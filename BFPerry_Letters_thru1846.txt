My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before the court meets.  I am afraid I shall not have time to do so after the adjournment of court.

	We arrived here yesterday evening about three oclock.  Very tired & very dusty.  Judge Earle, Col. Townes, Edward Earle & Mr. Young.  We made free use of your bread stuffs on the road & they were very much praised and also you yourself was praised by all for being as good & kind a wife in providing for her husband so bountifully.  Judge Earle thought the corn pound cake exceedingly good & could hardly believe that it was all cornmeal.  

	I have just been to the court to look at the docket & find a great many cases ahead of mine.  I am afraid of being detained here until the last of next week.

	I saw Judge Evans this morning who enquired after you.  Mr. Pendleton is here & enquired kindly after you.  Not many of the lawyers have yet got in.  Mr. Pendleton has got a good many subscribers to his Paper.  I have given him my Revolutionary Incidents & he seemed very thankful for them.  He asked if he might state by whom they were written.  They will therefore appear as written by me.

	I have bought�but the other books you wish cannot be had.  I have bought a new novel by [Alexander Dromgoole] Sims of Darlington a member of the Legislature, whom you may have heard me speak of as being a young man of talent & inclined to drink.   It is addressed to Judge Evans.  The style is good.  It is a tale of the Revolution called �Bevil Faulcon.�

	There was a great to do here the other night about four students who went off to Texas without the knowledge of their parents. They were from Camden.  One was a son of Col. McWillie whom you have heard me speak of.  There was a great crowd assembled to see them start.   The Professors in college came & tried to restrain them.  They went off in the stage & it will be very mortifying to their parents.  

	I went yesterday evening to look at the burnt part of the Town.  This is sad to behold.  I met there Dr. [William] Blanding.  He told me that Mrs. McCray had been brought home and that there was little or no hope of her sons recovery.  He is still in the Asylum.

	My pen is so bad & the ink has grease in it that it pains me to write.  I hope to hear from you Wednesday.  I hope you are getting on well with the house & Servants & that the children are all well.  The dear little creatures how I could kiss & squeeze them this morning.  There is no place like home & there are no persons whose company gives as much pleasure as the members of ones family.  You and the children are to me everything in this world & always with you I could be happy.  

	  My pen is so bad & cannot be mended.  I must conclude.  Give my love to your mother & sisters & believe me yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	I have time only to write you a few lines whilst I am in the same room with�Ware & Town[e]s & chair.
	We had quite a pleasant journey down here but have had a most angry and stormy time since our arrival here.  The Rail Road Convention broke up in confusion.  The Greenville & Laurens stock holders withdrew�their connection with the company.  The reason of this was that the road was located in Abbeville & Anderson instead of coming through Laurens.  The Greenville and Laurens subscribers are now released from the payment of their stock.  We have had much debate & some angry discussion none on my part though�some on the part of General [Waddy]Thompson & others.  We start in the morning to Columbia.   Col. Coleman, Poinsett�and their families are at Harts & go down tomorrow or next day.
	I took tea with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  He lives in great style.  I was at Chancellor [Job] Johnstons who lives handsomely & he invited me to tea, but I could not accept.
	The towns people are outraged with Col. [James Lawrence] Orr for his course on the rail road.  I made two good speeches on the convention & was highly complimented for them.
	Edward has been standing by me & says give his respects to you & tell his mother howdy & all the rest of the servants.  He says that he is very much pleased with his journey, & has behaved himself well.
	Choice is considerably hurt by this runaway scrape.  We have been very gracious.  
       In haste yours truly.  Tell Will I wish very much to have him with me, & I am sorry I did not bring him in the carriage.  Kiss the children. Tell Will to write me.  Your husband affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	I have just finished dressing & taken my seat to write you a few lines before breakfast as I do not expect to have time to write afterwards before the mail is closed.  I hope you wrote me yesterday & will add a Postscript today.  
	We reached Columbia yesterday evening, all safe, after a pleasant journey down, with the exception of an accident which had like to have been a very serious affair.  The second day after leaving Greenville we were disappointed in getting lodging at the house where we expected to stay & had to drive two miles further in the dark of the evening.  I had taken a seat with Judge Earle & his boy was driving my horse & buggy.  In passing through a drove of hogs which had been to water, in the lane & in front of the House where we were going to stay, one of the hogs ran under the heels of his horses & frightened them.  They ran up the hill & we thought their scare was over.   But whilst enquiring about lodgings one of the horses commenced kicking, plunging, wheeling round &c.  The other horses were all behind & became alarmed also & manifested a disposition to join in the frolic.  It was then quite dark.  I sprung out of the Judges buggy & ran to my horses lead & made Edward go to hold the Judges horses, one of which was kicking at a most terrible rate all the time.  Col. Cox unloosed his horses from the carriage just in time.  In order to get my horse out of the way I drove through a gate & I had scarcely got through when the Judges buggy & horse & two or three men who were trying to hold his horse made a dash at the place I had just left.  Had I not been out of the way we should have had a general crash.  After some time a half dozen men succeeded in getting the horses extricated from the carriages.  But the frightened horses was not satisfied but continued to kick, came very near giving Sam Earle a blow which might have made another widower in Mrs. Harrisons family.  Col. Cox received a severe kick on his hand.  Judge Earle came out safe.  The carriage considerably injured, the horse badly crippled.  I thought at one time we should have a �general runaway.�  The next morning the Judge got a new horse & mended his carriage.  We all came on safely.

	We had some fine dinners on the road out of the provision we carried with us.  Judge Early provided the corn pound cake & ginger bread is so much more pleasant eating on the road side than stopping at a House for dinner.  

	I hope you & the children are all doing well.  I talked to Judge Earle so much about the pleasure we derive from a wife & children that we believe he seriously returned�  He regretted his situation very much & said he had nothing but a dreary & gloomy�full of suffering & misery.

	I saw Col. Martin last night.  He says they are all well.  I have not yet seen Mr. Hayne.  There are ten or fifteen candidates for secretary of State.  I have never seen so much electioneering.  I feel happy that I am not a member.  The old members are all expressing to me great regret that I am not a member.

	I have a room with Mr. Burt, but he has not yet arrived.  In it there is [a] fine chest of drawers and locked.  I supposed they were empty & took out my bunch of keys to try to unlock them.  I found a key & unlocked them, when behold, instead of being empty, contained a lady�s wardrobe!  All the paraphernalia of a female�s dress with a great many et ceteras.  I was reminded of the story of� I had got into forbidden ground & locked up the drawers & put the keys back in my pocket.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was disappointed in writing to you yesterday as I intended doing.  I was all day waiting in Court for one of my cases to be taken up and it was not till this morning.  I have just finished the argument in that case & have left the court for the purpose of writing to you.  I had the good fortune to try one of my cases last Tuesday.  So I have now two disposed of & six more to argue besides two in the Legislature.  I shall be detained here eight or ten days yet.

	In consequence of my rooming with Mr. [Armistead] Burt I cannot write you as conveniently ass I Could if I were alone.  We have two sets of visitors to entertain in consequence of our being together.

	Your letters were recd this morning & I�speak of the pleasure they gave me.  I read them both whilst with Sam Earle & had the pleasure of telling him that Mrs. Earle was well &c.  Poor old George looks very natural & is cooking for Dr. Roache.  I do not know what to say about your mother buying him.  She must determine the matter for herself.  You know my plan is not to purchase an old negro.  Your mother can determine for herself & write me.

	I have been tempted to purchase for Susan one of the sweetest little gold pencil cases you�  The price was seven dollars but I got it for four & one half so I have paid $4.50 & will present the gold pencil case to her.  It is substantial  & will last longer & look prettier than a silver one.  It was so beautiful I could not resist the temptation of buying it & making it a present.  If you wish I will get you one like it.  It has a ring�to a chain & is beautifully carried.

	I have seen a horse & think of buying it for Will.  The price is $14.00 & I cannot get it for less but the difficulty will be in getting it home.  I do not think of going to Augusta now, as I can arrange the business I have there, by sending the money by ben Yancey who is now here & is in Augusta every day when at home.  By the by Ben Yancey says he has the prettiest specimen of female beauty he ever saw.  I doubted that I had not a prettier in little Anna.  Yancey made a very good friend the other day on the Court of Appeals.

	I am the more & more pleased not being in the Legislature & would not take�not then, now, for several hundred dollars.  I have seen so much intriguiry & electioneering this session that I am utterly disgusted with politics.  Col. [William Campbell] Preston has resigned & Mr. Calhoun intends doing so.  The Legislature will have two Senators to elect.  Great exertions are making by the Rhetts to have Barnwell Rhett elected. The friends of Judge Huger will perhaps put him in nomination.  Governor [John Peter] Richardson, Judge [John Belton] O�Neal[l], Col. McWillie are all spoken of.  [George] McDuffie will be the successor of Col. Preston.  I saw Col. Preston this morning.  He looks remarkably well &  has returned to the Bar.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler came to see me the other night & enquired after all of you very kindly.  In giving the Judges my briefs I gave him one that you had endorsed last Fall.  He said he would keep it on account of the writing.  Albert Rhett came twice to see Burt & myself & enquired after all of you very kindly.

	Mr. Hayne tells me he has a box for your mother but has not yet sent it to me nor have I sent the box of Susans to him.  Mrs. Taylors brother is much better.  He has Mrs. Keith with him.  Her health is bad.  He has been elected & will return to Town.  He enquired after all of you, how many children &c.  He looks badly.  I went down to the State House this morning to meet the Bible convention but it did not meet.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother &c.  B.F. Perry

I am glad to hear that the children and Servants are all behaving well & am very sorry to hear of Annas bad health again.  [sentence interlined illegible].  I saw Col. Keith who came to my room electioneering.

 My dear Liz

	Your letter was handed me last night & Mr. Earle came up to know what was the news from home & to my surprise had not heard from his better half since he had left Greenville.  I was much pleased to hear you were all doing pretty well.  I begin to feel anxious to see you & the children.  How I should like to take them in my arms & hear their prattle.  I will endeavour to be at home the first of next week.

	I have just returned from the college commencement to write you.  I saw there a great display of beauty & fashion but did not stay long to admire it, not more than three minutes.

	This morning I start with your letter in my�to shop.  I found all the articles you desired & have made the purchase.  Tell �Will� I have bought him a most beautiful pony with a saddle & bridle long tale and main, high head�price $16.00.  Co. [Henry Gaines] Johnson�s waggon will be down here next week and will carry the horse up for nothing.  It is really a beautiful hobby horse & Will can ride on it most gloriously.

	Mr. Hayne sent me two bundles for your mother, & I gave him the boxes which I brought down�or rather I sent it to Mrs. Taylor.  I have not yet seen Taylor or any of his family.
	
       I hope you�the gold pencil & letter sent you by Col. Town[e]s.  I would write to you oftener than I do but really I have no chance.  Our room is constantly filled with company & I am now writing whilst Burt and Col. [Frederick William] Davie & Reed are talking about all sorts of things, & I have to join the conversation every now & then.

	There is great excitement in regard to the election of United States Senator.  Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger & Barnwell Rhett & Col. Davie are candidates.

	I saw Mr. Pendleton this morning.  He gave the magnolia & a beautiful print of Charleston.  You will however see the Print as it will come with the magnolia.

       I am very much complimented by all who see me on account of my good looks.  I am told that I have improved astonishingly in personal appearance.  They all say that I have flattened & look younger &c.  Laurens district will be added to Greenville & Pendleton as a congressional district & we young� that I must be the candidate, but fortune will not permit me.
       
       I have gained one of my cases in court & one in the Legislature�the road case in court, Spriggs & Bartons case is in the Legislature but they have not yet decided on it.
       
       I have read a letter from Mr. W. Gilmore Simms.  He says that it is well that he was tempered down to a Benedict before he met with Ann or he should have lost his�and says he will be very happy if his (prescription) of cold water can be of service to her.
       
       I must conclude my dear wife as I am writing without thinking.  There is so much talk going on.  Miss the children, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I sent you this morning by Col. Barton & Mr. Spriggs one box, one trunk & one bundle.  They will be delivered to you Saturday some time in the day by Col. Barton.  Be kind & polite to him in the day for he is a good friend of mine & has very kindly offered to carry any thing I desired to send you.

	The trunk will contain a bundle from Mr. Hayne Wells silver cup which he carried down with one Sears Bible and Pictorial illustrations which he sends as a present to my dear wife which you will value both for the gift & giver.  The trunk also contains three vol[ume]s of Harpers family library also Rowlands�oil & two other boxes or vials.  The contents of the Box are unknown to me.  Mr. B. Carrol told me last night that Miss Seabrook had sent it by him & sent for it this morning to send by Col. Barton.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  I am beginning to be very restless & anxious to see you & the children again.  I trust however you are all doing well.

	I argued Mr. McBee�s case yesterday & was more than two hours reading my argument in the Court of Errors.  After I had concluded Mr. Burt got up to speak on the same side & Chancellor Job Johnston said he did not wish to hear any further argument on my side & went out of court.  Judge Richardson did the same.  This was quite a compliment to my speech.  Mr. Burt addressed the other judges for about an hour & made a capital argument.  You may tell Mr. McBee that I have very little doubt of our success.  Judges�& Richardson are with us.  So is Chancellor Job Johns[t]on and Judge Butler (I think) has been brought over by Burt�s & my argument.  He gave me a favourable intimation this morning.  Judg[e]s Earle & Wardlaw would not try the case.  Judge Harper is absent.  [Benjamin Faneuil] Dunkin & David Johnson will decide the case.  Judge [John Belton] O�Neall is against me.

	I have just left the Court House after examining the law students.  My student Reid was admitted & all the others except one.  

	The election of Senator is exciting great interest.  I think Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger will be elected.  Barnwell Rhett and Col. [Francis Wilkinson] Pickens and Col. Davie are also candidates.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler is not, & is provoked at the notice of him in the Mercury.

	I have not yet bought the Bells nor the gold pencil case for you.  You must write me on that subject.

	I was told by Mr. Middleton last night that it was understood that Col. [Edward] Frost & myself were candidates for the next vacancy on the Bench.  I assured him it was a mistake so far as I was concerned. Tell Will his horse will reach home in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be at home sooner myself than that.  This matter of Spriggs & Col. Barton will give me some trouble in the Legislature.  Col. Barton has offered me a fee of $500 if I can get the lease of the State Road for him for five years & $1000 if I can get it for ten years.  I will try.

	In haste yours truly.  Kiss the dear little children for me & give my love to your mother & sisters, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am surprised that in none of your letters you have mentioned the death of my Father.  It is possible that you have not heard of it?  Mr. Duncan informed me that Mr. Foster had just returned from Tugaloo & brought the intelligence.  It was a great shock to me, and although he was very old, yet it grieves me much to think I had not seen him before his death.    When I last saw him in the summer little did I think it was to be a final parting between us in this world.  You know that it was our intention to have visited them last Fall.  How sorry I am that we did not do so.  It would have been a great consolation to me now if we had done so and had shown him our two little children, one of whom he never saw.  My father possessed many sterling virtues which I would not have had him to exchange for all the hollow heartedness & proof of wealth & fame.  He possessed a keen heart & a stern unbending integrity of character which would do honor to any one.  There never lived a more honest or a more just man.  I am sure he never did an intentional injury to any one & I believe he did all the good to his fellow men which lay in his power.  I am sure that there is nothing in his long life to exclude him from happiness in another world.

	I am anxious to be at home once more & see you & the dear little children.  I shall finish the last of my business on Monday in the Legislature.  I have already disposed of my business in Court.  And if God spares me I will leave here on Tuesday morning.  You may expect me at home on Thursday evening unless the weather should be as bad as to prevent my travelling.  It is now raining and I am afraid it may not slow up before Tuesday.

	Tomorrow morning I shall hear all about my cases & I will write again.

       Sunday night.  I have just read your letter and still you have heard nothing of my Fathers death.  I think uncle Foster might have sent you word.  It is strange.  Mr. Duncan spoke of it as coming from aunt Foster.
       I shall be at home Thursday evening, but this letter will reach you one day sooner.  My cases are not yet all decided.  The case of�is not yet decided.  I saw Judge Earle this morning who told me all of
       I went to see Judge Huger last night.  He looks very well.  Governor [James Henry] Hammond was inaugurated on Saturday.   There was a great crowd at the inauguration.    Mr. Burt has gone home, & I am now alone in my room.  I hope Judge Huger will be elected Senator.  I have purchased four Bells, combs, pullies, wire &c &c for hanging them & they cost $5.87 ?.  I have got the spoon marked for Anna [last line and signature cut off]

 Laurens C. House, 11th October 1843

My dear Liz

	It is now late in the night, and I hope that you, Miss Pamela, and the children dear little creatures all of you, are sweetly reposing in the arms of that leaden eyed deity of whose embraces no�or lover is ever jealous, no matter how much they may be sought for and enjoyed.  I have just finished looking over�forthcoming volume of Reports, which contain several of my able & learned arguments in the Court of Appeals.  This you may be certain, afforded me no little gratification, and I hope you will not feel your noble self slighted when I tell you for the time being you & the children were not out of my thoughts.  But this letter is an evidence of the quickness with which you are recalled.

	The fore front of the evening I spent in conversation with Judge [Andrew P.] Butler.  He possesses his usual flower of spirit, with humour.  I love him much, although you know he shows no great�for some of his family, in Greenville.  The Judge is a noble hearted fellow, liberal, generous, high minded & honorable.

	We have very few lawyers in attendance on this court.  Burt is at Edgefield, Henry has gone to Union, General Caldwell to Sumter.  General Whitner heard of the extreme illness of his brother in law Dr. Harrison last night & returned post haste to Anderson, leaving me the solicitor�s duties to perform, which will consist principally in prosecuting some pugilists for an affray & assault & battery.  This may detour me here longer than I intended to stay.  It is probable that I may not be at home till Friday night.

	Tell Miss Pamela that I have not had the pleasure of meeting either her Father or Brother at this court and I am afraid it will be out of my power to visit Rosemont during my stay here, those which nothing would give me greater pleasure. The letter which she entrusted to my care, was deposited in the Post office early Monday morning & I have no doubt it has gone safely.

	I know you are fond of news, like all of mothers�daughters, I therefore give you an item which I have just heard from Judge Butler.  It is rumored that Col. [Francis W.] Pickens is going to be married to Col. John C. Calhouns daughter, about sixteen or seventeen years old! Dr. [Maximilian] Laborde too is about taking to himself another wife, Miss Carroll, his sister in law!  How lucky these old widowers are [&] how easily they fool the young girls!.  And how complimentary to the memory of their departed wives.  They have found the married state one of so much happiness that they cannot exist out of it!

	If you see Mrs. Coleman tell her that the Cols law suit is not yet tried.  I promised to write him by this mail if it had been tried.  Both Young and myself are in good spirits in regard to the case.  It is one of considerable importance to Col. Coleman.

	I hope you & Miss Pamela are keeping house finely with the help of the children and servants to keep you straight.  When did you have your company?  You have had fine evenings for company.  The weather is delightful, & I hope you have had no further visitations from the toothache�and that Miss Pamela has entirely forgotten that there is any such thing as a nervous�at all, or such medicine as calomel.  And I hope the children, little Will, Anna & Frank have all forgotten how to cry!!  In all of these�I am sure you will all join me most heartily (page torn) had forgotten or it should have been (page torn).

	I am not so well myself as I was when I left home.  This I say in truth & in compliment to you & the dinner which your kindness provided me with on the road.  I ate too much.  I stopped on the road & had quite a social meal with my horse!  He is indeed a civilized brute and possesses a much more refined taste than most Kentuckians.  He ate several of the rolls, a large portion of the fruit cake, & smacked his mouth as if it was a most delicious morsel, much better than the food every day given him by his worthless groom.  I offered him a piece of ham, but he turned up his nose at the gross & vulgar food & seemed to say that it should not touch his lips after your pound cake.  I ate too much & have been starving myself ever since, which suits the Tavern here, remarkably well.  There ought to be professorships of cooking.

	But I must now go to bed.  I can imagine to myself the great stillness at home tonight, and your situation tomorrow evening when you receive this letter.  Will & An[n]a will have gone to bed�perhaps not yet asleep�talking to each other in the dark�Frank taking his supper�you and Miss Pamela seated around the lamps engaged in work.  Is this a true picture?  Yours good night , and good bless you, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight as I expect Col. Town[e]s will leave for Greenville in the morning.

	It is altogether uncertain when I shall be at home.  We are now in the midst of a case of perjury, which excites considerable interest, & will take the greater part of tomorrow.  I think our defendant will be acquitted.  His name is Clardy. You heard of the case some three or four weeks since.

	  I have been employed as assistant consul in a case of slander.  Our client is a very pretty young woman, who sues a neighbor woman for imputing to her a wont of chastity.  We expect to recover heavy damages.  The appearance of the young woman will be much in her favour, I hope, with the Judge & Jury.  Almost everyone would be more disposed to punish another quicker for slandering a pretty woman than an ugly one.

	You need not be surprised if I bring home with me another servant�a man about 18 or 20  years old�smart & good looking�black colour about the colour of Lynda.   He is uncommonly smart�raised in N. Carolina�sold for debt & the only negro owned by his master�his name is �Jim.�  What think you of the name?  But you we may distinguish by calling one �James��price $700 in Rail Road stocks.  However the bargain is not yet completed.

	I have been very uneasy about you & the children ever since I left home.    I hope however that the grippe has passed you by.  Everybody here is unwell with it�never heard of an influenza so general in my life.    I wish you would write me by the return mail how you all are.  I will get your letter Thursday morning.  You can write a few lines after receiving this letter before the mail closes.

	Judge Butler showed me a letter he read on Monday from his little daughter.  She is quite well & writes very well for a child of 9 years old.  The letter was only five lines.

	I saw Mrs. Dr. Haynsworth & her son pass through here in the stage this morning on their way to Greenville to Mrs. Elias�Earle.  What a melancholy visit they must pay.   Poor Elias�sorry for him but ten times more for his wife. 

	Judge Earle has resigned & requested Judge Butler to inform me of it.  He asked Judge Butler who he thought should take the place.  Judge B. told me, he thought I would make a very good Judge.  I replied that I thanked him, but should not be a candidate.  I feel much flattered to be thought so well of by both Judge O�Neall & Judge Butler & I have no doubt Judge Earle would have agreed with them.

	I shall endeavour to be at home on Friday night if not sooner.  If Col. Cox should send to take away Exception to winter her, tell the boy I have changed my mind & will keep her at home.  I am afraid some accident may Happen to her if sent off.

	In great haste as I have to prepare tonight for my speech tomorrow.  Kiss the little children for me.  I do hope they have no more of the grippe.  I am pretty well myself.  I hope the servants are all doing well�especially Lynda.  Tell her I have seen �aunt Emily� & that she made enquiry after her.

	Good night my dear Liz.  God bless you�you & the children.  [Signature cut off].

My dear Liz

	The mail closes tomorrow morning, & in the morning I shall be busy, so I must write you tonight.  It is better to hear from me a day too soon than not at all.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  If I do not I shall be sadly disappointed.

	I have made a considerable purchase of Books, Law & miscellaneous�and Mr. Carter the Book Seller is so much pleased with my custom that he has made you a handsome present.  I do not know what it is.  But it is a large book of pictures.  He has wrapped it up & put it with my other books.  I thought it would not be decent to ask him what it was.  It looks like it might be Lady Bles[s]ingtons book of Beauties. 

	I have been trying to get a hat for Willie, but they are rather small.  I think you must have given me too large a measure.  I see some beautiful Leghorn hats about one inch smaller than your measure.  Write me whether they will do.  It seems to me that they will.  

	I saw Col. Herndon�s wife the other day�met her & him in the street.  She is good looking, genteel & rather handsome�and possesses an intelligent face.  Her appearance was simple & modest & I was pleased with the glance I had of her and must go & call on her before I leave.

	I saw General [Waddy] Thompson this morning in Court.  He goes on Thursday next.  I have seen nothing of Mrs. Thompson since I wrote you.  Nor have I seen Taylor or wife & family.

	I do not know when I shall return.  It is very doubtful whether any of my cases will be reached at all this court.  I may stay till the last of next week & all for nothing.

	I have drawn the Bill of Equity for Mr. Watson against�Mayrant but Chancellor Harper is sick & they are not likely to have any court at Sumter.  It is very doubtful whether Chancellor Harper will ever be able to take the circuit again.  He is now at the Glenn Springs & has not been able to come here.    Judge O�Neall is also unwell, but is in court.  Judge Evans looks very well�enquired particularly after you.  Judge Frost looks well.  I told him I thought his Judicial honours agreed with him.  Judge Butler looks a little rough.

	We have now a fine rain falling and it has been pleasant every day since I have been here.  Mr. Young has gone to Charleston & says he may not be able to pay me.  If he does not [page torn] be short of friends.

	I have bought one ream of Law paper�also a very neat little storing or dressing case with all the appurtenances.

	What presents shall I bring you & the children?  A doll for Anna�hat for Will�a rattle for Frank�and Mr. Carters Book of pictures for you?  Will that do?

	I want to see you & the children very much.  How often I think of you in the midst of business and I have been very busy since I have been here!  Mr�.has sent me some cases to attend to in the Court of Appeals & says that I shall be well paid if successful.  Leitner has sent me some for Town[e]s.  And Young has left some of his for me.  So I am a sort of general agent.  Good night, your truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I only have time to write you a word or two.  I have been so much engaged that I could not write you last mail & it is the same thing now.

	You last letter gave me great pleasure, but your last one was sad enough in every way.  Poor Judge Earle.  We had a meeting of the Bar this morning at the request of the Judges.  Col. Preston was called to the chair & I offered some Resolutions which you will see in the papers.  I made a biographical speech to the Court of Appeals on Judge Earle.  Judge Johnson replied.  The speeches will all be published.

	I thought you crazy about Texas from your letter.  [remainder of paragraph interlined, illegible].

	It is possible I may start home in the morning.  If so I will be with you my dear wife  & my dear little children on Thursday night.  God knows it will be a source of great happiness & pleasure.

	I have much to write you but no time to do it in as the mail is closing.

	Kiss the children for me & tell them I have a great many presents for them.  Yours truly & lovingly, B.F, Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d several statements today which satisfy me that I have been elected by a handsome majority.  I hope your fears are now put to rest.

	I shall be at home Friday morning.  And I propose to give our wine party Saturday night.  Can you make the necessary preparations?  Send & get two or three large hams & two large turkeys & some fowls & have some bread baked in preparation.  You may also have pound cakes prepared &c.  The supper may be set in the Piazza�the wine in the dining room.  You will have to borrow wine glasses, tumblers & bottles.  If you can make all these arrangements do so.

	I wish every voter in the village invited.  This can be done perhaps after I return.  The invitations may be extended informally through friends.  Saturday will be the day of the agricultural Fair & I can invite persons from the country.  You must propose to entertain at least one hundred persons.

	If you see people you can request Col. Hoke, Major Jones, Mr. Lister, Mr. Wells and any others to invite the village as they may send them word�invite every voter in the village and others from the country.  Sam Earle, Elias Earle, Waddle, Poinsett, Dr. Butler &c, Brooks, Williams &c.

	We can make quite a display of cake & wine on the tables in the dining room and have the cold meat & bread & coffee out in the piazza.  

	But my dear wife if you think it will give you too much trouble I will have the wine alone & nothing else.
  
	I think the party had better be on Saturday evening.

	I am truly sorry that Col. Town[e]s is not elected.

	In the district Simpson will beat 500 votes. Col. Fair is elected.

	Yours truly�good night & kiss the children, B.F. Perry

 I am much disappointed in not getting off this evening for home.  Indeed I am afraid I shall not be able to leave before Saturday morning if then.  There is an important [case] which detains me.  I hope to try it tomorrow.  It is one in which I have been employed to assist Mr. Young.

	How comes on our wine party?  If you have not commenced it I shall be glad.  If you have made preparation for it you must go on.  How all the people invited.  Get Lester, Hoke, Jones, Townes, Wells & others to extend the invitation.  Let all the country people be invited, who are in the village on Saturday, at the agricultural meeting.

	I will give another party Tuesday night of court week.

	You must get three or four dozen bottles & fill them with wine, Sherry,  Maderia, & Sicily Modecia.  You are a great manager & can do all these things without me.  But still I would like to be at home to help you.  

	Why did you not write to me?  I read a letter from Hoke & Lester giving me a fell return of the election.  My majority was very gratifying.  But exactly as I had calculated.  You must now admit that I have a good judgement in elections.  I hope you will never worry me again on that subject.

	I am very anxious to get home & meet you & the children.  It appears a long time since I left home.  And an important event has happened.	I read a letter for you from Miss Pamela Cunningham & a note to me, with a box containing a cap.  I will send you the letter by mail. 

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.   Yours &c, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I must write you whenever I can & therefore will have to write the day before the Stage leaves.  I have a few moments of leisure this morning before breakfast & will avail myself of the opportunity of writing to my wife & children.

	Yesterday morning I saw Col. Martin, who said that Mr. Haynes friends requested him to ask me to write & inform you of the particulars of his death.  I told him I had already done so.  I understand Mr. Haynes was in perfect health when the paralysis came on.  He attempted to raise up a window & his right side became palsied & he fell to the floor.  I hope however your mother has received letters from some of the family.

	I made my debut in the Senate yesterday in a short speech on the contested election between [Andrew] Hibben & [James Smith] Rhett which was well received.  Have you seen the puff [of me] in the Charleston Courier?  It was written by Gilmore Simms.  Judge Frost told me yesterday he was really gratified to see me in the Senate & that my election gave great grattification to my friends in the Courier & that they were many.  Almost everyone I have met has said to me that they were pleased to see me back in the Legislature.  Col. Pickens spoke to me as I went up to qualify & said he was glad to meet me�that we had both got to be old men at the same time�alluding to our coming into the Senate together.

	Judge [Josiah James] Evans enquired very kindly after you and so did Judge Butler & O�Neall.  I gave the letter to Mr. Seabrook & also to Mr. Roper, both of whom enquire very kindly after you all & Anne in particular).  I had a long talk last night with Henry L. Pinckney who also enquired after you all.  He is very much like Frances Hayne.  I could but think of Frances all the time I was talking to him.  His nose, lips, expression of the eyes &c.  I hope she has more principle than her uncle.  But I found Pinckney a very pleasant man.  His views & feelings as expressed on every subject were correct & honorable.  He agreed with me very well in politics & I was rather disposed to like him.  I expect he is a good deal like Walker morally�nothing bad about him but without firmness & not a close observer of truth.

	I have taken a seat in the Senate with Mr. [Henry Clinton] Young.  He left his seat & came over to where we could both sit together.  I like Mr. Young very much.    He is a noble fellow & keen hearted man.  I love purity & sincerity & will make those only my friends who possess those qualities.  

	The breakfast hall is now ringing & I must close this very hasty scroll.  I have bought the finest trunk you ever saw�a large travelling trunk ($22.00).  It will last us our lives & be a trunk for our children.  I have also had to buy a�, pair of gloves and shall have to purchase handkerchiefs.   I left one at home.
 
	You have no idea how much I wish to see you & the children & how glad I shall be to receive a letter from you.  God bless you, B.F.P.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight, as I shall not have an opportunity of doing so, tomorrow before the mail closes.  I sat down to write you a letter two hours since, but persons have been calling at my room ever since, and I now will have time only to write you a very hurried epistle.

	You have no doubt heard of the death of Mr�.Hayne.  I was told of his paralysis b Col. Bee who came down with us in the stage from Greenville.  Mr. Henry L. Pinckney informed me tonight that he was dead.  He died yesterday evening.  Mr. Pinckney said it was fortunate that he died as his mind was entirely gone.  His is a sad calamity to his family & to your mother.  It will not become necessary for someone else to take charge of your mothers Bonds &c.  Col., Isaac Hayne was in Charleston in time to see his father die.  You no doubt heard all the particulars.

	Mr. Pinckney informed me that Miss Hayne was married but he said nothing further about the match.

	We had a very pleasant ride down here in the stage�[Thomas Edwin] Ware, [Tandy] Walker, [Perry Emory] Duncan, Col. Bee, Mr. Young, Moore & Lester.  We ate up all of your cakes &c and your praises were highly sounded as a good wife in providing for us &c.  The stage broke down with us about ten miles from Columbia.  But we mended it with poles & came on.  In jumping out of the stage I hurt Col. [Barnard] Bee in the breast�he was in great pain for a while but is better.  The Col. apologized for not calling to see us &c.  I found him quite a pleasant gentleman.  We talked a great deal & about a great variety of things and amongst other things his relationship to you &c.

	I have got a fine room at Maybins & Ware, Duncan & Walker have another one all together.  The house is greatly improved & I am to keep the room as cozy as I wish it.  

	It is thought that [William] Aiken will be Governor.

  	I have met a great many of my old friends.  They all seem glad that I am in the Senate.  Mr. [Simeon]Pope & Col. Fair have said that the gentlemen will consider me as in some manner their representative no matter in what district they reside.

	I hope to hear from you Wednesday night & hear you are all well.  I hope the children are well & that you have had no more scares [page torn] too easily frightened.  Kiss the children for me.  What about the [page torn] light procession?

	Mr. Samuel Earle has just been in my room.  He thinks the whole affair foolish.  His election I think pretty certain.  

	I must now bid you good night.  God bless you.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville 

Friday morning, [29 November 1844]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	As I suppose you would like to hear from me although I have nothing to write I will not omit sending a letter by the mail which closes this evening.

	I have written to [O.H.] Wells pretty much all that we have done in the Senate which you will see in the Mountaineer.  But we do comparatively nothing in the Senate to what is done in the other House.  Yesterday we had a short discussion on Col. Pickens Resolutions.    He came to me & asked me if I concurred with him & on being told that I did, he requested me to reply to Col. [Franklin] Moses, which I did in a short speech.  After the Senate adjourned he requested me to ride with him in his carriage & seemed very cordial *& kind.  He & the Rhett party have split & have no kind feelings for each other.

	I rece[ive]d your letter by Wednesdays mail and was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I wish to be present & see you all arranged in the dining room whilst you were writing.  Your description called every thing to my mind very forcibly.    There is no place like home after all, especially when we have a wife & children at that home�even if the wife does worry her husband occasionally & the children fret him & the servants provoke him.

	By the by how do you come on with the servants.  I hope they all behave themselves & give you no trouble.  The children you can manage.  How are the horses, cows & hogs?  I hope Jim will take care of every thing.  

	I think Mr. Aiken will be elected Governor & I shall vote for him.  I gave the letters to Mr. Seabrook & Roper.  Mr. Roper gave me one for your mother.

	Mr. Sam Earle is not so good at electioneering as some of his competitors & if he does not win he will be hard pushed.  The election between Elford & Butler is very uncertain.  They are beginning to be a little excited with each other.  Ware & Duncan are very well pleased with their situation & I suppose Walker is too, for he keeps pretty generally two thirds drunk.  I was ashamed for him the other night on committee.  But all of the [page torn]  is between us.  You must not [page torn] about it.

	I never saw so many candidates before in my life.  There are at least fifty to carry the votes to Washington.  Barclay�s father came & spoke to me the other day & enquired after his son.   He looks something like his son & has the scotch accent.

	I have gained an important case old Mr. McElroy�s case in Equity.  You remember he once took you for my daughter.  I have succeeded entirely for the old man & am proud of it.    Charles Sullivan was on the other side.  

	You see I have made up a letter in some sort of a way so God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F.P.

My dear Wife
	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening.  It gave me more pleasure than any I had rece[ive]d from you.  In it you spoke like yourself & seems to have your reason restored.  But�in several of your last letters you seem to be crazy on the subject of going of going to Miss Cunningham as if a pressing invitation from Pamela was a matter of so much consequence when you might know she expected to return your visit next summer.  Nor is a journey down there at that season of the year any very trifling affair.

	Still I think a little recreation would be of service to you & the children.  I have no doubt you would enjoy a short visit there very much.   And I desire you to go, provided the weather is good.  But do not think of travelling in bad weather.  Select your time, & start some day when the weather is settled.  You can go Thursday or Friday if you see proper. Jim can return home & bring down my Buggy.  I shall be at Laurens Court House Sunday 22nd in the morning. It may be that the Legislature will adjourn before that day, or rather so that I may be there sooner.  But this is uncertain.  We will fix on that day.  You can make Jim return by that time.  I do not wish to stay longer than three days at Cunninghams, nor will I.  If you go down there it will be out of the question for you to leave Cunningham�s  before I come for you.  They will not let you.

	The election for governor is over.  Aiken is elected after five lotterys.  He gave a treat this evening after his election�but it was not equal to yours.

       I have been writing to a great many of my constituents, some of whom have been here�Major Berry, Col. Brockman, Major Goodlett, Blassingham, Whitten, Col. Boston, Dr. Crook, Dr. Irvine, Alleier Barrett & others.  I have sent documents to a good many--so you see I am following your advice.
       
       	I met Governor Richardson the other day who said to me he did not know I was old enough to be in the Senate.  Every one compliments me on my appearance�so I think I must be getting younger. 
       
       Mr. Wells has not sent one of my letters or if he did he has bot published it.  The letter containing the second & third days proceedings of the Legislature in which I mentioned Col. Maybins Hotel &c.
       
       I was disappointed in sending my trunk by last stage as it was full & Moore did not go up in the stage.  I hope you have seen Mr. & Mrs. Mauldin & Mr. & Mrs. [page torn] them whilst here.
       
       I am glad to hear Will becomes better than hew did.  I have not yet purchased the presents.
       
       Whenever I look sat Col. McWillie I am reminded of Frank.  They look very much alike. 
       
       Col. Ware, Duncan & Walker are all well.  I have no further news
        	     
	God bless you & the children.  Good night, B.F. Perry

My dear Wife

	I have just seen Mr. Burt who informs me that he will go up in the Greenville stage tomorrow morning.  This gives me an opportunity of writing you again.  I put a letter in the Post office for you this morning.  Since that time the Legislature have determined to adjourn Wednesday the 18th so I shall be at Laurens C. House Friday morning the 20th.  If you go down to Cunninghams you must make arrangements to send for me on that day to Laurens C. House.

	I do not believe that we shall be able to take Christmas dinner with Mr. Cunningham.  It will be too long for me to stay.  We can spend a day or two there after I arrive & then come on home.  This will do just as well as to spend Christmas with them.  

	You had better start down the day after you receive this letter�If the weather be good.  But if the weather is bad do not go at all.  

	I understand you have scarlet fever in the village.  Mrs. Walker writes to her dearly beloved that their son has had it very badly.  Be careful about the children catching it.    And take good care of them on the road.

	I have been in court today & have gained Mr. Fields case�also on another from Pickens in which two men were convicted of hog stealing.  My other cases not yet decided.  This case of Mr. Fields will be worth $100 more to me by a mistrial.

	I now have to go down to thew State House to attend the committee on Scriviner & Books of which I am chairman so I must close this letter.

	In regard to your visit do as you please.  Go when you please but do not travel in bad weather.

	Your husband with love & affection, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter written Sunday night.  Major Butler goes up to Greenville in the morning & has promised to carry this letter for me.  I have therefore deferred writing to you till I could answer your letter by tonights mail.

	I am glad to hear you & the children are all well and the servants and animals are all getting on well.  You have before this time received my permission to go to Mr. Cunninghams�so you are well pleased on that subject.  But really I think you are going to make them a visitation with your children, servants & horses.  You had better send Jim with one of the horses back & when he returns for you he can drive my horse and buggy and lead the horse behind the buggy. 
 
	I have no doubt you will be well pleased at the election of Butler over Elford.  They are both deserving the office.

	I will send Susans watch by Butler.  He did not let me know he was going until this evening & I have had no opportunity of sending anything.  The box I brought down I sent to Charleston by Elford who promised to carry it to Mrs. Hayne.  Elford told me that he & Spark are second cousins.

	I saw Col. [Lawrence M.] Keitt this evening & he enquired very kindly after �cousin Susan & her daughter.�  Mrs. Keitt is with him.  They are on a visit to her niece.  Chancellor Harper enquired very kindly after Anne the other day.

	I can not give you any more particulars than I have as to the death of Mr. Hayne.  Col. Taylor has gone down.  I suppose his family were all present.  His death is indeed a loss to his family & also to your mother.  It would be proper for your mother about her Bonds &c in his hands.  If it is necessary I will go to Charleston for her.  She must write to me.  

	Tomorrow I am to make my speech on giving the election of Electors to the people.  I have already spoken several times & I think I did pretty well.  I feel some anxiety about my speech tomorrow.  There is very little to do in the Senate�not one half that is done in the House nor is there one half of the speaking.

	A resolution was introduced today for the Legislature to adjourn on Monday the 16th.  This will interfere with our spending Christmas at Cunninghams.  But I do not think the resolution will be agreed [on].  I have no idea that they will adjourn before Friday the 20th.

	I will send you �the gift for 1845� by Butler containing Simms Greenville Story.  Moore & Lester will return to Greenville next Sunday night and I will send my old trunk up by them with some books in it &c.  They are to be examined tomorrow.

	You need not talk to me about home.  There is no place in the world so sweet as home with your wife & children.  And how I should like to be there tonight.  God bless you�kiss the children.  I have a sore throat & cold.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Wife

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter, & have not time to write much in reply.

	All day I have been engaged in the Court of Appeals.  All of my cases are soon disposed of except one which I attend to for Mr. Dean.  The result of them I know not.

	Yesterday was a day of great excitement in both Houses.    The members seemed to be crazy on the subject of the Massachusetts mission.  The House of Representatives passed a Resolution expelling Mr. [Samuel] Hoar, with but one dissenting vote (Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger).  To the Senate your husband was thew only man who opposed them.  I stood alone against the whole Senate.  And I made a most exciting speech.  They were a great many members who thought with me, but had not the boldness to act with me.  The vote has given Col. Memminger & myself quite a distinction, a minority of one.
  
	Mr. & Mrs. Roberts & Mr. & Mrs. Mauldin are here & will leave in the morning.  I will send this letter by them.  I suppose you will be gone to Mr. Cunninghams before I write to you again.  I hope you will take good care of yourself, the children & make Jim take care if the Horses.  When he carries you down he can return to Greenville & wait till the day before Christmas�then go back to Cunninghams & drive down my�buggy.  

	If I can I will get Moore to take my old trunk up to Greenville with him.  But there is such a crowd going up that I am afraid he can not do so.

	Frank Burt has beaten Sam Earle for Treasurer.  Col. Ancrum has been elected Super Intendent of Public Works.  The Governors election comes on tomorrow.  Aikens chance is the best.

	You must write me as soon as you arrive at Mr. Cunninghams.  I shall feel very anxious to hear from you. 

	I have just had a visit from old George.  He is cooking at Clarks Hotel.  John�s son Thomas also paid me a visit yesterday & enquired after his father.  Thomas appears to be a very well disposed boy & looks pretty well.  You can tell John.

	I have written you so often that I have not much to write about.  But will have more to tell you when we meet which will be the Sunday before Christmas at the farthest.

	God bless you & the dear little children.  Kiss them all for me.  How I should like to see them.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry 
Greenville

Sunday morning, [ca. 22 December 1844]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday morning informing me of your�to me been very�to meet me, & spend the Christmas with the family, and as you seem so anxious about going, I have no objections.  But I should enjoy myself more to meet you & the children at home.  I never spend my time very pleasantly at Mr. Cunninghams for I am always confined too much to the House.  There is such a sameness y=to the days.  They are all alike�no new places�new things�new faces.

	I have no doubt you would find a change & a journey pleasant and agreeable you may therefore go down there as soon as you please & stay till I arrive.  But I cannot stay more than one or two days.  We will take Christmas dinner with them & start home the next day or the day after.  This is the condition on which we go [page torn] not act there as you did once before & refused to come home when I desired you.    I felt mortified & degraded then, & actually cried in secret until my heart almost broke.    It has ever since made me feel unpleasant when I thought of it.  And I did, at that time, vow it should be the last time I would ever set my foot in the House.    For they were altogether too�& urgent about our stay.

	Before you go down you must make Jim haul wood and see that there is plenty of shucks, fodder & corn for the cattle.  He will know how to procure it of uncle Feaster.  Do not start in bad weather.  If you go to Goldsmiths the first day you had better start about one oclock.  The next day you must make an early start for it is a long days drive.  Do not let Jim drive too fast.

	If the weather is suitable I wish the hogs killed before you go.  They are eating too much corn.  Have them killed and the meat all taken care of.  

	[page torn] I had no objection to your lending Yancey my horse & buggy, but you should have written to me about it.  Never keep anything concealed from your husband.  You are so much in the habit of keeping me in ignorance of everything at home when I am absent, that I am loosing confidence in your letters.  When I receive a letter, & have no assurance that you are all well�that nothing has happened.  The most extraordinary, or the most serious matters may have occurred & yet you do not write about them.  The death of my father two years since, you kept from me.  Such conduct is wrong & it destroys the interest I take in the reception off your letters.

	If you go to Mr. Cunninghams you must send the carriage to Laurens C. House for me.  I shall probably be at Laurens C.H.  Sunday, the 22nd of December.  I will then stay at Cunninghams, Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.  Christmas falls on Wednesday & we will start home Thursday morning.  Longer I cannot stay.    You had better start down a week or ten days before or as soon as you please.  I hope to hear from you again tonight, & if so, I will write you on [page torn] should anything occur.

	P.S. I have just seen your letter by Butler Thompson and your anxiety about going to Mr. Cunninghams seems to increase & I am afraid you will be off before you receive this letter.   I am very willing you should do as you please about the matter.  If you wish to go you can do so.    But I do not think you should do down so soon as you speak of doing.  It would hardly be worthwhile to send Jim home.  It would look too much like you were going to take up your board with them.  I am willing for you to pay them a visit, but let it be a visit.  If you start down there on Monday the 16thI am sure it will be soon enough.  And you too will get tired of your stay.  I don�t think you should manifest such an anxiety to stay so long from your home, your mother & sisters & that to a visit with persons not at all related to us.  As to Pamela�s pressing invitations you know they are given to everyone.  And you must remember too that you have to return the compliment & ask Pamela to stay with you next summer.  Unless you do so, it would be mean to go there.

	As to my coming home, & going down to Cunninghams after you that is out of the question.  I will call there for you on my way up from, Columbia.

	I have taken yup so much space in writing about your visit that I have not room enough to write about other matters.  And I have been thinking so much about it that other matters have gone from my memory.

	I have just read to torch light procession in the Mountaineer.  It is quite magnificent.  

	I dined with Dr. Gibbes the other day & was much pleased with the entertainment.  I have spoken of his collection of minerals paintings & curiousities in a letter to the Mountaineer.

	In the Temperance Advocate you will see a very handsome compliment paid my address.  I have bought some few books & amongst them the Gift for 1845 containing Simms story about Greenville.  I had to buy it.

	I am glad to hear you are getting on well with all the servants & children.  But in your last two letters you seem to have forgotten about the children.  

	But it is late in the night & I must close this letter.  Kiss the children for me & believe me your affectional husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now half after ten o�clock in the night & I have just finished my pleadings in three�cases of slander which are to be tried here this week.

	I write you a line to inform you that I may not be at home till the latter part of the week.  I have been employed today in the management of an important case & we are to argue it tomorrow�Young & myself on one side and Irby & Sullivan on the other.  My fee will be $100.

	I have been employed in four other cases of great importance.  Three of them will probably be tried this court & the fourth next court.  I have also another case here in which I was employed last court & a case of some importance.  It will likewise be tried this week.

	You perceive I am doing well from home.  My practice here is valuable to me.  

	I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  But suppose I hope you are all better.  If the children become worse you must write to me & I will return immediately.  

	Judge Wardlaw is presiding & I find him pleasant & agreeable.  I have not seen or heard from Mr. Cunningham.

	As soon as I can possibly leave here I will but that is very uncertain.  

	I have nothing worth writing & it is so late I must conclude.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just seen the Post Master & request to him to let me mail a letter although the hour has expired.  I have therefore but a few moments to write you in.

	You did not write me by the last mail, but Col. Butler &�informed me that you were all well.  You might have written by them.  But I suppose you had nothing very particular to write.  They informed me of the very sudden death of Mrs. Chick.

	From present appearances we shall not be able to reach the cases at all from the Western circuit, & if so you may look for me at home Friday night.  I have to stay to Wednesday as I am on the committee to examine Students on that day.  We shall then determine whether it is worth while for us to stay or not any longer.  The Court of Errors will occupy two weeks & the remainder of the month will be covered with the Southern & Middle circuits.  My business in the Court of Errors is through with.

	I have purchased a pair of candlesticks for chamber use price $4.00.  My other purchases you are informed of & you did not desire anything in your last letter.  By the by your letter was one of great interest�gave me much pleasure.  A very different letter from some which you were accustomed to write me last winter & spring.  Your troubles now on War & your Box.  I suppose Butler Thompson has relieved before his time & relieved you of the latter trouble�in regard to the first you need be under no dread.

	I wrote Wells a long letter for the Mountaineer yesterday & went to church which is the reason I did not write you�that I had nothing to write about.

	I saw Dr. Davis last week, who said he wished me to ride out some evening & see him.  I have not seen Taylor or any of his family.

	The lawyers from the county are now coming in.  Col. Fair came down this morning.  Butler &�go to Charleston in the morning & will return the last of the week.  

	I would give a great deal to see you & the children.  It would never do for me to be a member of Congress.  I should find it impossible to stay at Washington thew whole winter unless you & the children were with me.

	We have had a fine rain, & I was truly glad to hear you had rain in Greenville.  The rain is now falling & I must conclude my letter & send it to the Post office or it will not reach Greenville before I do myself.  

	Kiss the children for me & tell them I will bring them all something.  

       Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line by General Thompson & to thank you for your long letter.  Willie is quite well.  His grand mother was delighted to see him & so were all his relations especially Fosters wife & family.  He has been very much admired by all who have seen him.  His only fault is that he will stick to me too closely.

	I shall probably be at home tomorrow evening (Saturday).  One of my cases has been postponed & the other we are trying today.

	You did not write me how much you subscribed to the Church.  I hope not much.  There is no necessity for a new church at all, & I regard the whole project untimely.  But more of this when I return.  

	 We have had a fine rain & I hope it extended to Greenville.

	In quite haste yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have sat down to thank you for your very acceptable letter this evening by Dr. Palmer.  It  contains a great deal of news & gave me great satisfaction.  When from home I am always anxious to know how you & the children are doing & nothing gives me more pleasure than such information.

	I had the pleasure as you requested in your letter of being polite to Mrs. Palmer.  I had her invited to sit with the Judge & lawyers.  She sat next to me at the table & we had considerable talk.  The Dr. seemed quite sociable also.  Mrs. Palmer told of yours & your mothers cake &c.  The company is all gone from the Mansion House.  I am in court & did not see the Middletons as they passed down on the stage.

	Judge [Edward] Frost came up in the stage, & lost between Newberry & this place his trunk with all of his clothes & $150.00 in cash.  The trunk dropped off the stage.  He sent back for it, but can hear nothing of it.  Someone has picked it up & appropriated it leaving the Judge without a clean shirt & nothing but a very shabby suit of clothes, on his back.  I lent him my razor & offered him a shirt, but he procured one from the store & has a shirt washed every day.  He says he will make Capt. Ward pay for his loss.  The straps of the leather boot containing his trunk were not buckled.  He is a very pleasant agreeable gentleman & a pretty good Judge.

	I recd a short letter from Miss Pamela this morning with a package of books from her Greenville subscribers and amongst them is Mrs. Poinsett.  You say Mrs. P is not a subscriber.  I have a book for her anyhow.  Pamela writes from Abbeville C.H., is still very feeble, sends her love to you  & the children, and requests you to copy from my C� Journal all the corrections she made with a few into the copies sent her, Greenville, �wishes.  The Indictment against me can�for whipping young Bowen is going on & will be tried next Court.

	I recd a letter today from Sam Earle on the subject of the Rail Road &c.  The people do not seem to take much interest in the matter here.  They are all absorbed in the Com[mittee] meetings &c.

	None of my cases here have been tried yet & I shall be here all the week.  General [Waddy] Thompson told me as we came down that Butler & Miss Jones were going to be married..  He said it was not what could be called an advantageous match, but it was one he could not object to.

	I have exchanged my gold chain for another one.  It broke, & I found all the links were�& worn out.  I have a very beautiful one in exchange, something like yours & I gave $4 for boot.  I hope you have recd & taken care of my plows & straw cutter.  As President of the agricultural society I shall have the honor of introducing the first such soil plan in Greenville District & also the first plan for other description.  I bought them of Robe to use & show at the agricultural meetings.  F� Robe has made a present of a valuable book on agricultural chemistry by Johnston.  [sentence interlined, illegible].  

	Tell the servants to gather the peas & clear as much as possible before I get home.  Thank Will for his letter.  General Thompson saw him�on Saturday & says he is a �born  Democrat.�  Tell Anna & Frank howdy & kiss them all.  Miss Crawfords expression is in character & next time let her invitation be delayed still longer.  The news from Col. Hoke is good.  I am grateful to you for your letter.  Good night near ten oclock.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	As I shall not be able to return home before Sunday I will write you a few lines.  Nothing yet has been done in my cases & I am very tired of waiting. My great apprehension is that after staying all the week I shall not be able to reach them.  I have three very important slander cases & the great Will case, all ready for trial.

	I saw Mr. & Mrs. Allston & Mrs. Gadsden last night.  They spoke kindly of you & your kindness to them, praised Will &c.  I see a good many persons passing down the country.  The dancing master F� went on this morning.

       � Robe has permitted me to take a Box of seeds & wheat of an extraordinary character which he ordered from the north.  I will now plant wheat this Fall which he did not intend doing.  But which you wished me to do.  The grass seeds I am looking in getting. I have a great deal of agricultural talk with the Judge [Frost] & � Robe and amazed with Robe.  He says he likes to talk with him & picks up a great deal of information from him. [sentence interlined, illegible] It is now after eleven oclock.

	It would give me great pleasure if I was at home with you & the children.  My Farm is now another inducement to be at home.  My wife, my children, my office & my Farm are all great attractions for me, [words interlined, illegible] The office the least of all  & yet the most profitable.

	I hope John is well so that I can put Charles to work when I return.

	It is so late in the night I must conclude.  In the morning if I have time I will write a note to Will & Anna & Frank.  Yours truly & affectionately, good night, B.F. Perry

	I was very much pleased to receive your letter.  It shows that you think of and love your Papa although he is absent.  The next time you write you must ask Mama to print the words & let you fill them up.  This will make your letter more interesting.  

	You must learn fast & keep ahead whilst I am from home.  Never let any of the little boys out spell you.  I wish to see you a great man some day.  So you must love your Book & school.  You must also try to be a good Boy and mind what Mama says.  Love Anna & Frank and be kind to the little boys at school�never quarrel or fight.

	If you do these things Papa & Mama will love you & everybody will be good to you & you will grow up to be a great good man.

	Your papa, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here this evening after a fatiguing passage on the Stage & have nothing of interest to write you.  I am afraid if I have to postpone writing till tomorrow, I shall not have time.  As yet I have seen very few persons.  But as I know you will be glad to receive a line from me saying I am well & have arrived safely, I will write you the evening.

	We had a stage full�Elias Earle, Speen, Ware, Dr. Evans & Morris from Anderson.  Col. Ware joins us at Mr. Neelys.  He & Earle had provisions with them.  We all made a sumptuous dinner yesterday & today.  The�at Newberry House has improved very much.  By the bye Judge Frost has heard off his trunk.  Some negroes of a man named Hole� found it in the road & secreted it.  They burnt the trunk & books,�a portion of the money, dressed themselves in the Judges clothes & gave his silk gown to a negro woman to ware.  A portion only of the money has been recovered & the gold watch & his new suit of clothes.

	Mr. John Maxwell is a candidate for Super Intendent of Public Works, which will interfere most seriously with Elias Earles chance of success.  Their friends are trying to persuade them not to both run.  Mr. Maxwell is a rich man need the office.  But if he runs he will prove a very formidable competition.  

	The feeling in favor of the railroad is strong from Greenville�in this place and the feeling in Charleston.  Other portions of the state is friendly & favorable.  I   think a charter will be obtained this session, but I am afraid the Legislature will not take stock in the Road.

	Duncan & McBee were just ahead of us, & are at the House (Maybins).  I suppose Luther & Susan will be married the day after you receive this letter,  You are now no doubt busy in arranging for the wedding & hardly have time to read my letter so I will stop and write you a longer one next mail.

	Tell Jim to kill the hogs as soon as the weather turns cold.  We had rain Saturday night.  Do not leave the children alone.  I dreamed about it last night.  Tell Willie to learn fast & I will bring him a pretty knife�Anna to be good & she shall have a present�and Frank must talk to be rewarded.

	God bless you my dear wife.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Col. Martin & Col. Taylor enquired where you were.  They had understood you were coming down with me.  Mrs. Martin is not well nor is Mrs. Taylor well.

	I told Judge Butler that Susan was to be married.  He said perhaps his advice had some influence on her.  

	The weather is cold today & clear (Monday).

	I resented the Rail Road Petitions & they were favorably rece[ive]d.

	In haste yours, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I read your letter this evening & was extremely glad to hear you were all well.  If your letters contain nothing else they will nevertheless be read & read with great pleasure.  It would be gratifying to me if I could now take a peep at home & see you & the children.  Tell Will I have been looking at some knives for him & he must write me a postscript to some of your letters.  Col. Ancrum has his little son with him, who is about Wills size & make with hair exactly like Will.  With his back to me I thought of him.  But his face is not so intelligent & manly.

	I carried your watch & pencil to the jeweler this morning & he is to repair them.  I saw some beautiful striped silk dresses today.  Would you like one.  Your shoes I gave to Dr. Davis & he is to exhibit them tomorrow night at the Agricultural meeting.  Mr. Poinsett makes his speech there in the State House.  I saw him yesterday in the Senate for a few moments.  There was a meeting last night of the State Agricultural Society�Judge O�Neall & Butler made speeches.

	In the Legislature not much has yet been done.  We elected Mr. Calhoun today in the place of Judge Huger.  No other election takes place.  Major Earle seems in good spirits.  There are about twenty candidates for Super Intendent.  We have very strong electioneering for Comptroller General.    I have made up my mind to vote for Col. Wigfall.

	The speech I made last Winter on the election of Electors has been put in circulation today amongst the members by someone & I have been complimented by some of the members for it.    Some change will now have to be made on that subject.  I do not know whether my speech has been reprinted or whether the old edition has been put forth by the Chronicle.

	The Rail Road meeting with favour from all quarters.  I have been very busy for two days past in looking up law in McBees case about the gold mine.  Chancellor Johnson was�on one point.  I have now furnished him with law sufficient on that point & he will decide in my favour.

	Tomorrow Susan is married & before this reaches you there will be another member added to your mothers family.  When I told Judge Butler of the wedding he enquired if Luther could work.  I told him I rather thought not.  He said that was candid in me.  But if he will be prudent, his father can give him enough to support him through life. [page torn] he must be prudent & Susan also�otherwise in a few years they may sped all he has & be left penniless without the hope of making anything.  

	I have nothing further to write you about Wells.  Duncan has refused to sign the petition 7 I think none the better of him for it.

	I am writing in a great hurry & Col. Ware is waiting to take my letter to the Post office.

	Kiss the children & give my congratulations to McBee & Susan.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from dining at Dr. [Robert Wilson] Gibb[e]s in company with Mr. Poinsett, the Governor, Judge Butler. Chancellor Dunkin, [Chancellor] Johnson, Mr. Barnwell, Seabrook, Col. Pickens, Col. Allston, Col. Preston &c.  The stage leaves in the morning & I must write tonight or you will not have the pleasure of hearing from me.  The other evening I went with Major [James Edward] Henry to the Post office & sent your letter.  He enquired how often we write to each other & seemed astonished.  He writes once in two weeks.  I have just sent to the office for letters now & hope to hear from you before I have finished writing.  I spent a very pleasant & agreeable evening at Dr. Gibbes & drank some most excellent wine.

	Last night Mr. Poinsett made his Agricultural speech before a crowded House of Ladies & gentlemen.  I met Mrs. Poinsett there�also Miss Blanding by whom I was seated during the evening.  She enquired after you with interest & agreeably surprised when I told her Susan was to be married that evening.  She called McBee her �old friend Luther.�    She seems quite a pleasant young Lady.  Our friend Gilmore Sim[m]s made a most flowery speech complimenting the Ladies & some domestic wine which a Miss Roberts presented to the society.  After he had concluded I observed to the meeting that my fiend from Barnwell had omitted one thing one thing He should have offered his wine to the ladies after he finished�his speech.  Wherefore he came forward & did so to the amusement of the meeting.    Your shoes were greatly admired by Miss Blanding & other ladies who examined them in my presence.  Dr. Gibbes reported on them & this morning he carried them to have made up. 

	 Today I have been all day in the court of Appeals arguing a case of Mr. Kilgores.  In the House of Representatives they had some speaking on Mr. Calhouns course at the Memphis convention.  The members appeared like Calhouns slaves and refused to assert their opinions.

	The boy has just returned from the Post office & brings no letters from you which is a great disappointment but I suppose you were so busied about the wedding that you had not time to write.  I wish I could have been at it.  Susan is, I hope, happy, as she should be & deserves to be.  I think I heard someone say today that General [Milledge L.] Bonham was married.  Mr. Cox was here today on his return from the north �poor fellow�looks rather sad.  He goes up in the stage in the morning.  He left Miss Skinner behind him.

	I hope to see, next week, someone from Greenville which would give me great pleasure.  You said so much in your last letter about my writing about home, that I will say nothing on the subject.   Still I should like to be there & see you & the children & Will I wish he was here with me.  Kiss Anna & Frank.

	The weather is cold.  I hope the meat is doing well.  You must write me everything about the Farm, the children &c.

	I must now bid you good night.  Give my congratulations to Susan & McBee.  Yor husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter by Sundays mail informing me that Susan was married Sunday night.  Mr. Elford came & brought me the wedding cake.  I have distributed a portion of it amongst the Greenville delegation.  The piece for Pinckney McBee has been handed to him.  I informed him we had become a kin to each other since we left home.  I saw Col. Martin this morning in the Senate & informed him that I had a piece of cake for him.  Taylor.  He said he would send for it.  Mrs. Martin is now at Taylors.  She arrived here Saturday evening.  I promised to go & see her.  Martin had his little son with him in church on Sunday.  But I could not see him well. 

	General Thompson and Butler Thompson are at the House.  They came Sunday evening.  Butler talks very freely about his marriage & says he has it so arranged that I shall be at home when it takes place.  General [Milledge Luke] Bonham & his bride are in Columbia.  I saw them today at the college commencement.  They looked very happy.  There was another bride sitting by Mrs. Bonham.  Mrs. Randal, formerly Miss Lipscomb, now married to Mrs. Pearsons cousin of Chester or Fairfield.

	Ben Yancey & his sister are in Columbia but I have not seen them.  I saw John Cunningham today.  He says Pamela is much worse than she used to be though better than she was in the summer.  He speaks of her despondingly.  Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham are well.

	I have very little to write you about the Legislature.  We have done very little yet, so there has been a motion to adjourn on the 12th next Friday week.  If you don�t mind I shall get home to your Party.  You wrote me to let you know the price of fruits.  They are moderate in price.  The oranges are not good.  The pineapples are small & 29 cts by retail.  The grapes are very delicious & packed up in little kegs.  If you will direct me I will make a purchase for you, & send them up in the stage.

	In spite of your advice to the contrary I am becoming homesick & would like very much to be with you & the children tonight.  There is no place to me like home.  I very often go from home most cheerfully that I soon wish to return.  The novelty & excitement of new scenes soon cease to interest me.  My wife & children never.  It is true they sometimes interest me a little too much, but I never get tired of them as I do of everything else in this world.  I pitty from the bottom of my heart, him who has no wife & children.  Here is Col. Ashe sick & surrounded by the worlds wealth & luxury but no wife or children.  He seems to be without aim, object or interest.

       I am glad you think yourself so happily married as to wish Susan the same degree of happiness.  It is true we both have everything to make us happy.  It has my�fallen to the lot of two persons husband & wife to have less�to their happiness.  We enjoy uninterrupted health.  We have been prosperous, living well, surrounded by & enjoying all the comforts of life, accumulating property notwithstanding our extravagance, blessed with uncommon children, for I see none equal to them.  And our love for & confidence in each other is all that husband & wife could wish or desire.  I hope Susan will be equally happy.  How do they seem since their marriage?  How does Ann like it?  What does your mother think?  Write me all about them.  I have some curiosity to see them together.
       
       In regard to March hope you are mistaken.  Jim has made him work hard at very hard work splitting rails, & he is not accustomed to it & is young & slender.  There is a great deal of comeout
 In March when he fattens & fills up.

	Write me whether my oats are sown. Any fence made, how many rails made.  How the hogs I bought of Watson do.  This information you can get from Jim.

	Col. Martin has just come in, got his cake & brought me a Bundle for Susan B. McColl, a small bundle like silk or calico.

	I must conclude.  I went to the Episcopal church last Sunday.  

	You will see the political news from me in the Mountaineer Friday morning.

	The Governor has given no answer yet about Wells.

       Tell Willy I have seen some very pretty knives.  Tell Anna she must tell me what to purchase for her.  Tell Frank to say what he wants.  I wish I had Will with me.  Col. DeTreville has his little son with him.  We walked back from the college together.  He says he carries his son to let him see & learn things.  He gains practical information of more value than lessons from books.  Write me what you want.  Your truly, B.F. Perry

	I have just finished writing questions for the Students in Equity, who are to be examined tomorrow & I am one of the committee.  It is now eight oclock & I have to put the letter in the Post office tonight.  The preparation of questions has given me a good deal of trouble, & I did not know of my appointment till this morning.  There are four members of the Legislature and one member of Congress applying for admission in Equity.  

	I have just received your letter of Sunday night &�the Post letter also.  It had been lost in the Bar Room.  Hereafter I shall take your advice & go to the office myself.  Your letter advising me not to purchase any fruits for you has come too late.  This morning I started to you in Bensons wagon one hundred oranges, six coconuts, 1 dozen plantains, 1 doz Bananas, 1 keg of Grapes 26 pounds, delicious grapes. 50 cents worth of Almons  some of�nuts, some of Brazile nuts, 1 drum of Smyrna figs, 5 lbs of candy, 12 pineapples. All costing $16.85 cts.  They are all in one Box, except the grapes, which are in a keg & have also sent a large Box of Books, law books which I could not well do without.  I have paid for them in past by an order on a client in Charleston.  The balance I pay next Winter.  Jesse R. Gary owed me $100 for a case at Laurens.  The Books cost me $315.00 & cheap at that price.  I bought them of Mr. Carter & Allen.  I know you will be surprised but they are books I have long wanted & could not do well without.  All that I have, & all that I ever expect to make, have been & will be the product of Books.  My Books have been profitable & therefore I must cherish my Library.  I will pay for their balance $215 in some fees which I shall make pretty easily. Take good care of them & don�t let the Box get wet before you put it in the house.  

	You will receive the Boxes & key Tuesday next.  Benson, Wade & Lark were all down here hauling Gibbs property down.  Benson owes me & I have got him to take back the 2 Boxes & key.  Elias Earle has also sent up some Fruits and Speers sent up a Box full by some wagons.

	Tell Col. Coleman that the Rail Road Bill has been reported & read once in the Senate.

	I introduced some Resolutions today in the Senate on the subject of General Jackson, which I think are beautifully drawn.  They have been ordered to be printed & I will send you a copy.

	I have not time to write you more at present.  Kiss the children.  Give my respects to your mother & Susan & Ann & McBee.  I hope they are all happy.  Write me all about them.  The weather is cold & bad.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received yours & Willies letter & was very glad to hear from you and especially pleased at Wilies first intelligible letter to me.  Tell Willie I have not time to write this mail, but will by the next.  Indeed all of my letters to you have been written in great haste because I always wait to receive your letter before writing.  And I am so busy here that I hardly have time to do anything.  

	Last night the Governor gave a good Ball, but I had been engaged in court all day, & had to meet a committee at night, & did not go  I felt tired and went to bed about the time the others went to the Ball (10 0clock).  I had to be in court all day today, & knew that I should not feel well if I went to the Governors.

	The courts are now trying my cases & will be at it next Monday & Tuesday.  Today the law students were examined & all admitted (26), Pinckney McBee among them.  The Equity students were admitted yesterday & they all complimented me very much for my courtesy & kindness to them in my examination of them.  Butler Thompson was admitted in Equity & Elford.  

	I have the pleasure of seeing Col. Martins two little sons this morning.  They came with him to the State House.  The oldest is a good looking boy but not equal to our Willie.  In fact I have never seen three children so smart looking as ours.  This I say independent of the influence and�.  Martins second Boy would be good looking but for his blemish in the eye.  He has five children.  What a charge for a poor man to have.  I must go & see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.

	I saw your cousin Alston Hayne the other day & he promised to come & see me but has not.  I saw him in the Senate chamber.

	The election of Superintendent of Public Works comes on tomorrow at one oclock.  Mr. [Elias] Earle will soon know his fate.  He seemed pleased at your wish for his success.

	Pinckney McBee & B. Thompson start home tomorrow morning but will go through Edgefield & not reach Greenville before Thursday.  General Thompson will start home the firrst of next week.  Elford has gone to Charleston.  Tom Butler & Rowland have not reached here yet.

	My box of fruits & keg of grapes will reach you in time for your party.  But the weather is so cold you will have an unpleasant time.  Be careful about fire.  Col. F. Wardlaw got his House burnt up last week, by the rolling down of a chunk of wood on the floor.  Have the fire attended to every night & be careful about the children falling into the fire.

	How I should like to gear Frank�s sweet voice, even his cry.  Tell him to learn fast to talk  Tell Amma I must bring her a frock  Tell Will I will speak to Col. Summer about the dog and bring him a knife.

	The Legislature adjourns next Monday week.  I will be at home on Wednesday 17thwhen it will give me pleasure to see you & the children once more.

	I saw the Governor this morning.  He requests an interview with me & the other members of the delegation tomorrow, on the subject of Wells pardon.  So much has been said about his pardoning every body, that he has become extremely cautious.  I trhink however he will pardon him.  

	The Rail Road is going on finely.  The state will take two fifths of the stock.  

	I have not yet even seen to know[word obscured] Mr. Heyward.  If I can make it convenient I will seek his acquaintance.  But I see very little of the members of the House who do not board at Maybins.  

	The death of Mr. Cleveland was expected.  How many deaths happen in Greenville whilst I am absent.  Col. Dawkins was enquiring about Mr. Cleveland this morning.  I have not yet seen his wife.

	I must now conclude my letter as my paper is pretty well filled up & my topics exhausted, & it is late in the evening & I must put this letter in the office tonight.  

	Col. ware & Duncan & myself all recd letters this evening from our better halves.  Whether Walker did or not I do not know.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

       I have only time to thank you for your letter Sunday evening.  I obedience to your advice I have written a long letter for the Mountaineer & therefore have no time to write you.  You see what you get by your advice.  

	I have been all day today in the court of Appeals until 3 oclock.  Then I went to the Senate & staid there till five.  I have gained Kilgores case in the Court of Appeals & lost one I gained at Laurens.  The other cases have not yet come on.

	I hope you will receive tomorrow the box of fruits sent you, & that it will be in time for your party.  The night you wrote me, you must have read my letter informing you that the fruit was sent.

	You ask about my clothes.  They fit remarkably well.    But I have done so much writing in them that I am afraid of wearing them out.

	Mr. Elias Earle has just called & says he will go up in the morning.  Col. Ancrum was elected today.  But for Maxwells running Earle might have been elected.

	Tell Willy that Col. Sumner is going to write him a letter about the puppy.  He has no puppy yet for him but will have the next time.  I will certainly bring the knife and will as soon as I have leisure write Willy a pretty letter.

	Tell Anna that I will bring her something, but she has had so many dolls, & breaks them so rapidly I do not know so�about bringing a doll.

	Tell Frank that a whip is�brought than a drum & costs a good deal less.  I will bring him a whip.

	I wish to see you all very much & wish that I was going up with Major Earle so that I might be there in time to be at your party.    But, no, I do not care to be at your party.  I rather have the whole of your company to myself when I do return.

	If you do not hear from me by the next mail you need not be surprised.  And you will be so busy entertaining your company that you will not have time to read my letter.  I hope you will have better weather than we now have.  It has rained all day.

	In my letter to Wells you will see an account of a debate we had in the Senate.  I have tried to give quite a spirited sketch.    You will see a complement to the ladies & wives.

	We all had an interview with the governor about Wells case last Saturday.  He has given no answer yet, I think he intends granting a pardon.

	[page torn] I have seen nothing further of�Hayne.  I suppose he has returned nor have I been able to visit Taylor & Mrs. Martin & probably will not before I leave.

	I am glad your mother has rece[ive]d her money & hope she will immediately pay Hoke.

	I must conclude this hasty scrabble.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I hope you have arrived safely at�and I shall address this letter to Water Loo.  I feel anxious to hear how you & the children made out in your journey.   But you are a great manager & I have no doubt you got on very well.  You have beautiful weather.  By the by, you are this morning about this time, 8 oclock setting off from Goldsmith.

	I did not write you by the last mail because I know the letter could not reach Greenville before you had started, nor had I time to write,  I have been exceedingly engaged for several days past & shall still be until the Legislature adjourn[n]ing & you may not perhaps hear from me again.

	My bill giving the election of Electors to the People has undergone a long discussion & been rejected in the Senate by a vote of 25 to 19.  I opened the debate, Col. Pickens replied in a very warm & excellent speech on his side.  Col. Thompson spoke next on my side not very ably you may suppose.  Col. [George Washington] Dargan replied on the other side in a very long & most elaborate speech.  This excited me to another effort.  Col. Preston came to me in the Senate chamber & gave me his views & went off & hunted up all the authorities for me.  He brought young Mr. Blanding & introduced him to me who also furnished me with some additional facts.  The debate was adjourned till next day.    In the meantime Col. Preston sent me more books.  I went back fully prepared & made a speech of one hour & a half in length which all friends & opponents, admit did me great credit.  A great many persons have applied to me to have the speech published.  I shall do so as soon as I can write it off.  The Senate chamber was almost empty when I took the floor.  Before I concluded there was a dense crowd all around me.  I felt that I was making a good speech & my replies to Col Dargan & Col. Pickens were very happy & appropriate.

	I will now give you an account of the parties which I attended last night & the night before.  The Governor gave a magnificent democratic party at Col. Maybins Hotel.  There were a thousand persons present.  They drank eighteen hundred bottles of champaign, besides other wines & brandy.  The supper was a handsome one & must have cost a great deal.  The drawing room was covered around the walls, with flags, banners,�&c.  There was a painting in one end of the room with the names of all the governors of South Carolina with Aiken at their head showing through showing through a trans�

	There were not many ladies.  The Hamptons & Singletons were there however & some others.
Before night I received a message from a lady that she desired to be introduced to me that evening at the governors party.  So I brushed up & went into the ball room about ten oclock, after returning from the State House.  I was escorted through an almost impenetrable crowd to Mrs. Ellet the wife of a Professor in College & a very literary lady who writes for all the magazines, reviews &c.  You have seen some of her articles in the Democratic Review.  She is not only literary but very handsome about thirty.  I believe ladies never get beyond that age.  She took my arm & we commenced a promenade in the long piazza.  The other ladies & gentlemen followed.  We had quite a literary talk.  I found her very agreeable.    She made me promise to collect some information connected with Col. Clevelands life & character.

	Whilst promenading with Mrs. Ellet I met Gen. Canty with a lady hanging to his arm about forty, with a pleasant smiling face having still the vestiges of former beauty.  I thought I had seen her, but could not recall, either name, time or place.  In the course of the evening, I asked Gen. Canty who she was.  He said to me �she is an acquaintance of yours.�  Says she remembers you very well & perhaps you might remember her as Mrs. Cripps�.  I took the Generals arm & was immediately introduced to her.  I saw her fifteen or sixteen years since at William Mauldins wedding in Georgetown.  She told me that she had frequently seen me since.    She once heard me make a speech in the Legislature on the duelling bill�that she saw me at Greenville &c.  Poor woman you know her sad fate�married a drunkard & separated.  

	Last night I rerce[ive]d an invitation from Col. & the Misses Hamptons.  Col. Harleston & myself went together �four miles & a half.  We started after 8 oclock�got lost & arrived there just at ten oclock.  Quite a fashionable house!  When we came within lights on each side of the road negroes standing to add fuel, the road was perfectly lighted.  On the gate posts a quarter of mile from the house there were�--lamps burning.  The lawn leading up to the house & all the circuitous walks in front of the house were lighted with lamps. I suppose at least one thousand.  It looked like the starry firmament brilliant indeed.

	Col. Hamptons residence is a magnificent one & looks like an English noblemans palace.  I cannot undertake to describe it to you in a letter.  The company had all assembled.  We were ushered into a wide entry & on each hand there appeared to be rooms as far as the eye could see filled with all the elite of Columbia the Legislature & a large portion of the state.  There were wealth & fashion & beauty.    Col. Hampton met us & carried us through the smiling crowd to his daughter & gave us an introduction.  They were dancing & waltzing & flirting & talking all around.  I knew most of the gentlemen present, but few of the ladies.    I saw a lady dancing with Middleton who looked pretty but somewhat faded & I said to Mrs. Bull who was standing by my side �what lady is that dancing with Middleton?�  �That is Mrs. Bull� was his reply.  I saw Miss Pride (still Miss Pride).  She went to Europe this past summer with Col. Davie�your cousin Allston Hayne was there & quite a dancer.

	The supper was the most beautiful affair I ever saw�magnificent yet graceful.  The tables were arranged in circles all round the room.  In the center a splendid collum of evergreens &c.  But I will not describe.  Leave this for a conversation.  I left as the company were breaking up at one oclock�got home at two, & woke up this morning at six�feel quite well�have to b0e in the court House at ten, to argue a case from Spartanburgh�and in the Senate at eleven.

	Since I have been writing it has clouded over & we have appearance of rain.  I feel for you & the dear little children & think of your lonely condition on the road.  I hope however it will not rain today.  This day week I shall meet you & I assure you that I shall greet this place with great pleasure.

	After my return home I shall have to go to Charleston, perhaps in January, to argue a case in the court of Appeals, Mrs. Mayrants case.  The court has not time to dispose of it here.  Col. Hunt & the Attorney General are employed against me.   We have made an arrangement to take it up whenever I go down.  The only objection is the season of the year.  But that is nothing if we go down in the stage.    Think of it.  We can carry all the children with us.

	I must now go into court.  You must give my respects to Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham, and Miss Pamela.  Tell her that I have given her womans�to Dr. Arnold.  My friend Simms is about starting a magazine again.  If he does it will afford miss Pamela & myself an opportunity of making use of the womans�

	Kiss all the children for me & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I am afraid from the progress yet made in Court, that I shall be detained here till Sunday.  I have four cases here of great importance & no prospect of reaching any of them before Thursday or Friday.  And I cannot think of leaving before the last is disposed of.

	I saw Mr. Cunningham here today.  He was indicted in court for an assault & battery.  But the case was compromised, and he got off with a fine of one dollar.  He informed me that Miss Pamela had been extremely ill last week �that he had despaired of her living, but that she was now better.  She was last week worse than she ever had been & Dr. Arnold was sent for.

	I will send you the Laurensville Herald which contains my communications & the remarks of the Editor.   He has treated my explanation very fairly & published my speech.  I am entirely satisfied with the result.

	Judge Wardlaw is holding court here & seems sad no doubt mourning for the loss of his wife.  He mentioned a shocking piece of news in regard to General McDuffies negroes�two of them were brought in the other day dead.  �had been whipped & tarred to death by his driver & overseer.  He says that McDuffie has had some fifteen or twenty slaves in chains for some time past.  They work in chains & at night are locked up.  Such cruelty is more is worth�can cover.  I am pleased at Judge Wardlaws notions about the government of slaves.  The correspond with my own.

	General Thompson is here but is not going on to Washington until after the courts are over.  He says he is very much distressed about Butlers eye & thinks he may loose the sight of it.   

	Mr. Cunningham told me there was no prospect of Ben Yanceys getting married.  I expect he has been kicked.   He said he wished him very much to marry Miss Per�who is now staying with Pamela.

	I hope you are doing well in your garden & will have everything in nice order when I return.  You had better plant such seeds as the season suits.  Send & get a paper of carrots & parsnips & plant.

	Tell Jim &�I want to see a great deal done at the Farm on my return.  Let the ground all be broken up & ready for planting corn next week.  Tell them that next week I wish everything ready carry out the manure. 
       
	Kiss the children for me & say to them that I forgot to kiss them when I was starting�and that I have thought of the omission often.  It would give me great pleasure to be with you all tonight, & hear them fret & crying in the morning.  I do not know how much I love you all [page torn] I am absent from you.

	It is now late in the night & I must go to bed.  If I have time I will write you by Fridays mail.

	The prospects of the Rail Road are dull, but it is said that a good deal of stock will be taken in Laurens during the summer�and also in Newberry.  I hear $100,000 has been taken in Charleston, but I am afraid it is too good news to be true.

	My dear wife�good night.  Mr. Wells will leave here in the morning for Greenville & perhaps may carry this letter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S.  We are all shocked to hear that President Tyler & his wife had separated.

My dear Liz

	I received no letter from you by Sundays mail.  I shall anxiously expect one by the next mail.

	It is more than likely that I may return home next Friday evening.  There is no hope of reaching my cases under two or three weeks.  Young, Whitner, Sullivan, Irby & Orr are now here and we will probably make an arrangement tomorrow to continue all of our cases & go home.  Whitner has his wife with him & Mrs. Mays is to be here tonight.  Harrison is here with his wife.  General Thompson came here yesterday & says Cornelia Crittenden will also be here tonight.  She stopped a day in Orangeburgh & all the Abbeville lawyers came in today & yesterday.  

	There weas quite a pleasant party at Col. Prestons Saturday evening.  I met Mrs. Ellet again.  She invited me to her soiree Wednesday evening, but the Board of Trustees met that evening.  [Thomas Jefferson] Withers, Manning & myself have been busy about the college every day.  

       The students for admission to the Bar are examined next Wednesday & I Am on the committee again.    Have just prepared my questions.  Fortunately I brought my old ones down with me.  There are some fifteen making application.
       
       I purchased the works of Hugh [Swinton] Legare & was not a little surprised [to] learn from Col. Wigfall that I was mentioned in them that my name had reached Brussels also!   I have been reading the Work with some interest.  He is very severe on the nullifyers.
       
       I was at church on Sunday & heard Mr. [James Henley] Thornwell preach a fine sermon.  I saw Chancellor Harper at Col. Prestons.  His health is desperate & [he] cannot live long.  He enquired about Anna & your mother.
       
       I have bought your knives & a carving knife & fork�a Ball for Will that will bounce as high as the House�no hat as yet�price same as in Greenville $1.50 and Panama $3.00.
       
       I hope you are not much alarmed by the war.    There is great interest felt here to know more about it.  We shall hear in a few days.
       
       I saw Pringle here on Saturday.  Poinsett will be here tonight.  
       
       Col. Irby brings me news that you have had a great deal of rain in Greenville.  I am afraid my crop is all ruined & the land all washed away.
       
       In my last letter I said nothing about being anxious to get back home.  You once told me not to write anything more about that.  I will not at present, but only leave you to imagine [page torn] much pleasure it would give me to see you & the children�.  The remembrance abroad is always a delightful one.  I forget that the children ever cry, or behave badly.
       
       I saw at Col. Prestons a beautiful marble bust of Mrs. Preston by [Hiram] Powers.  It is worth looking at & made me ashamed of my plaster of Paris busts.  He has a great many fine paintings.  His library was on shelves in the dining room but not so large as mine.  Nor was his house so neat as our rooms are.
       
       My darling Liz good night.  If I do not return home by the next stage I will write you.  Kiss the children for me & believe me yours truly, &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Although I have just started on my tour. Only one night from home, and yet I am disposed to avail myself of an opportunity of writing to you.  In fact you and the children have scarcely been out of my mind for ten minutes since I left home.  I regret that I have not all of you with me.  The conduct of Will the night I started in running down the stair case to kiss & hug me once more before I departed deeply affected me.  He has an affectionate heart & his faithfulness no doubt proceeds from disagreement of his stomach lately.  He will one day make a man of some figure in the world I hope.    Anna is so kind & affectionate, so much like my old mother & being a daughter is my favourite.  Little Frank is a noble fellow, & how I wish I had him sitting on my knees this evening by your bedside.  But I have left you all in the care of your mother & I am sure, feel certain that you will be well taken care of.  It is said that a mothers love is the strongest feeling of human nature & I know your mother possesses it in its greatest strength.  But I think a husbands love for his wife, & the mother of his children as strong [as] any human feeling need be.

	I had a pleasant trip down here.  The stage all alone to myself& my journey had been preceeded with most refreshing & delightful showers, which�the dust & cooled the atmosphere.  In the lower part of Laurens I heard of much sickness & some deaths from fever, whereupon I took out Dr. Crooks vial of pills & swallowed them without water or anything else to facilitate their downward course.    I never felt better than I do.  I weighed at Col. McNeeleys 192 pounds.  He said he wanted to see how much I would gain in my travels�says I will weigh at least 200 when I return.

	I hope you have had rains since I left home.  Tell Jim he must continue to harrow the corn until it is all silking.  Crops look fine on the road and a great deal of the corn made & out of danger from drought &c.

	At Newberry I sent for Col. Fair.  He was at Edgefield court.  But he heard that he & Patrick Caldwell & Mr. Nance were all going on to the north next Tuesday.  I am approved the mens is too good to be true.  How I would like to have Col. Fair as a travelling companion.  He is a noble hearted fellow & I love him much.

	You must return my thanks to Mrs. Poinsett, Mrs. Butler & your mother for the letters they gave me, although I may not be able to deliver one fourth of them.  My journey is more to look at the country than to become acquainted with people.

	Should you see any of Tom Butlers family you may tell them to think there is but little doubt of his election as Major.  I have heard from all the campaigns but Chester & he is thirty votes ahead of Major Gladden the next highest candidate.

	I have seen no one scarcely since I reached Columbia.  �ate dinner washed dressed & sat down to write you this letter�nothing to write about either�so I can�promising our children and speaking for husbands love old themes, but nevertheless interesting ones.  You, however, have had too many proofs of my love in actions in conduct to have it strengthened by words.  Your sweetness & womanly softness, have too often made my stern[n]ess & inflexibility if purpose yield to your own wishes, to doubt your influence over me.  I was not born to obey & yet you have always made me yield to your feelings & wishes.

	But enough�remember [me] to your mother, Susan & Anne.  Susan I suppose begins to feel a young mothers love.  I hope she may be as happy in life as her disinterested affection through life merits.  And I pray that Anne too may be restored to health & happiness.  Her father has, indeed, been a sad one.

	Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

6 July 1846
Washington, D.C.

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this city yesterday morning & have not yet recovered from the excessive fatigue of the journey.  I will however endeavour a brief of my travels so far.  

	The morning after I wrote you in Columbia I set out on the Rail Road for Charleston in company with Professor Henry of the South Carolina College.  I had quite a tete a tete with him as far as Branchville.  He then turned up for Aiken.  The downward car had Judge Dunkin on board but I did not find it out till we had landed in Charleston.  He enquired after you very particularly.  I saw no one in Charleston.  The boat closed at 4 oclock.  We had a crowd on board.  In the night a most terrible storm over took us & I assure you I never spent a more wretched night.  We were in great danger from the wind & lightening.  I slept none.  It was excessively hot & we had to close all the windows to keep the rain water out.  The heat broke out all over my body & in many places the skin is as red as blood.  Sunday morning we landed in Wilmington & took the cars for Weldon where we arrived at night 160 miles�travelled all night�came to Petersburgh about sunrise�ate breakfast at Richmond & arrived here at 5 oclock.  I took lodgings at the National Hotel, a very splendid building.  Almost the first man I saw was General Thompson.  He was glad to see me & hear from home. I next saw Frederick Rutledge�then a Mr. Michael from near Beaufort.  He was going round to Burts to take tea.  At the tea Burt & Yancey came to see me & we sat & talked to near ten oclock.  In the meantime I met my old acquaintance General Rush of Texas.  General Thompson called up Commodore Morris & introduced me to him & I informed him Mr. Poinsett had given me a letter to him.  He enquired very kindly about Mr. Poinsett & invited Gen. Thompson & myself to call & see him.

	In the morning I went down to the Capitol.  This is a magnificent building & greatly surpassed my expectations, for grandeur & beauty.  The grounds too are magnificent.  I was introduced into the House by Mr. Yancey.  [Richard F.] Simpson came over to see me�so did Rhett & [Isaac] Holmes, [James] Black, [Joseph] Woodward & [Armistead] Burt.  I was greatly astonished at the appearance of the members.  They are indeed a most inferior set of looking men�seem to have very little talent & one half of them look like they had no pretentions to be called gentlemen.  I was more shocked at their rudeness & vulgarity than I was at their bad looks.  They are a rowdy set & nothing could induce me to be a member of that House.  I went with General Thompson into the Senate.  He introduced me to [John J.] Crittenden of Kentucky, [Dixon] Lewis of Alabama, [Alexander] Barrow of Louisiana & [William S.] Archer of Virginia.  The latter invited me to take tea with him tomorrow evening.  I spoke to Mr. Calhoun but did not see McDuffie.  Col. Benton is decidedly the most striking & imposing man I have seen.    I am to go to his house to deliver my letter.    The Vice President is also strikingly aristocratic in appearance.    A good many of the Senators are inferior looking.

	I have engaged some clothes.  [page torn] they will not be ready for some days ad will detain me here�otherwise I should go north immediately.

	I hope to hear from you before I leave this city.  I shall endeavour to write a letter for the Mountaineer, but really the breaking out of the heat annoys me so at night, that I am almost crazy.  I commenced writing this letter last night but had to stop on that account.

	I feel as if I was a long way from home & am anxious to see you & the children.  It seems to me that I have been from home a month at least.  

	You must excuse this�scroll.  I will write you again before I leave Washington.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The weather is so dreadfully hot that I can hardly muster courage enough to write you.  It has been one week since I left home really it seems to me like an age.  I have travelled so far, & seen so much that it seems to me impossible that I have done all this in one week.  I hope you & the children are  all well & that I shall receive a letter shortly saying so.  I left you unwell & when I think of it I am almost ashamed of my conduct.  But you were willing & persuaded me to come.

	I have just written a letter to Col. Townes giving a full account of what I have seen & noticed.  To that letter I refer you & you must consider it part & parcel of this.  

	I had the pleasure of going to the Presidents yesterday evening & was charmed with Mrs. Polk.  There was an immense crowd in the grounds around the Building.  The President is not so�in his manner as his wife.  I soon was introduced to another fine lady Mrs. Crittenden of Kentucky.  Yesterday evening I spent at Archers in company with the Russian minister, Barrow, Senator from Louisiana, Crittenden of Kentucky, General Thompson, Pendleton of Virginia.  I called to see Commander Morris, General Towson, Major Cooper & Col. Benton.  Commander Morris returned my visit this morning.    Holmes, Woodrow, Simpson & Black all called to see me this morning & left their cards.  Mr. Crittenden also did me the honor to call & leave his card.  I dined with Simpson today.  General Towson seemed very glad to hear from Mrs. Butler & requested me to call & see Mrs. Towson.  Major Cooper seemed delighted to hear from Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett.  Col. Benton was not at home.  I saw Mrs. Benton & her three daughters, one of them married to Co. Fremont of the army.  When I gave Mrs. Fremont the letter from Poinsett, she said she was entitled to one half the letters her father received from him.  They seemed quite a pleasant & agreeable family�not pretty, but not ugly�healthy & rosy cheeked.  General Thompson went with me and he has been very kind to me.  I feel under many obligations to him for his politeness.  It has been of great service to me.

	I was delighted with Barrow of Louisiana.  He is a noble looking man & I think a noble hearted fellow with handsome talents.  I have yet seen very few pretty women.  They do not strike me at all.  Mr. Calhoun came up to me today & seemed very kind.  I have not seen McDuffie.  Yancey�s mother is here & has fallen out with Cunninghams family & Ben.  She must be crazy.  So Burt thinks.  Mrs. Calhoun & Mrs. Burt left here this morning for the Virginia Springs.

	Commodore Shubrick is in command of the navy yard at this place.  I went to visit the yard & did not carry your mothers letter with me nor did I see him.    I will send it to him.

	Barnwell Rhett�.

	I have just got my clo[page torn] coat, pantaloons, & 3 vests at $45.50.  They fit very well & if I had my shirts, I should look quite genteel.

	I shall not leave for the north before next Saturday.

	You must write me in Boston, all how you are coming on, & the children, & the farm &c�how Willie�  What they say &c.  What sort of a present they wish &c.  Barrow told me the other night he wished to have 25 sons�that he would rather have a distinguished son than be distinguished himself.   I told him I expected Mrs. Barrow would object to the number which made him smile.  He is a noble gentleman.  Good night.  Your husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before breakfast.  I am not in such a rack of pain as I was when I wrote you last.  But the weather is the hot[t]est I have ever felt.  Last night I went to the Presidents alone.  Burt was to have gone with me.  I first rode to Mr. Calhouns where I spent a few minutes very pleasantly with him.  I had some�tensions in going to the White House alone for fear I would not be recognized.  There was a great crowd assembled.  I pushed my way through to the President & then to Mrs. Polk who said in her kind manner �how do you do Mr. Perry.� I entered into conversation with her.  She expressed great astonishment that I never had been to Washington before--said she could hardly believe it.  We spoke of South Carolina, the mountains, Tennessee, the French Broad down which she had once travelled, the Hudson &c.

	I met Col. Benton at the Presidents & had a long talk with him about Oregon & his speech.  I complimented it very highly & he seemed pleased.  I understand he is very greedy of praise & flattery & does not hesitate to talk of himself.  The President was nearby & heard my compliments which he did not seem to relish as it was rather a censure on him as he differed so widely from Col. Benton.  I noticed he turned off & sat down.  I was introduced to Col. Benton in the Senate chamber yesterday by Mr. [William Lowndes] Yancey.  He told mew that Benton would speak of his daughters who were educated by himself, in very high terms.  He said �Sir my daughters are well educated.  They are capable of conversing with ease, with the crowned heads of Europe�!  Mrs. Freemont it is said possesses all of her father�s talents & I should suppose so from what I saw of her.  

	Mr. Yancey has resigned his seat in Congress, is going to move to Montgomery & practice law in copartnership with Elmore of that place.  He says Isaac Hayne was doing well & his wife made him here�that he will go into copartnership with Perroneau & Mazyck is going to withdraw.  There was no other cause for his leaving Alabama.

	I dined with Simpson the other day.  He lives by himself�only one other member of Congress with him.  He has been very kind to me.  And General Thompson I feel under a thousand obligations to.  I have become acquainted with Governor[Arthur Pendleton] Bagby of Alabama.  I was also introduced to Yulee & [James Diament] Westcot[t] last night at the Presidents.  She is very pretty.

	Yesterday I heard a debate in the Senate between Calhoun, Webster, [John Adams] Dix of New York, [John] Davis of Massachusetts, [William Segar] Archer of Virginia.  I also heard Benton speak on Another subject.  I liked Calhoun�s style of speaking more than that of any other.  I felt proud of him.  He sent me his report the other day on the Memphis Convention and yesterday he came to me in the Senate chamber and asked me if I had read it and I had barely looked over it.  He asked me what I thought of it & begged me to write something in the Mountaineer about the subject in order to call the attention of our friends to it.  This placed me in a most delicate situation for I differ with him in some respects.  I told him I would think of it.

	If I do not stop my letter will not be at the post office by eight oclock when the mail closes.  I hope to hear from you on Monday�Tuesday.  I will go north.  Mr. Yancey speaks of going with me.  Kiss the children a dozen times for me�my dear Liz�your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your letter yesterday morning and was delighted to hear from home.  I went to the Post office to put in the letter I wrote you, & came very near coming off without enquiring for letters, not supposing you had had time to write me.  I assure you it affords me great pleasure to receive a letter [from] my home & my Dear Liz in a strange place.    And it seems to me that we shall have been separated so long that our meeting will be like a second marriage.  I am glad to hear that Will is head, that Frank misses me so much.  I hope they will all be good children & grow better by my return, & I will bring them so pretty presents.

	Yesterday I went to see Commodore Shubrick.  He now lives in Washington & has command of the navy yard.    He made a great many enquiries about your brother & family & seemed very kind.  Sent for his daughter to come down & see me & introduced me as the husband of her cousin Elizabeth McCall.  Said he would call & see me &c.  His standing in the navy is very high & he goes to sea in a few months.

	From Commodore Shubricks I went to the Capitol & was there introduced again to John Q. Adams who I find represents the district in which My Father was born.  He invited me to call & see him  Monday morning  & he would give me some information in regard to my name.  I had considerable conversation with him.  He looks very much like my Father, & I was so forcibly reminded of the likeness on first seeing him that I could not refrain from shedding tears.  I never will say aught against him again.  For I hold it impossible for any one with his features to be a bad man.

	I went into the Senate & there met for the first time Mr. [George] McDuffie who seemed very kind & invited me to take tea with him.  I was introduced to Richie, the venerable editor of the Union.   He enquired if I was major Perry of Greenville, S.C. and on being told yes�He replied �you are a much stouter man than I expected to see.  I had always formed an opinion that you were a small man.�  I had a long & very agreeable conversation with him.

	In the evening Burt & myself took a ride & went to the walls of the Capitol where some hundred of ladies & gentlemen assemble every evening to hear the Bank of music, promenade &c.  where I met Miss Howard.  I tried to avoid her but she literally ran after me, begged me to call & see her.  I found her with a member of Congress from Kentucky.  She must be crazy.  I met Mrs. Woodward & walked over the grounds with her & her husband and a Miss�from New York.  I met & was introduced to Winthrop of Massachusetts who is a gentleman.  About dusk we returned to Mr. Calhouns & took tea with Mr. McDuffie & Mr. Calhoun.  After tea Middleton came in who married a Vonness.  I had met him in the Library in the morning & had a good deal of conversation with him after an introduction by Burt.

	After sitting a while Burt & myself came to the Hotel where we found Col. Fair & Mr. Nance who had just arrived.    I am delighted to have Col. Fair for my travelling companion.  He will detain me a day or two longer in Washington.

	At the Box I found a letter from Col. Totten�inviting me to dine with him on Monday at 5 oclock.  He had just rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Poinsett.  I find Mr. Poinsetts friends very much attached to him here.  And I could not have brought letters from a better source.

	You can form no conception of the heat of the weather.  It is actually purgatory.  Such distress & complaint I never had before.  My room is surrounded by Ladies & such doleful lamentations do I hear.

	You need be under no apprehensions about my money.  I believe my trunk the safest place.  Captain Rivers is here with his daughter going north & Mrs. Bryce of Columbia.  

	Adieu my dear Liz�my love to the children & your mother & family, your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you this morning because I may not have an opportunity of writing again for several days.  The great Tariff debate in the Senate commences today & from what I hear will continue several days.  I may detain me in Washington as it will [be] of great interest.  The great men of the Senate will all take a part.

	Yesterday was Sunday & it was so hot that I did not go to church.  I wrote you a letter in the morning.  After breakfast I pulled off my clothes and lay on my bed near a window pretty much till dinner thinking of you & the children.  That I loved you all as much as it was possible for a husband & a father to love his wife & family.  But I never realized the full strength of my love till separated from you in a strange city & no hope of seeing you for weeks to come.  I thought to myself all day yesterday how little I Appreciated whilst at home the value & the pleasure of yours & the childrens company & how much I would value it on my return.

	In the evening I went with General Thompson by appointment to ss Webster.  We found him sitting in his front portico with his coat & waistcoat off.  He looked as plain as any old farmer or country magistrate.  He said to me �I have heard of you before.�  I told him that I once had the pleasure of receiving a letter from him.  He ordered some claret, whiskey & water.  I & General Thompson drank of the claret & water.  He drank whiskey & water.  He spoke of the Tariff, Mr. Calhoun, Internal Improvement, Oregon, the Mexican War, the character of the American people, Agriculture, England, Stock, Talleyrand, France &c.  I enjoyed the conversation very much and was delighted with his simplicity & greatness.  When I went to start he asked me how long I would remain in the city.  He asked me if he could do anything for me in Boston by way of letter &c.  Said he would send me to a gentleman near where my father was born who would give me more information than I had any conception of in regard to my name & myself.

	From Websters we went to Judge Masons attorney general of the U. States and spent an hour or two very pleasantly with the judge, his wife & children.  Judge Mason is regarded as the purest best man in Washington.  His wife is very ugly but pleasant & agreeable.

	A good many South Carolinians are now here and Judge Butler is to be here today.  I tell you in great confidence which you must not mention that Governor Butler & Col. Mason of the Army are to fight a duel as soon as he arrives in Washington.  This brings Judge Butler here.  I have my information from General Thompson.  But do not let it get out as it would distress his family & friends.  It is an old quarrel & cannot [page torn] made of.   

	Major Stark of Hamburgh is here & also Mr. Bryce of Columbia.  They are all going north.  So I shall have company enough.

	Today I must return some calls & visit old John Q. Adams by appointment.

	The weather is alarmingly hot and it is truly distressing.

	Breakfast is ready & I must conclude this letter.  You may not hear from me again before I leave the city.  I shall go to Baltimore & stay a day, thence to Philadelphia, New York, West Point�&c.  Give my love to your mother, Susan, Mr. McBee, & Anne.  Kiss the children & accept the openness of my love.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your second letter last night.  I sent two or three times before I could get it.  Once or twice the Bar keeper told me there were n letters.  I knew you had written me and I leave here today.  I was unwilling to start without hearing from you.  General Thompson rece[ive]d letters from Mrs. Thompson & Butler who sent word that all of my family were well.  But I persevered until the letter came & I was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I shall now leave the city without regret�hoping to hear from you in New York & Boston.

	I have not much to write in addition to my last.  I dined at Col. Tottens Monday and was delighted with him & his family.  He is a very intelligent & warm hearted gentleman.  His wife is a most agreeable lady but not handsome.  His daughter is a sweet young lady.  They all came up & shook hands with me & treated me as one of the family.  He has two sons not grown.  I believe he has one or two sons, a daughter married whom I did not see.  They all seem greatly attached to Mr. Poinsett.

	Yesterday evening I went to the Presidents in company with Burt, Simpson, Judge Butler, Fair.  I told Mrs. Polk that I had written Mrs. Perry some admirable sketches of the White House & its inmates and I assured her that the feeling of South Carolina was quite loyal that evening.  Judge Butler who was standing with me said I should use the word allegiance.  Mrs. Polk replied the other was the feeling when applied to a lady.  We talked to her some time until a crowd came up & pushed us off.  She is a most charming woman & seems so happy at being Mrs. President.  I do not think I ever saw a happier woman in my life.  She has a little spice of vanity in her character & her heart is filled to overflowing with the idea of being the wife of the President, & she seems to look upon him of being worthy of all the honor & admiration.  I could but think how she would differ in opinion with those who called Mr. Polk a third rate man during the presidential canvas.  In their opinion he is first of the greatest.  I will have a great deal to tell you about persons in Washington, but cannot write all.

	I have written a letter to the Mountaineer & in it mention my visit to Adams & the debate in the Senate.  You will see this letter and I will not repeat what is in it.

	Judge Butler stays here a short time & returns to So Carolina.  Governor [Pierce Mason] Butler has not yet arrived.  Dr. May who was over at Greenville with Powell McCray called to see me yesterday.  I also went by myself to see Crittenden of Kentucky & Archer Senator from Virginia.  I found them both very kind & pleasant.  Yesterday I dined with Mr. Burt at Calhoun & McDuffies in company with those gentlemen, Judge Butler, Simpson, Fair & Tucker of Virginia.  We had quite a pleasant party.

	Col. Fair & myself will start today for Baltimore.  You will not hear from me for some days.  I have not written yet to anyone but you & Col. Townes.  I must write to some others when I get time.

	My dear wife you must take good care of yourself & children.  Give my love to your mother & family & write me all the news, write to Boston.  My present notion is to go to New York, Saratoga, Niagara, down the river to Montreal & back to Boston.  Mr. Adams directed me to take this rout[e] & gave me all the particulars.  In great haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Philadelphia

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Col. Townes describing everything I have seen since I left Washington & to that letter I refer you.

	I am now travelling with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  Yancey did not come on with us as we hoped.  We will go on rapidly together till we reach Boston.  There Col. Fair will leave me & return home & I will stop along to deliver my letters & see more of the country.  He will go with me to Niagara & Quebec.  I find it very pleasant to have a friend, & will more so when I get into Canada. 

        I hope to hear from you in New York.  If you wrote within three or four days after you wrote me last in Washington I shall receive it.  But my stay will be as short one in New York until my return.
       
       In looking over Sully�s Gallery of Paintings I was struck with the painting of Adam & Eve.  It is the most lovely picture I ever saw & if I had money would purchase it at $150.   You will see some account of it in my letter to the Mountaineer.  I am delighted with Philadelphia but have seen no one.  Your mothers letters I shall have to leave in the Post office.  I left Mrs. Heywards at Willmington as I passed through it.  I feel awkward in calling to see strange ladies & I suppose they would have some such feelings themselves�now shall I be able to call & see Capt. McCall as I pass through New Jersey.
       
       I was looking at some bracelets for you this morning.  They are fashionable�one only.  But I will take your advice & make my purchases as I return.  I saw a bedstead worth $2500, a wardrobe $1500 and the whole set for one chamber worth $8,000!  I saw some beautiful & new fashioned sofas�French�price $190�some neat plain ones at $35.
       
       I have met in Philadelphia Dr. Thompson, son of Wallace Thompson of Union who is attending the medical lectures.  He has been very kind in showing us the city.  I find hacks here cost me a great deal.  They charge one dollar per hour for driving.  In Washington my carriage hire amounted to all most as much as my board Bill.
       
       So far my dear Liz I have been delighted with my trip.  I knew so little & had seen so little of the world before compared with other gentlemen.  I have learnt much & acquired much valuable information which I hope will be of service to me in other life.
       
       You must take good care of yourself and children.  Do not whip them.  I believe it is best to let them be unrestrained than to be punishing.  All children are bad & unruly.  Do not let Will study too hard.  I was glad to hear he was head again & hope he will remain there.  I will bring them all a pretty present.  How I do wish to see them& yet we are separated a thousand miles by Rail Road &c.  This is a long distance when I think of it.  Tell Anna she must be a good girl & I like to hear that she cries when my letters are read & hope to see Frank much grown when I return & hope also to see my dear Liz recovered & in good health with blooming cheeks again.  It has been almost a month since your confinement & I hope you are pretty well.  But you must not get well too quick.
       
       I hope the servants are doing well.  If they do not it is best to let them alone & not have any difficulty with them.  In Washington they had white servants entirely.  Here they have black ones.  I get along with the black ones best.
       
       I will write you from New York if I have time.    I hope there to see someone from Greenville.  General Thompson told me to write him when I returned & he might go back with me.  
       
       Give my love to your mother & family & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

New York

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Albany in company with Col. Fair & Mr. Nance.  We will go thence to Niagara Falls, & through Lake Ontario, down the St. Lawrence to Montreal & Quebec, which we expect to perform in six or seven days.  We shall then return through Lake Champlain & Lake George to the Hudson & Saratoga Springs.  There Col. Fair will leave us & return home.  I shall call to see Mr. Van Buren & stop at West Point.  Then go to New Haven, New Port & Boston & return by the way of the Niagara Springs, to Greenville about the middle of August.  Mr. Nance will return with me.  He is a very worthy & clever gentleman & I am much pleased with him as a travelling companion.

	I have been in New York only two days & would leave with regret for the beautiful Hudson had I rece[ive]d a letter from you whilst here, as I hoped & expected to do.  I feel sure you have written, & the letter has been misplaced in some way, which provokes me.  You do not know how dear a letter from home is to one in a strange city.  My heart sank within me when the Bar Keeper informed that there was nothing for me in the Post office.  I made him send again & again.  The same answer was returned.  I console myself with the hope that you & our dear little children are all well.  I do not think that I shall ever wish to leave home again to travel.  I am not sorry however that I am making this tour.  It was�to me never to have been to the north.  But I shall be satisfied when I return to my home & to my wife & children.

	I wrote you from Philadelphia which letter I suppose you have rece[ive]d.  We had a pleasant trip to New York passing through a beautiful country, the heart of New Jersey in a high state of�, adorned with many pretty little villages & towns�Princeton, Newark, Burlington, Jersey City, Elizabeth Town, Amboy &c.  We stopped at the Astor House & find it a most magnificent Hotel well kept.  I rather think the best table I was ever at.  But the company is inferior�merchants & merchants clerks & travelling yonkes & manufacturers--very much like the company I found at the Charleston Hotel.  At table we have soup which is one course�then fish�then all sorts of meats & vegetables, oyster pies &c.  Then all sorts of pastry, strawberry pies, puddings &c &c.  Then the clothes are removed & we have pine apples & all sorts of fruits, & lastly ice cream.  If I can get one I will send you a Bill of Fare.  The servants are all white & very attentive.  I now see so few negroes that when I meet one it seems to me I have found an acquaintance, & feel glad to see him.  I feel as if he was my countryman & fellow creature, & not the white man.  Today we wished a carriage to drive to the Croton water works & I selected a black driver instead of the many white ones standing by.  I think cuffee was made for a servant & he does pretty well in his post.  In every room of this Hotel there is a bible placed on the table.

	I called to see Hastie today.  He was out.  I left Nichols letter & my card.     The weather is quite cold but today has been very pleasant.  I have rode through�saw the museum & there met two mammouths [word obscured]seemed ten years old weighing five hundred pounds.  They look like fat hogs.  As I return & shall endeavour  to see more of this great democratic &�city.  The streets are crowded from morning till twelve oclock at night so much so that it is difficult to walk them.  I went to Trinity church Sunday evening, but the�& aisles were all full.  I stood up amidst the crowd till the organ stopped�.It is the largest & richest church in America I expect.

	You must write me to Boston as soon as you receive this letter.  I shall be constantly travelling now for a week & you may not hear from me in that time.    Accept my love for you & the children and remember me to your mother & family.  I must now back up.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I cannot resist the temptation which a few leisure moments afford me of writing to you.  I have nothing to write and yet it gives me pleasure to say so, and I know you will take pleasure in reading such a communication from me in a far distant land.  I wish I could only receive a similar communication from you tonight.  But that pleasure will be denied me until my return to New York & next to Boston.

	I wrote you on leaving New York.  I will now bring my journey up to this time.  Tuesday morning we got on board the steamboat for Albany.    From the time we started until we reached this city the scenery on the Hudson was a continual picture.  To me it was an enchanted view the whole way.  I did not know before that a landscape could be so beautiful.  It is worth travelling a thousand miles to see the beautiful river the high & precipitous banks, rugged cliffs, splendid mansions, lovely Farms, fertile & highly cultivated & improved, the flocks of cattle &c all �admiration & wonder.  The Boat was crowded with men, women & children�several hundred.  I took my seat in the extreme part of the forward deck & continued to gaze on the bewildering scenery.  Col. Fair & Mr. Nance joined me and Mr. Hobby assistant Post Master General united himself to us.  He was familiar with every spot & could point out every house & cliff & village.  He was born on the banks of the Hudson.  I found him a most intelligent & agreeable gentleman�very much like Mr. Calhoun in appearance & talks like him.   I never saw a prettier place than Newburgh a town on the Hudson.  The Catskill mountains looked to me very much like the Saluda mountains.

	We reached the city at five oclock.  The British Legation, Mr. Cronston, was on board, a very plain looking gentleman.  Albany is a beautiful Town, built on the side of a hill & on top of the Hill.  �every rain washes the paved streets clean.  The convention of New York is now in session at this place.  We went last evening to visit the capitol & were very politely shown over the House by one of the members, Mr. Townsend.  In the morning I found that Mr. Conbreliry & Mr. Kemble were members of the convention & boarding at the House we stopped at.  I sent them Mr. Poinsetts letters & they were very civil to me.  Mr. Kemble is one of the most accomplished gentlemen I have met with, an old Bachelor & as I was told in Washington the �Siamese friend� of Mr. Poinsett.  I have had a great deal of conversation with him.  Governor Wright is not at home today.    My letter to him I will keep till I return.    Mr. Conbreliry is a very plain sensible gentleman, but not remarkable for anything except his good sense.

	We start in the morning for Niagara Falls.  It is now raining very hard & I am afraid it may rain tomorrow.  The next letter I write you will be posted in her Majesty�s dominions & in it you may expect a description of Niagara & the lakes.

	Tell Will I will bring him a nice suit of clothes from Canada.  Tell Anna & Frank I will bring them something pretty.  And I must get a present for you from Queen Victorias�

	My dear wife good night &c.  All of my letters are written in great haste as I have not time to travel, look, write & sleep all at the same time.  It seems to me.  I have been in one continual hurry from the time I started.  Travelling is not pleasant, except that you see so much.  Remember me to your mother, Susan, McBee & Anne.  Good night, your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here last night.  Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter which you will read & send over to Col. Townes.  It will give you some idea of where I have been & I have not time to rewrite it for you.  I shall leave here this evening for Troy, Albany�Springfield, New Haven, Boston &c.  I shall not get your letters until my return to New York.  It seems to me that I have been almost to the end of the World & am happy that my face is now homeward.  You may well imagine my impatience to return to my wife & children.  I am heartily tired of travelling & will never care to go from home again.  

	In Montreal I purchased three beautiful dresses for you�one of silk�one of a new sort of goods not yet reached the U. States & the other of a most lovely pattern�silk & wollen.  I have purchased Anna two beautiful dresses & perhaps enough for three or four.  I have purchased Will & Frank a suit each.  I have also purchased for you a great many Indian curiosities which are beautiful toys, pin cushions &c.  And also a rarity from the Grey Nuns.  I have bought for myself some fine clothes�all very cheap.    Your dresses are new & lovely.

	How glad I would be to hear from you, but I flatter myself that you are perfectly well & the children are all well.  It is (sic) has been more than a month since your confinement & I hope the bloom is restored to your cheeks.  This is the very first opportunity I have had to write you since my letter from Albany.  

	Last night I met here some very pleasant ladies from South Carolina who seemed glad to see me because I was from their own state�a Miss Nelson from Statesburgh who knows the Bradys & says one of them is to be married to Richard Harrison in a very short time.  She is a young girl about 18, and I have walked with her all over the grounds to the springs &c.  Miss Yates is here & has taken possession of Col. Fair.  There is a Miss Taylor here from South Carolina, granddaughter of Governor Taylor & a pleasant girl.  Mr. Seabrook & his bride Miss B� are here who seem pleasant & glad to see us.  There are at this House about 500 persons�some thousands at the other Houses.  The world seems very congregated here.

	In some of my former letters I spoke of the heat breaking out over my body.  The skin is now all peeling off and my hands look bad but are now pretty well peeled over.  I shall have a new & fresh skin on my return.  Yesterday I was bilious.  There was one effort of nature to relieve�  I feel much better today.

	I shall part company with Col. Fair & Nance at Troy & I regret it, but they will not wait on me.  I must see Governor Wright & Mr. Van Buren before I return.  When I shall reach home I do not really know.  I wish to spend a day or two in Boston and a day at New Haven.  I may stoop a day in Washington & a day at the Virginia Springs.  

	God bless you my dear wife & children.  Kiss the children for me and give my love to your mother & family and remember me to all my friends in Greenville.  I shall have a great deal to tell you on my return�enough to keep us talking for a long time.  Your husband, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter to read & hand to Col. Townes.  I have nothing to add to it.  I wrote it because I had a few leisure moments.  

	I was very much gratified with my visit to Mr. Van Buren & spent the evening most pleasantly.    When you see Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett say to them that Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Gilpin & Lady & Mr. John Van Buren & Mrs. Van Buren all desired to be remembered to them & spoke of them in the most affectionate terms�said they were in hopes to have seen them here this summer. 

	By waiting to see Mr. Van Buren I have lost two days & I assure [you] I hesitated whether to do so or not.  I thought however that you would desire it, & that you would be willing to postpone the pleasure of seeing your husband that length of time for him to make the acquaintance of the ex President.  I was pleased with Governor Wright, but had only a few moments to stay before the cars left.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone.  They are to meet me at New Haven tomorrow night.  They will be returning from Boston & I shall be going on.  My impatience to return home is now so great that I shall not enjoy what I see as I otherwise might.  

	 I will write you from New Haven if I have time.

	I must now close my letter & start to the Rail Road.  God bless you & the dear little children & God only knows how much I wish to see you all again.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

4 August 1846
New Haven

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this lovely Town yesterday evening in time to take a walk around the College Buildings, the State House & churches.  This morning I procured a large open Barouche, & I drove all through the streets & around the suburbs.  Oh my dear wife how happy I should have been to have had you seated by my side pointing out the streets & Houses as you saw & recognized them.  The house in which you mother lived�the church which you attended�the school where you went with books & slate every morning like a sweet little girl of ten or twelve�sometimes trudging through the snow & meeting the cold winds.  I need not say to you that New Haven is dear to me from these associations, & if it were an ugly place, still I should love it, as the town in which my dear wife was educated & spent some of her most pleasant days.  But it is the prettiest town I have yet seen.  I was told by a young Englishman, with whom I travelled in Canada, that New Haven was the prettiest town in America.  I now heartily agree with him.  But it is twice as large as when your mother resided here.  And yet every house is built in the finest style & with great taste.

	After I had rode over the Town, I drove to Col. Moslys to deliver your mothers letter.  He was not at home, & would not return for several days.  So I shall not have the pleasure of seeing your old friend.  I left the letter and my card & drove to Governor Edwards.  He was at home & as soon as he broke open your mothers letter came into the room.  I found him very pleasant and agreeable.  He made a great many enquiries about your mother & her family.  After a short call she desired him to introduce me to Professor Silliman & President Day & show me your sisters grave.  He stopped at Mrs. Ingersolls to enquire the spot.  We went into the cemetery & readily found the place beside the grave of a Daughter of Mrs. Shubricks, & shaded by a small tree planted some years since.  I need not say to you that I shed many tears over the grave of [my] wifes sister as I looked over it.  My weakness was seen & noticed by Mr. Edwards.

	We found Professor Silliman at home & I was much pleased with him, his conversation & his appearance.  He is really a fine looking gentleman & much younger than I expected to see him.  He begged to be remembered to your mother & to you�said he remembered all of you with great interest & thanked me for calling to see him & regretted my stay was so short.  We found President Day engaged with the Board of Trustees.  He came to the door of the college & expressed great pleasure at seeing the son in law of Mrs. McCall�enquired most affectionately after you & your mother & invited me to take tea with him this evening at half past six.  He said Mrs. Day would be glad to see me & enquire about Mrs. McCall.  Mr. Edwards asked me to walk round this evening & see his daughter, the only member of his family living with him.  But I am afraid I shall not be able to do so.  We rode by the brick House in which your mother lived near the college.  I looked at it with great interest & pictured to myself three little girls, blooming with health, beauty & loveliness & playing & running over the House, & that one of them was now my wife�the mother of three sweet, lovely children!  What a change a few years make in the condition of a little girl!

	I cannot get from here to New London except by riding twelve hours in the stage.  I will return to Springfield & from there to Boston.  I will pass through New London or New Port on my return to New York.  Say to Mrs. Butler I came here on purpose to go by Mrs. Rodgers to Boston but am disappointed.  I hope however to have the pleasure of seeing some of her relations on my return.

	I hope to hear from you in Boston & also on my return to New York.  I must close [and] shall not write you again for several days.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family & remember me to all my friends.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

6 August 1846
Boston

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday to dinner and received two letters from you.  I cannot tell you how happy these letters made [me].  It had been so long since I had heard from you, , & I had travelled so many thousand miles, that it really seemed to me that I was lost & forgotten.  I was opposed to & that some of you might not be well.  If I had consulted my feelings I should have started home from New Haven without visiting Boston.  But I am now better satisfied, & will remain here a day or two.  Your first letter was advertised & I did not receive it till I applied for advertised letters.

	  I immediately on receiving your first letter I made a memoranda of the articles you wish me to purchase & which I will get as long as my money holds out.  I purchased last evening a beautiful shawl such as you described white with lilac stripes for $3.50.  The price was $4.00.  It is a beautiful thing & far prettier than anything of the kind sold in Greenville.  Your dresses in Canada were about $9.00 a piece.  The dresses for you & the children were $35.00.  My cloth clothes dress coat & pantaloons & travelling sack were $52.00.  My clothes in Washington & shirts in New York $60--Carriage hire has been a large item.  I paid one day in New Haven$3.25cts for the hire of a carriage to ride over the city & to visit with Governor Edwards.  They charge $1.00 an hour!  I mention these things to show you the state of my finances & if I should to buy you a musical box & something else, you must know it is not because I would willingly deny the least request you can make.  It has been my great pleasure since our married life commenced to love you & make you happy in everything and the only pain I have ever experienced has been on account of my�knowing that I was not able to live as I desired & you deserved to live.  But I think our condition has greatly improved since our marriage�that we are much better off than we were then.

	I have now $140 in my pocket which I hope will be enough to carry me home & get all you desire.  If I could return directly by the way of Charleston it would save time & money but on account of sickness I had better return through Virginia.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone home.  They did not pass through New Haven & I saw nothing more of them.  I found on my arrival at the Tremont House a letter from Col. Fair explaining why he did not meet me as he promised.  Just as I was getting into the cars at New Haven I met Mr. Latta of South Carolina going to Boston & will make the same stay that I do & return to New York with me.  He is an old gentleman of great wealth & has a son & two daughters at school in New Haven.  He was on board the vessel with your father & mother when he died, desires to be remembered to your mother about whom he made many enquiries.  I find him a pleasant old gentleman being from South Carolina we have attached ourselves to each other.

	The weather is extremely hot & last night I was so much fatigued that I had a dreadful headache.  I was afraid I was going to have a bilious attack & hunted for Dr. Crooks pills, but they are lost.  This morning I feel much better.  But the weather is so hot there is no moving about.

	Tell Mrs. Butler I will certainly see her sister.  But I shall not be able to visit New Port.  I will return through New London to New York, there stay a day & go home as fast as I can.  I should like to call & see your uncle McCall, but am afraid I shall not be able to do so.

	Tell Susan that the coral beads must be a present from me & not you.  I claim the honour of making the young stranger the present.

        Tell Will, Anna & Frank that their commands shall all be obliged & they must be good children, mindful what you say & not [be] cross [with] each other.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter for Col. Townes.  I shall leave in the morning for New London & do not know when I shall have time to write you again.

	I have purchased for you a most magnificent Bracelet $11.50 & two gold pins $3.00.  I have had made for you the prettiest thing in the shape of a French cap your eyes ever beheld $5.00.  How I shall carry it without washing is the difficulty.  I have purchased a beautiful set of coral for Susan�s first born $4.50.  I have purchased a suit for Will & Frank of cloth at $17.00.  They are very handsomely made.  My funds are getting low & I must now stop.  I will make your mother a present of Mas[s]il[l]ons sermons which I now have & don�t care for.  My trunk is full & I can get nothing in it.  You see I have grattified your every wish.  I felt it doubly my duty to Susan as I had been off enjoying my travels & spending money whilst you were at home.  I wish you had been with me & yet I know you would not have found it pleasant.  

	I must now pack up and be ready to start soon in the morning.

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am happy to be this far on my return home to you & the children and am very much tempted to go on by Charleston.  Judge Butler & many others are going that way.  But I do not consider it entirely safe and if I returned through Columbia I should have to stay there at the Court of Appeals.

	The morning I left Boston I recd your last letter & on my return to New York I found two more only.  The two first you wrote me are last in some way.  I was delighted to receive all your letters & read them on in the cars as I came on.

	When you see Mrs. Butler tell her I was most pleased with Mrs. Rodgers and her family.  If Miss Rodgers wardrobe had been completed she would have come on with me.  Her mother says she is insane on the subject of her visit to South Carolina.  She will remain twelve months with Mrs. Butler & will come on in September.  She is about the size & age of Behethlen Butler & seems quite a pleasant girl.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Rodgers, who must have been a very handsome woman when young.  He sons seem clever.  One is in the navy & the other in the army & gone to Mexico in September.  There was a little chap about thirteen or fourteen who was standing with a string of crabs in his hand looking at me.  His brother called him & said to him you have let that gentleman [page torn, word illegible] you with your crabs & he is a relation of ours.  �Well� said the little fellow �I saw him when he got out of the Boat & I saw then he was one of our kin.�

	I have just had a visit from James mother & brother.  She is quite a good looking woman about the colour of James and seems sweet & sensible.  James must take his bad qualities from his father, who ran away to a free state as his mother tells me.  She gave me a letter, a brush & 25 cts to give James.  The Brother of James looks lazy too & is the son of a white man as he is nearly white.

	I did not see General Thompson on my return to Washington.  He will leave there in four or five days with Governor Butler by the way of the Virginia Springs.

	Miss Rodgers informed me that Miss Thompson & Mr. Jones were engaged & Miss Crayton & Mr. Rowland,  I told her this was news to me.

	Governor Butler looks to be in very bad health, a mere wreck of himself.  His difficulty with Mason is unsettled and I did not learn the particulars.  

	I must now conclude as I must pack up & get breakfast in time for the cars.  I hope to be at home in the course of ten days, or perhaps sooner & do not know the stage rout[e] &c. & cannot speak with certainty.  

	Kiss the children for me & remember me to mother & family & all friends.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Butler Thompson who starts this morning.  He told me that his mother said he must come back BY Thursday.  I suppose from that you will be invited to the wedding.  If so I hope you will go.  I trust that Frank is better and that neither of the other children has taken the scarlet fever.  If you can write me by Thursdays mail though I do not know whether I shall hardly be detained here so long.

	We have very little business in court & as soon as I can get through I [page torn] to Pendleton & perhaps [page torn; final line on the sheet] my mothers at place.  You must write me to Pickens by someone who is going.

	I have been talking to Cureton a negro trader about purchasing my negroes.  He intimated that he would give me my prices at Greenville Court $500 for Mario--$550 for Janus--$600 for Mor�.  But Mor�I do not care to sell�nor do I like to sell Mario to a trader to be carried off.

	Your mother sent for me to stop as I passed on Sunday.  She has a notion of building a little house for Anne.  I told her it would cost $500 and then she would find it useless�that Anne would not stay in it & accept�  She asked me what she should do, & I told her to do as she had been doing all along.  I find they are disposed to worry themselves [page torn; final line on the sheet] But I was a kind as I could be [sheet stained] believe I gave them some [sheet stained]

	My dear Liz our happiness in this life is very much in our own hands.  If we strive in the right way to be happy, we will be.  We must exercise Christian philosophy & bear up with the ills�look to the comforts we have & not pine after those we cannot get.  My rule through life has been to make the most of my situation & look on the bright side of the picture�never work myself over that which cannot be altered or has passed by�do my duty to the best of my ability & care little as to consequences.  And I flatter myself that I have been blessed through life�blessed with prosperity, blessed with the comforts of life, & the good opinion of my acquaintances�blessed with a good wife & pretty children to whom I look for all my future happiness & to promote whose happiness I live & am happy.

My dear Liz

	Mr. Spears will return to Greenville in the morning and I cannot forego the opportunity of writing you a few lines.

	I hope to hear from you & how the children are by the stage tomorrow.  I have been detained here longer than I expected and the probability is that I shall not get off till the end of the week.  I have a case of great importance which is at the foot of the docket.  I have been trying to compromise it, but have not yet succeeded.

	I had a settlement with my client Mattison�took his note for $200.  He is very good but I should like the money instead of it.  I shall get another note for $50 so the�is not entirely valueless.  

	I have not yet sent your prescription & box to Mr. Sharpe but will do so if I do not carry it myself.  I have not seen Mr. Sharpe since I have been here.  

	General [Joseph Newton] Whitner told me today that Mrs. Whitner had sent to invite me there yesterday evening but the messenger could not find me and that she was scolding him for not bringing me.  They are kind & hospitable.

	I hope you & your household are doing well.  I am very anxious about the children but hope for the best.  You must write me a letter by Mr. Spears to Pickens.  Send it to Mrs. Rowlands early Sunday morning.  And let me have all the news.  How you & the children are.  How your mother & family are�the servants &c.  You can also give me an account of the wedding.  I understand the whole world is invited.  

	I am very much afraid I shall not be able to go by my Fathers old place.  I am certain that I shall not get there Friday night. But perhaps I can see them at Pickens & it will do as well.

	We shall have a great deal of business at Pickens & I may not be at home till the last of the week or Sunday.

	The rail road is quite popular here & in Abbeville.  It is said Abbeville will subscribe $500,000.  I begin to think the road must go that way.

	Kiss the children & tell Frank I will let him ride Skylark when I come home.  Tell Will he must keep heart & tell Anna she must be a good girl & begin to learn her letters.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line by Col. Townes, thanking you for your letter by Mr. Elford.  I was indeed glad to hear you were all well & doing well.  

	I do not know when I shall return�perhaps not before the last of the week.  I was disappointed in going to Josiahs as it rained all day Saturday, & I was detained at old Pendleton.  I have not yet seen Josiah or Foster.  They will be here today.

	In the evening of Saturday Mr. Sharpe called to see me & thanked me for the pincushion & invited me to his house.  But I did not go.  The weather was bad & the invitation rather a cold one & I thought should have been given in the morning instead of the evening�having been there all day.  Sharpe was dressed up & looked quite spruce & seemed quite pert�important in his own estimation�had a good deal to say about his farm &c.

	I came to the place Sunday morning & escaped the rain but have a bad cold.  I find very little business here.  General Thompson says if he practices law he will go to Charleston.

	In great haste you must remember me to the children & kiss them.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	Your letter was rece[ive]d last night & although a short one I was exceedingly glad to hear from you.  I am gratified to hear that you are pleasantly situated at you Aunts, but you did not mention any thing about the children.  Always tell me how they are & what they are doing.

	I would have written to you last evening but had no an opportunity of doing so before the mail closed.  I wrote a very good letter for the Mountaineer as you requested and gave an account of our Rail Road meeting in Charleston &c &c.

	We met with a considerable accident on Sunday coming to Columbia.  There were three cars filled with members of the Legislature.  I happened to be in the first one.  The car behind ran off & broke the axle tree, pulled off the middle one & twisted the one in front considerably.  Finally the hind most car broke loose & was left behind.  The Engine was stopped, & the second car after great difficulty was extricated from the train.  Fortunately no one was hurt.  All the members had to get into one car & stand up till they reached Columbia, a distance of thirty miles.  The other two cars were badly broken & left behind.  It was too late in the night when we arrived in Columbia.  The cause of the accident was the weakness of the hinder most car.

	I found all of our Greenville members in Columbia & at Gladdens.  They brought no news from Greenville.  Col. Townes brought my drawers & said he had seen Edward & Charles.  Col. T.P. Butler is here but returns home to muster his company.  He says he will go to Mexico if his company accepts the terms, which I am inclined to think they will not.  Major E.D. Earle is here in good spirits & so is Reed.  The candidates for the different offices are without number�thirty-two for messenger, ten or fifteen for Secretary of State & as many for the Superin[tendent of] Public Works.  

	I saw Mr. Gilmore Simms & had a long talk with him about his criticism of Pamelas book.  He has written an answer to John Cunningham which he presumes will pacify.  He said he had no idea that the article was written by a lady.

	Mr. Boyce came to me on Monday& saw that some of the Senators had been trying to get Col. Patterson not [to] run for President of the Senate again & if he had consented they intended to elect me.  But that Patterson seemed so anxious about it they did not like to say more to him on the subject.  How would you like to have heard of my election as President of the Senate without, in fact, my knowledge of what was going on?  I have been asked repeatedly since my arrival here if I had no aspiration to the Chancery Bench.

	The prospect of our rail road is brightening.  Col. Memminger called to see me yesterday evening & we were engaged some time in consultation on the subject.  He takes a deep interest in it.  We have another meeting this evening.  

	B[enjamin] C[udworth] Yancey has his bride with him at Hunts.  I am going over this evening to see her.  Ben looks well but I saw a tear in his eye when I spoke of his marriage�fact is it was in remembrance of his first wife.  It seems disrespectful to the reported companion to take on other scenes like being�or forsaking the memory of her.  Kiss the children for me & give my respects to your  aunts & kin.

My dear Liz

	Your second letter was rece[ive]d last night & gave me great pleasure to hear from you.  But I was surprised you had not heard from me.  My letter was certainly in the Post office when you wrote.  You must not wait for me to write you in answer.  This you know I would do most cheerfully if I had time.  But really between the Legislature, the courts, & calls of company I have not a moment to spare.   I have been wishing to go to the theatre & to see The Painting again, but have not time.  The night you declined the Miss Elliotts invitation I had to walk a half mile down to the College in the night & back after ten oclock.  The wind was terribly cold.  The Board of trustees meet again Monday night.

	You seem to think you will be short of money.  You know, my dear Liz, I will get you more if you desire it.  Make yourself easy on that score & if you see anything you desire, purchase it, & write me & I will send you the money.  It gives me great pleasure always to gratify the wishes of my wife in every particular.  I know how pleasant it to purchase little things which we fancy.

	There is one thing which I wish you to do for me and you must do this.  As you pass through Columbia you must let Clark Mills take your bust.  It will look handsome & be much better than a portrait.  I have had mine taken.  He came to me room�took a brush & put on my face a sort of paste which dried in a few minutes& fell off as complete mould for a likeness.  The is not disagreeable.  He says I will see the finest likeness I ever saw.  I saw Mrs. David J. McCords.  It is very fine & looks well.  The price is $25 & $35.  You may have copies for $5.00 or $7.50.  The busts of Judge Johnson  & Elmore are admirable�also of Petigru. Preston, Judge Cheves & Hampton.

	I have paid Mr. Carter $200 for my book bill.  �also paid over the money recd of Butler Thompson.  Whilst I was sitting for my bust Dr. Teague came in & paid me $50 in part towards a counsel  fee.  I thought the visit very opportune.

	General Thompson & the Greenville delegates think I can be elected Chancellor but I do not.  Col. Ashe said he would vote for me in preference to any of the candidates.  Col Fair has suggested me for President of the Bank in place of [Franklin Harper] Elmore who will be elected U. States Senator.  But I have suggested Judge O�Neall.  If he is elected, I do not know but that I may be a candidate for the Bench.  I am really gratified at the estimation in which I seem to be held by the Legislature.  Dr. [Thomas Jefferson] Goodw[y]n told me the other day that he was very anxious to see me President of the Senate.    He is Senator from St. Mathew.

	You must write me often & all about the children, yourself & aunts.  Col. Martin asked me this morning how often you wrote me.  He said his wife wrote every other day & he did the same.  You must write me when you expect to come up, or what your arrangements are as soon as you determine.

	I have not yet been too pay Mrs. Yancey a visit.  We have a rail road meeting in Columbia tomorrow evening.  We are all to make speeches.  Col. Summer will publish my speech in the Carolinian next week.

	I have engaged with the editor of the Southern Review to write an article on ��Life� and embody the revolutionary history of the upper country.

	I must now go to the committee room.  Tell Will he must be a good boy.  His papa was never so bad (though I was a bad boy at his age).  Tell Anna she must be the young lady.  And Frank a little man.  Kiss them.  My love to your aunts.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed last night on returning from the Rail Road meeting & not finding a letter from you.  My first letter to you remains unanswered & I hope however that you & the children are all well & that I shall certainly hear from you this evening.

	I am so busy that I have no leisure on Sunday eve.  The whole of today I have spent in drawing a rail road charter for Greenville.  Last night I made a speech an hour long on the rail road to a town meeting in the place.  General Thompson is to speak Monday night.  Then I have to meet the Board of Trustees, & check a Professor of Roman literature.

	Yesterday I attended a lecture of Dr. Ellets before the Trustees on green cotton.  He loaded a pistol with this cotton, & I shot it three or four times.  The cotton is better than powder & will supersede it in all probability.

	Tomorrow my resolution giving the election of electors to the people [will] come up for discussion.  We shall begin this week to have meetings of interest before our Honourable Body.  I wish you were here to witness them.  You must let me know as soon as you determine what you are going to do, whether remain in Charleston or come to Columbia.  General Thompson says Mrs. Thompson is to be here this week.  Jones & Eliza have gone home from Edgefield.  

	Clark Mills is making progress with my Bust.  At present it is an ugly affair.  I desire very much to have yours taken.  I am sure it will make a handsome one.  And whenever an opportunity offers I wish to  have your portrait taken.

	How I should like now to see you & the children�in on you & see how you are�I hope the children are behaving better.  But really no children [always] behave well & should never be taken from home.  The next time we visit Charleston we will leave them behind.  I must now go to dinner & will keep my letter open till night.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Saturday morning and thank you for it.  I was afraid you were unwell or something was the matter with the children.  z\I have written you twice & hope you have re[ceive]d the second letter.

	I shall be glad to see you whenever you feel disposed to come up and if possible will supply you with all the money you wish.  I know how pleasant it is to spend when abroad & how much we are tempted by pretty things.  I only regret I had not a fortune to place at your command.    But we have done pretty well.  If you stand in need of funds write me�

	
I have just re[ceive]d a Greenville Mountaineer with my letter in it & one from Col. Townes.

	Mr. Elmore will not be a candidate for the Senate.  Judge Butler will be a candidate.  Col. Davie, Barnwell Rhett, Pickens, Judge O�Neall, Governor Hammond &c.

My dear Liz

	I rec[eive]d your letter tonight & herewith enclose you $25.00 which I hope you will receive safely and that it may be as much as you will need.  I do not think you will save much by remaining in Charleston as there are so many pretty things to tempt you.  The next week is the gay & fashionable week in Columbia.  The commencement in the college is on Monday�the Ball that evening.  The inauguration of the governor elect will take place Wednesday.  He will no doubt give a party.  I went round to Dr. Roachs this evening to see General Thompson.  He & Mrs. Thompson will stay there�also Mrs. Walker & Jane.  Mrs. Roach told me that she could furnish me with a fine room the first of next week.  You can stay there or at Clarks Hotel.  He has room plenty and I desire you to stay in Columbia a few days & see the Town.

       I went to the Fair tonight & saw an immense concourse of ladies & gentlemen.  Coil. Hampton & his family were there selling all sorts of pretty things & eatibles.  There were some twenty or thirty different establishments belonging to different persons.  I bought a pen of Miss Yates for 50cts.  At another table Mr. Griffin bought a couple & paid $1.00!  The difference in price, & in persons too.  The fair was a most magnificent collection.  Col. Martin had bought some little matter to send in a letter.
       
       Governor Aiken & Lady paid us a visit this morning in the Senate Chamber.  He introduced me to her & I took a seat by her & conversed with her for some time.  Their little daughter was with them.  How immensely rich she will be.   I saw Mrs. Yancey at the Fair.  She is not pretty, nor very young, nor very pleasant looking, but immensely rich which�a multitude of faults.  However she seemed very�
       
       I hope you see the Charleston Courier which contains an account of our legislative proceedings.  I made a speech on the Electoral question Tuesday about an hour long.  Col. [George Washington] Dargan replies to me & I shall reply to him.
       
       You must write me as soon as you determine to come.  If you could come up on Sunday next you might be at the college commencement.  If on Tuesday you can be at the inauguration on Wednesday.  But you consult with your own convenience.  Take special care of the children on the rail road.  Perhaps one of your cousins may come up with you�.Arthur or Col. Hayne.  It would be well to have some friend to come with you.  If you desire it, you may stay until after the adjournment of the Legislature & I will come down for you & then I am sure you & the children will be safe under my charge.  But be careful & do as you like best.  It gives me great pleasure to gratify your every wish when I can do so.  My happiness in life is to make others happy.  I live for them.  Good night, kiss the children.  If Will comes up I should like to keep him until I go home.  Remember me to your Aunts.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

General Thompson & Col. Herndon had a fight yesterday in Gladdens Hotel.  But through Chancellor Johnson & myself they have made friends.  Col. Herndon said at the supper table that the General was broke.  Erwin Jones went & told Thompson.  He met Herndon told he lied & struck him in the mouth & thereupon a scuffler ensued.  Duncan ran for me but it was over�neither hurt. They shook hands today & made friends very cordial[l]y.

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed in not receiving an answer to my letter enclosing you $25.00.  I hope it is not lost.  I received a letter from you night before last.  I have been so much engaged that I have not had time to write you as often as I wish to do.

	We have had more elections & electioneering than I ever knew before.  After five ballotings Judge Butler has been elected U.S. Senator.  Governor Hammond was ahead of him two ballotings.  Col. Davie was also a candidate.  There was great excitement.  The old rumors against Hammond were brought to bear on him.  I saw a letter from him.  He admitted that he had committed a great indiscretion, denied that there was anything criminal designed by him.  But said that he should not attempt to defend or extenuate his conduct unless the version given by Col. Hampton was grossly incorrect.  I heard that Col. Hampton placed in the hands of Col. [John Algernon Sidney] Ashe a letter of Hammonds confessing & begging.  I know nothing more about the affair.

	The election of Governor will be made Tuesday.  Chancellor Johnson has already resigned.  Two Judges are now to be elected.  My friends have placed my name amongst the chancellor for Chancellor.    But I do not know that I will continue to run.  They think however that my chance is a good one for being elected.  I have no such hope.  General Caldwell, Mr. DeSaussure, F. Wardlaw, Col. Patterson, & Haynesworth are all candidates.  For the Law Judge General Whitner & Col. Dawkins are running.  But for Whitner I would run for a seat on that Bench.  A good many persons have spoken to me about running & have persuaded me that my chance was as good as anyone�s.  But the others have had so long the start of me.

	You had better not come here until the elections are over.  They will probably take place next week.  But you must expect to hear of my [being] beaten.  And as all my friends say, it will do me no harm to run if I am beaten.  I believe to a[ttempt] it is your advice.  

I was at the fair last night & saw Jane Walker.  Mrs. Walker is here & her son.  I wrote you in my last that Mrs. Thompson & Eliza & Jones were here.

	I hope you have seen the Charleston Courier & read the accounts of my speeches.  I am sure you will read them with great pleasure.  

	I saw Mrs. Aiken in the Senate Chamber today.  She has been there every day for the last three or four days.  I find her a very pleasant lady.  Mrs. Yancey was in the Senate Chamber today but I did not have an opportunity of speaking to her.   I met her last night at the Fair again.  She is actually turning gray or it seemed so to me�nothing remarkable about her.  

	I was invited to dine with Mr. DeSaussure today & also with Col. Martin.  But I declined both invitations.

       How are the children?  You must write me several days before hand when you are coming so that I may prepare to receive you.  But you had better not be here during the election if I run for Chancellor.  I will write you again Monday.    In haste yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Col. Martin informing me that Mrs. Rhett has this afternoon lost a little daughter with scarlet fever & that it is prevailing in several families in Columbia.  If the fever still continues you must either remain in Charleston or pass immediately through Columbia.  I will write you again tomorrow evening.  And you must write to me what you determine on.

	The election of Chancellor takes place tomorrow at 1 oclock.  The probability is that no election will be made for the first or second balloting.  I shall be voted for by some, but have no hopes of being elected.  Caldwell & DeSaussure are electioneering hard for it.  I think it unbecoming a gentleman to electioneer for such an office & will not even mention it to a member.  It is not generally known that my name is used as a candidate.  Several gentlemen have told me that they were glad my name was used although they could not vote for me the first ballot�they would the second.  My friends tell me that all the members seem pleased at my nomination & the greater portion would support me but for their pledge to others previously.  In the scramble there is no telling what may happen.  The fact of my permitting my name to be used will do me no harm if I gain nothing by it.  I look upon it as an honor to be taken up under the circumstances & voted for by even a few friends.  But I will write you the result tomorrow night.  The election for Law Judge will not come on for several days.

	I was at the commencement this morning, & a splendid one it was�more company & better performance than I ever witnessed before.  Mrs. Jones was there, also Mrs. Walker & Jane.  

	In regard to servants clothes & everything else do as you think best.  I have confidence in your judgement & prudence my dear wife.  My only anxiety now is about the children.  I have so many reports to write tonight that I must conclude.  Your husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It was�consolation, after being beaten so badly as I was today, to receive your scolding letter.  You have but little philosophy in your composition & ought to thank your stars that you were not born of a different [page torn].  Your letter was so unlike the soothing of a gentle & affectionate wife, that I burnt it immediately for it might hereafter be seen.  So there is an end of it.  Forget that you wrote it, & I will forget the contents.

	Noe for the election.  I would not go to the State house at all this morning.  I never mentioned to anyone that some of my friends were going to vote for others, but all expressed themselves friendly towards myself.  Caldwell recd 36, Wardlaw 30,  DeSaussure 29, Patterson 25,  Haynesworth 19, myself 12, �6, Young 2 &c.  There is no election made.  I presume Caldwell will be elected.

	I care nothing about it.  In fact I had rather stay at the Bar.  But General Thompson & others persuaded me that it would be no injury to me as a candidate.  But I was not a candidate.  My friends only voted for me a few of them.

	I will expect you Saturday evening.  I hope there is no danger of scarlet fever.  No cars arrive now before night, & leave Charleston at 9 oclock in the morning.  I shall be most happy to meet you & the children my dear wife.  After all the only real pleasure in life, is in one�s own family.  
	I saw Mr. Legare this evening, who spoke of you.  Mr. Bull introduced him to me.  I saw Dr. Hayne also this evening.  General Thompson & Mrs. Walker will leave before you arrive.  I will endeavour to get a room at this hotel for you.

	My bust is said to be a fine likeness.  The man who cut my likeness on paper several years since is here now.  He is cutting the whole Legislature.  You & all the children may have your likeness cut.

	There was a great to do here today.  The volunteers arrived here from Chester & paraded through the district.  They will be in Charleston tomorrow.

	I am now engaged in court constantly.  I am glad to hear you are pleased with Charleston & your friends there.

	You must write me again before you come up�let me hear from you Friday night.

	I must now conclude.  Kiss the children for me.  I am very anxious to see the little creatures.  I hope Anna & all of them have improved by their visit to the city.  Tell Will I expect to see him a man in behaviour.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & shall be prepared to meet you at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening. I do not suppose there will be any danger of the children catching scarlet fever.  It will give me great pleasure to meet you all again.  It seems a long time since I saw you.  And I have been in a hurry ever since, not time to do any thing. 	

	I made a speech of one hour length today in the Senate on the Rail Road, which drew a great crowd & was well received.  Tomorrow I speak on the Electoral question which is made the special order at one oclock.  Today I have been in court a good deal.  I wish you were here, to be present when I speak.

	The election of Law Judge will take place tomorrow.  Col. Dawkins, Whitner, & Withers are candidates.  Who will be elected I know not.  General Caldwell was elected Chancellor.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees.  We have elected two Professors�Pelham & Williamson [Mathew Williams].

	I must prepare for my speech in the morning & therefore must conclude,

	Col. Townes is unwell�heard from Greenville.  They are all well there.  Col. Hoke wrote me that my negroes were doing pretty well.  Jim & Minerva had a fuss & he came very near sending both of them to jail.  I rec[eived  a letter from McBee about the rail road.

	I shall expect to see you with great anxiety on Saturday evening.  You must not disap[p]oint me�take care of the children.

	Give my love to your Aunts & thank your Aunt Mrs. Turnbull in my name for her hospitality & kindness to you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	I hope by this hour you are comfortably seated in our Home with the children all around you eating their suppers & the servants coming in to see you.  Today we have had rain & I have thought you all the same.  But you were fortunate to escape so well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip, & that the children gave you no annoyance.  

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Martin who invoked the President of the Senate Col. DeTreville, Moses, Boozer &c.  I like Martin very much.  He said the first thing he thought of when he saw the sun rising Sunday morning, was that you would have a pleasant day.  I do not like Col. Isaac Hayne much.  He seems cold & sly.  Manifests no disposition to become acquainted with me & I have shown none towards him.  He seems not disposed to approach me or to have much to say when I approach him.  I think our dislike is mutual, & likely to continue.

	Dr. Goodwyn told me that Mrs. Goodwyn was coming to our room to tell you goodbye but prudence had you to bed.  She had taken tea out that evening.  Col. Davie spoke of my pretty mountain children whom he had seen running about in the Piaz[z]a.  

	The likeness of the whole family is finished & makes a pretty group as Col. Ashe says.  I have got a gilt frame for it.  You look quite natural.  Your dress & hair are taken very accurately and I thank your�also.  Mine is not so well as the other.  Anna & Frank show rather better than Will.  All look well enough.  Will is standing near me & Anna near you.  Frank between.

	I have to go down in the Senate tonight at seven oclock & will finish my letter after I return.  Col. Town[e]s, Sam Earle & Dr. Earle all go up in the morning.  I will send this letter by Col. Townes,

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just returned from the State House through a terrible rain & deep mud.  This is one of the worst nights I ever saw.  How glad I am that you are not travelling.  

	We have had a great deal of discussion tonight in the Senate & I feel much exhausted.  I claim the credit of having saved many thousand dollars for the State this night.

	I have just heard of a most melancholy death. Mrs. Seabrook, once Miss B� the wife of a member of the Legislature, married last Summer, & I met them at Saratoga Springs, gay & joyous.  He was a very young man & his wife not more than 17 years old.  She died suddenly from mis�.  Her husband went to the rail road tonight & heard of her death.  He fainted & appeared for some time a maniac.  Another member Mr. Barnes of Lancaster lost his wife last week in the same way.

	I must now bid you good night.  I hope to meet you Sunday evening.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours truly, B.F, perry

My dear Liz

I have but a few moments to write you by Mr. Butler.  Last night it was twelve oclock when I got my supper on my return from the State House.  For the last three nights we have not [adjourned] until near eleven oclock.

	I recd your letter last evening& was glad to hear you were all well, & that your party was to take place after my return.  But in postponing it, you may disappoint Mr. McBees family from North Carolina which you ought not to do.

	Edward Rhett took dinner with me the other day & enquired kindly about you & your mother.  He told me some anecdotes about you & Mrs. Potter in New Haven.   He seemed astonished when I told him Susan had been married whilst I was in Columbia.  He said he thought she had returned not to marry.

	I will endeavour to bring the little presents you name but I shall not have time to get them.  Indeed I have no time to do anything�not even to go & see Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin.

	For several days past we have some hard discussion in the Senate in which I have taken a part.  The election of the circuits has taken place again.  Mr. Ward of George Town said to me he wished me to be a Judge�someday & did not�me to have to come to George Town so early as the court now sits.  I was elected a Trustee of the college yesterday.

	I was one of a special committee on the Beaufort College.  Mr. Robert Barnwell sent for me in court to talk about the college & the business before the committee.  I was much pleased with him.  He afterwards appeared before the committee & made a speech and an admirable one it was.

	The governor says he will not make up his decision in Wells case for four or five weeks.

	I shall be at home Wednesday night.  We are all well.  Kiss the children for me.  Your affectionate husband., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It is now near eleven oclock and I have just returned from the Senate.  You must expect only a few lines.  From ten to three I was engaged in court.  From three I have been engaged in the Senate till ten with the exception of time to get dinner.

	I was disappointed last stage by Mr. Earle.  He says he is going in the morning & will carry this letter. Thomas Butler is here also & William Rowland but they will not go till the next stage.

	Your very welcome letter was recd this evening enclosing [not present] Simms note.  I do not wish you to postpone your party on my account.   I had rather you should have it before my return.  But if you see proper to postpone it untill after I reach home it will make no difference with me.  Your letter did not scold me as much as I expected about the purchase of books.  I hope before this time you have sent your fruit.  The grapes are nice and delicious.

	I shall no doubt surprise you when I inform you that I am a candidate.  The joint committee to nominate Trustees of the South Carolina College has put my name down amongst them.  The Legislature has to vote on it tomorrow.  This was done without my knowledge.  It is considered a high honor.  Dr. Gibbs, Col. Goodwin, General Caldwell & Col. McCord have all been electioneering for it the whole session & are disappointed.  They have not been nominated.  Whilst I have been who never thought of it & was greatly surprised when I heard of the nomination.  The Board of Trustees consists of the most distinguished men in the State.

	I have no time to write you about our legislation.  I should be glad to hear Frank talk a little tonight.  OI hope Will has sent his letter.  Tell Anna if I had time I would write her one.

	Mr. Walker has been sick for three days past, but is better.   He came very near going out as Bob Spurgeon did by hard drinking.    Bob says nothing about it.  I have heard nothing positive from the Governor.

	Mr. Earle has been in my room & just left & it is now near twelve oclock in the night & I must bid you good night my dear wife, B.F. Perry
