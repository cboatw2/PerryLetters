	I have tracked Reuben to Columbia & think he went to Augusta with Mrs. Harrisons woman.  I have telegraphed Augusta, Marietta & Wilmington.  I have also advertised here in Columbia Carolinian & the Augusta papers.  I shall catch him.

	We are all well & about setting off for Charleston.  In haste, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a line before going to bed. Anna has gone to bed.  It is now after nine oclock.

	We reached here yesterday evening.  Nikerson seemed very glad to see me & today at dinner s[page torn] me a bottle of old sherry wine.

. 	After breakfast I went to K� & purchased groceries--a barrel of crushed sugar[page torn] ten cents�powdered sugar at 9 cts and for servants at 6 cts.  I thought it just as well to purchase these things as to be sending to the stores in Greenville.  I purchased five boxes of candles.   [Page torn]�was cheaper than tallow�also bought Buckwheat�Brandy, champagne, coffee, tea, soap, prunes, doi[page torn] figs, oisters & pickle beef.

	After returning from K� I paid Reynolds a visit & bought a most beautiful fashionable barouche &�$275.00.  It is just like one purchased by Lowndes whose daughter was married the other day for her.  I am sure you will like it.  It can be made very close or entirely open.  

	Anna went to see her relations this morning & delivered all your letters.  They were all glad to see her.  Your uncle Arthur called to see me but I was out.

	This evening I carried Anna to see Miss [Victoria] Murdens.  We were both pleased.  Tomorrow I will take her & leave her there.  She goes into a room with Miss Cane [Cain?] & Miss Palmer�two Senators daughters whose fathers I know very well.  Miss McLeod is also to be here from Statesburgh who says she went to school with Anna at Greenville.  Her house & everything seemed neat.  Judge Frost told me this morning he would like to pay Anna some attention�that he has two daughters about her age.  

	I will go up to Augusta Saturday & see what has become of Reuben & be at home Tuesday night if possible.  I may have to go on to Mrs. Harrisons at Marietta.  I think he went on with her women.  They can tell me his plans.

	Sam Townes is here in a drinking spree�say nothing about it.  He is bordering on delirium tremors & Dr. Dow� attending him�but don�t mention it.  He will come up with me if he is able to travel.  I have met Hastie & wife here who are both very pleasant.  Some Griffins & others from Newberry came down to go to Miss Boles school.  

	I saw General Martin this morning & must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Anna

	Your letters to your mother have been a source of great satisfaction to all of us.  We all look forward with interest to hearing from you, & feel disap[p]ointed  when we do not every two or three days.  But we know your time is so much taken up with your studies that you cannot write as often as you otherwise would.

	I will endeavour to arrange so that I can go down for you the first of April.  Write when your vacation is.  I wish to be in Charleston at the great Fair on the 11th of April.

	Enclosed I send you five dollars to purchase paper & such things as you desire.

	In all matters I wish you to conform to all the rules & regulations of your school & pursue your studies diligently and be a good girl.  You must remember that at home you have not been under much restraint.  It will be of service to you, in all after life to learn to be systematic in your conduct & business.  It will be of great service too to learn to be governed & restrained & not have your own way.  When you return home your mother will have less trouble in managing you, as you will have become accustomed to be governed.  

	I have directed the Patriot to be sent you regularly & if you do not receive it, the fault is at the Post office in Charleston.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  The Female College here will open shortly & they have a prospect of getting a gentleman highly competent to take charge of the school. 

	We are all pleased with our new carriage driver Wiley, & he is a very good looking & sensible & well disposed servant.    Your mother likes too the Barouche which I purchased in Charleston.  

	Your little acquaintances here are all well, and enquire about you.  They will be glad to see you on your return in April.  How long is your vacation?

	Willie & Frank commence their college studies next week, & I shall be very glad to have them at school once more.  They are running wild.  Willie hauls wood from the farm & Frank stays every night at your aunt Susan�s.  Fanny goes to school.  Hext is playing about the yard & visiting the stables.  Hayne is a prisoner in the house this cold weather.  The little fellow is delighted to go with me over the house.  He is learning to walk & will be able to meet you at the door when you return.  Your  affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [John Pettit]

	I received your letter the other day, and am glad to hear that Mrs. Pettit received regularly the Southern Patriot.  I was very much gratified in my return from the Legislature of the State last winter to learn that you had ordered the Patriot to be sent to her.

	I am publishing this week your very able & most acceptable speech on the Slavery question.  Your views too on the right of the States meet my hearty approval & although I am as you express yourself to be a States rights man.

	I was in hopes to have seen you & Mrs. Pettit in South Carolina this spring.  It would give as great pleasure to meet you & greet you in Greenville.  I forwarded to Mrs. Pettit last winter, a copy of a Poem of some merit, by Col. Grayson entitled The Slave & the hireling.  I hope she received it.  The author was for many years a member of Congress & is one of the faithful Union men in South Carolina amidst all the faithless secessionists.

	Mrs. Perry unites with me in our respects to Mrs. Pettit & yourself & I am truly yours &c., B.F. Perry

My Dear Daughter

	I received your letter containing your roll of merit or standing in your school & was very much gratified with it.  Your progress in your studies & your behavior in school are creditable to you and your teachers.  You have talents & a capacity to study far above ordinary girls and you should endeavour to improve them.  It gratifies your mother & myself so much to hear a good report of you.

	I would write you oftener, but your mother writes so constantly that it is unnecessary.  We were very much alarmed about the fever but hope that at risk is over.

	I will go down for you about the 12th of April if you insist on it.  But your mother thinks you ought to stay till May.  Write me what you wish to do.

	We are very much obliged to all of your relations for their kindness to you & especially to your aunt Mrs. Hayne.  It was good in her to take you out of danger.  We thank her a thousand times for it.  

	We are all well.  Your mother has been busy planting out flowers & gardening�riding our occasionally�once to Pine Mountain last week, where we may one day live.  Willie studies hard & brought home a very high standing in College last week.  He was perfect in his lessons in Latin & Greek.  Frank does not hurt himself studying, but has a respectable position in his class.  He thinks too much of his pigeons�boll &c.  He spends a god deal of his time at your aunt Susans with Vardry & Alexander.
Fannie is now going to the Academies & seems fond of her books.  She & Annie are very much together & has been to visit old Mr. McBee.  Hext is the picture of health & strength, romping & playing all day.  Hayne is lively, walks & tries to talk, has a breaking out on his head which disfigures his appearance, but is going off.  You will be glad to see how much the little fellow has grown.  The servants are all well.  Edward is in Columbia.  Wiley does well.  Lindy is with your grandmother.  Your Pony is so fat & gaity that you will hardly be able to ride him.

	I go in the morning to Anderson Court & will return the latter part of the week.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My Dear Daughter

	I received your letter last night, & we were very glad to hear from you, & to learn that you were well, & enjoying yourself so much at Dr. Caines.  You must give my respects to Dr. Cain & thank him & his family in our name, for all their kindness to you.  You must also invite your little friend Anna Mos� to come & spend some time with you next summer.  I know Dr. Cain very well & served a long time in the Legislature with him & always entertained a very high regard for him.

	I am glad you have an opportunity of seeing the plantations of the lower country, & learning something of the society of the Planters.  You must not stay too long.  It is not healthy for a mountain girl to remain on the plantations late in the Spring.  I shall be in Charleston the first of May.

	When you go back to Town, I had rather you should stay with Miss Murden till I go down for you.  But you can do as you please, & as your mother directs.

	We are all well.  Fanny & Frank are taking lessons in dancing.  Hext & Hayne have grown a great deal.  Willie is making fine progress in his studies, & has the highest standing in his class, although there are some grown men in it.  You Pony is so fat & gaity, that I am afraid you will not be able to ride him when you return home.

	Your little friends here are making a great many inquiries about you, & when you will return home.  The Baptist school is doing very well here one of the best teachers in the Southern States.

	Your mother writes you so often, & tells you so much of the news, that I suppose you are well posted up in regard to Greenville.  I would write you oftener if your mother did not write you so constantly.

	We are all anxious to see you & the servants will give you a warm greeting.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just written a letter to the Southern Patriot in which I described our journey down here & could not repeat it to you.

	It is probable that the Western circuit will be taken up Friday next.  If so I shall have to go down to Charleston next week.

	I have just seen Edward who has been a little sick with cold.  He prefers living in Greenville, & does not like Mr. Antwerp much.   I shall see about it after tomorrow.  He is perfectly well now.  I will write to Anna tomorrow.  Jones went down after Flora & could return the middle of next week.  He completed his trade with Wilson & got the necessary funds.

	I hope Willie has returned safely & that you & all the children are well.

	I went to the college chappel to hear Thornwell this morning & have seen nothing of Col. Taylor & his family.  Dr. Thornwell seemed glad to see me& so did Mr. Brumby who enquired after you.

	I am in a room�Col. Owens of Barnwell.  Col. Watts informs me that Arthur Hayne is sick in Boston & that his wife is still acting as though she has just lost a brother.  The Col. says Arthur will kill himself drinking brandy.  He once travelled with him & said he would drink a tumbler full of brandy & it did not seem to move him.

	The Congaree House is not much improved.

	I will write you after receiving your letter tomorrow evening.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.    I was afraid Willie had met with some accident.

	Edward has been unwell, but is now perfectly well.    He had a cold.  He looks rather thin.  Sunday he did not seem willing to stay with Mr. Antwerp.  But early this morning he came to tell me that if he had to stay in Columbia he would prefer remaining where he was.  I went up & saw Mr. Antwerp this morning.  He praises Edward a good deal for his intelligence & good behavior.  He says he is much better than any of his servants.  He says however, that he did not know much about such work as he is doing.  He proposes to give me one hundred dollars for the �clothe�, pay his taxes & doctors Bills.  He says his clothing costs $50.00, as he clothes his tailor boys�that Edward will be worth fifty dollars more at the end of the year by the instruction &c.  I gave him no overseer. He says in payment Edward may have two weeks to come home & eight or ten days at Christmas.     

	We had no court of Equity today.  Young, Herndon, Dawkins, Boylston, Thompson, Aldrich & a great many other lawyers are here.

	I have bought two white waistcoats for &6.00, one pair of pantaloons�one pair of boots $8.00�Lady [Marguerite] Blessingtons memoirs & the Queens of Scotland.

	I have just been to see Professor McCay about the State House.

	Give my love to all of the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & have just returned from a lecture on young America by a�Methodist Preacher who is chaplain to Congress.  Governor Adams, Col. [Christopher William] Dudl[e]y & Mr. Thompson went with me.  I saw Robert Thurston downstairs & he kindly offered to take up anything for me.  I have time only to write you a line.

	I was pleased with Mr. [William Henry] Millburns lecture.  He has produced quite a sensation in Charleston & Mrs. King has become seriously affected under his peaching says Col. deTreville.  She leads him up to the Pulpit & escorts him all over the city�He taking her arm!  Piety badly lead.

	Today I argued the case of the church in Spartanburgh & commenced Dr. Bivings case, but it will take about all day tomorrow.  I shall get off from here the first of next week.  Governor Adams has given me an invitation to his house, Saturday next.  I am appointed to examine students next Tuesday.  I wrote to Anna this morning.

	I am getting my gold chain mended & borrowed a vest chain to wear.  They are now all the fashion.  I wish one for myself.  Willie may have the one I have been wearing.  Will that do him?  Write me.

	Col. O�Hanlon called to see me yesterday but I was out.  He left word that he would be back in a day or two.  Dr. Lieber called yesterday & I was out.  Dr. Thornwell called this evening, & presented me with a copy of his book on Truth with his presentation on the blank leaf.

	I will write to Dr. Croft & answer the other letters you sent me tomorrow.  I saw Mr. Green today.  He came up from Sumter to see me, & seemed greatly pleased with my settlement with Loring.

	I am writing you with such haste that I hardly know what I write.  Yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I received a letter last night from your mother stating that she had just heard from you, & that you were about settling out for Charleston to the hospitable abode of Dr. Cain.

	I left Greenville Saturday & shall probably get through my business here this week.  You must therefore prepare to return next week.  At present, however, my movements are uncertain, but I hope to get through with my cases this week.  You must write me immediately & let me know when you will be ready to return home.  We shall all be glad to see you in Greenville once more.  I suppose your mother has informed you that we think of sending you to the Limestone Springs this summer.

	Governor Adams is going to give a party at his residence Friday & I suppose I shall be there.  Col. Jones went down for Flora last Sunday & I suppose with return here tomorrow.  A great many of your acquaintances during the session of the Legislature have enquired about you.

	Your mother writes you so often that she leaves nothing for me to say in my letters to you.  Be sure to write me immediately on the receipt of this.  

	Give my love to all your friends & relatives.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

	I could not write you last night, as I had to attend the sitting of the Board of Trustees.  I was engaged all the evening & did not receive your letters till I was just starting to the college.  I finished the case of Dr. Bivings & Leitner yesterday & went to Dr. Blanding.  He has fastened the plate & tooth which gave me so much trouble very well & I can now talk, speak & eat without apprehension of the plate falling out.  In the evening I was with Professor McKay [McCay], Dr. Goodwyn & Col. Beadon  examinisg the plans of the new State House.

	Dr. Theodore Croft will write me to death, but I have promptly attended to all his business & have so written him. I was glad to receive Anna�s letter.  I am fixed here now till next Tuesday & hope to go down for her next Wednesday stay Thursday & be at home Saturday.  I am on the committee to examine students Tuesday.  My Equity hearing is over.  The law business comes up today, but the opposite lawyers are not here.  Last night I was appointed chairman of the committee to which is referred the whole business of the College.  Governor Means & Col. [Franklin J.] Moses are with me.  I shall have the Report to write & submit next Monday night.  Saturday I do down to Governor Adams with Chancellor Wardlaw & others.

	I hope to hear from Anna tonight.  I have just had a call from Col. Fr� who is as warm hearted as ever & sends a great many compliments to you.  I must now conclude & go to Court.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Tomorrow I go down to Governor Adams� & will return Sunday or Monday.  Monday night I finish my college duties & go to Charleston.  I shall have two days to stay there & return home Saturday,

	Edward has just been to see me & seems satisfied.  He will stay till Christmas.  He has permission to come home & stay two weeks in August.  In the fall I will make further arrangements as to his continuance with Antwerp.  

	Mr. Easl[e]y goes up in the morning & I will send my letters by him, perhaps & maybe some books. Last night I went to hear the boys speak in the college with Governor Means & Col. deTreville & staid till eleven oclock.  But I took the precaution to write you in the morning.  So you heard from me.

	I must write to Mr. Elford & to the Patriot & to Anna tonight & it is now nine oclock.  Easl[e]y has just been in my room & I send by him Lady Blessingtons Memoir.

	The Committee to whom were refe[r]rred the various reports on the state of the College submitted to the Board of Trustees have carefully considered the same and respectfully ask leave to Report.

	In considering the documents refer[r]ed to them, your Committee have had reference only to such matters as required the immediate action of the Board.  They can barely allude to the present condition & prosperity of ethe college, the dilligence & progress of the young gentlemen connected with it, their�exceptionable deportment, together with the attention & ability of the Professors, as sources of high congratulation to the Board as well as to the whole State.

	Your Committee concur entirely with the President of the College, in recommending the appointment of a committee whose duty it shall be to visit the Laboratory, Cabinets, Library, observatory and rooms of the college, enquire into its internal affairs and report the same to this Board.  Such committee, would, no doubt by their visits & enquiries, have, in the language of the President �a fine effect upon the officers & students.�

	In obedience to the suggestion of President Thornwell, your Committee recommend the appointment, now, of a Board of Visitors to attend the examination of the Senior Class next fall as is required by the laws of the College.

	They concur with the President in his complimentary notice of the liberal and patriotic action of His Excellency the Governor in assisting with the contingent fund to rebuild the burnt wing of the College, and have no doubt the some will meet the hearty approval of the Legislature.

	In relation to the various matters of expenditures brought to the view of the Board by the President of the College they would recommend, hereafter, a more rigid observance of the rules & laws of the College which require all repairs to be made at the expense of those who occupy the College Buildings, and which forbid all expenditures of money without a previous appropriation by the Board of Trustees.

	They recommend, however, that the following sums be paid when the Treasurer is in funds to meet them.

	One Hundred sixty nine dollars & ninety six cents, expenses incurred in rebuilding the fencing & so forth of Professor Brumby. [this paragraph lined through in Perry�s hand].

	Three Hundred & Forty dollars for the new fence around the Presidents House.

	Three Hundred & five dollars & ninety six cents for the fencing about the new Houses of the Professors.

	Thirty eight dollars and sixteen cents for shingling L� House.

	Eight dollars & sixty two cents for tearing down the college walls.

	For Printing, to pay the present Bill of eighty seven dollars, & for necessary expenses of the examination one Hundred & fifty dollars.

	To pay the postage on the quarterly reports, which the committee recommend instead of monthly reports, fifteen dollars.

	To pay Brittons account for printing Professor McCays Address, Sixty Five dollars.

	To pay Walker & Evans Bill for printing addresses of President Thornwell & Mr. Petigru one hundred & fourteen dollars & fifty cents.

	Your Committee are unwilling in the present embarrassed condition of the funds of the College, to recommend the appropriations for the additional repairs to the lot of Professor Brumby. 

	Nor do they think there is any obligation on the part of the Board of Trustees to pay the expenditures made by Professors Lieber & Brumby in relation to the lightening rods which they have recently had attached to their Houses without the authority of the Board.

	Your Committee have considered the application made by the architect in relation to the fourteen Hundred dollars which he has become responsible for on account of the construction of the College Hall, & a majority of them think that this amount should be deducted from the sum due the contract�when the Hall is finished, if the same can be done without prejudice to the Board or liability on their part. [This paragraph lined through by Perry].

	In relation to obtaining the necessary aid from the Legislature, for rebuilding the burnt wing of the College, your Committee would recommend that the matter to the view of the Legislature by His Excellency the President of the Board in his annual message.  

	All of which is respectfully submitted.  B.F. Perry, Chairman

	I have just returned from Governor Adams & enclose you my account of the visit. 

       I rece[ive]d your letter on my return & hope to hear from you again tonight.	

	I have nothing to write you.  I shall go to Charleston in the morning & stay there Thursday & Friday & be home Saturday.

	I hardly think it is worthwhile for Frank to come & meet us.  It will cost three dollars & he will loose a day from school.  But still if you are disposed to let him come you may.

	I hope you will have all your house arranged by my return.  I can do all the shopping in two days in Charleston.

	Governor Adams has improved his style of living very much.  Mrs. Adams inquired about you & Anna & has promised to send you a basket of strawberries, the largest I ever saw.  Affectionately yours &c, B.F. Perry

	I have just had my supper, written a letter to the Patriot & a long visit from Mr. F�, who desires to be remembered to you kindly & affectionately.

	I have had a long visit too from Dr, Gibbes Editor of the Carolinian & Mr. Miller Editor of the Yorkville Paper.  They all have electioneering schemes.  Dr. Lieber paid me a visit yesterday evening after my arrival.  The election of President of the College comes off this week.  Dr. Laborde met me yesterday & thanked me for my notice of his Book, and invited me to a Literary club which meets at his House Tuesday evening.  He reads an Essay on Woman & then the subject is discussed by all the members & visitors.  Ladies are to be present but not to enter into the discussion till supper.  The society meets every fortnight.

	I have not seen the Governor, nor many members of the Legislature.  There was a great dinner here today in the new dining room & all the Town invited.  We have quite a number of ladies boarding here and amongst them Mrs. DL Fair.  Col. deTreville tried to get a room here for his daughters next week & could not.  I do not know what the young ladies will do at Commencement.  The House is very much enlarged & improved.  Janney has purchased the American after January.

	I did not go to church today.  The weather is bad & the rain is falling.  Col. Brockman & Duncan have gone to a private boarding House.  I met on the cars Mrs. Teter & husband.  She looked rather scared.  Mrs. Mauldin of Anderson was with her.  I saw Mrs. Daniels going north, who enquired after you very kindly & said she remembered Willie as a bright eyed light haired boy.

	I shall expect Willie & Anna Saturday. The servants have put two beds in my room, so that I might have a bed for my little sons to sleep in, (says Sam).  Anna knows the room.

	I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow night or evening.

	I do not think I shall have time to write you tomorrow.  Tell Fannie, Frank & Hext I will bring them a present and kiss dear little Hayne.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening as I was going to meet my committee.  I am surprised you let Hext go to Pendleton; but I am glad he behaved well.

	I asked me to say at which house Miss Susan Hoke shall stay.  I think it probable she would enjoy herself more with the young ladies she goes down with at the American.  I will go there & see her & take care of her.  But we [have] very pleasant company at this Hotel.  You ask me to name the Ladies.  They are changing constantly.  Mrs. D. L. Fair is here & tells me that she will take care of Anna.  There is a Miss Sedgwick a cousin of the authoress here, who sings & plays finely.  Mr. Wheaton whom you saw at Pendleton is here with two daughters who sing & play charmingly.  There is a Bride Mrs. Bail[e]y formerly Miss Bozeman of Charleston.  Dr. Winsmith of Spartanburgh has a daughter & a Miss Mills with him.  Mrs. Col. Herndon came today.  There are a good many others I do not know.  Do not send Frank till I see Col. O�Hanlon again.  Then if he insists on it he may come down.  But I dislike the expence.

	  I have just been in the drawing room & heard some very fine music.  Mr. Birdsall came to my room & invited me to go down & hear the Miss Weatons sing & play.  Tell Anna I have bought her a very beautiful writing desk of�with flowers all over it.  It is a beautiful thing.  Price $15.00.

	I must now close my letter.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have but a few moments to write you.   Last night I was at the meeting of the Board of Trustees till very late.

	I rece[ive]d your short letter last night just before I started to the College & was glad to hear you were all well.  I shall be glad to see Anna & Willie Saturday morning.

	I dined with Governor Adams Tuesday & they were very kind in their enquiries about you & the children.  I went from there to Dr. Labordes & staid till twelve oclock.  We has quite a literary meeting an account of which I have written for the Patriot.  Tonight I am invited to Mr. G.M. Thorp�,but cannot go.

	I saw Mr. Blake yesterday who said he came up as far as Kingsville with Miss [Suzanne Mandeville] Sparks who spoke in terms of great admiration & affection for you & me & sent her best respects to me.  Her father who was with her said if anything was to happen to Mrs. Perry his daughter would try & take her place.  Mr. Blake said he was not willing that Mrs. Perry should yet take her place among the angels in Heaven.  Miss Sparkes will not be in Columbia.  I saw Col. Keitt last night.  He was in Charleston with Miss Sparks.  I saw Col. Wilson with him & it may be true that they will yet get married.    

	I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin.  Their families are all well.

	Last night at the Board of Trustees I made a speech & a warm one in favor of Dr. Lieber as President.  Mr. Barnwell spoke in favor of Professor McCay.  Mr. Petigru spoke in favor of Dr. Lieber, the    
election taking place Wednesday.  It is very doubtful who will be elected.

	I hope Wily & Charles will go on clearing.  I should suppose two or three weeks was long enough for Minerva to stay at Pendleton.  I am glad Stroud sent the corn.

	I must now conclude.as Mr. Bossett is about starting.  Old Mr. McBee is here also.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this morning & also one from Willie & a line from Frank.  After reading your letter I went down to the State House to meet my committee, but the members did not attend & I have returned to write you a letter.

	You must think me very foolish to suppose I am going to interfere in legislating on the subject of temperance.  I have always & uniformly expressed myself decidedly opposed to the Moi� Liquor law.  I Am glad to see the cause of temperance�& am sure it does good.  But I am not for legislating in that way.

	I am sorry Frank will be disappointed in not coming with Willie & Anna, but he may come down if Col. O�Hanlon insists on it when I see him.  I should like to see you all tomorrow.  It is very probable I may come up next Saturday & stay Sunday if we have no pressing business before the House.  Frank may then come down & stay with Col. O�Hanlon till his school commences.  Next session we will engage a family room & parlor or rent a house as General martin does.  

	I saw Col. Preston Brooks today on his way to Washington.  He begged me to write him & said there was not a man in South Carolina whom he regarded higher or whose good opinion he valued more. This was said in front of Taber & he must have heard it.

	By the by General Bonham tells me that young Brooks and Miss Mary Adams are engaged to be married.  He said it was pretty conclusive from what she said to him the evening we dined with the Governor.

	Col. Evans the district attorney has been very cordial to me & speaks with great pleasure of Greenville.  He goes in the morning & will return Monday.

	My commentaries on Boyces speech have been highly complimented by a good many persons.

	You say I must write you every day.  I have scarcely a moment to spare to do anything.  I am so much engaged I have not time to converse with my friends & acquaintances.

	The Judiciary Bill has been under discussion today & will be again tomorrow.  It is expected that I will say something on the subject & I must now close my letter & prepare some notes.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just had dinner & Anna has gone with the Miss Adams to the Presbyterian church.  This morning Sue Hoke & Anna, Willie Gill Watson & myself went to the Episcopal church.  Last night we went to hear General Casey deliver a temperance lecture in the State House.  Afterwards we had dancing & singing till eleven oclock.  There is quite a crowd of ladies here.  Sue & Anna seem yp enjoy themselves very much.  They went to see the girls at the American Hotel after returning from church & paid a pleasant visit.  I gave up my room to them & have taken possession of Col. Irbys room with Willie.  The Col. has gone home & will not return till Tuesday.  In my room there are two beds.  When Irby returns I will have another bed put in the room & stay with him.  But room�was in more demand.  A very large concourse of ladies came down Saturday & are now at this Hotel.

	I was glad to meet Anna & Sue & Willie at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening.  Willie has bought him a�cap.  I am sorry you did not receive my letter Friday night.  There is great carelessness at the Bar in sending off letters.  Wells came up to take my letter & I told him I had mailed it.  I will send this by Wells.  

	I saw Armistead Burt yesterday.  He is at this House.  He came up & took a seat at the table by Anna & told her he saw her when she was a baby that he was one of my oldest friends, but that he was not quite as old as I was.  Anna denied this promptly & said I looked much younger.  He is three years my senior.  He said I did not change at all.  I told him you looked.  I told him you looked about seventeen.  He said it was strong proof that I had made you a good husband.  That case & distress wore out & broke down a wife faster than anything else.  He seems very kind & I have great regard for him.

	I must now close my letter as Mrs. Duncan has come with Mrs. B� �& I must stop & speak to�  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written Sunday & was glad to hear you were all well.

	This was commencement day & the girls have been very much pleased with the show.  Walker Adams & Willie went with them. To the College.  I had to go with the Trustees.  I think both Susan & Anna have enjoyed themselves very much.  We have [a] great crowd of ladies here.

	Tomorrow I will probably make a speech on the Judiciary Bill.

	 You ought to have a letter from me the night Anna left.  

	I have not seen Col. O�Hanlon since I wrote you.  I expect it is better for Frank to stay at Home nor do I suppose [page faded]�my power to return him before the session ends.

	Willie & Anna will go to Charleston Wednesday morning. Col. Dargan had a good deal of chat with Anna in the college.

	Tomorrow night I shall be at the college to elect a President & will not have time to write you so you need not expect a letter.  

	After Anna & Willie have gone I will write you.  

	I must now conclude.  Kiss Fanny & Hext & Hayne for me.  Tell Frank to be a good boy.

	Col. Irby has come back & I shall sleep with him, & Willie with Mr. McBee till Anna & Susan leave here.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tell Mr. Elford to send the Patriot to Mr. Whal[e]y of Charleston [page faded]�he subscribed on seeing it.  Dr. M�did the same but I have�about Whal[e]y.

	I have just returned from the College& will write you a line.		

	Professor McCay has been elected President over Dr. Lieber, eighteen to ten votes.  I am very much grieved & mortified at the result.  Dr. Lieber will now quit the College I expect.  He will be sadly disappointed.
	  		
	Anna & Willie are dancing & the room [is] full of ladies.  Sue Hoke is not dancing.  I will go down in a few minutes & tell Anna as she goes off at six in the morning that she must retire.  Sue Hoke speaks of returning Thursday morning.  Willie will stay a day or two in Charleston & return here without going to the Cains.  Gill Watson is here & speaks of going down to Charleston with them.  

	I made a speech today on the Judiciary Bill & carried it by seven votes.  If I can push the Electoral Bill through I shall be greatly delighted.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening.  It was very short.

	Miss Susan Hoke has just gone to the American Hotel to spend the night & go up in the morning with the Greenville ladies there.  Anna left this morning for Charleston & I am now restored to my own room again at eleven oclock in the night.  This I am extremely glad of as Col. Irby is a bad bed fellow, snores & grits his teeth most horribly.  I have slept scarcely at all the last two nights as his bed fellow,  What his wife does, poor woman,  I know not!  He has to wet his head before going to bed & then put a wet towel under his pillow to put around his head in the night to keep it from burning up.  But he is a good fellow & I like him in all respects except as a bed fellow.  Sue Hoke has enjoyed herself very much & expresses a wish to come back next session.  Her frank manners & lively�have gained her a good many friends & admirers.  She would not dance & this was a drawback on her amusements.  They are dancing here every night.

	My speech on the Judiciary has been very much complimented.  Whaley & Pope came to my seat & thanked me for it.  [John Etienne] Tobin told Governor Adams that it was the only argument on my side of the question & yet�[Mem]minger spoke on that side.

	Col. & Mrs. Preston have sent me a note inviting me there tomorrow evening at 8 1/2 oclock in the evening.  They are to have a magnificent party I suppose.  

	Today I made several short speeches on the State House.

	Tomorrow the electoral law comes up & I shall have to say something.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Franks.  But I have not seen Col. O�Hanlon.  I must now conclude.  Douglass & Donaldson are both admitted to the Bar.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Tell your mother that I have just rece[ive]d her letter written after your grandmother had dined with you.

	I suppose Susan Hoke has been over to see your mother & told her all about Columbia.  I have not seen Col. O�Hanlon since I wrote the first time.  Willie will return tomorrow & perhaps go home Monday or Tuesday.

	I am sorry �bee�� turns out a such egg day, but the egg shells ought to be in the nest if Burt sucked them.

	Tell Fanny I hope she ids getting & saying her lessons also.  Tell Hext he ought to begin to learn his letters and tell Hayne he must begin to talk when I return home.

	Say to your mother that Mrs. Martin is not in Columbia.  Anna did not see Mrs. Taylor or any of the family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night just before I started to Col. Prestons magnificent party, & thankful I would write you till after my return.  But I did not get back till after two oclock & slept till Mr. Wells was about starting.  I have not yet had my breakfast & will write you now for fear I may not have time tonight.  Today the Electoral Bill is discussed.  I made a short speech yesterday on that subject.  Tomorrow the Bill providing for a separate court of appeals comes up, so it is impossible for me to think of returning home.

	I have just come back from breakfast & have to go to the State House in a few moments.

	I went to the party last night with Col. Alston & Harrison.  There were a great many persons there & I have never seen a more magnificent display.  I cannot, nor I have time to describe the party.  Col. Preston introduced me to Mrs. Preston, who asked me to take a seat by her, & we commenced talking about the mountains.  But in a few moments she had to rise to receive other company & I had to give up my seat.  It reminded me of much of the Presidents levee.  Mrs. Preston stood to receive her company.  The Col. was near the door to greet them first.  The rooms & entry (three rooms) were all full.  The ladies were richly dressed, & amongst them were Flora Jones & Sally Thompson.  Judge Withers had a very pretty daughter there about seventeen & vert talented.  Governor Manning & his wife were there.  Miss Sally Thompson says Governor Manning in Columbia & Governor Manning in Greenville are very different persons.  I went up to leave to Mrs. Manning & she held forth her hands & said she wad glad to see Major Perry�that I had treated her unfairly in visiting her house in her absence�that [I] must pay another visit & stay longer.  She is a real cordial. Warm hearted Virginian and still a fine looking lady.  We supped at one oclock.  About two oclock we broke up.  There was dancing, waltzing &c., good wines & rich brandy.  What a fine thing says Col. Watts to be rich.

	Tell Frank if I have time I will write him tomorrow morning & I will get his cap.  Willie will come back tomorrow & probably go home Tuesday.    Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  I was in hopes you had seen Susan Hoke & that she had told you all about her visit to Columbia.

	I have seen Edward several times & I have also seen Mr. Antwerp.  Edward looks very well & dresses finely.  He seems well pleased & Antwerp expresses himself pleased with Edward.  I told him that he had not improved him as he agreed to do.  He said he would pay more on account of it.  He is to make me an offer for the next year by letter at Christmas.

	Willie came back last night.  He said Mr. Cain met them at the�House & took charge of Anna.  He went to see all of his relatives in Charleston.  Anna wishes the Southern Patriot sent to her.  Tell Elford to send it.  

	The bundle you sent Anna came safely by Peter although I had not known it till Willie told me last evening.

	The letter of Miss Sparks was inclosed to me & I gave it to Susan Hoke open.

	This is a great day.  Willie has been to church, but I have been in my room all day reading the equity report.

	I have purchased two beautiful oil paintings as large as portraits in fine�frames representing Scotch scenes for twenty dollars.  I will send them up by Willie.  I don�t know when he will go up, as he wishes to stay a day or two & listen to the debates.
  
	Pinkney {Pinckney] went home Saturday & did not let me know.  He says his wife is sick.  I am sorry I cannot go home occasionally.  It would be a great pleasure.  A great many of the members are gone today.  They went yesterday & return tomorrow.

	I made another speech yesterday on the Judiciary in reply to General McGowan.  The Bill was defeated but we will try it again tomorrow.

	The ladies here are gone, & the Hotel seems quite deserted.  We shall probably adjourn the 19th Wednesday.  Willie is now in the room with me, reading a novel.  He has no news from Charleston.  I suppose you have heard from Anna by Miss�  She went to see Mrs. Eliza Hayne but none of the rest of them.

	I went up to the toy shop yesterday and looked over the pretty things.  Ask Frank, Fannie, Hext & Hayne what I must bring them.

	I broke my key this morning in my trunk & cannot get into the trunk again till tomorrow.  Bad luck with my trunk.

	I will go & see Mrs. Adams next Tuesday if I have time.

	In great haste.  I long to be at home again with my dear Liz & the children.  Hereafter I will never stay from you more than two weeks or you will have to go with me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now after eleven oclock but have just returned from the special committee Zeide way.  I have only been to write you a line.

	I recd your letter & was greatly shocked to hear of the sad fate of the poor little girl Sarah.  I do hope my dear wife it will make you all careful about fire & candles.  You know my constant apprehensions on that subject.  Do make the servants put out their fires & candles at an early hour.  

	Willie is asleep.  I will keep him here a day or two.

	My candle is giving out  & I must bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your letter & am truly sorry to hear that Mr. B�s John is so low.  I am afraid Mary will catch the fever & bring it into our yard.  This I would not have done for thousands of dollars.  Keep her away from him as much as possible, and if he dies do not let her stay all night with the Corpse.  It could be fatal.  Make all the servants clear out their rooms & white�them.

	I recd a letter from Anna this morning & she writes that she has just written you.  She was very much pleased with Columbia & says that P� Hoke made her stay here more pleasant.  Willie went to the race course today & is now gone somewhere.  It is eight oclock.  He will probably return Thursday.  The next letter I will send by Willie.
	I recd a letter from Mr. Elford saying he had recd Eighty five dollars for me from Edings on his Edings note.  Edings is one of my Pickens clients.  He wishes me to write him what to do with the money.  If you wish any of it send for it; otherwise he can pay it over to Mr. McBee.  I will write him to that effect.  I will write him to pay it over to you.  He writes me that he has purchased out the Mountaineer  & will consolidate the papers in the next two numbers.  I am glad the old Mountaineer is done & I suppose you are.  But I suppose you will not like the name being retained.  I am glad of it, as we will have it as a trophy in our banner.  

	Willie tells me that he met Willie Taylor in the Senate chamber yesterday, but he said nothing to him about going to see him!

	We have agreed to adjourn next Wednesday at ten oclock.  I will probably be able to get home that day.  I am very anxious to see you all again.  Although I have had Willie & Anna with me it is not like having you & Hayne & Hext.  But above all you.  For the last eighteen years I have been so much with you at home I feel at a loss when away from you.  There are few men who have spent so much of their time with their wives as I have or who have loved them more.

	The Judiciary Bill was defeated again this evening by two votes.  I was all day engaged arranging & defending it.  But it was lost by not following my advice & reducing the court to three Judges.

	Governor [James H.] Adams is in a peck of trouble about the censure which the committee have passed on him for returning the�Legislation, resolutions.  He threatened to resign.  So you see that all have their troubles, the Governor as well as your husband.

	Col. [Thomas] Dawkins is here with his wife.  I do not fancy her much.  The Col. drank so hard that he was crazy this last Fall, so Col. Herndon told me.    

	I like softness & sweetness in women, not bold fussy women, blue stockings & conceited ladies.  The other day I had occasion to speak of Judge Hayne whilst the gallery was filled with ladies.  I said he was positive to a reflection on his honor as a lady was to an imputation on her modesty.

	But I must now quit & write to Mr. Elford.  I had nothing to write about & yet I have written a long letter,

	Good night my dear wife, your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I now have nothing to do at night until my committee business is over.

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & I have time to write you a long letter.  The weather is bad & I shall not go to church.  I have just finished a long letter to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  The union of these two names sounds horribly to ears yet awhile.

	I rece[ive]d Franks letter last night with a line added by you & for which I thank you.  General McGowan asked me if it was a fact that I wrote a letter to my wife every day.  He said he had heard so & told his wife so, & that it has elevated me very much in her estimation.  She desired him to do the same, but that he would not find time to write more than twice a week.  I told him that you & I both wrote to each other every day, & that also wrote to the Patriot daily, notwithstanding my arduous duties.  He expressed great surperize.

	I have not written to you a full letter since I dined at Col. Prestons.  The dinner was superb one & I never ate more or drank more.  We did not rise from the dinner table till after ten oclock in the night!  I had promised Governor Adams to go to his house that night to attend the Literary Club if I could get off in time for eight oclock.  But I had to forego that pleasure.  I was very anxious to be present at the governors.  Generals Bonham & McGowan who were there said I was very much enquired for.  I suppose some of the literary gentlemen desired me to speak at their debate again.

	My. Account of the meeting at Dr. Labordes has excited a great deal of chat with the ladies & the Patriot is in great demand, although a copy is sent to each member.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks the other day by her son of the Dr�s quitting the College.  Mrs. Dawkins manifested great interest in seeing the Patriot & the Col. got a copy for her.

	I dined with Col. Campbell & Count deCha� the other day.  We had a very pleasant party & the Count gave me a pressing invitation to visit him next summer in Henderson.

	Last night I was invited to take supper with the governor after the adjournment of the Legislature.  But the House did not adjourn till midnight & I came home & went to bed.  I wish very much to see Mrs. Adams & her daughters before I leave Columbia, but I am afraid I shall not have time.

	We shall have to sit up all night now till the Legislature adjourns if we do the business of the House.  I shall not be at home till Thursday & may not have time to write you again.  I hope Willie was able to tell you a good deal about Columbia & the Legislature, and I will tell you a great deal when I return home.

	I am my dear Liz exceedingly anxious to see you & the children & be with you all again.  It is actually painful when I think of having to stay till Thursday.  But some of the members, my friend Col. [Benjamin Henry] Willson [Wilson] for instance, seem perfectly willing to stay a week or two longer and have actually tried to force the Legislature to rescind their order for adjourning.  They are perhaps happier, & have more enjoyment from [here] than at home�not so with your husband.  When I think of my position at Greenville, never from home more than a week whilst on the circuit & receiving five thousand dollars a year, I feel happy, & would not exchange my situation for any office less than that of the Presidency.  Whaley & some members from below said to me I had been spoken of as Judge if there was an election, but that they had said I would not accept.  I told them they were right, & that I was doing much better than to be a Judge.  

	In regard to my likeness I have not time to sit for a daguerreotype & I do not think a better one could be made than the one you gave Elford.  He need not wait for any other if he intends having an engraving of me.

	I shall expect a long letter from you Monday night.  You can write me Tuesday evening & I will get it Wednesday night.  

	Last night on returning from the State House I fell in company with General Martin.  He seemed very kind & cordial & enquired after you all.  He said he never saw me.  I did not go into the Senate & he did not go into the House.  I have seen nothing of Taylor for two weeks.  Last night I walked to the State House with Isaac Hayne & General Bonham.  Hayne wishes his salary raised four or five hundred dollars.

	Tell Willie I went for his wal[l]et yesterday.  They were at work on it & said it should be ready Monday.

	I will now enclose & write a letter to Anna.  I was glad to read her letter to you.  I have not yet written to her at all nor have I heard from her but once.  Flora Jones is going with Mrs. Allen to Montgomery to stay with Mrs. Young awhile.

	Tell Frank & Fanny I hope they are studying their Books & will learn faster under your instruction than they have done at school.

	In January you & I will go down for Anna & stay awhile at the Mills House.  I shall receive $500 of Williams at American sale day in January & perhaps my Mobile money with Strouds &c.  A few days from home together will be pleasant & it is so pleasant to travel with you & leave all the children at home.  Our trip to Pickens was a pleasant one.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I thank you for your letter & desired to have answered it sooner, but I have no time to write to you except on Sunday.  We very often sit in the Legislature till midnight & yesterday we met at eleven and adjourned Sunday.  Monday we�after twelve in the night!

	I was glad to hear you were enjoying yourself so much, & your little friend & her father were so much pleased to see you.  I hope she will come up next summer and stay with you.  You must remember me to Mr. Cain, & tell him I often think of him & should be pleased to meet him again.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last night & she enclosed one of your letters to her.  Willie staid with me till last Friday.  He returned from Charleston on Saturday after you left him.  Your mother has written you all the Greenville news.  I shall go home Thursday morning.

	There are no ladies at the Congaree House now.  They all left a few days after you did.  I sent up your writing desk by Willie.  It is a beautiful thing & you must take special care of it when you return home.

	Flora Jones has gone to Barnwell & is going to Montgomery with Mrs. Allen to stay with Mrs. Yancey.  I met her & Sally Thompson at a great Ball at Col. John Prestons.  It was one of the most splendid entertainments I ever saw.  Susan Hoke went home the day after you left. 

	Frank writes me a letter every day or two & his last one was quite a long letter, and he gave me a good bit of news.

	I have ordered the Patriot to be sent you.  Mr. Elford has purchased the Mountaineer & the two papers have been blended.

	I must now conclude & go to dinner.  I think of you & Susan Hoke very often when I start to my meals.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	The Legislature did not adjourn last night till after midnight.  I did not get to bed till after one.  It is now almost eight oclock in the morning & Mr. Wells will leave in a few moments.  I have just dressed & have time only to say that I am well & will be at home Thursday.  We did a great deal yesterday & I was speaking for five hours last night with short intervals on the state Capitol.  I did not sleep well but feel quite well this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from General Thompson at Wilmington in great agony about his child who was extremely ill.  He requested me to forward the letter to Batten which I did.

My dear Liz

	I have only a few moments to write you my last letter from Columbia this Session.  Tomorrow night I shall have the joy & satisfaction of meeting you & the children once more.  I wish it was tonight.  As the time approaches the more anxious I am to be at home.  There is no place to me like home sweet home, & perhaps I have more to make my home sweet than others, which is the reason of my love of home.  But I am somewhat differently constituted from other husbands & fathers, & you too are different from most wives, & we have both taken pleasure in making each other happy.

	I returned last night just before midnight from the Legislature & left the House in Session.  President McCay came to me in the morning & said Mrs. McCay desired me to go & take tea with her that evening, but I could not.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks for my notice of the DL.  So I am in good repute with both them today.

	You wrote me some time ago for money when I had not a cent.  You forgot that I started with my little in hand & had to give Willie thirty dollars to pay his expenses to Charleston & Anna ten or fifteen whilst regretting that I had no money.  Mr. Spain came up & tapped me on the shoulder & said he was authorized by Mrs. Green of Sumter to pay me fifty dollars.  I thought to myself that it was always so, good fortune attends me & money comes when I get out.  I went down into the Governor�s Room & he paid me for Ware sixty three dollars which I shall keep for interest on Wares note.  Presently the Clerk of the House came & brought me a check for John Watson for one hundred & twenty five dollars & Watson owes me a little.

	I dined yesterday with Col. Wag[e]ner & had a pleasant time with his mess.

	I went up to Heise�s to buy some taps & he made me a present of a fine silver headed walking stick.  I bought some candy, three dollars, a whip with a whistle, crackers, a knife for Frank, a cap for Willie &c.&c.

	I must now stop as the agent is about leaving Miss Hayne for me & I will pay you back the kiss tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry

	I have scarcely time to say I am well as you requested me simply to say when I have not time to write you.  Yesterday I dined with the Charleston mess & had a pleasant evening with Count Chais�, Col. Campbell Wilson & others.  The House did not adjourn till near midnight last night & I have slept rather late this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night which was gratifying to my feelings as a husband & lover of my wife.

	Yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing my Bill giving the election of Electors to the people pass by one vote.  All the other Bills on the subject were defeated, & we spent the whole day in voting.

	I will write you a long letter Sunday and have a great deal to say.  But it is thought that the Legislature cannot adjourn on the 19th.  I do not suppose I can leave here till the adjournment.  But I am very anxious to be at home once more.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just recd your letter of yesterday dated Charleston, stating that you had arrived safely and all were well!  I am truly glad to hear all are well, but I am sorry to hear you are in Charleston again.  I hope you did not after I left you Tuesday morning get out & take the downward train.  

	I shall not be able to get off in the morning but hope to reach my case tomorrow & be at home Friday evening.  Have the carriage at the depot for me & I should be happy to meet you & the children there.

	I went down to the rail road depot this evening & ascertained that my boxes were put on board the Greenville cars & will leave in the morning.  But I hear nothing of the carriage.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & brought a bundle for you.  Mrs. Elford will be here tomorrow.  He told me of the death of Butler Hayne�s daughter.

	How anxious I am to be at home ever more.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.

	Harman was tried this morning.  I do not think there was any chance for him.

	I have gained all my cases in Equity.

	I must now conclude.  Mrs. Brown sent me word that she had some potters to send you.  Brown has come back to suit his affectionate wife.

	Kiss the children for me.  It is so dark that I am sure you cannot read what I am writing.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have about ten minutes before breakfast to write you.  Mr. Elford & myself are in a room together.  There were about four hundred passengers yesterday on the Greenville Rail Road.  Five cars full.  The largest�ever on the road and the taverns are crowded.  The stockholders paid nothing.  Hence some came from Greenville who only own two shares forty dollars.  We had a dusty ride down here.  I thought I should never get clean again.  But after washing I went out & bought me some clothes�two coats, two pants, four vests, a�& pair of gloves for $28.00�nice clothes too.

	I met Col Ware & Mr. Duncan returning home yesterday.  They have purchased 1800 acres of land in Georgia at $12 per acre.  Mr. Furmans intended bride was on the road.  She is tall & pale & rather pleasant looking.  

	The Rail Road convention meets this morning & will get through tomorrow.
	
	The committee & convention is much talked of.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  Mrs. Col. Fair came down with the Col. & enquired after you.  

	I hope you & the children are well [and] getting on well.  I must now go to Breakfast.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Elford found your letter as he went in to mail one for himself.  It was lying on the desk.  He brought it up to me just as I was sitting down to complain of your negligence.

	I am now writing to you before breakfast & Elford & Mauldin who has been rooming with me will go up this morning.  I will send the letter by Elford.  I enclose you the $20.00.  I was glad to hear you were all well, & that you had got through with white washing.  I am sorry your money will not pass.  If you wished to purchase anything of the merchants I am sure they will not refuse the Bill.

	I called to see Antwerp yesterday & he paid me $32.50 for balance of Edwards bill.  This is rather better than I expected,

	The Rail Road Convention adjourned yesterday.  We had a great deal of discussion & some sparring between Judge O�Neall & myself.  In my Report I give the President & directors a caution about their extravagance & selling bonds too low & the Judge did not like it.

	I saw Col. O�Hanlon yesterday.  He seems very kind & cordial & enquired after you & the children.  He said the other day in company with my friend Thompson & Mr. Green talking about the nominee from the Presidency he said he would be glad to see me nominated & that they all concurred  with him!  This is surely an evidence of strong feeling on his part.  He introduced me to Co. Ben McCulloch of Texas.  He is a rough unpolished &�man & I think Miss Sparks had better have Col. Keitt.  He has been to see her & has also been to see Col. Pickens daughters so said.

	Col. Orr arrived here last night.  He says there will be a vacancy for midshipmen in September but that the applicant must be not under fourteen nor older than fifteen.  Frank is yet too young.

	Tell Frank I will get his sword.  But an officer has no use for a drum.  I hope he is not going to turn drummer.

	Dr. Fair has been very polite to me, but I have only seen Mrs. Fair once.  Mr. LeConte the new Professor & his wife are boarding at this House.  He is a very pleasant gentleman indeed & moderate & unpretending.  But his wife, whose acquaintance I have not made, seems one of the most magnificently dressy & pompous women I ever saw.  She is a New Yorker & came to the table, dressed as if for a Ball, with bare arms & shoulders.    She is a large woman & the Professor a small man.

	I have seen none going to Charleston yet.  I saw Edward Buist one evening.  He enquired about Willie.  President McCay & Professor LaBorde had called to see me at the same time & Edward seemed shy of them & staid but a moment.  The College is doing well.  There is a fuss about Dr. LaBordes defence of Dr. Lieber in the subject of slavery.

	I must now close my letter to you & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Tell your mother not to be in a tie�about selling her land,& quit saying she will take $7.00.  Hanckle will give $8.00 just as quick as seven.  He perhaps does not wish to buy at all.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday morning & I have just breakfasted & will not write you a few lines for fear I may not do so after awhile.

	I rece[ive]d your short letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  But would have been better satisfied if you had stated that Anna had returned as well as Frank from Paris Mountain.  I hope Wiley drove the Barouche, for I should not like to trust the horses with any of those young men in going up the mountain.

	Tell Frank I have bought him a sword for 15 cts.  The preparation for bedsteads I started to purchase, but the shop was full of Ladies & I passed on.  I have bought a fountain pen which writes all day without being dripped in ink more than once.  This is a great convenience.  It is like writing with a pencil.

	I have nothing of interest to write you last night.  General Casey made a Tennyson Lecture but I did not go out to hear him.  I sat in my room & read [Samuel] Rogers table talk a very interesting book of sketches of men & anecdotes of men.

	The delegates to the Convention are coming in pretty rapidly & we shall no doubt have a large representation.
	
	There was quite an excitement here the other day against Dr. LaBorde for some expressions of his on the slavery question.  They thought the article was written by Col. Preston & his enemies caused the excitement.

	The church Bells are now ringing & I will finish my letter this evening.

	It is now after supper & I will finish my letter.  I went to the Episcopal church and heard a good sermon from Mr. Shand.  I saw Alexander Taylor & he said they were all well.  I did not see Mrs. Taylor.  I sat with Mr. Ford who has charge of the Male Academy in this place & boards at this Hotel.  He married a Georgetown lady.  Taylor invited me to sit in his pew.

	After dinner Col. Orr & myself went over to see Col. Pickens & spent the evening.  His daughters are with him & came into the room.  I had a good deal of chat with the youngster.  There was a Mr. Taylor with Thompson [a] Virginian who may be a B� of the eldest.  I see Maxwell from Georgetown is here who is said to be engaged to one of them.  I spoke of Col. McCullough to the youngest in connexion with Miss Sparks & I thought she seemed confused.  She enquired what I thought of Col. McCullough & seemed to wish to have my opinion of him.  

	There was a young Pringle a delegate here this evening who enquired after you & said he heard of your very often through his aunt.  Col. Wilson is here from Georgetown.  We have a large number of delegates already arrived.  Tomorrow I shall be very busy & you need not expect me by the next mail.

	I must now conclude my letter & write one to the Patriot.  I hope you & the children are well & shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  Col. Orr spoke to me about occupying the district Judgeship in place of Gilchrist who is dead.  I declined it.  He has telegraphed the President not to make the appointment till his return to Washington.  Col. Moses of Sumter, Col. McGrath & Mr. Evans are the�  The salary is $2,700.  We could not live in Charleston on that salary.

	The other day after the Rail Road Convention adjourned & after I had spoken several times Mr. Wardlaw a cousin of the Judge�s came up to me & said he has long heard of me but never had seen me before & that I was a man after his own heart from the speeches I had made.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I barely have time to acknowledge the receipt of your letter last night.

	I have a great deal of writing to do this morning before the Convention meets & I did not get to bed till twelve oclock last night.

	We had a glorious meeting last night & a noble speech from Col. Pickens, President of the Convention.  There were perhaps 120 delegates present.  We will adjourn tonight.  I shall try to be at home next Saturday.  My cases in court were disposed of yesterday.  Col. Brockman, Bolling, McKay, Jones came down.  Flora Jones came up from Barnwell last night & is at this Hotel, but I have not seen her.  Tell Anna all the other servants enquired after her.

	God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees, but I will write you a few lines.

	It is probable that I shall not be able to leave here before Tuesday morning.  The cases of mine in the court have been restored & will not [be] argued till Friday.  The Board of Trustees have appointed me on a committee with Col. Memminger, Mr. Barnwell, Governor Means & Col. Dawkins to consider & report all the college difficulties & matters.  This will detain me some days.  The Governor has made up a party for my special benefit, according to past agreement with him, to go down to spend Saturday & Sunday with him.  He would receive no excuse.  The Court of Appeals deliver opinions on Monday.  So I think I shall not be able to leave here till Tuesday.  You must write to me.

	Governor Adams has promised me sixty rifles for Willies company.  He will give me the order tomorrow, and I will have them sent up at once, to Greenville.  This will be good news for Willie to communicate to the Students.  The Governor seems very cordial & says there is not a man in South Carolina he would sooner oblige or prefer having at his House.  He enquired after you & Anna very kindly.  Tell Willie Chancellor Johnston enquired after him very particularly.

	Col. Jones & Flora go up in the morning.  Col. Pickens has just called to see me, but I was at the College.  Col. Memminger introduced me to his two sons who took tea here this morning.  They seem very clever young men or boys.  This evening I speak with Col. Memminger & Professor LeConte.  I have not yet made the acquaintance of Mrs. LeConte.  Captain McCullough said what is very true of her�that she looked too much like she desired the admiration of the world to care much for her husband.  He seems a most amiable & interesting gentleman.    

	I saw Mr. Jann[e]y who enquired after all of you & desired Anna to go & stay with his daughters.  He said they had just returned from school.  They said they saw me on the streets, but I did not recognize them.  He seemed very kind.  Captain McCullough is addressing Miss Pickens, so says Col. Watts, hence her curiosity to know what I thought of him.  Flora Jones told me that Miss Sparks was dead but this cannot be so.

	I will try & get Franks company the�& him the epaulettes.  Willie & Frank their hats & Anna a prayer book.  I have not spent much money in the purchase of books & have bought only a few�Prescotts, Philip, McCauley, Tre�, Washington, Allisons continuation of his History & Rogers Table Talk�fifteen or sixteen dollars worth.

	It is all better for me that I cannot be a Judge or do anything else than work for the support of my wife & children.  I do this with a hearty good will & enjoy it, & see more pleasure than if I were in Congress or on the Bench.  My reputation will be better too in the sight of my God & man.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and also the bundle & the�box to Mr. Reynolds who goes down in the morning and who promises me to see them delivered to your aunts.  The Box to you, came up this morning, Mr. Wells says he will take it up in the morning.  I have put him in charge of it.

	He told me this evening that he had carried a receipt for you to Dr. Boatwright & it made four bottles.  He paid $2.00 & that you took only one of the bottles & returned the others to him.  This was a most untho� act on your part.  To oblige you he gets a�mode , & because it amounts to more than you desired, you leave him to pay the $1.50.  He said he knew I would pay it when he mentioned it to me.  I did pay him.  You can send & get the other three bottles.  Dr. Boatwright asked me how you liked the preparation.  He said it was the best preparation of the kind that he had ever seen.  I never heard anything about it & could tell him nothing.

	I shall probably return home Thursday.  The Board of Trustees meet Wednesday night, & I shall not stay to my subsequent meeting.

	You can tell Willie to say to his college friends that I have not yet seen the Governor.  He was to come up tonight or in the morning.

	I got your preparation for bed bugs & will bring it up with me.

	The convention adjourned this evening after appointing as delegates to the Cincinnati convention Governor manning, Pickens, McGrath, Gadberry, Porter, McBeth, Wilson, Dudley, Moses, Farrow, Orr, Brooks, Sullivan, Palmer. Allen & Brown.  I could have been appointed but I could not have gone without a great sacrifice.  My business would have been ruined for the next Court of Equity.

I must now conclude my letter & go to bed as I did not sleep much last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now near eleven oclock & I will write you a few lines, before going to bed.  I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & strange to say you still write about sending the bundles.  They were sent long since.

	I shall be at home Tuesday evening.  I dislike staying here but circumstances have rendered it.

Necessary.  All day today I was engaged with Barnwell, Memminger and Dawkins on College matters.  We report tomorrow evening.  I spent the day pleasantly.  We called the President of the College & all the Professors before us to give us information.  No doubt McCay did his duty in the riots.  We have expelled Rhett and [John Charles] McClenag[h]an.

	I have bought Willie, Frank & Hext hats $3.00, $6.50 & $1.00�Panama and Leghorn hats.  I bought Willie & Anna gloves $3.50 and a Book for Anna which I hope she will read & study.  �The Lady�s guide to perfect gentility.�  It is an admirable book.  I have bought two bottles of the balm of a thousand flowers.  It is good for anything.  I can shave with two drops of it & it makes a fine lather.  It is a good tooth wash &c.  I am now so sleepy that I will finish my letter in the morning.

	I have just dressed & will write you a few additional lines.  I feel better this morning than I have since I have been in Columbia.  Slept well & my system is [in] a better condition.  But I begin to wish to be at home.  I am afraid my business is neglected there.  My clients will wish to see me.  And I wish to see you & the children.  It isa pleasant to go from home occasionally just to have and enjoy the pleasure of returning�for after all there is no place like home.  Someone says in Rogers Table Talk that he pitties the man no matter how great and how rich who has no one to love.  I have my wife & six children to love & provide for & it is my greatest enjoyment & happiness.

	Col. O�Hanlon dined with me the other day & seemed very cordial but he is a tiresome   egotistical man.  He told me that Mrs�.Jones had written him a letter recently wishing to boron $2.500 & pledge the honor of a lady for its return.  The colonel did not answer the letter.    He did not appreciate the security.  But this you must say nothing about.

	I rece[ive]d a Patriot last night through Mr. Wells, but none through the office.  Chancellor Dunkin spoke to me for a copy when I received it.

	I have nothing now to write & must conclude & write to the Patriot.  I suppose I shall not hear from you tonight & Saturday night.  I shall be at Governor Adams�--so I shall not hear from you now till Monday morning and Tuesday morning I start home.

	Governor Adams returns this morning & will give me the order for the rifles.  I will immediately have them boxed up & forwarded to Greenville.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have barely time to write you that I have got through with my cases in court & Dealers vs�of the College & but for my promise to the Governor could return home this morning.

	Chancellor Wardlaw & Aldrich & Boylston go with mew to the Governors & will return Monday morning.  We shall no doubt have a pleasant trip.   

	I rece[ive]d your letter last evening & should like very much to get the one which will arrive here this evening and which you say shall be a long one.  But I shall not have the pleasure of reading it till Monday morning.  You can write me by Monday�s mail again.

	I wish to see you & the children very much & regret that I cannot go home this morning.  

	Tell Willie that I got the Rifles & accoutrements yesterday & they will start on the Rail Road in boxes Monday morning directed to me.  They will reach Greenville Tuesday evening.

	I am with great love & affection, your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I write you merely to let you know I will be at home tomorrow evening.

	I saw Warren yesterday who told me they were all well at the Farm & his Fathers.  They had just heard of the death of Clark Perry�s wife.  She died of typhoid fever in Texas & left a little daughter ten months old.  It is a sad fate for the poor girl remote from all friends but her husband.

	Warren paid me about five hundred dollars for the estate from the sale of wheat & bacon.

	I have got a good many new cases here but no money.

	Elford, Donaldson, Easl[e]y & Sloan Duncan came on with me on Sunday.  Elford told me that Dr. Edward Jones had cut his throat in Jail.  I presume the family have no regrets on the subject.

	I have not had any conversation with Keith yet on the subject of your settlement.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I arrived here this evening safe & well.  We had a pleasant time coming down.  Dr. Crook, Col. Wilson, McKay, Donaldson�& many others aboard the cars.  We had to walk a part of the way & have our baggage changed where the terrible wreck occurred.  

	I left Wiley at Newberry C.H. & he will return Friday.  I gave him three dollars to pay his passage back.

	We came very near being left this morning by the cars.  The omnibus was so long behind time.

	Jann[e]y is here & very kind.  I have seen Col. O�Hanlon.  He enquired about you all.  I saw Buist who enquired about Willy & says if he will read Homer he can enter Junior class very easily.  

	I have bought a Raylin $20 as good as Sudd..at $30 pants $9.00 vest $6�$1.00.  So I am clad for the winter.

	I have four letters to write this evening, & therefore must bid you good night.  I saw Col. Perrin who told me he would have the Bonds here.  I paid Dickeys money $1000 to Col. Goodwyn President of the Bank. 

	Take care of yourself & the children & I will try and take care of myself.  I lost my trunk containing the pon�but found it at Hunts Hotel & all is safe.

	Let Wiley purchase some shucks for corn feed.

	Kiss Arthur for me & give my love to all the children.  Write to me in Charleston.  Mr. Arthur was aboard the cars & Jeter & his wife.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just breakfasted and will now write you a few lines.  I wrote you from Columbia.  The next I started from this place & reached here safely about two oclock.  The trip down was very pleasant although there was an immense concourse od=f persons on the cars.  Col. Wilson & Mr. Pinckney Huger & myself sat together & had a good deal of pleasant chat.  Mr. Huger told me his sister [was] in the cars when the terrible accident happened two or three days before.  But the car she was in jumped the gap in the road & she did not know that anything had happened till she heard the screams of the passengers in the cars below which were crushed to pieces.

	I found on my arrival here that the South Carolina Institute had a magnificent private parlor & bed chamber attached engaged for me next to the ladies drawing room.  Tell Anna I am in the Bridal chamber which she saw here once.  I wish you were with me.  It would be very pleasant.  I shall perhaps never be so handsomely accommodated again.  It would be pleasant for you to have a private parlor to receive your visitors.  The House is very much crowded & Governor Means seemed a little curious [at] my superior accommodations to himself.  

       In the evening after my arrival Lawton & DeSaussure & the Vice President of the Institute called on me & carried me to the Hall.  It is beautiful & the paintings & sculpture are truly magnificent.  The whole collection is wonderful, beautiful beyond description.  The Standard & the Courier both sent to me for a synopsis of my address to publish after delivery.  But I preferred the whole address being published & declined.
       
       Yesterday evening Mr. Taylor the President & Mr. Reynolds called for me to go over to deliver my address.  I met in the parlor a large number of gentlemen.  Col. Hayne & Judge King &  Mr. Thornwell amongst them.  The evening was wet & rainy, but there were one thousand persons in the Hall, who paid twenty five cents each for admission.  If the evening had been good there would have been two thousand.  Reynolds said there was a general wish & curiosity to see me & hear me speak.  I told him I supposed they had a curiosity to see the ��Traitor� who had done so much to keep the State in the union.
       
       I was an hour & twenty minutes delivering my address & then skipped over parts of it.  The audience listened with profound attention.  My voice filled the great Hall completely and all heard me distinctly.  The gentlemen on the stage congratulated me on the address & said it was one of great ability &�& would do good.  I think it was well rece[ive]d, & I have been much flattered.  After the address I supped with the Institute & got home at eleven oclock.  We had a very pleasant time.  Today I dine with Mr. Lawton & sup with Mr. Yeadon at ten oclock.
       
       I have a great deal more to write, but not time to do so.  I hope you & the children are all well.  Col. Hayne enquired how his little godson comes on.  I shall go up to Columbia Sunday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Gowers fine carriage to be raffled for & he has presented me with a chance.  Perhaps I may win it.

	I have just reached here safe & got my supper.

	Frank�s letter was handed me on my arrival.  I rece[ive]d but one letter from you in Charleston.  Your aunt McCall sent me a little box which is in my trunk & which I will send up by the first opportunity.

	I had a pleasant time in Charleston & could hardly break loose from my friends there.  Mr. Petigru�very much on my staying today & dining with him & Col. Alston & Lady.  I dined yesterday with Col. Alston & Mr. Petigru & Mrs. Alston at their private table at the Mills House.  Judge McGrath insisted on my taking supper with him yesterday.  Mr. Johnson brother of Judge Johnson also invited me to dine with him�also Mr. Yeadon. 

	My speech has attracted much attention & has drawn forth a compliment from the Mercury which I will send you.  It has been published in the Courier & Evening News.  The Institute will publish it in pamphlet form in a week or ten days.

	There was an immense concourse of persons today on the Charleston cars.  I had a pleasant seat with Col. Harleston Read, Col. Simmons the Speaker & Col. Boylston.  There were six cars full.

	I see General Thompson here on his way to New York.  I have not seen Mrs. Thompson.  He had no news from Greenville.  I see none of the Greenville delegation here.  They will come down tomorrow I suppose.

	The weather was very warm in Charleston & I could not wear my Raylin.  I had therefore to buy me a frock coat to speak in which cost me $22.  I paid no�Bill at the Mills House.

	Mrs. Wilson came down the day I rece[ive]d your letter but I saw nothing of her.  I was a good deal with the Colonel.

	This Hotel is very full & I have my old room.  Dr. Fair & Lady are opposite to me and he made an appeal to my gallantry as I went down two young ladies to have the room for three days at the commencement Ball.  That their coming to the Ball depended on their getting a room opposite Mrs. Fair�s.  I told him if I could stay anywhere else they might occupy my room three or four days.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  I saw Mr. Robert Duncan in Charleston.  � Barnwell Duncan came to see me.  I left McKay & wife & Donaldson in Charleston.  They will be up this week some time.  

	I am very much fatigued & will write you tomorrow or the next day.

	I paid Kle� &65.00.  He has the finest fresh butter I ever saw & says he can supply us at thirty two cents a pound.  I think one pound of his butter will [go] further than Mrs. Brockmans & is much sweater butter.

	Good night.  I must write a line to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening written Sunday.  I was glad to hear from you.  But really your Bill astonishes me.  If the Bonnets & dresses were for summer or you and Anna were going to Columbia it would be all right.  But nobody will see either Bonnett or dress & next summer they will be thrown aside.  Willies chair was unnecessary at this time.  But you know what is done is over with me & I never receive to it like you.  I shall not have money enough to pay the Bill & pay Willies college expences.  I am now sorry I did not bring my money with me.  You can borrow a check from Mr. Cox for $130.00 and I will pay interest till I return.  But perhaps the better plan is for me to send you the keys & let you get $130 out of the Beaureau.  I will send the keys by Mr. Wells or would in�a check payable to your aunt give her name to Cox & send him the money.  It will cost fifty cents.

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot & have not time to write you anymore.  The correspondent of the Carolinian speaks in high terms of my speech.  All who have read it speak in high terms of it.

	I am glad Willie got back safe & that you are all well.

	I don�t know what to say about Franks coming down.  If he comes he must come in his present clothes�don�t purchase any for him.  We have spent money enough for the present.  I think he had better stay & come down towards the close of the session.  But if he wishes let him come & stay till after commencement.

I called at the bar & was told they had rece[ive]d the letters & there were none for me.  I went to the Post office & got no letters.  On my return to the Hotel your letter was handed me.  It had been put in a wrong box.

	I have just been to see Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham at Hunts Hotel.  Mrs. Cunningham had gone to see Howp� Gardens & I did not see her.  I saw Mr. Cunningham.  Pamela is in Charleston.  Mr. Cunningham is going to move there entirely & isa a candidate for Bank director.

	I was invited to dine with Governor Adams today, but declined his invitation as Col. Orr was going to dine with us.  You need not give yourself any fears about Franks getting into the money.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this morning, & I hope he will remain in the College a year longer at least.  I spoke to him about Willie�also spoke to Professor LeConte.

	There was nothing done in the legislature today.  I must conclude & get a cup of tea & go to College.  Alex McBee & his Bride are here.  I saw Alexander but have not seen his wife.  I congratulated him & he blushed & appeared ashamed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Son [Frank]

	I will write you a few lines as you have been so good as to write me so often since I left home.

	I received your letter this evening & am happy to hear you are progressing so rapidly in your studies & lessons.  If you wish to, you can come down Thursday.  You can get ready, I suppose, in a few minutes.  Willie can also come down with you if he desires to do so.

	Tell your mother I have nothing of interest to write her.  We had a little speaking in the Legislature & I took a part today.  I sent up the box & keys by Mr. Wells.

	Tell Anna that Mr. Evans who gave her the thimble is married.  He enquired very kindly about her�so did Col. Beadon.

	It is very warm tonight & I am sitting with my windows up & door open in a perfect perspiration.  

	Tell your mother that Mrs. Brooks Governor Adams daughter Had a fine son last night to greet its grandfather in going out of office.  Col. Pickens has declined running for governor & Col. [Robert Francis Withers] Allston will not be elected.

	Why does not Anna, & Willie & Fanny write me.  I saw a student of the College tonight a prot�g� of Yeadons, who says if Willie applies for Junior they will not examine him on Homer but the �memorabilia of Xenephon.

	Tell Hext & Hayne that I think often of them & long to see them all.

	Col. Moses has invited me & some other gentlemen to go down to Sumter with him Saturday evening.

	Tomorrow night the Board of Trustees meet & I shall not be able to write to any of you.

	It is now ten oclock in the night & I have just returned from Col. John S. Prestons dinner party.  It was a most delightful & interesting party & magnificent entertainment.  Only a few persons were present�Col. Hampton, Governor Manning, Col. Orr, General McGowan, Col. Pickens, Col. Chesnut & myself.  I never spent a more pleasant evening at the dinner table.

	On my return I rece[ive]d both of your letters with many others.  I was glad to hear from you & rather sorry not to find Frank here.  

	Last night after writing to you I called over to see Col. Dawkins as I went to the College & saw Mrs. Cunningham.  She is altered very little & seemed as cordial as ever.  She enquired most affectionately after you & the children.  She asked how you looked & I replied as young as you did when we were first married�looked about seventeen.  I saw Mrs. Dawkins also.

	Col. Moses has invited four or five of us to go down to Sumter & spend Sunday.  I have promised to go�may be gone before Willie reaches here Saturday evening.  If so he can take charge of my room till my return Sunday evening or Monday morning.  In haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	We have elected young Robert Barnwell a Professor in the College in place of Dr. Lieber.  A Brother of Professor LeConte in place of Dr. Brumby.

	I go down with Col. Moses to Sumter Saturday evening.  General McGowan, Yeadon & others are also going.  We may not return till Monday morning.  Col. Ashmore says he has telegraphed the people of Sumter & there will be a crowd to see me & will have to make a speech.

	I have not time to write you further except that you letter was rece[ive]d this evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & as I have not time to write you & send my letter to the Patriot for you to read & send immediately up to Elford.

	I should feel disgraced to be nominated for lieutenant governor & would be so regarded by my friends.

	I read your letter to Mr. Yeadon.  He says he will take your offer & feels much complimented.

	Willie has written you a letter tonight.  Tomorrow he is examined.

        Col. Perrin has given me the Bonds but the coupon due was left off.

	 I am glad to hear of Arthurs tooth.  I wish you were here & next winter you must come.  

	Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B,F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have a great deal to write you if I had time.  But tomorrow I have the House at one oclock to make a speech on the Judiciary Bill & have to prepare for as yet I have scarcely thought of the question since last winter.  There will no doubt be a large audience to hear me.  The ladies are all here & will go.

	Willie is at the College undergoing his examination.  I have not seen him since breakfast.  It is now dark.  There are forty applicants.

	Norton has just come into the room& told me he & Jeter were admitted to the Bar.  Four out of twenty one were rejected.

	Write the day & year Frank was born, & I will send it on to Col. Orr.

	I have just heard as a great secret that Col. Pickens is to go into the Buchanan Cabinet.  I am delighted at this, as he is my friend in policies & feeling.  I saw him yesterday.  I am invited to President McCays tomorrow evening and to dine with Senator [Moses Cohen] Mordecai on Saturday.  The Jews seem to have taken a fancy to me.

	Col. Fairs little daughter is here & he enquired after Anna.  Governor Adams proposed the other night that we should send our daughter to Charleston next winter to the same school.  He is cordial & you do him great injustice.

	Col. Isaac Hayne walked home with me today & invited me to take a glass of brandy in his room.  He was more sociable & friendly.  

       Norton seems very gratified & proposes making me a present of some book.
       
       I shall not have time to write to the Patriot tonight I am afraid.
       
       I have just seen Willie.  He has been examined in fact & his examination will close tomorrow.  He thinks it doubtful whether he can enter the Junior class.
       
       The Bonds your mother will get will have interest from July.  Col. Perrin said nothing about the prior interest & I did not see proper to mention it.
       
       I must now close.  I hope you are all well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	The nine oclock Bell is just ringing & I have not had a moments leisure all day.

	Your letter has just been read.  Willie has been admitted into the Junior class alone.  There were fifty admitted into the Freshman & Sophomore.  Professor LeConte says he did well in his department.  Professor LaBorde admitted him in his department without an examination.  Dr. Lieber says he passed well.  Rivers says he did tolerably well in Greek.  I have not seen Preisdent McCay.  He called to see me this morning before he examined Will.  Willie is much pleased with his success.

	I did pretty well in my speech today on the Judiciary& there was a con[siderable] audience present.  

	Miss Brenan gives a concert tonight, but I have not time to go or to go to Mrs. McCays party.

	Enclosed I send you my letter to the Patriot as you desired.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I wish you would answer all of my letters & say I am absent in Columbia & will write when I return�especially the letters from Col. Dunkins sisters agent.

My dear Liz

	I enclose you a long letter which you must accept as one to yourself as you did not write me today.  Anna�s letter to Willie was rece[ive]d.  Willie will return Friday or Saturday.  He passed his examination very well & is pleased at his admission.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees& it is now near eleven oclock.  I have never been so busy before of a session, because I have been more in company & dining out.  I have really enjoyed myself very much.  But I am very anxious to see you & the children.  But for my engagement to dine out on Saturday, I would go home & return Monday.

	Tell Anna I bought her knife today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & Willie will go up in the morning.

	The Rail Road Bonds draw interest from 1st July last.  I have the two Col. Perrin sold me in my trunk.  Captain John Westfield has just offered me two at 80cts in the dollar, $850 for two Bonds worth $1000 & $35 Interest due 1st Jan[uar]y.  He is to wait with me till 25th December for the money.  I have agreed to take them & he is to give them to me in the morning.  He is on his way to the north& says by making sale of them to me he can raise funds of Cox to go on.  Tell your mother to write me immediately to have the money ready.  She can take the Bonds at what I give.

	I have just given Willie $25.00 to go & buy the furniture for his room of a student who is leaving & sells cheap.

	Willie will tell you all the news.  I will write to Col. Orr tonight about Frank.  It will be pleasant to have Frank provided for for life.  Willie can make his way at the Bar.  Hext will go into the army.  I am congratulated by all the Professors in having a son in college.  I think they will respect Willie on my account & that he will do well.

	I am very anxious to return home & would do so with Willie if I had not agreed to dine with Mordecai.  I know he has made large preparations & it would disappoint him.  I may go up tomorrow week.  

	I have rece[ive]d a free ticket on the Charlotte Rail Road & now they charge me nothing on the Charleston Road so I can go where I please on the rail road without cost.

	Nothing of great interest occur[r]ed today in the Legislature.  I spoke a short time on the amendment of the Constitution. 
	
	I thank you for your favorable opinion of our childrens exhibiting my talents.  You ought to tell them that they inherit talents from both of us.  It is well for a great man to have a great wife as much so as it is for a great woman to have a great husband.  The children partake of the talents of both.  

	Mr. Pinckney has left a package for Susan which I will send by Willie.

	I must now close my letter & bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & a cold rain day & I will spend it in writing instead of going to church.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from Fannie & one from Anna to Willie.  I am glad Willies admission into college gave you all such pleasure.  It is a high honor to enter junior class.  I hope Willie arrived safely at home last night & told you all about Columbia.  All who saw him were pleased with his appearance.  Burt regretted very much not seeing him.  Yeadon did not make his acquaintance which he regretted.

	I have not seen Col. O�Hanlon but twice.  Yeadon enquired how old our youngest child was & on being told six months, he said he was afraid that it would be a long time before his namesake would make his appearance.  

	I have written to Col. Orr about Frank & told him you had your heart very much set on the appointment.

	Tell Fannie I thank her for her letter & she must write me another.  Tell Frank if I come home next Saturday he may go down with me on Monday.  I am anxious to see you all & Sunday is a miserable to spend in Columbia.  I shall get back on Monday to sit in the evening.  There is nothing, however, before the Legislature in which I take much interest.  It will cost me nothing to go & come back, & it will be delightful to see you & the children once more.  It seems almost an age since I left home.  So many things have taken place.

	I gave my note to Westfield for $850 for the two $500 Bonds.  I am to pay the 25th of December.  I shall write Elford to make payment by that to me.  Westfield has other bonds to sell but he asks &12.50cts more for each one of the others which is what I gave Co. Perrin.

	Tell Anna to write me.  [Peter] Stokes says that his little daughter writes him almost every day.  Tell Hext I will get him some presents & Hayne also.  I almost forget how Arthur looks. 
	I saw Paul Hayne yesterday evening.  He is lecturing here, & says he is coming to Greenville.  He looks the same & enquired about you all.

	Tom Jones came down the other day & said he wanted Frank to come with him.  I see Pools son here.  It seems that almost one half of Greenville has been here.

	Col. Al[l]stons wife & daughter came up yesterday he says to console him in case of his defeat for governor.  But I suppose to enjoy the pleasures of his election.  She is a very pleasant lady & smart.  Most of the ladies have gone & amongst them Mrs. LeConte who was a great Belle & dresses most magnificently.  She seems [word obscured] ambitious of the notice of gentlemen as if she was a single lady wishing to make conquests.  I admire her husband a great deal more than I do her.

	I was invited the other evening to a large party at Captain Adam� but did not go.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Theodore Croft wishing the appointment of aid to the Governor for Edward.  He writes most urgently.

	I have seen nothing of Alex Taylor or his family.  General Martin I see every day.

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot.  Must stop to have my room cleaned up.

	The members all seem astonished that I can find time to write my wife every day.  If they loved theirs as I do mine they too would find time.  But I do not tell them so.  Indeed I think most of them care very little about their wives when absent.  We are a model couple.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now past twelve oclock in the night & I have just returned from Mr. Yeadons supper to the Press.

	Burt & Aldrich dined with me today & I could not write you.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.  Several letters came to me tonight &  one to Willie from Willie Beattie which I enclose.

	I have spent the day rather in a dis�way & have not time now to write you.

	I will do better tomorrow.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot in lieu of one to yourself.

	I have nothing of interest.  We had considerable debate today on the slave trade & I took a part in it.

	You will see that Al]l]ston is elected Governor.  I went up to Mrs. Al[l]ston at the supper table & congratulated her on the election.  She seems very meek & modest about it.  Mr. Petigru was sitting by her side & he is much pleased.

	Dr. T. Croft is here & wishes an aid�for Edward Croft Theodore�s son.

	You must not trouble yourself about Willie�s room [word obscured] will do very well.  I will see about a set of drawers for him.

	I am glad you are having the hogs killed.  It is now turning warm again.

	I had a very pleasant evening with Burt yesterday.  He enquired very kindly about you & the children & says he is coming to Greenville next summer.

	Col. Dudl[e]y told me a great deal about Miss Sparks.  His daughter is just married & will be here this week.

	If you desire to you can come down with me next Monday as I expect to go home Saturday if the weather is good.  It would give me great pleasure to have you here but the company of ladies is very much broke off.  There are however some still here & others coming.  Mrs. Sullivan came yesterday�Mrs. Allston the day before.  Col. Carn says Mrs. Allston elected the Col. on the first ballot.  If she had not been here there would have been another ballot, that she got him more than seven votes.

	I am glad to hear Arthur has another tooth.  How I should like to see the little fellows tooth & kiss him.

	I must now quit & go to bed as I slept very little last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Anna

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & thank you for it.  I was sorry your mother did not write me also.

	Tell Willie I bought him, today, & paid for it $14 a nice Mahogany set of drawers with a glass on top.  Bowers from whom I made the purchase is to send it down to College for him when he comes down.

	I have seen a good many persons here who enquired after you.  Mr. Evans did bring his bride with him.  Mr. Sparks & his bride were to have been here tonight.

	Jane Adams is not with her Father in Columbia nor none of his family.  He quits Columbia tomorrow & says he is most happy so to do.  Governor Allston is just as happy to begin his administration as Governor Adams is to end his.  I am invited to a champaign party tomorrow after the Inauguration to meet Mrs. Allston & was requested to bring with me any ladies I might have under my charge.  I wish your mother & you were here for the inauguration.  

	The ladies seem to gather about the state House more now than they did last week.

	Waddy Williams has just come into my room to borrow $20 to pay his expences & get home.  He says he does not suit the man in whose employment he is staying, & I expect he tells the truth.  I told him I would let him have enough money to pay his expences home in the morning.

	I am writing in great haste & must conclude.  Tell Fannie I will write her a letter tomorrow & tell her all about the Inauguration of the Governor.

	Give my love to your mother & tell her Mr. Yeadon has written to his wife what she wrote me.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Fannie

	I promised to write you this evening but really I have not time.  Enclosed I send you a letter to the Patriot which will give you an account of the Governors Inauguration.  There were a great many young ladies present & some very pretty ones.  The Governors daughter is quite pretty & about as old as Anna.

	Tell your mother that I rece[ive]d her letter this morning, but as I expect to be at home Saturday night I will reserve what I have to write her till I return.  I look forward with great pleasure to seeing you all again.  It seems to have been an age since I left home.  I will stay with you Sunday & go to church & return Monday.  The Legislature sits now at night so I will get back to sit Monday.  Saturday nothing is done.

	I am glad to hear you & Hext are going to school & doing well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip with Mary Cleveland into the country.

	Next May I will carry all of you to Columbia as we can go down for nothing & return for nothing to attend the Rail Road convention.  That will be pleasant to take you & Anna & your mother & Hext & Hayne & Frank & stay two or three days. 

	I saw Paul Hayne this evening.  He says he will be in Greenville in January.  He enquired particularly after Anna.

	Mr. Elford writes he will be here tomorrow.  Your affectionate Father, give my love to your mother, & Anna & the children.  How happy I shall be to see them all Saturday night & I will bring you oranges & candy & a silver knife.  B.F. Perry

	I arrived here safely this evening & found very little done in my absence.  Dr. Furman has invited me to dine at his mess tomorrow & I may not be able to write you.  Enclosed I send a letter for the Patriot.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  Today was very cold, but I am glad that I went home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

This morning I went into court & then to the Legislature & sat till four oclock & thence to dine with Dr. Furman.  Then I went back to the Legislature & have just returned from the House fatigued & tired.  We adjourn on Saturday & I will return Sunday night.  There is to be an extra train to carry us up on Sunday.

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Dr. Furman & in going there I met Miss Brenan in the street & shook hands with her & had some little chat.  She enquired kindly after you & mother.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Enclosed I send you a letter for the Patriot, & also one from Col. Orr.  I rece[ive]d your letter tonight about eleven oclock.  I dined with Col. Wilson & then went to the House.  I was invited to dine with Mr. [Francis] Lance & also with J[ames] J[ohnston] Pettigrew.  Tomorrow I am engaged to dine with Col. Hampton.  He invited me Tuesday but I was engaged.

	I went to see Willies room today & ordered it to be cleaned & the furniture moved into it.  I also looked at the furniture he bought & think he paid enough for it.  Mrs. Simons & the Speaker [James Simons] went down to the College yesterday to see their sons room opposite & are fitting it up very handsomely.  I saw President McCay & he went with me to the room & carried me over [to] his House.  I called at Mrs. Greenes & paid the fifty dollars towards Willies board. 

	I have no time to commit on your estimate of moneys to be received in January.  We shall adjourn Saturday & I will reach home Sunday night.

	The Bundle of�& the shoes for Anna have been sent me by Mrs. Taylor.  I have them in my trunk.

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Col. Wilson & many friends.  It seems I shall not have an opportunity of dining at the Hotel at all again this Session.  The Parish members have  taken a great liking to me & over burden me with their hospitality.

	In great haste kiss the children & believe me your affectionate husband.  It is now near midnight.  B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night, but I dined with Col. Hampton & had not time to write.  

	You must not erase my editorials.  If you do I must quit sending them to you.

	It is possible that I may get home Saturday night.  [William Adolphus] Mooney & [John Wickliffe] Stokes go up this morning.  The business will all be finished today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
