My dear Sir

	The Bond old old Major McKinney to make Titles to his sons Preston, Wilson & Jesse gave them no interest in the land which could be levied on & sold by the Sheriff.  It only conveyed to the purchaser the interest which the Son had in the land as an heir to the old Major.  

	The Bond of the Sons to their Father is only to let the old man & woman have the use of the House during their lives & pay them the interest annually on nine hundred dollars.  This is all that would be recovered   if suit were brought & the sons were able to pay it.  Each one of the sons is only liable for his three hundred dollars.

	I think the better course to pursue is to file a Bill in Equity for a partition & sale of the Land, as the Real Estate of the old major McKinney & divide out the proceeds amongst his heirs.  The old Lady would be intitled to one third which would support her.  The children to an equal share, each, of the other two thirds, or if any of the children have sold their interest or it has been sold by the sheriff the purchaser of such interest would take the childs part thus sold.  

	But before a decision & payment is made each child would have to account for advancements received from the old major during his life time so as to make them all equal.

	If the personal estate has not been settled in the ordinary�s office, Mr. Robinson should have a final settlement then & a decree by the ordinary as to the amount each one has received & what is still due each child.  All advancements in the life time of Major McKinney to each child to be accounted for in this settlement.  The Bonds should be treated as a�as they have never been complied with & now cannot be on the part of the sons.  For I presume they are all insolvent.

	If Mr. Robinson is disposed to pursue this course & will furnish me with the names of the children or heirs of old Major McKinney & the name of his widow I will file the Bill for him.  If any of them live out of the state the Bill must be filed three months before Equity court.  He had better therefore act at once.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I have written you two letters & desired information from you on both of them.  Your neglect in answering my letters is not only wrong, but wanting in this respect you owe your Father.  I hope you will not do so again.  Your letters to your mother, Frank & Anna is not a sufficient excuse for you.  They contain very little information as to the College, Professors, your studies & associates.

       I am very much pained to hear of the distrust once in College.  All who are concerned in these riots & disorderly conduct ought to be expelled at once.  They should be cut of from the College in order to prevent their cr[u]el example from influencing others.

	Honor & duty, the highest sense of honor, should make every student conform to all the rules & regulation of the College when he enters it.  He who violates them willfully does not possess an honorable heart.

	I charge you as my son & as you regard my love & your own honor & happiness & prosperity & success in life to keep aloof from all such conduct & from all who are guilty of such conduct.  Do not go out of your room at night.  Pursue your studies diligently.  Be obedient to the Professors, kind & civil to all of your fellow students and strictly keep & obey all the College laws.

	I gave you a letter to President McCay.  Did you deliver the letter?  Has he said anything to you in reference to it?  How often have you been examined by the Professors.  How did you stand your examination?  How do you like the College & Professors & Students?  Who are your most interesting associates?  Do you keep a regular account of all your expences?  When you are in want of money, let me know & what you want it for.  But do not go in debt for a single day.  This has ruined many a young man in college.	

	You ought to have written who were suspended.  Their names will be reported to me as one of the Board of Trustees in May next.  It cannot therefore be kept a secret from me.  

	Let me know how Buist, Hayne, Wardlaw, Cain, & Memminger are doing.  I hope none of them are engaged in the disturbances of the College, for I know them & their Parents & feel an interest in them, & also in Simons & Pinckney.

	I am glad to hear you have a good roommate & I shall always feel an interest in him on your account.  I think you did well to get off the first story where�frequent & Thiery �break through & steal.�

	The College here is doing well.  The have one hundred & fifty students and a prospect of three hundred.  The Female college has seventy five.  Anna & Fannie & Frank & Hext are doing well and studying hard.

	I am sorry to say your mother has been unwell.  She had a high fever Saturday night Sunday & Sunday night.  Was confined to her bed till Monday morning.  She then came down stairs & lay on the sofa.  This morning she is better & no return of fever.  I hope it has passed over but I was yesterday very much afraid she would have a severe spell of typhoid fever which I dread as much as the smallpox.  It has been so fatal to the families of both of my brothers.

	I rece[ive]d yesterday a piece of�wedding cake and was shown a likeness of him & his bride both very fine looking.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son 

	Your mother has just sent me word that I must write to you this evening.  I thought Anna was going to write you.

	Your letter last Monday has already been answered by Frank or your mother.  I have nothing in the way of news to communicate.

	Poinsett Wells tells me he sees you very often.  I hope you do not neglect your studies, or frequent the Public Houses.  Keep away from them as idle places.

	I am truly sorry to learn that the students are misbehaving in any way.  They ought to consider it a point of honor to conform to all the rules & regulations of the College.  Be careful never to violate any College rule, & I warn you to keep aloof from all idle & bad associates.  As sure as you come in contact with them you are corrupted.  

	Your ought to read History when you have leisure from your regular studies.  Now is the time to improve yourself & acquire information.

You speak of wishing to return to Greenville in April.  The expence is considerable & the time you will loose important.  Are the Professors willing to grant leave of absence to you?  For you must not think of coming without their permission granted.

	When I was of your age, how much would I have given to have had your present opportunities of acquiring information.  I remember at Asheville when I was sixteen years old. I studied twelve or fifteen hours every day.

	I desire you to take exercise, but always be in your room at night.  Never leave it after dark.  The mantle of the night is the defence of the wicked for then they escape detection.

	We are all well.  Your Robert Foster died the other day, a drunkards death.  How mortifying to his old Father!

	You must write me often.  I liked your letter on Monday very much.  It was sensible &�, Yours &c., B.F. Perry

 My dear Son

	Your letter was rece[ive]d Saturday evening & enclosed I send you twenty dollars more which you must take care to keep & spend judiciously.  Your expences in college are amounting to a good deal more than I expected.  

	In return for these expences I hope you will endeavour to improve your time & opportunities to the very best advantage.  Strive by hard study and good conduct to reward your Parents for all their care, troubles & expence in your education.

	Guard against the first step in vice & immorality.  The second step is easier than the first & so on to ruin.  The same too in regard to your studies.  I hope you will distinguish yourself in your class.  You must have studied a good deal in the course you are now going over.  This ought to make it easy for you to keep ahead of your fellows.

	Sam McClanahan is the person who told me that he saw you in Columbia.  The name of the young lady is Mary McLain of Spartanburgh.  The suit was brought by me against John Baldwin of this district.  

	Why is it that I have rece[ive]d no report from the Faculty as to your progress in college.  More than there months have elapsed since you entered college?  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. You say you have a bad cold.  Be careful to wear your winter clothing throughout the spring.  There is more danger from colds, at this season of the year than any other, & more danger of catching them.  Never change your dress too soon in the spring.  Remember this through life.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday morning, & the weather is so unlikely that we shall not go to church.  Willie & Frank have gone to the Presbyterian church.  Your mother �read this morning�is resting on the bed & has directed me to write you a letter.  I have nothing my dear daughter to write except that we have had a very pleasant time in Columbia.  There has been a great crowd of ladies here, but they have all gone.

	President McCay and his wife came to see us yesterday & invited us to take tea with them tomorrow evening.  Your mother however declines going.  Susan Hayne came to see your mother & took her to Col. Taylors.  Mrs. Taylor is in delicate health�dines with them Friday.

	Willie is looking very well & stands thirteen in a class of sixty five.  Considering he is the youngest boy in his class I think he has done well.  But he is not on�& does not�himself in studying.

	Anna Ware & two of her companions�here Friday.  Col. Ware was here.  Anna looks well & seems pleased with her school.  

	I am sorry to hear of the decision in your May day celebration.  You ought to have written to us.  I hope your oranges were rece[ive]d in time for supper.  Your mother will return home Wednesday evening & you must direct Wiley to be there with the Barouche to take her from the depot. I shall have to remain a day or two longer.

	The Society all seemed kind & enquired kindly about you.  Frank & Fannie & Hext & all enjoying themselves very much.  Arthur does well & has given very little trouble.

	Col. O�Hanlon came to see us & invited Hext to go & stay with him.  He seems as kind as ever. 

	We had greeted a number of girls here from Greenville, Abbeville & Newberry.  Col. Fairs daughter is about as tall as her mother.

	Willie says he saw Augustus Townes Bride as she passed this way�and was pleased with her.  

	Tell your aunt Susan that your mother rece[ive]d her letter & thanks her kindly for it.

	I hope you & Hayne are well & doing well & that all the servants getting on well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Tell your aunt Susan that your mother can find no chair to suit her.

My dear Liz

	I feel very lonesome since you & the children have left me.  I met Miss Mary Jones after dinner & said I was lonely & she said I looked so.

	After you started I walked up with Willie to the Court House.  He went on to the College to study his lessons.  Whilst at the Court House I met General Thompson & Col. Preston.  Thompson looks pale but otherwise very well.  He says Mrs. Thompson is quite well, & he speaks in high terms of her surgeon Dr. Sims who went from the upper part of South Carolina & then was a man of no reputation.  He now makes by his profession $40,000 annually!  General Thompson & family will go up with me Saturday.

	When I returned from Court I wrote a letter to the Patriot.  Then I walked in the piazza & Dr. LeConte came & invited me into his parlor where Mrs. LeConte was.  She invited me to join her party & take a seat at her table.  I did so.  Col. Johnson was with me & we spent a pleasant time at the table.  Mrs. LeConte says there was an awful destruction of hoops & dresses last night at the May day celebration.  She said the hoops were pressed out of all shape & the strawberries & ice creams were handed over the heads of the ladies.  Every now & then she could hear the expression from some lady �Oh me look how they have ruined my dress.�   The Professor says two nights in succession have used him up.

	I met Governor Allston who carried me into his Parlor & regretted not seeing you.  He said two Miss Harlans   came up with him & enquired who they were.  He said they were in company with a fine looking woman who was a suspicious character & the conductor refused to tell him her name.  They must have been on board the cars with you.

	Professor Barnwell & his sister Miss E. Barnwell called to see you about one oclock & expressed great regret at your absence.  They left their cards, but I did not see them.

	Col. Preston expressed his regret at not knowing you were here.  General Thompson regretted that you were gone.  

	The Board of Trustees meet in the Court House instead of the College Library tonight for the accommodation of Judge O�Neall & Judge Glover who are in bad health.  I am glad of it, as it will save me a long walk in the night.

	President McCay called to see me this morning & sat with me an hour talking about the college.

	I hear the Greenville cars coming in & will quit writing to you & see the arrivals.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening & hear that you reached home safely & found all well Minerva better.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I wish I had kept Hext with me or Arthur for company.  I had rather have Arthur but for the nursing & care.  I found a tooth brush & handkerchief of Franks.

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College Exhibition & it is now half past ten oclock (you like to know the hour & time I am writing to you).  I have lighted a segar & will write you a few lines whilst I smoke it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear that you arrived safely at home.  I was anxious about you.  I am glad to hear that you found all well except Minerva & Marys baby & that they are better.  I hope poor Minerva may be restored to her mind.  It is a sad thing to be without reason.    I hope too Marys baby is better.  Nurse it & take care of it & let Minerva have every attention that she may require.  My feelings are always�on the side of pitty & suffering.  If I were endowed with omnipotent power, I would make every human being happy in this life & relieve any�want of mankind.

	The speaking in College was tolerable.  Willie came to see me this morning & introduced his chum [Fredertick Gustavus] Behre to me.  I invited them to take tea with me tomorrow evening.  Behre is genteel modest looking young man.  He blushes like a woman.  I saw his face suff� with blushes as he came up to be introduced.  I told him you were anxious to see him & he blushed again.  I have taken a fancy to him.

	Mr. Barnwell came up to me on the rostrum this evening & expressed his regret at not seeing you.

	I delivered your compliments to Mrs. LeConte at the supper table & she said she was charmed with you.  She said she had seldom seen a lady in whom she felt so much interest.  I told her that you reciprocated her feelings.  She had spoken to me in the morning about sending you the patterns.

	I have been engaged all day in College business.  I was appointed Chairman of a committee by the Governor at our meeting last night for this purpose with Senator DeSaussure & Col. Townsend which I regard as a compliment.

	When I went to the chapel this evening amidst a crowded house President McCay rose & came forward to greet me.  He seemed extremely kind & obliging.  I could not see Willie, but I suppose he saw me.  As we returned from the College there was a bonfire on the campus said to be the chairs & tables taken out of the room of Professor Pelham.  He was standing by me when someone told him what it was!  He said nothing.

	Goodlett & Donaldson came down this evening & told me about the Kansas meeting.  Col. Johnson of Charlotte walked with me to the College this evening & insists very much on my going to the Mecklinburgh celebration on the 20th.  It is to be a great occasion.  I am half inclined to go if I can spare the time.  I shall see Governor Swain, & all the great men of North Carolina & can reach there in one day from Greenville.

	The clock has now struck eleven & my segar is most out�my paper most filled & I must bid you good night.  I wish you & Arthur were here again.  Willie sends his love to you all.  Give my love to all the children & believe me your most affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Send my letter to the Patriot which is enclosed to you.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night which has helped me much to hear of the difficulties in college again.  
I shall come down to the meeting of the Board [page torn of Trustees].

	I am terribly sorry that you went with your class in refusing to recite to President McCay.  College Boys have no right to take [text obscured by torn page] but they must obey the college laws whilst there.  They are {page torn] the authority of the Trustees & the College will never do any good whilst such conduct is tolerated by the Faculty.

Dear Mamma

	Papa told me to write to you tonight, as he is too busy, being obliged to meet the trustees tonight at half past 7.  I am in a hurry myself, so will make this letter very short. It is not necessary to write a long one, inasmuch as Pa and myself will both be at home Friday evening, that is day after tomorrow evening.

	Papa is going to take me to Harvard University when he goes on with Anna & Frank this summer.  You may accordingly expect us Friday evening, so send Wiley with the carriage, to the depot for us.
The trustees met this morning and heard the statement of McCay, and the rest of the Faculty, from them Pa says he does not think that McCay has lied.  Some of the Trustees, and Pa amongst the number, are in favor of disbanding the College, electing new Professors &c.

	I haven�t time to write more as I want to carry this letter up street tonight and mail it.

	I have barely time to write you a line before breakfast.  Last night I was at the College till midnight.  We had a very full Board of Trustees & they are unanimous in the belief that President McCay has been slandered & wronged.  There is a decided disposition to make all the Professors resign.  Nothing yet has been done although we had two meetings yesterday.

	Willie will return with me.  I am done with sending my sons to this College.  The Students will all be dismissed this evening I expect by the Board of Trustees.  I shall send Willie to Harvard college.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning.  I enquired at the Post office & was told nothing for me.

	Old Mr. & Mrs. Pinckney are here & enquired about you & their daughter M�.  Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly about you & expressed great admiration for you.  She repeated that of all the ladies she had met in Columbia you were her favorite.  She is very much excited about the College difficulties & takes a warm part for McCay.  She gave me a talk of two hours the night I arrived here in explanation & vindication of McCay.  I never saw a lady more excited.  She says that when she is a friend is in distress she then shares her friends strife.

	Mr. Arthur went to Abbeville with me.  My case was not reached.  I shall not go back to Abbeville if I can avoid it.  The Hotel is shocking.  I have never seen hotter weather.

	I have a great deal to write you but really not time to say more at present.  I told Willie to write you last evening.  I reached here Tuesday evening.

	Have the Barouche for me & Willie At the depot Friday evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Dear Sir

	Your letter was received last night dated June 4th, and I can assure you has given me great concern & anxiety.

	You say that my remarks, in a letter from Columbia about �a Bride� have been republished in the Georgia newspapers and applied to your wife.  They are without name, place or date of occurrence, and it was not supposed they could identify or illustrate any one.  Much less were they intended to implicate the virtue or honor of �a Bride.�  Such was not the belief of my informant.

Flirtations are very common in fashionable lifer, & some times very provoking to husbands, but they do not necessarily imply guilt of �a damning nature to a Ladys�,� nor is such implication due the term flirtation.

	I can assure you both my informants & myself did feel a deep sympathy & interest in the history of �a Bride�, and if I had supposed that my remarks would ever have been seen by her or by any of her acquaintances and by them recognized they never would have been published.

	I am ready to make the explanation of facts, as you desire, but really, it seems to me, that this would only attract public attention & cause enquiries to be made as to the person alluded to, which otherwise would not be.  If I could recall the indiscretion of my remarks, which we really made in deep interest & concern for �a Bride�, most gladly would I do so.  If there was any way, by which I could make correction, without giving renewed injury, it would afford me pleasure to do so.

Chancellor gave me two opium pills which relieved me in the evening.  I was however able to be in court & attend to my business.  This morning I feel quite well.

	I have been very successful in my cases & have gained one which establishes a new principle in South Carolina in regard to the sale of lands & the security of the purchase money.

	We all arrived here yesterday evening & found Willie & Col. Memminger quite well.  They went out to Harvard College this morning & commenced their studies.  Willie caught a cold last night by going to the Theatre.

	I went to the Post office last evening soon after I reached here to get a letter from you, but found none.  We will return to New York in a day or two & write you to meet us in Baltimore as we may not be able to get down to Annapolis.  You can come up to Baltimore & stay all night with us & go back the next day as we go on to Washington.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies & making yourself a good boy at Mr. Greens.  You must behave yourself well, study hard & be obedient to Mrs. Green.  Keep out of all bad company.  We shall be glad to see you in Baltimore if you do not go to Annapolis.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  Give [page torn] our love to Mrs. Green & tell her to make you recite your lessons every day to someone.  If she can employ someone to instruct you & hear your lessons I would be glad.

	Yesterday Mr. Perdicaris met us in Trenton & came down to Burlington with us.  He told us you were pretty well. but that Col.

I hope he is well by this time & that you are all getting on well.  

	I have just seen Mrs. LeConte & she says she said a good word to Professor Pirce for you & has since written him to pay attention to you as the son of her intimate friend.  She says Pirce showed her my letter to him about you, when she was in Cambridge.  I wish you to go & see Professor Pirce &T make yourself known to him.  He will be kind to you, & it will be to your advantage in entering Harvard.

	We were all very much disappointed in Burlington & Bishop Davis school.  Your mother was so much shocked at the idea of Anna�s staying in a room with fourteen other girls that she determined to take her back to Greenville & leave her at some other school.  Today, after seeing Mrs. LeConte she is better reconciled, & I expect Anna will stay there.  Doctor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte will go there with us tomorrow & determine about the matter.  They wish their daughter to go to school there.  We saw their daughter this morning & were pleased with her.

	Anna received several letters from home at Burlington, one from Fannie, Annie, Mary Mauldin, , Tinny Carson & others.  They seem all well.  

	I have heard nothing of Frank yet.  We go to Baltimore Monday & on to Annapolis.  We bought carpeting today $450.00 worth.

	You must write me & direct your letters to Greenville.  Be sure & enter Harvard College.  Study hard whilst in College & before you enter.  Keep out of all bad company & be correct in all things.  Above all things be honorable, & scorn everything mean & less honorable.

	I write you n great haste.  Give my love to Col. Memminger & his son.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear son

	We arrived at home Saturday evening & were glad to receive your letter.  But out return was otherwise a bad one.  We found your aunt Susans S�dead.  She died about the time we reached the depot of scarlet fever.  Last Sunday she was in church & this Sunday she was covered there a corpse.  

	We found Arthur too quite unwell with the prevailing pandemic, but is getting better.   His mother is nursing him again.  He knew us both & seems fond of us.  I hope he will soon be well.  But I am afraid of the scarlet fever spreading in our families.

	We are thankful to be at home once more.  Hext & Hayne are quite well & so is Fannie.  Vardry came up today to see Susan buried.  He looks fat & heavy.  We are qute lonely�you & Willie & Anna.

	I was glad to�had so�loved in�again, & your watch�You will now study hard & be a good boy.  Tell Mr. Miller I am very thankful to him for his kindness to you.

	Your mother says you are the best of all the children in writing to us.  We have heard nothing from Anna or Willie since we left them.  Your acquaintances & friends all enquire about you.  In Columbia we met Frank Cox & Tench Cox.  As we came up the Greenville Rail Road, the freight train had run over a cow which delayed us an hour.  Last Saturday the passenger train ran over a cow just at the depot & turned over the whole train.  The passengers were buried considerably, but no lives were lost.

	Your mother is now writing to Willie.  She wrote to Anna today through Fannie.  You must write to us every day or two & tell us about your studies &�

	I suppose you have received the Patriot before this time which will give you all the�

	I write you in great haste & must now conclude.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Your aunt Anna Hayne died about two weeks ago.  Frank Cox is going to Philadelphia to enter the university of Philadelphia & stay there several days.

Dear Anna,

	I received your letter yesterday evening.  I had been expecting a letter from you, and was glad to hear from you at last.  But I was sorry to see from the beginning of your letter that you have not yet become reconciled to Burlington.  Of course Home is the dearest place in the world, but still we must make up our minds to be away from home some times during our lives.

	You must know from experience that the first two or three weeks that we are away from home go harder than any other.  So if you can bear the first week or two you will get through the rest very well.

	I got through my examination last Saturday, and am glad to say that I was admitted into the Junior Class, which was more than I expected.  The examination [is] a very tough one indeed, and I consider myself fortunate in having passed it as well as I did.  	

	When I last saw you in Boston I was pretty sure I would�nt be able to pass any examination.  I feel a great deal better now, after having got through with it.  The two Memmingers also passed.  We have changed our rooms, and have got better ones than those you saw us in.  But have had to buy our own furniture, which costs a good deal.

	We have�nt good under weigh yet, but will in a few days; then we will have to study pretty hard.

	I have only received four letters since I have been here; one from Frank, two from Pa, and one from you.  I have�nt received any from Greenville, so don�t know how things are going on there.  One of Pa�s letters was written from Burlington, the other from Annapolis.  I suppose Pa & Ma are at home by this time, and that Hayne is well.  

	I am glad to hear that you like some of the girls and hope you will like them all.  You must be rather crowded having so many girls in one room.

	My first vacation will begin the first part of January & end the last part of February.  Pa said that I might go home then and I expect I will do so; if I do I will go by Burlington to see you, certain.

	You made a mistake in your letter in saying that I must have received letters [of] certain young ladies.  You meant that you had heard from them.  I wish I could say I had heard from them too.  You must give my love to them when you write.  My paper is giving out, so I will close.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

Dear Mamma

	I received the letter partly from you, and partly from Pa, yesterday.  Today is Tuesday, and I write now to make up for not writing last Saturday.

       I was very much shocked to hear of poor little Susys death, but hope Aunt Susy will be able to bear it.
       
       You must be glad to be safe at home again, after all the fatigues and annoyances of travelling.  I would like to be with you, though I like this place and College, a great deal better than I expected.  I have got regularly under way now, and have to study pretty hard for we are called up to recite very often, nearly every recitation.  In Columbia we would�nt be called on for weeks at a time.
       
       In my last letter I told you that we were going to change our rooms.  We are now in our new rooms, which Col. Memminger chose.  We have a room a piece.  Col. Memminger also chose the furniture for them which cost about a hundred dollars a piece.  We had to furnish them ourselves as we did in Columbia.  Our boarding is $4.50 cts a week.
       
       I got a letter from Frank, the other day, and one from Anna.  Frank seems satisfied, and I hope Anna is also by this time.  I hope Arthur is well. And that everything is going on well.  If Sue Hoke comes to Boston, I will call to see her.
       
       The way Col. Memminger does about his son�s clothing is this.  He knows a tailor here, and he makes him send his accounts for his son�s clothes directly to him.  The tailor offers to do the same thing for me, that is send the bill for any clothes to Pa, and let him pay for them.  I would like to know if Pa is willing to the arrangement which Col. Memminger thinks is best.
       
       I am writing in a great hurry as it is between recitations, so I will have to close.  I heard from Bill Beattie.  You must write often for you don�t know how much good it does me to get a letter from home, when it is so far off.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Anny & Aunt Susy and all the children, and to Pa.

My dear Son

	This letter will be handed you by Master Waller R. Lane.  He goes to Annapolis to enter the Naval School with you.  I have never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Lane, but our mutual friend Mr. Suber has requested me to give him a letter of Introduction.  I hope you will both be good friends as you come from the same state.   You must take Mr. Lane & introduce him to such of the officers as you know.

	I am now just about returning home from the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the South Carolina College.  Your affectionate Father &c., B.F. Perry

Dear Papa
	I received your letter yesterday and will now write you a few lines to let you know how I am getting on.  I have written two letters home, and one to Anna and one to Frank since I�ve been here.  I will try to write every Saturday.

	Today is Sunday and I will have to go to the Chapel to church directly.  It is worse than in Columbia, for here we have to go to Chapel twice a day, morning and evening.  In Columbia we only had to go once a day.

        The preacher in the Chapel belongs to the Unitarian denomination.  I am glad to hear that you are going to send me some books, but am sorry they are all text-books, for the majority of them will be of no use to me.  I would like to have had some miscel[l]aneous books such as Historys &c., along with them.  But I am glad of any sort.  I suppose you have settled something about the So. Ca. College by this time; what it is I will hear by the Patriot.
       
       I have received three Patriots since I�ve been here.  They all came at once.
       
       I am sorry to hear that you have been unwell, but I hope that you and Arthur are both well by this time.  I was rather unwell myself the othe day but I am perfectly well now.
       
       We changed our boarding because the place we were at when you left, was so bad the rooms, fare, and everything.  The place we are now at is a great deal more convenient to the College.  We have only to cross the street to be in the College yard.  Do you recollect a new building they were erecting in the College yard!  Where [we] are now is nearly opposite, and is�[on] the main street that you came into Cambridge.  There are twelve rooms in the house, and all [are] occupied by students.  Mr. Perdicaris� son is in the same house with us.  I like him very much.  He has gone home at present on account of ill health.  Each of our rooms has a dormitory attached for our beds, and is lighted with gas.  My room joins the oldest Memminger.  The youngest rooms a story above us.  We eat at a house called the �Brattle House� which is kept especially for students, and is just like a fine Hotel.  Some who eat there pay for whatever they call for at each meal.  But I think it cheaper to board by the week as we do. [William Hayne Perry]

My dear Son

	Your examination will take place tomorrow.  Before you read this letter it will be decided whether or not you are a Midshipman. 

        I saw your Lane as I came home going on & gave him a letter to you.  He looked like a good Boy.

	You must write me all about your examination & the students & Professors.

	You may tell Mrs. Blake that I know her sister Mrs. Pendergrast.  I travelled with her from Portsmouth to Washington in the spring of 1853 with General Thompson.

	I have just written a letter to Willie.  He has written but one letter to us since he has been at Harvard.  I told him to write to you & Anna.  

	You must give my thanks to Mr. Miller for his attentions to you & to Mrs. Green.  

	We are all well except Arthur.   He is getting better I hope.

	Willie Long has come back from the Asylum perfectly restored.  Mr. Westfield lost his little son yesterday.  There has been a great deal of sickness with children.  

	I will send you tomorrow a certificate of moral character if required.  Perhaps Mr. Miller & Mrs. Green could give you one that would answer.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

I have just returned from Columbia & found all well except little Arthur who is getting better I hope.  But he is still very feeble.

	We restored all the old Professors in the College except President McCay who did not desire to go back.  No President was elected.

	Your last letter to your mother I have not seen.  But was glad to hear you were better satisfied with the school.  I have written to Bishop Doone to let you go & spend some days with the Pedicaris during vacation.

	I saw Col. Memminger yesterday & he told me all about Willie & his sons.  They are all doing well at Harvard, but I have rece[ive]d only one letter from Willie.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Yesterday Mr. Westfield lost his little son, & Willie Long has returned from the Asylum quite restored.

	The schools here are doing well.  I suppose you saw Susan Hoke as she went on.  I was in hope Miss Caldwell would stop at Burlington to go to school.  

       The Governor was here yet with is family.  Greenville has been quite gay this summer & we have had a great deal of company here.  

         This morning a letter was sent from the Post office for you directed to Burlington.  It had no post stamp on it & we put one on it & forwarded it to you.  I suppose it was from some little girl who forgot about the stamp.
       
       This is Sunday & I am in great haste.  I will write you a longer letter the next time.    Your grand Mother & Aunt Susan are all well.

My dear Son

	I rece[ive]d yours & Mr. Millers letters this evening, & I have written to Col. Orr & Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury to try & get the Secretary of the Navy to have you reconsidered by a Board of Physicians in Washington.  I hope we may be successful.  But if not you can come home & prepare yourself for some other Profession.  It may all be for the best & so you must not grieve at your misfortune.  It is owing to no fault of yours.  But in the meantime you must study & remain with Mrs. Green till our application to the Secretary of the navy is known.  If you cannot get in the Navy, I suppose you can come home by yourself.  It is impossible now for me to leave here as my courts are coming.  We shall all be glad to see you at home again.  I will forward you a check to defray your expenses.  If you are not admitted I think you had better think of medicine as a Profession & perhaps you will do as well in that line as any other.  Your trip to Annapolis will have improved you & it has been pleasant.

	But I still have hopes for you.  Could you not speak to Captain Blake or get Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller to speak to him to intercede with the Secretary of the Navy & have you reexamined.

	We are all well but Arthur.  He is getting better.  You must give our love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & thank them for all of their kindness to you.

	I will write also myself to the Secretary of the navy & get Col. Pickens to write to the President with whom he is intimate.
	  
	Willie & Anna are well.  We heard from them tonight & they are both pleased with their schools& doing well.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I have received two letters from you this week, one of yesterday morning for which I am much obliged.  I also got a letter from Pa this morning, and one from Anna.  It is Saturday. And now nearly dinner time so I will have to stop writing directly, and finish this letter tomorrow or this evening.  You see a picture of the College at the head of this letter, which you may not recognize at first view.

	I�ll write my first letters to my friends on this paper, so that [they] may have an idea of what sort of place I am at.  My letters must travel very slow, for I have written three home, & to Anna & Frank, yet you don�t seem to have got but one of them.  I will write once a week, but you must tell Fannie to write, and write yourself, so that I may hear oftener than that.  Home is so far off, that I value the letters from there on account of the distance they have come.  It is now dinner time so I will close for a while.

	I have just returned from dinner, and will add a little to this letter now, and finish tomorrow (Sunday).  In my last letter, I gave all the particulars about my room, the College &c., so that I have�nt much to tell you.  I did�nt mention in my last, anything about Pringle.  I like him very much indeed.  His father was on here a short time after you left.  He has a sister living in New-Haven.  He is in the sophomore class.

	I got the trunk of book day-before yesterday, but they came by express, and I have�nt heard anything of Mr. Long or Sue Hoke.  I have not been to Boston to see whether they have been at the hotel or not.  For a great many of the books I have no use, but some I am glad to have; I�m glad you sent the shirts and desk.  I borrowed a key to open the latter.  Chancellor Dunkin called to see myself and the Memmingers the other day.  He was very kind, and said that I must mention he had called, and remember him to Pa, and particularly to you.  He graduated here.

	From Pa�s letter I see that they have re-elected the old Professors, so I suppose the students will return.  They have the students under very good government here.  I don�t think there is any danger of their rebelling.

	From Anna�s letter she seems to be better satisfied that when she first wrote to me.  I got a letter from Jim Moore, the same day I received your first mentioning, also, the marriage of Miss Hamilton and Lamb, which must have created quite a sensation in Greenville.  The Memmingers received letters a day or two afterwards, mentioning the same thing.  [William Hayne Perry]

My dear Son

	I was in hopes to have heard from you again last night.  This is Sunday.  I shall hear from Col. Orr tomorrow & will then write you again.  I have written to the Secretary of the Navy & to Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury whom I know personally.  I have also written to Captain Blake.

	You had better see Captain Blake & consult with him about your application to the Secretary of the Navy for reexamination by the Board of Physicians in Washington.  Get him to give you a letter to the Secretary, & go up to Washington & present yourself to the Secretary & tell him you wish to be reexamined & that you think you are able to perform all the duties required of you.  By the time you reach Washington the Secretary will have recei[ve]d my letter & Col. Orr�s & perhaps Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury will have seen him.  If your chest is fit for service you will be admitted & if it is not you had better not enter the Navy.  You can then return home & pursue your studies till you are educated.  When you have been thoroughly educated you can study medicine, & I will send you to Philadelphia to attend the medical Lectures.  You will make yourself a useful & great Doctor I hope.  If you prefer any other Profession when educated you shall be allowed to pursue it.

	I do not wish you to be grieved at all at what has occurred.  It is no fault of yours & we shall all be glad to see you at home.  

	As soon as I hear from Col. Orr I will write you again.  I suppose you are soon enough to go to Washington by yourself.  My circuit is about commencing & I cannot possibly leave home or I would go immediately to Annapolis for you.

	Perhaps you can fall in company with someone going to Washington, who will carry you to the Secretary of the Navy.  In Washington, if you will call on Mr. Bradl[e]y or Mr. Carlyle, & tell them whose son you are either of them will assist you or if you will go to Mr. Howell Cobb Secretary of the Treasury & make yourself known he will be kind to you.  Thomas Thurston is in one of the offices in Washington.

	I will send you in my next letter a check to defray your expences home in case you have to come home.  I suppose you can come by yourself.  Bring your ticket in Washington to Weldon and at Weldon purchase one to Columbia.  Come home by Charlotte, the same rout[e] that you went.

	Consult with Mr. Miller & get him to assist you and advise you as to your action in all things.  Perhaps you might get Mr. Miller to go with you to Washington.

	Since writing this letter Col. Pickens who will be elected to the United States Senate in the place of Judge Butler has been in my office and given me a letter of introduction for you to the Secretary of the Navy.  You take it & give it to Mr. Yancey &perhaps he will admit you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I received your welcome letter yesterday morning.  Today is Sunday.  I have just returned from breakfast, and have an hour or two to spare before going to church, so I will drop you a few lines to let you know that I am still flourishing in this land of yankees.  There is no danger of my getting bad for want of preaching, for I have to go to the Chapel twice every Sunday.  In Columbia I had only to go once a day.  I am getting on very well, and am glad to heart that you are better satisfied than at first.  There is nothing like getting used to a thing.  My friends are getting to be more punctual than they were.  I got a letter from Bill Beattie, and am expecting another every day.  He was at Glenn�s Springs for some time, which was the reason he did�nt write sooner.  Jim Moore has also written to me.

	Tell Miss Jennie Carson that there is no danger of my forgetting Greenville while she stays there.  Give her my love.  I would like to have a correspondent like her.  

	I suppose you have heard the great event in Greenville :viz: Miss Hamilton�s run-away match with Lamb, who they say is a complete drunkard.  I expect they both brought their pigs to a bad market, as the saying is.  I get most of my Greenville news from Frank, who I hope has passed his examination by this time, and is strutting about with his midshipman�s clothes and gold watch.

	I have heard nothing of Mr. Long, and Sue Hoke.  I have received a trunk of books, which Ma said she was going to send by them; but it came to me by Express.  They must have left Boston out of their route.  I have to study pretty hard.  Whenever I want any amusement I can go to Boston to the Theatre, which is next to the largest in the United States.  I have been there several times, and saw some very fine acting.  I and the Memmingers always go together.  There is a Pringle, also here, from Charleston Aunt Brewton�s nephew, who I like very much, and am very intimate with.  He is in soph Class.

	Do you recognize the picture at the head of this letter.  I write you on this paper so as to send you the picture, but the paper is so small that I don�t think I will write on it again.  I have not room to say half what I want.  I shall have to stop for want of room.  You must write to me soon.  You wont have much else to do, in your vacation.  I will call to see you on my way home, and will see about taking you with me.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

P.S. I have sent you another letter to Miss Branch.

My dear Daughter

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you last night, and you complain of my not writing you.  Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much in her letters that I did not think it worthwhile for me to write you.

	I suppose she has told you about Frank�s rejection which grieves her very much, but I care very little about it.  We are making an effort to have him examined by a Board of Medical men in Washington.  If he is not admitted, he will return home & commence his studies at the Furman university with a view of making himself a doctor.  I think this will suit him as well as the navy.

	I hope you will stand�& enter a high class.  Consult with your teachers & study those branches in which you are deficient.

	I am glad you are becoming better satisfied with your school, teachers, & students.   You must not be spending all your money in dressing.  You had better keep your money to buy dresses when you quit school.  I see no necessity for your dressing fine at school.  It is all folly & extravagance.  Your moth is imprudent in this particular & our kind.  I hope your good sense will stop your shopping at once.  Wear the clothes you have & buy no more.

       I wrote to the Bishop to let you go & spend a few days at Mr. Pedicaris if he called for you.  But you must not stay there long.  Return to your school & study hard.  Your return home depends on it.  You have gone to Burlington to study & not to visit or receive visits.  I am opposed to your being visited by young men or boys whilst at school.  It is contrary to the value of the school, & I do wish to make you an exception.  

	I know that Sue Hoke was very anxious to stop & see you.  I suppose she will as she returns.  But then she will be with Crayton & his wife who will not be willing to stop.  It may be you will not see her.

	We shall be glad to hear from you as often as possible, but you must not let your correspondence interfere with your studies.  My great ambition is to have my children well educated, & they ought to improve the opportunities I give them.  You have mind & capacity for study, & I have confidence in your inclination & ambition to study.  I think you have more of these qualities than my sons.

	We are all pretty well except poor little Arthur, & he is improving.  I was very much afraid when we returned home that we should loose the dear child.  He was very puny & looked badly.  I was shocked when I saw him.  His death would have been a bitter sting to me through life, as I should have attributed it to our going off & leaving him.

	We rece[ive]d a letter from Willie the other day.  He is doing well & quite well but has been unwell.  He is pleased with Harvard.  Mr. Perdicaris�s son is in bad health & has had to return home.  Col. Memmingers sons are well.

	I have sent you the Patriot & you must enquire for it at the Post office.  It will give you the news of the village.  Give my respects to your teachers & believe me your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Col. Orr says you had better take his letter & go on & see the Secretary if you do not hear from him in a few days.  I think you had better go at once & see the Secretary.

	I am sorry I did not hear from you tonight.  Col. Orr writes me he wrote a very strong letter for you to the Secretary.

My dear Son

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from the Secretary of the Navy ordering you to go on to Washington and to be reexamined by a Board of Physicians there.

	If you have not already gone on to Washington you will do so immediately & report yourself to the Secretary of the Navy.  I hope now you will be admitted.

	It may be that after the Secretary rece[ive]d Col. Orrs letter he wrote to you to go on to Washington.  I did not tell him where you were & consequently he wrote to me directing me to send you to Washington.  Col. Orr wrote him where you were.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Cobb Secretary of the Treasury also tonight informing [me] that he had been to see the Secretary of the Navy & had got a favorable decision.

	When the Secretary receives Col. Orr�s letter & General Thompsons, Judge Evans & Col. Pickens he will certainly be favorable so far as lies in his power.  When he wrote me he had rece[ive]d none of them.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & was truly glad to hear from you & to hear you were well.

	I hope now my dear son that you will enter the naval school.  Your mother is delighted at the idea of your reexamination.  She was greatly distressed before.  

 
	When I hear from you again I hope to hear good news.  You must use as much of the check as you wish which I sent you & the remainder keep for future use.  We will go on & see you next summer.  

	You must tender my sincere thanks to Mr. Miller, but for his letter I should not have know what to do.

	We rece[ive]d a letter from Anna & one from Willie yesterday & tonight.  They are both well.  Anna is distressed at your rejection & Willie will be when he hears it.  

	We are all well except Arthur.  He is better.  In haste yours &c., B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I received your letter yesterday morning, and have just time now to begin to answer it, as today is Sunday, and I will have to go to the Chapel soon to attend service.  Our Chaplain is of the Unitarian denomination and most of the Faculty are of the same denomination, that is they don�t believe that the son is equal to the Father.  But I don�t think they will convert me, as I generally get about half asleep during the service, particularly in the evening.  I would go regularly to sleep, but they are so strict here, they would have me up before the Faculty if I did.  You certainly have enough of Church, if you have to go once a day, but then you don�t have to go to recitation, which is worst than Church.

	You must be having a dull vacation.  I have heard of Frank�s fate.  It is a great disappointment indeed, but no doubt is all for the best.  He would have had a hard life in the navy, from what I hear of it.  Besides, as you say, it is no disgrace, as it was none of his fault.  It would have been worse if the Academical board had rejected him.  

	I received a letter from him yesterday and one from Ma, who Takes it very hard.  I have just written to her, and given her as much comfort as possible.  I received a letter from Pa, who thinks he will let Frank graduate at Furman University, and then study medicine, which I think is a great deal better for Frank.  

	I will now stop until after Church, when I will finish, if I have anything more to write you.

	I went to church, and have just returned from dinner.  You must get crowds of letters.  I got three yesterday and thought that I had got a great many for one mail.  Give my love to Miss Helen Harrington. And Particularly to Miss Jennie.  You must not think that I make a regular habit of going to the theatre.  The Memmingers and myself only go now and then for variety.  You know we ought to have some recreation after studying hard all the week.

	When we want exercise, we walk over to Boston, which is three miles and a half, which is a pretty good walk.  We walked over yesterday.  And I feel pretty good from the effects of it.  I hear that Frank Coxe has gone to Philadelphia to College.  Bill Beattie has gone back to the V[irgini]a University.  Wes Cary has gone home.  So I expect Greenville is dull; I would like to be there a while though, at any rate.

	It is about time for me to close.  I will stop in New-York, on my way home, and buy you some of the best candy that I can find.  

	Keep to your promise, and write to me quickly.   Your affectionate brother, B.F. Perry.

P.S. Give me all the Greenville news, of which you ought to have a good deal, as you correspond with so many girls.

My dear Son

	Your letter last night filled our hearts with gladness.  Your mother was afraid to open the letter fearing that you were rejected again.  I opened it & read it to her that you had been rejected by the Academic Board.  But there was something in my�once which contradicted the reading.  You don�t know how much gratified your mother is.  If you had been rejected I think she would not have cared to see you in Greenville.  You must return our thanks a hundred times to Mr. Miller who has been a true friend of yours.  You ought to be proud to have such a friend & value him through life.

	We are all anxious to receive the long letter you promised giving an account of your visit to Washington & examinations.  I hope the letter may come tonight.

	You must now choose a clever, good boy for your roommate & study hard & distinguish yourself in your class.  Be kind to every one of your associates but keep out of bad company.  Be careful to observe all the laws & regulations of the school.  Obey your teachers in everything.

	You must write us as often as you can & tell us all about the school, the students, the teachers, your studies, the fare &c. &c.

	Settle up with Mrs. Green & purchase the things you need & put the rest of your money in bank to be kept for you.

	I have told Col. Hoke, Dr. � Croft, Mr. Elford, Dr. Hoke and a great many others that you were a Midshipman.  I am sorry for poor little Lane who was rejected.  I thought he looked like a good Boy & was pleased with him.  Did you become acquainted with him?

	Fannie says that she told the little girls at school you were admitted & they said they were sorry, for they wanted to see you back in Greenville.  Matilda almost cried when she heard you were rejected.

	You must write to us all [that] the Secretary of the navy said to you, & what Mr. May said, & did for you.

	We are all well.  Arthur is pretty near well.  He walked about over the room yesterday for the first time in two months.  Hayne is as fat as a pig.  Hext is going to school & learns well.  Your mother spends a good deal of her time in writing to Anna, Willie & you.  I am very busy in my office preparing for Court as this is return week.  My Clients have come in now & I must conclude.

My dear Daughter

	I received your letter of Oct. 1st the other day, in which you complain of my not writing you, & say you began to think I had forgotten about leaving you at St. Mary�s Hall.  Now, my dear daughter I have written you twice & only received one letter from you.  I might have supposed that you had forgotten that you had a father as well as a mother at home.  All your correspondence has been with her.  I knew that she wrote you almost every day, & told you everything that occurred in & out of the Village.  I had therefore nothing to write you.     

	 I am glad to hear you are better pleased with your school than you were at first.  I hope you will study hard & make good progress in your studies.  I wish you to learn Latin if you have time.  I am willing for you to come home in April if convenient, but you must commit to return & graduate.

	I recd a letter from Frank last night stating that he was now �an acting midshipman�, had passed the Academic Board, with flying colors, missed not a question, had been kindly rece[ive]d by the Secretary of the Navy, & pronounced by a Board of Physicians in Washington without defect or disease.  He writes me in high spirits & says I must �tell everybody� he is admitted.  He likes the school but not the life of a naval officer.  He has made a great many warm friends in Annapolis.  Mr. Miller went with him to Washington.  There he met Mr. May a former member pf Congress from Baltimore whom I knew very well as a distinguished lawyer in the Gardner case.  He took interest in Frank on my account & went with them to the Secretary of the Navy.  Frank will not be able to return home for two years now.  What do you think of that?

	The Perrys are not going to school.  Emma is thinking of getting married to a Mr. C� a student.  Susan & Anna say they will go to the Lexington Springs in February.  Anna is now at school in Pickens at�.  

	The Poney is fat & hearty.  Fannie rides him occasionally.  Arthur is getting well I hope.  Hayne is quite fat & as hardy as a little pig.  Hext goes to school & does well.    Fannie is making fine progress with her music.  Your mother spends a great portion of her time in writing to you & Willie & Frank.  She is one of the best correspondents I ever saw.

	The servants are all well & Wiley has got married to a woman of Mrs. Nances in Newberry.  He says he is willing to see her once a year only rather than not marry her!  They will have very little time to quarrel during their married life.

	I am interrupted by my clients & must close my letter.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I received several letters from you during the past week.  The first thing I do is to congratulate you on Frank�s admission into the Naval Academy.  I am as pleased at his good fortune As you are, though I tried to console you by saying that it was all for the best.  I received three letters from Frank almost in succession, the first telling me of his rejection, the second of his being reexamined, by the medical board, and the last of his being admitted by the Academical board, and consequently being a midshipman.  He says the first thing we hear of him, he will be Commodore Perry.  The first medical board must have been very unjust.  I knew of his success before I received Pa�s letter, which was post-marked Columbia, from which I thought that Pa must be in Columbia, until I opened it.

	The oldest Memminger, Parker, from Charleston who is in the Scientific school here, and myself all dined with Mr. Winthrop in Boston yesterday.  He is one of the distinguished men of Boston, and was speaker of the House in Congress.  He said he had read Pa�s speech before the Institute in Charleston.  He was very kind, and said we must call to see him frequently.  Col. Memminger introduced his sons and me to him when he was in Boston, and he showed us the Library and curiosities of the �Massachusetts Historical Society�.

	Our catalogue is out, and I will send one by the same mail with this letter, and you can have the pleasure of seeing my name in print, and at full length.  I went last night to hear the celebrated Lola Montes deliver a lecture.  I saw your friend Mr. Davis there, but only at a distance, this is the first time that I have ever had a glimpse of him.  

	Today is Sunday.  I will have to write to Frank, and Anna also.  I saw Franks name in a paper, as one of those admitted to the naval Academy and I must tell him of it.  I have nothing to tell about myself.

       I got Mr. Earle, the tailor that I wrote you about, to make me a pair of dress pants and a vest to wear to Mr. Winthrop�s yesterday.  They cost $16.  My washing will cost about $15 a term, or twenty weeks.  Besides I have to pay 50 cts a week to a man who blacks my boots, makes fires, and tends on my room.  The tuition fees are $37 a term.  At the end of the term a bill of the tuition fees, book-bill and coal, is made out, and we are allowed until the beginning of the second term to pay.  I think this would be the best way to do. As I would have more money then.  But if he wishes. I will pay the bill now.  I have nothing more to write.

	I hope you feel better now, since Frank has been admitted.

	Give my love to Fannie, Hext, and Hayne.  I am glad that Arthur is better.  I hope he is well by this time.  I was very much surprised to hear of Wiley�s marriage, but hope that he will continue to do well.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	I returned from Anderson Court last night & received your letter of the 9th Inst.  I have to go back to court in the morning and will write you a letter whilst I am at home.

	Your letters give us great satisfaction, & I hope you will study hard & behave well, so as to get no demerit at all.  Strive for this my son.

	I saw Mr. Suber at Anderson who told me all about Lane�s rejection.  He thinks of preparing himself for West Point & trying to get in there when he is old enough.

	You must write me what you are studying�how often you recite your lessons �how long & how often you drill�how you like the different Professors & students.

	Col. Orr was very much pleased to hear you had entered the naval Academy.  He saw all the news in the Washington union newspaper before I saw him.  The Colonel says he knows Mr. Bradford of California, who was a Presidential Elector & he supposes him to be the father of your roommate, & that he is a very clever gentleman. 

	I know a Mr. Grimball who was Senator from one of the Parishes, & perhaps some kin or may be the father of your fellow student & drill master.

	The check I sent you you ought to get the money for if you have not done so, Mr. Hammond will give you the money for it.  You are quite rich in the way of money now & must take care of it & not spend it foolishly.  Youi ought to try & lay up a part of your pay till you come home or graduate.

	I do not know how you had so much money left after paying Mrs. Green.  What was her Bill for board &c.?

	When you are allowed to get out, you must go & see Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller, & keep out of all bad company & away from all bad places.  Give our love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller, Mr. May, Mr. Cobb. The Secretary of the Navy, & Captain Blake thanking them for all their kindness to you.

	Do you get the Patriot regularly?  Does your watch keep good time?  What have you to eat?

	I was sorry for poor little lane.  He said he did care so much about staying after you had been rejected.  He seemed a good boy.

	We are all well.  Arthur is running about once more.  We heard from Willie & Anna lately.  They are well except Anna still has a cough.

There is nothing new in the village.  The Baptist have a fair tonight.  The Episcopalians had one last week & made three or four hundred dollars.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Fold up your letters like I do�double them in the same way.  Your mode is awkward.

Dear Papa

	I received your letter the other day and as I have written several times lately, I will now write you a few lines to let you know how I am getting on.

	I have nothing of importance to write.  The weather seems to be turning to regular winter weather, but I see by the Patriot that you have also had frost.

	I am glad that Ma�s distress about Frank has been relieved.  I got a letter from him the other day, and he seems well satisfied.  I have just received a letter from Anna, and she seems to be getting on very well.  I want you to tell me how you went from New-York to Burlington.  I want to stop & see Anna before I go home, but I don�t know exactly how to go, as I did not pass through Burlington.  

       I sent you a catalogue from which you will see that the vacation commences on the 20th of January.  I am much obliged to you for your permission to stop in Washington.  It is just what I would like, as I want to see the distinguished men of the country.  
       
       Mom said that I ought to study Mathematics.  The reason I have dropped it, is this.  According to the rules, if a student takes a modern language (as French) and Mathematics, he must drop either Latin or Greek, and I knew that you wanted me to study the ancient languages in preference to Mathematics.  Mem[m]inger and myself have both taken French.  I saw Mr. Joe Long Wednesday.  I was very much surprised to see him, as I thought he had gone home.  He said that Sue Hoke did not come by Boston, but had gone home.  He sent my trunk on by the express from Columbia and paid for it himself, so you had better pay him for it.  He has a cousin in the Law school here, who he introduced me to, and who seems to be a clever young man.  He left the next day, and I suppose has reached home by this time.
       
       Today is Saturday.  Some of you must write to me on Monday always, as it is the letters written on Monday, and not those written on Sunday that reach me on Saturday.  I would like to hear as often as possible from home.
       
       I suppose you know more about the great money crisis than I do.  A great many of the richest men in Boston have failed.  The Boston Banks have suspended for the present, but will soon resume payments again I suppose.
       I hope the children are well, and servants and horses.  Fanny says that you are going to get another horse, and a mule for a fee; what are you going to do with them
       
       I will now close.  Your affectionate Son, [William Hayne Perry]
       
P.S. There was a student named Perry in College last year, but he has quit, and I don�t [know] whether he was any relation to us, or not.

Dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning, after I returned from one of my exercise walks to Boston.  Your letter reminded me of Judge O�Nealls.  I also received a letter from Ma and it made two letters in one day which was a crowd for me to get at one time.  Ma does�nt write as often as she did.  I also got a letter from Frank the other day, who seems to be still flourishing.  You must write some very homesick letters home, from Ma�s account.  You ought to be getting used to the place, and to being away from home by this time.  It must be getting so many letters from home that makes you homesick.  I don�t think you have any harder time than I have.  I will have to walk through the snow this winter to Church and to recitation every day; and I expect this place will be a great deal colder than where you are.  So just compare your condition with mine, and you will begin to think that you are far better situated than I am.  You must be better off than Frank, for he says he has to be his own tailor, chambermaid, and boot-black.  Did you get a Catalogue that I sent you; I don�t think you have mentioned receiving it.

	I will start for home on or about the 20th of January.  Our vacation lasts six weeks, but it takes up so much time going and returning, that I wont have so much time at home.  I will stop and see you and Frank also.  Pa says that I may stop in Washington, as the Congress will be in Session, and I will have a chance to see all the big men.  Frank says he became acquainted with the big men when he went to Washington.  But I suppose he could�nt enjoy the acquaintance as he must have been worried about his examination.

	Why did�nt you send Miss Anna Trezevant�s letter.  I would have given the world to read it, and of course would�nt think her forward.  Is she coming back to school again.  I have written to Bill Beattie to find out if she is any relation to him.  I hope she is.  

	Today is Saturday.  I will finish this letter tomorrow (*Sunday).  Sunday morning�It is nearly church time and I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

Write soon

My dear Daughter

	I have staid at home today, instead of going to church to write you & Willie & Frank.  

	I returned from Pickens Court Friday & rece[ive]d your letter which gave me great pleasure & satisfaction.  I shall be very busy this week as court opens here in the morning.  I had a fine business at Pickens & made a good deal of money which I stand much in need of at present to pay for my House &c.  I have also had to advance seven hundred dollars to your grandmother to help pay for her furniture &c.

	You must not fret at everything which happens.  You know I sent you to Burlington to learn obedience & patience as well as your studies in school.  Take everything quietly & patiently & do not complain of anything.  We cannot have everything as we wish it in this life.  And it is best to make a virtue of necessity & take everything calmly.

       If I do not have it in my power to go for you in April, it will suit very well for you to return with some of the Southern girls & I may meet you on the road.
       
       Your school will commence shortly & then you will be better satisfied & have regular employment.  Idleness or want of regular employment is a horrible life.  We were all made to be actively engaged in this world & no one is happy unless he is actively in pursuit of some object.  
       
       We are all well except colds.  Arthur is quite well again except a cold.  The poor little fellow was very low when we returned & had we staid a week longer he would have died.  Hayne is fat & hardy.  Hext went with me to Pickens court & behaved well.  He went with his uncle F� home & staid two nights.  He wished to go with William to the Tugaloo farm & stay there.  His uncle gave him a knife which he is proud of as Frank is of his watch.  Fannie is going to school & occasionally rides your Pony�evening.  I wish you could have him to ride through the streets of Burlington.  Your mother is well & much gratified at the success of her children at school.  The servants are well except Clara may had a cold & was laid up a day or two.  Clara is still in her room with a cold.  The Horses are all doing well & looking fat & sleek.  Your Pony would no doubt be glad for you to take him out of the stable & ride him.  He finds it doubtless dull standing in his stall all day.
       
       Poor Mrs. Prince, daughter of Jordan Pool died very suddenly of cold & her husband & family are in great distress & anguish of heart at her early loss.  A good many students are sick.  You must take care & not catch cold.  Never mind the musquitoes�they only deplete you a little by their biting.  You will soon get used to them & their music.
       
       I hope your cough is better�avoid coughing if you can.  If your teeth need plugging have it done.  Good teeth is a very desirable matter with a young lady & you must take care of yours.
       
       Franks letters are more hopeful in tone & spirit than yours & Willie�s.  he is a fellow who always looks on the bright side of the picture & sees its beauties.  This is a great strength in life.  Two persons may have the same fortune in life in every respect & one be happy 7 the other miserable by looking at different sides of the picture of their lives.  �one looking at his good fortune & the other seeing nothing but his troubles.  Life is a mixture of good & evil.  We had better dwell on the good & forget the evil as soon as possible.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
You must request them to ask for the Patriot & Mountaineer direct to you.  It will be better than a letter every week.

My dear Son

	I received your letter of the 14th Inst. On my return last evening from Pickens Court, and was gratified to hear you were still pleased with the Naval Academy & had no demerits.  You must study hard & behave well, be obedient to your officers & teachers in all things, & kind to your fellow students.  I know it is hard to pass through the school without demerits.  But you must have as few as possible.  I hope you will pass your February Examination with flying colors.

	Col. Orr inquired about you at Pickens, & all of your friends ask after you very frequently.  You are a great favorite in Greenville amongst all the Boys & girls too I believe.  You must prove yourself worthy of their love & esteem.  

	Hext went with me to Pickens Court & behaved well.  He went down to his uncle Foster Perrys & staid two days.  His uncle gave him a knife which he is very proud of & thinks as much of as you do of your watch.  Does your watch keep good time?  You have said nothing about it lately.

	You ought to git you an overcoat when the weather turns cold.  I believe you have none.  Take care of yourself & avoid catching cold.  

	Mrs. Prince the daughter of Jordan Pool died whilst I was At Pickens.  She caught cold at the Fair one night & died the next day or two.

	A great many persons are now sick in Greenville with colds.  Several of the students in the Furman University are quite unwell.

	The House is now finished and painted & looks pretty.  It has cost me upwards of two thousand dollars.

	I had a great deal of business at Pickens & made some money.  I defended a man who was indicted for having two wives.  He was convicted & has been sentenced to fine & imprisonment.

	This is Sunday & tomorrow is court at this place.  Instead of going to church I have staid in my office to write you & Willie & Anna.  I am glad you all keep up a correspondence.  I need not therefore write you about them as you hear from them sooner than I do.

	You must write me all about your school, your officers, teachers, students, studies amusements, boarding &c. &c.  Who are you most intimate with amongst the students?

       You wrote to your mother on the 18th enquiring about Wileys getting married.  He married a girl of Mrs. Nance at Newberry.  I told him it was so far he could not see his wife often & he said he was willing to marry her oftener than once a year.  I will let him go oftener than that.  He does very well now & keeps sober since joining the Baptist church.  Clara is sick with cold�Mary has been ill the rest of the servants are well.
       
       Arthur is pretty well but has a cold.  Hayne is fat & hardy.  Hext is quite well.  Fannie is going to school & well.  Hext is also going to school.  Your mother is quite well & delighted at your success in the Naval Academy.  We will try & go on & see you next summer.
       
       The Horses are all fat & sleek.  The Pony wants someone to ride him.  He stands in the stable all day & no doubt would like to prance about a little.  Fannie rides him some times.
       
	Your grandmother & Susan & the children are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	Your welcome letter was received at the right time yesterday morning.  Today is Sunday my usual writing day, but owing to the old Chapel I will only have time to begin this letter now.  I will finish it this evening.

	I see that you still get as many letters as usual.  I get fewer that I used to.  Because I told Ma that I wanted to hear from home Saturday anyhow, she seems to think that I don�t want to hear any other time.  I heard from Pa yesterday.  I went to a musical party Wednesday night at Prof. Pierce�s, where I had the extreme pleasure of seeing & becoming acquainted with some of the young ladies of yankeedom.  I don�t think them any prettier through, but you can tell the �young ladies� in Greenville that if they wont have me I stand some chance of getting a yankee girl who will be useful if not ornamental, for no doubt they know how to act as chambermaids, as they have�nt any niggers to wait on them.

	I also went to see some young ladys in Boston the other night.  I went with Joe Long�s cousin, who is in the Law school here.  The bell is ringing for church, so I will close till after dinner.

	I have just returned from Chapel, and will conclude this letter before dinner.  Give my respects to Miss Jennie & Miss Helen.  I don�t know whether I will go into that flirtation that you were speaking of, or not.  I�m afraid it will be tiresome.  If you see Frank Coxe again, tell [page torn] I leave about the 21st of January, and [page torn] be in Philadelphia a few days after [page torn] so he must call at the Girard House, about that time, and inquire for me.

	Every time I write to you I forget to send the lock of hair, and I�m afraid that I will forget it again before I finish this letter.  Bill Beattie says his father came from Washington County Va &c., but as Mrs. Tresevant is gone it is no use going into particulars.  He said he would claim the relationship if he came up North next summer, so that he might visit the school.

	I like the paper your letter was written on, because it was of a good size.  This is the best paper that I can get about here, and it is no account.  I want to hear of Miss Pauline�s marriage, just so as to know, who she is going to marry.

	I just have to cross the street to be in the College yard, but have a pretty long walk {page torn] meals.  [page torn] I�ve cut the lock of hair.  I did�nt have a[ny] scissors, so had to cut it with my knife, and it liked to have pulled all the hair out of my head, and did�nt get much after all.  I have�nt any ribbon to tie it up with.

	I have got me a new suit of clothes and if I don�t wear them out before I get home, I may break some ladys heart.  I will certainly have a fine time, being the only beau.  I will fly around �like a cart with one wheel on�.  But all the Fairs will be over.  However, I don�t care about going home to see the girls.  I don�t know whether I will speak to one all the time I�m at home.

	I hope you will keep on writing long letters.  I have a Theme to write every two weeks, which is a good deal harder than a composition.  I�ve come to the end of my paper a must close.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

My dear Son

	I recei[ve]d your letter of the 29th October Friday evening & was glad to hear you stood so well in tour class as to be placed in the second section.  This is well indeed for you, for all the boys must be older than you.  I hope you will study hard, behave well & graduate with high distinction.

	You must be very particular in your conduct & studies, & observe all the rules & regulations of the school.

	I am glad you were invited to Dr. Sharpe�s & went.  You must go & see captain Blake & his good Lady whenever they invite you.

	We will try & send you all our likenesses when we have an opportunity.  And you must have yours taken well & send to your mother & myself.

	You say that Anna writes you she is homesick & you do not see the propriety of sending girls off to school like boys.  Anna will be much better satisfied when her school opens again & she has to study hard.  She will then have no time to indulge in thinking of home.  It is of great service to girls to send them from home to go to school at Anna�s age.  It keeps them out of company & gives them a better opportunity of studying.  At home they become young ladies too soon & think more of company than they do of their studies.
,
	You say I must write you how all the horses are doing.  They are all fat & sleek & look remarkably well.  Wiley hauls wood with Bill & Tim & Monarch.  Tom Thumb is very tired of standing all day in the stable & would like very much for you to be here & ride him every evening.  When I go into the stable he begs me as well as he can to take him out.  Fannie sometimes rides him.  He is very fat & stout.  Monarch would be unmanageable if I did not make Wiley put him in the lead & haul wood with him occasionally.

	I am now engaged in the Courts.  Last week was Greenville Court & this week is Spartanburgh  Court.  Tomorrow is sales day & I shall not go to Spartanburgh till Tuesday.

	You may remember Simon Turner was in Jail for killing Reed.  He was tried last week.  I & Goodlett defended him.  His trial took three days & the verdict of the jury was�.  He has been sentenced to twelve months imprisonment & fined one thousand dollars.  The Solicitor Reed & Henry Thurston made speeches against him.

	This is Sunday & I shall not go to church, as I have so many letters to write and so much business to do before starting to Spartanburgh.  You must write me every Sunday as you promise I will answer all your letters.

	We hear from Anna every other day, & from Willie once a week.  He is doing well & well satisfied.

	I have done a good business this court & am paying for my House which will cost me for the rooms put up twenty five hundred dollars.

	The times are hard & money scarce.  The Banks here are suspended & there will be a great deal of suing next court.  This will make a fine harvest for the lawyers.

	We are all well except colds which are general.  You must write me all about the Boys in school & how you like them, your studies &c.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your mother rece[ive]d a letter from you night before last, but Mrs. Doctor Butler has it, & two other letters of yours to read.  The letter you sent your grandmother last week was sent to Mr. McBees & the old gentleman was very much pleased with it.  He said you wrote like a man instead of a Boy.  He made Vardry come down & read it.

	  I am glad you went to see Captain Blake & hope you will go & see Mrs. Blake.  You must also not forget Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You should have your likeness taken for Mrs. Greens daughter as she has asked for it�also send one for Miss McR� & give Miss Bartow one.  

	You will see in the last Patriot that I have acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Bartows sermon & will publish it as soon as possible.  I admire it very much.

	You ought to tell young Rodgers that you know his aunt Mrs. Doctor Butler very well & hear from through me.  He & you too may be some kin.  Mrs. Butler says that three Brothers, our ancestors, came over from England about two hundred years ago�two of them settled in Massachusetts, & one in Rhode Island.  We are descended from the Massachusetts branch & your grandfather Perry was born near Boston.  Commodore Perry is descended from the Rhode Island Brother.

	Your mother will fix you up a box of books &c. when I go to Columbia next week & I will forward them by Adam�s Express.

	Your grandmother has been sick, but is now better.  All the rest of us are well.  The servants are well & the horses fat & sleek.

	Poor Mrs. Gridley died yesterday.  She had been bedridden for twelve months.  There have been a good many deaths in Greenville since you left her.

	I am very much pleased to hear you are going to sea next summer & will coast around by Boston & see Willie.

	You must send us your likeness, & I am glad to hear you are fat & hearty, & doing well in your school.  I hope you will try hard & avoid demerits, & study well.  You must study your lessons most attentively.

	Write me all about the Boys in the Naval Academy.  How many have you become acquainted with? & whom do you like best?  I hope your roommate is a clever steady & studious boy.

	I will try & go on to see you next May.  The Legislature meets tomorrow two weeks & you must then direct your letters to me in Columbia.  I will write occasionally, if I have time, while I am in Columbia.

       The students in Furman University are now preparing to leave here.  They all behave themselves well.  There has been no difficulties in the school.
       
       We hear from Willie once a once a week & from Anna every other day.  Willie says he has been out visiting in Boston & was invited to dine with Mr. Winthrop & to a party at Professor Pierces.
       
       I am very busy now with my law matters & arranging to attend the appeal court & Legislature.
       
       Give my love to your school & roommate Bradford & tell him to take good care of you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday & I have been to church with your mother.  And was well as I go to Columbia on Saturday.  I will write letters this evening to you, Willie & Frank.  You have not written to me lately.  You promised to do so when your school opened again.  Your mother rece[ive]d a letter from you Friday evening.  I am glad to hear you have entered a high class, & I hope you will graduate in it with a high honor.  You will now be kept so busy in studying that you will not have time to think so much of Home, your dresses & your cough.  Now will you have so much time to write letters.  I think you write too many to your schoolmates, once a month would be often enough to write to them.  You must not neglect your studies for your correspondents.  Always endeavor to write well.  When you write so much you cannot take pains with your letters.  You must direct your next letter to me in Columbia where I shall be for four or five weeks.  If I have time I will write you occasionally & tell you the Columbia news.

	Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much that I have nothing to write about.  She will write you tomorrow & send you a pretty broach with a lock of Susans hair.  She wrote you the other day & sent you Fannies likeness.  She also sent one to Frank.

	Has she also told you that Emma Perry & Hawthorn are to be married on the 11th of December.  I have never seen him & know nothing about him.  Long & Susan Perry will probably make a match also.    They all�ought to be well switched.

	I hope you will remain single for many years, & learn something about housekeeping before you think of marrying.  I hope too you will not do as they are going to do, marry boys�no young man should be allowed to get married till he is in a condition, by his profession or business, to support a wife & family.  Whilst a girl is so young too she is incapable of judging of the character of a young woman. She may marry some, she will be ashamed of as a companion after her mind is matured.  I wish you my dear daughter to improve & cultivate your mind & talents & think nothing of company or society for years to come.

	You have written so much about your cough that your mother is distressed & is afraid you are consumptive.  I tell her that you have a pair of lungs almost equal to a blacksmiths bellows & that she need be in no apprehension.  There is some exc�in your throat which tickles & gives you the cough.  It will go off after awhile.  But do not expose yourself to the cold & avoid if possible catching cold.  Take exercise in the open air.

	How does Miss LeConte come on.  I shall see her mother on Saturday.  Write to me about her & All the other girls with whom you are intimate.  I wrote Frank he must send his likeness to Miss�whom you mentioned desired it.  He says so many young ladies have asked him for his likeness that it will break him.  Surely, Frank is a great favorite about Annapolis.

	We are all well.  Your Poney is well.  John rides him occasionally on errands�otherwise the poor horse would die of eating.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your letter of the 8th Inst. Was received Friday evening.  This is Sunday, and I will write to you, Willie & Anna, instead of going to church with your mother & Fannie.  Next Sunday I shall be in Columbia.  I go down on Saturday.

	Your letters, my dear Son, are a great comfort to me & your mother.  You are satisfied with your school & take everything like a little man, instead of complaining & trying to find something to be dissatisfied with.  But you must try and avoid demerits.  You ought ever to be on your guard against them.  You might have avoided those you have.  It was very thoughtless in you to prompt.

	In writing your letters you must not blot or blur them.  This makes them look as if they were written carelessly & not as a particular military young gentleman should write.  Your mother sent one or two of your letter to Mr. McBee & Mrs. Butler to read.  They were very much pleased with them & praised you a great deal.  You must therefore be particular in writing.

	I hope you will become acquainted with young Rodgers & tell him you are some akin to him & know his aunt Mrs. Butler very well.  I know his mother who was a daughter of Commodore�Perry�s.  I know his aunt Mrs. Commodore Rodgers & his cousin Mrs. Lizzie Smith very well.

	You must write & tell me when you receive any demerits & what they are for.  Remember if you receive a certain number of demerits you are dismissed from the Academy.  This would be a great shame & disgrace on you.

	You must be sure & study your lessons well & not be idle.  Let me know if you still keep in section no. 2 or whether you have risen higher.  Do not fall into a lower section.

	I am glad to hear you are growing fat & fatter.  This shows hot only that you are in good health, but that a naval school & all its hardship & trouble & study agree with you.

	Mrs. Butler is very anxious to send Tom to the naval school & says she will try & get Lanes place for him of General Bonham.  Henry Thompson told me the other day that he would very much [try] to get his son in the school in a year or two.  Mrs. Williams is trying to get a situation for Campbell in the military school in Columbia.  George Wells & Mr. Dyers son are both applicants for situations in the military school in Columbia.  And Mrs. Speers wishes to put her son there.

	We are all well.  Your mother has just sent me word that I must go with her to church this morning.  I will do so.  The children & servants & your grandmothers family are all well.  Hext is going to school to Miss Powell.  Hayne is sitting by me now in my office & says tell you he loves you & wants to see you very much.  Arthur is doing well.  Fannie has holiday now & practices a good deal  on the Piano.  The carpets have come & are put down & look very pretty.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Direct your next letter to me in Columbia.

My dear Son

	I arrived here last night at twelve oclock.  The cars ran off & the Engine was broken to pieces about twenty miles above Columbia.  But none of the passengers were injured.  We had to remain on the road two till ten oclock in the night without anything to eat or drink.  The Conductor had to send down to Columbia & get a car to come & take us.

	I left your mother & the children all well.  We received a letter from you the evening before I left home & one also came to Annie McBee from you.    I hope my dear son that you will study hard & be obedient to all the rules & regulations of the school & navy.  You are much younger than your classmates & will therefore have to study harder.  

       Mrs. Doctor Butler is very anxious to get her son Thomas in Lanes place.  She has written to General Bonham & requested me to speak to him on the subject.  Dr, Randall Croft wishes to get his son ibn the naval school as soon as he is old enough.  You see therefore what a desirable position you have & how many would be glad to have it.  You ought consequently to consider yourself very fortunate & try hard to improve & keep up with your class.  
       
       Mrs. Doctor Williams is trying to get Campbell in at the military school here.  Mrs. Speers & Mr. Dyer & George Wells are also contending for the situation.  The selection is made this week.  Two go this year from Greenville.  A young man by the name of Wilson who lives with H� Cleveland and Doctor Bell have also spoken to me about the situation.  Doyley & Garmany from Greenville graduate this Fall.  Doyley has taken an honor & graduates with distinction.  I hope you will do so when you graduate.
       
       I suppose your mother has written you that someone attempted to break open your Grandmothers house one night last week.
       
       When I left home Spartan Goodlett was very ill with typhoid fever.  He was hardly expected to live.  There have been a great many deaths in Greenville this summer & Fall with typhoid fever bowell complaint.  
       
       I sent you before leaving home four of my printed likeness which you may give to Mrs. Green, Mr. Miller & some of your young friends.  If you want any more of them I can send them to you.  I have not had time to have my daguer[re]otype taken for you.
       
       You must write me as often as you can whilst I stay in Columbia which will be for four or five weeks.  Your letters are very interesting to me, as you take everything good naturedly & joyously.  That sort of disposition will carry you through the world & make you have a happy life.  How much better it is than to be complaining & grumbling at everything that happens.
       
       I hope Anna will now be better satisfied since her school has open[ed] again.  Willie seems to be doing well & studying hard.
       
       I will write you whenever I have time, but I shall be very busy here in the court of appeals & the Legislature.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

 My dear Lizzie

	We all reached here last night about twelve oclock in safety after a break down on the Greenville road below Allston.  The Engine ran off & broke its axle tree & wheels.  We were detained in the swamp from two oclock till ten oclock in the night without anything to eat or drink.  There being no water, I did not even take a drink of brandy.  No one was hurt.  There was a great crowd on board the Cars.  Amongst them a large number of Methodist Clergymen on their way to the Conference at Charlotte.  Mr. Wightman, Doctor Smith &c.  They had their families with them.  We had a dreary time of it.  But on reaching Janneys Hotel we had a good supper & I went to bed at one oclock, slept till eight, took breakfast at nine, & feel perfectly well & restored.

       On the Cars Mr. Reed mentioned a singular circumstance in regard to Col. Brockmans daughter who is boarding with him & may throw some light on the cause of Anna cough.  Miss Brockman took a ride one cold day on the Blue Ridge Rail Road & commenced coughing.  It continued at intervals very bad.  Finally threw her into a fever & she had to go to bed.  The doctors visited her for two weeks & thought she had either consumption or bronchitis.  Her Father & Mother came to see her.  Whilst in bed one day, recently, her cough was very violent & she coughed up a lump of charcoal as large as a pea which she had somehow swallowed whilst cleaning her teeth & which had lodged in her throat.  She was immediately relieved of her cough, her consumption & her bronchitis.  It may be that Annas cough is owing to some such cause.  Some charcoal. Bone, or crumb of break lodged in her throat.  Write to her about it.
       
       I am writing to you about half past twelve oclock & have already written to Elford & Frank & am going to write to Anna & Willie.  I got here so late last night that I saw no one.  And went down to breakfast so late that I saw very few persons this morning.  I have not yet seen Mr. or Mrs. LeConte.  I saw their sons & told them to tell their mother that I had heard from their sister &c.  I suppose I shall see them at the dinner table.
       
       I have not been out of the House.  The weather is pleasant but rather cold.  I saw Hamlin Beattie & C� Butler last night.  They had just been undergoing an examination by one of the Committee.  There are twenty five applicants for admission.
       
       Governor Allston & his family are expected tomorrow.  The Charleston members have not yet arrived.  Neither Dr. [William Adolphus] Mooney nor [Nathaniel] Morgan or [John Latimer] Westmoreland are here.  I suppose they will come down tomorrow.  I wish very much I had staid till Monday.  It was a horrible time after we ran off the track till we reached Columbia.  I thought of a shipwreck at sea where the passenger were without food or drink & waiting death.  How much safer to be on land where we can send for help.
       
       I was told at the Greenville depot that Spartan Goodlett was very low with typhoid fever, not expected to live.  Write me how he is.  It is strange I did not hear of it whilst at home.  It is a dreadful disease.
       
       Write me every day & I will write you whenever I can.  Kiss the children for me, & give my love to your mother Susan & Anne.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I arrived here last night about twelve oclock.  We had a run off & break down on the Greenville cars as I came down.  The Engine was broken all to pieces, but the passengers rece[ive]d no injury, nor were the cars injured.  But we were detained in the swamp twenty miles above Columbia from two till ten at night without anything to eat or drink not even water.  The conductor had to send to Columbia for an Engine & cars.  We arrived in town at midnight hungry and cold.  I ate a hearty supper went to bed & slept till eight.  I feel quite well.

	At dinner I sat with Dr. & Mrs. LeConte.  The Dr. tells me [William Henry] White took first honors, [Elias Lynch] Rivers second & [William Calhoun] Keith third.  This has surprised my lady & Mrs. LeConte thinks Keith was degraded for having attended McCays recitation.  Born well &�gave him a low stand in the recent examinations.  Dr. LeConte gave him the highest mark.  The College is all quiet.  There are one hundred & sixty students in College.  They are now on their good behavior.  How long they will remain so is doubtful.

	Hamlin Beattie and C� Butler are both here applying for admission to the Bar.  There are
 twenty five applicants.  They are examined tomorrow.

	When I left home Spartan Goodlett was very ill with typhoid fever & hardly expected to live.  There have been a great many deaths in Greenville this fall with this disease & bowel complaint.  

	The Charleston members have not yet arrived.  They come up in the morning.  I have not seen or heard from Col. Memminger since he was at Greenville.

       I tell everyone that you are pleased with Harvard.  I told LeConte how often you were examined.  He seemed surprised at it.
       
       You must write to me here for the next four or five weeks.  I have no news to write you.
       
       The election for United States Senator is exciting a good deal of interest.  I think the contest will be between Pickens, Manning & Chesnut.
         	 
	The College & the banks will excite a good deal of interest in the Legislature.  I have drawn up a Bill to submit, converting the college into a university, diminishing the number of Trustees & making the Professors dependent in some manner on the tuition fund for their salaries.

	We have had extreme cold weather in Greenville.  The thermometer fell to eighteen which is unusually cold winter weather.  The mountains have been covered with snow.  I suppose you find it cold at Cambridge.  You must guard against taking cold.  Never sit or be chilled in a current of air.  When you find yourself becoming chilly guard against it.  There is a great danger in walking or heating yourself & then colling down to[o] soon.  Avoid night air & the cold winds of night & day.

	I shall be so busy in the court of appeals & the Legislature that I shall not have much time to write you.

	There has been a great Fair in Columbia & one in Charleston.  Col Ware took a premium with his fine horses in Columbia.

	I suppose your mother wrote you about your grandmother having her house broken open.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Lizzie

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, which you must read before you read this.

	I have just come up from dinner where I saw Dr. & Mrs. LeConte.  They invited me to their table & I had a great deal of talk about Burlington, Anna & Tulula.  Mrs. LeConte says that her daughter & Anna are bosom friends & that Tulula writes her she loves Anna Perry, that she & Anna & a girl from Florida & one from Virginia are always together.  She says during Christmas holidays her sister is going to have Tulula, Anna & one or two others to spend a few days with her in Philadelphia & that she can ensure Anna a pleasant time.  It will be necessary to write Mrs. LeConte to give her permission.  She says Tulula writes her, she never saw a girl get so many letters as Anna Perry does, that she rece[ive]d twenty five in one week. Whilst she (Telula, poor girl) rece[ive]d only one.  It seems that the girls are delighted to receive letters.

	In relation to Anna�s cough Mrs. LeConte says Dr. Gantt told her it was not consumption but only an affectation of the throat.  Mrs. LeConte says however it is very bad & that Anna did not look so well as she did in Philadelphia.  I told her about Miss Brockmans cough.  Dr. LeConte said he knew a man who was affected in the same way with a cough for forty years.  There was a lodgement of a�in the wind pipe & the flesh grew over it.  Finally it broke loose & he coughed it up.  Mr. Farrow who was sitting at the table said Mr. Bail[e]y had a similar cough three years & finally coughed up a bone or something & his cough ceased.  You had better write these things to Anna and let her tell Dr. Gantt.  But it seems nothing can be done.  Nature works out her own cure.  But the cough is not dangerous though troublesome.

	Mrs. LeConte is not so fat as she was & therefore looks better.  She & Dr. LeConte invited me to go to church with them this evening, but I said I had letters to write & could not go.

	I have nothing more to write you except I have a nice room in the new wing of the Hotel with two beds all to myself.  I have a good fire place & plenty of good dry wood & therefore quite comfortable.  

	Hamlin Beattie came up to get my certificate of his moral character & course of study just before dinner.

	I will now write to Anna & Willie.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Anna

	I arrived here last night about twelve oclock.  The Engine on the Greenville Road ran off twenty miles about Columbia & we had to remain there in a swamp from two till ten oclock in the night, without anything to eat or drink, not even water.  There was a crowd of members & Methodist preachers aboard of the cars, & some of them had their wives & daughters with them.  But no one was injured.  We had to send to Columbia for a train to carry us down.  The passengers bore their misfortune with great patience.  Some of the girls went to sleep and none murmured.  When the freight train�up behind there was a general shout & yell under the belief that they would be run over.  But the Engineer stopped in time.

	After getting supper I went to bed at one oclock and slept soundly till eight in the morning.  I feel perfectly well, and left all well at home.

	Just before leaving home I rece[ive]d your letter and was much pleased with it.  I am glad you have entered so high a class & are doing so well in your studies.  In regard to Latin I expect you had better not commence it, as you will have no time to make any progress in it, & pursue your other studies.  Do just as you please in regard to all of your studies so you have the sanction of your teachers.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte at dinner & had much interesting talk with her & the doctor about you & Tulula & Burlington.  She had just heard from her daughter, who said she & Anna Perry were bosom friends.  There was also one from Florida & Virginia who were much [pleased] with you & Tulula.  

       Mr. LeConte says your cough is very bad & annoys you very much.  Mr. Reed told me as we came down that Col. Brockmans daughter had a dreadful cough which continued for weeks & finally she coughed up a piece of charcoal which she had swallowed in cleaning her teeth.  Her cough then ceased.  The doctor thought she had consumption or bronchitis.  She was thrown into a fever ^ had to go to bed.  Dr. LeConte says he knew an instance of a man who had a cough for forty years & finally threw up a fish bone which had lodged in his throat.  Mr. Farrow who was present told me Mr. Bail[e]y at Laurens was affected with a cough for three years owing to something in his windpipe.  He finally coughed it up & was relieved.  You had better tell Dr. Gantt these things.  Mayby you have swallowed a fishbone or piece of charcoal or something else which is lodged in your throat or windpipe.  Tell Dr. Gantt to write us about your cough.
       
       You must write me as often as you can, & I will do the same whilst I am in Columbia & tell you all about the balls & parties, the girls & gentlemen.  But I am afraid your letters take up too much of your time.  Now [that] your school has commenced you will not have the same time to write.  Mrs. LeConte says Tulula regrets very much that she does not receive as many letters as Anna Perry does�that you rece[ive]d one�twenty five.
       
       You must write me your next letter about your cough & tell me whether it is better or not & how it affects you�when you first had it remember all about it.  I hope it has left you.  If it is owing to an ulcer in your throat it will get better soon.  The ulcer may be made by a fishbone or something of that kind.  
       
       I am writing in great haste as I go down to see Dr. & Mrs. LeConte immediately.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I send you enclosed a letter to the Patriot.  Do so as soon as you have read it.

	Col. Memminger has handed me three large bundles for you, which I will send by Wells, Thursday.  I suppose you know what they contain.

	We did nothing in the House today.  My bill about the College was read & referred.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & could get no room.  I have taken him into mine which has two beds in it.

	I saw Col. Frank Kayne today who enquired after you all.  I have seen none of the T� except on the Bench.

	I hope to receive a letter from you, but the mail closes at six oclock, & I must put this letter in the office without hearing from home.

	I have not seen Mrs. LeConte today & I do not know whether she has heard from her daughter & Anna.

	I have no news to write you more than my letter to the Patriot contains.

	I was dining today at my usual table all alone & invited Col. Memminger to take a seat with me.  Directly afterwards Yeadon came & took his usual seat by me.  I think these two gentlemen were very much embarrassed as I suppose they have not spoken since last session.  We all three conversed very pleasantly after the ice was broken.      
 
	Col. Memminger tells me his sons are better satisfied than they were at home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I wrote you the other day & gave you all the news I could.  Since writing you Mrs. LeConte has read me portions of her daughter�s letters in which she speaks most affectionately of you.  Miss Tulula writes a sweet letter.  Her description of the school, going to church, & the running off of the schoolgirl from Syracuse, was very amusing.  I was charmed with her letters, so sprightly, lively and affectionate.  I hope you will cultivate the intimacy which exists between you.

	I sit at the same table with Professor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte whilst taking my meals & we have a great deal  of talk about you & Tulula.  I enquire every mail of Mrs. LeConte if she has heard from her daughter.  I like Dr. LeConte & Mrs. LeConte very much.  Col. Memminger & Mr. Yeadon sit with us & we have a great deal of pleasant conversation.  I wish you & Tulula could be with us to enjoy it.

	At present we have no ladies here, but they are coming in next week, & we shall then have crowds of them.  Mrs. Allston & her daughter will be here in a few days, & Mrs. Chesnut will come tomorrow or the next day.  When the ladies come here I shall have something to write you.

	I saw Buist this evening who is in college.  He has grown fat & looks much better.  I suppose he fares better than he did at his uncles in Greenville.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie last night.  He says he has not heard from you for two or three weeks.  You ought to write to him & Frank occasionally & not so often to Ginny & Mary Mauldin & the girls at Greenville.  Willie says he went to Boston the other day & had his likeness taken for ten cents.  He says if Frank was there he could have his likeness taken so cheap that he might afford to furnish all the girls who have requested his likeness.  I wrote to Willie that Frank said so many girls had asked for his likeness that it would break him.

	Mr. Elford is now in my room & talking to me.  He came here from Charleston & had no room.  I have two beds in my room, & I have given one to him.  This makes it more pleasant for me.  Dr. LeConte has just sent me his Essay or Lecture on solar heat which I will read after I finish this letter.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Fannie this evening.  She said she had just written you a long letter.  I am afraid we all write you such long letters that you hardly have time to read them.  But I shall be so busy after this week, that I shall not have time to write you long letters.

	Give my love to Tulula & tell her I have been very much impressed in her favor from her letters, & that I will give her choice of Frank or Willie.  You must also present my respects to your Virginia & Florida friends whose moms I do not remember.  I wrote to Frank to be sure & send his likeness to your Florida friend.  Has he done so?

	I hope your cough is better.  Write me about it & what Dr. Gantt thinks of it.  

	Your affectionate Father.  Give my respects to the Bishop and all your teachers.  B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night but did not have time to write you.  I sent your bundles by Wells.  I rece[ive]d also last night a letter from Anna & one from Frank which I enclose to you.  I am glad you have determined to play Editor for me in noticeing  Bradfords articles.  I enclose you my letter to the Patriot which will give you all the news I have.

	I am now writing to you after breakfast. & shall not have time to write this evening as I am invited to dine with Governor Allston at five oclock.  Last night after returning from the college the Governor invited Mrs. LeConte & the Professor & Petigru, Memminger & myself to supper & to take a glass of champaign.  We spent a very pleasant time till twelve oclock.  Mrs. LeConte had rece[ive]d a letter from Lula yesterday.  I read Annas Letter to Elford who is rooming with me.  He said President Duncan said Anna & Mary Mauldin were as thoroughly educated as any girls in America so far as they had gone.  

	I now have to go & meet a committee for Col. Memminger who has had to go down to the College.  I must also go & see Col. Pickens.  Col. Simpkins has just been to see me.  I saw all the�last night.  They seemed very cordial notwithstanding my Bill in the Legislature to cut off all their heads
as Judge O�Neall remarked in his speech last night.  I replied to him & made a good speech & carried the Board with me in the election of President with the help of Petigtu & Dawkins.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I rece[ive]d a letter from R.B. Rhett saying his concerns nearly cured.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & thank you for it.  I have to go down to meet the Board of Trustees in a few minutes & shall probably not return before midnight.  I is now six oclock & I have just had dinner & read my paper & letters�one from your uncle Arthur about the Senatorial election.  He will serve if elected but is no candidate.   I see my last letter to the Patriot was crowded out.  It will do very well for next week.

	I argued the case of Hoke & McCallister today in court.  The argument will be finished on Monday.  We had one ballot for U, States Senator.  Hammond rece[ive]d 61�Pickens 40�Chesnut 23�Preston 18�Rhett 6 & Chancellor Dargan 1.  The run of Hammond is extraordinary.  But he cannot be elected.  The contest will be between Pickens & Chesnut & perhaps Chesnut may be elected.

	I saw General Martin this evening & Willie Martin who is a stout good looking boy.  The General said he would send me Susans bundle.  I will send it to you.

	I have nothing to write you.  I enclosed a long letter to you this morning for the Patriot & will write you one tomorrow.

	In regard to the abuse of me in South Carolina it has never come from the gentlemen of the state.  I do not believe there is at this time a distinguished man in the state who does not more cordially respect & esteem me.  Such is their deportment towards me.  I shall leave a reputation for my children which they may be proud of & which shall not injure their�at all.  My reputation will grow brighter after my decease.  It is my purpose to make a publication of my writings with a view of doing justice to my memory hereafter.

	I have not heard from Anna, Frank or Willie since I wrote you.

	I rece[ive]d a letter today from Col. W.C. Preston on the subject of the college & communicating important information & argument for me when the question comes up.

	I send you enclosed a very imperfect & brief sketch of the debate on that subject the other day.

	I wish to see you all very much & next Saturday I shall return home if possible as Monday evening will be commencement.  I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It is now almost eight oclock in the night& I have to meet a caucus in Col. Memmingers room on the bank question in a few minutes.  I have just quit the Governors dinner table where I spent a very pleasant evening with a party of gentlemen.  Col. Frank Pickens, Col. Isaac Hayne & Captain Cunningham were present with others.  I saw Captain Cunningham this morning.  He says Mrs. Cunningham & Pamela are in Charleston & very well.  Pamela is preparing to go on to Richmond about the Mount Vernon Association.  He says she would be perfectly well but for her excitement.  I said that was what kept her up.  The Captain has become quite garrulous & I thought simple in his conversation.  He is a bore.  He said he was a great Rhett man�that I and Rhett were the only consistent politicians in the state.  He had often said so.

	Hamlin Beattie has just been to my room & offered to carry a letter or anything else.  Consequently I write this letter.  Col. Hayne sat next to me at the table & was very cordial.  General Martin is living here with his family, but Hayne said he had not found out where he was.  I will enquire of Martin about having [a] bundle tomorrow & send it by Wells.

	I made a speech today in the House on the College.  But the question came up most unexpectedly & the debate will be resumed when my Bill comes up.  Col. Memminger spoke in reply & Col. Boylston & General McGowan also.

	I send your letter this evening & have just read it.  The story you mention about Gibson is very singular.

	Mrs. Chesnut & Judge Withers daughter are now at this Hotel, but I have not seen them.  After leaving the Governors dinner table I went to the supper room, but they had all gone but Mrs. LeConte.

	We had several elections today.  You can cut out the Editorials & send Anna as she desires to see them, or such of those as you think will interest her.  I will write to her in the morning.

	I must now bid you good night.  Kiss the children.  Tell Fannie I will write to her soon.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. In regard to my legal opinion nothing could be done with Perry as he did not break into the House.

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you the other day & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother with one I had recei[ve]d from Anna.

	I am delighted to hear you continue pleased with your school & have recei]ve]d no more demerits.  I hope you will be particular in that respect.  Also you must study hard & learn your lessons well & take a high stand in your class.  Your last report was pretty good, but I hope the next will be better.

	You must tell Bradford that I thank him for the paper sent me & when I return home I will notice it.  In my absence your mother wrote a paragraph acknowledging the receipt of it.  This is her first editorial.    

�.

		We have elected Judge Longstreet of Georgia President of the South Carolina College.  He has been President of the Mississippi University.  The College is doing very well now.  There are 170 students.  Mr. [Charles] Venable of Virginia has been elected to the chair of Mathematics.

	Your mother concluded it was not worthwhile to send you a box of books & bed quilts, as you could purchase blankets and books for what the box would cost by Adams� Express.  If you study hard after mustering with your musket & drawing the�you will not have much time to read miscellaneous books.  But when Willie comes on we may send you something.

	I shall certainly go & see you next summer before you start on your cruise, & perhaps your mother & some of the children may go with me.  

	As you receive the Patriot, you will see in my published letters all the news of the Legislature & Columbia.

	I shall be glad to see your likeness.  Willie says he had his taken the other day in Boston for ten cents, & that if you were there you might supply all your pretty girls who asked you for it, without breaking you.  Have you given your likeness to any of them yet?

	I am glad your mother sent you Fannies & I think the students in saying it is much prettier than you.  Fannie is one of the prettiest little girls I ever saw &is very smart.  She is improving very fast.

	I saw General Martin the other day & his son Willie who has grown very much, and he is a fine looking boy.

	You must write to me as often as you can & remember to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You must also present my respects to Captain Blake when you call to see him.  Give my love to your roommate & friend Bradford.

	This is Sunday & I have been all the morning writing letters.  It is the only leisure day I have.   Between the Courts & the Legislature & the College I am worked hard & kept very busy.  I write to your mother every day & also to the Patriot every day.

	I read a letter from your mother last night.  They are all well.  I wrote to Anna last week & have just written a letter to her today.  She is very much pleased with Lula LeConte who is at school with her & who is the daughter of Professor LeConte of the South Carolina College.  I told her to tell Lula that I would give her choice of you or Willie.  But as she is about your age I expect she will prefer Willie to waiting for you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday & therefore a leisure day with me.  Dr. LeConte gave me an invitation to go with him & Mrs. LeConte to church, but I declined on the ground that I had to write to you, your mother, Willie & Frank.  I also have to write for the Patriot & letters to others.

	I rece[ive]d your letter the other day addressed to me in Columbia & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother.  You do not know how much satisfaction it gives me to hear you are pleased with your school, that you have entered a high class and are diligently pursuing your studies.  I knew you would be satisfied as soon as your school commenced & you had something else to think about than home �sweet home� & the dear friends at home.

	The only thing that mars my happiness now is your cough.  I hope it is better.  It must be owing to some ex�in your throat, or may be to some piece of fishbone lodged in it.  I am sure it cannot be any defect in your lungs.  By no means have your pallate cut.  Dr. Geddings says this is altogether barbarous &�.  He says that allum pounded very fine & taken on your finger & placed on the palate is much better.  You can try this remedy & watch its effect.  You must write me about your cough in your next letter.

	I have not rece[ive]d any letters from Willie addressed to me in Columbia, but one forwarded from Greenville in which he says he has not heard from you for a long time.  You had better write him again.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Frank three days since.  Her is well & doing well.  So is Willie.

       There are no ladies in Columbia yet.  The commencement is one week later this year than usual.  Mrs. Chesnut & Miss Withers were here last week & went on the Charleston I expect & will return this week.  Col. Chesnut is a prominent candidate for United States Senator in place of Judge Butler.  We have had two ballotings & no election.  Governor Hammond is ahead & Col. Pickens next.  I am for Pickens & hope he may be elected.  
       
       Last night at the supper table Col. Carn of Walterborough told Mrs. LeConte & myself that his wife made you acquaintance here some years ago & fell in love with you that you were such a charming sweet little girl.  He said too that Mrs. Carn admired me so much that it excited his jealousy a little.  
       
       Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much of the Greenville news that I have nothing to tell.  I suppose she has told you of the marriage of Miss Bolling, and the death of young Lattimore a student in the Furman University.
       
       It is rumored here that Col. Wade Hampton Jr. is to be married to Miss McDuffie during the month of December.  His first wife was a sister of Col. Prestons & a most beautiful lady.  The colonel is young & handsome & rich, amiable & gentlemanly & is a good match for Miss McDuffie smart, pretty & rich.  I hope they may get married whilst I am here & invite me to the wedding or�.
       
       I dined with Governor Allston the other day & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mrs. Allston & his daughter will be here next week.    His son is here who was an officer in the army & a graduate of West Point.  He is a clever young man.  
       
       We have just had a meeting of the Board of Trustees & elected Judge Longstreet President of the College.  He was once President of the Mississippi University.  He is the author of Georgia Scenes& a man of great humour & considerable literary attainments.  Mrs. LeConte is very much pleased at his election.  The other Professors were all reelected except Pelham.  
       Give my love to Miss Lula & believe me your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have just come up from dinner & the clock has just struck two.  Whilst at dinner with Dr. & Mrs. LeConte, Col. Memminger Yeadon & myself, John Cunningham came & took a seat at out table.  In speaking of the Senatorial election he said he would go honestly against any man who was my candidate.  I replied I thought there was very little honesty in abandoning a mans principles or friends because anyone expressed them.  Some other conversation ensured & I told him that he himself was once a union man & his father also�that I was still where they had left me & gone over to the enemy.  He is the personification of an evil spirit.  I got through with dinner as soon as possible & left the table to get rid of his vile presence.

	At the table, Mrs. LeConte said to Yeadon, sitting by my side, that he was not himself today.  He replied, pointing to me, I am then madam beside myself.  That said Cunningham is the most perfect truth you ever uttered.  I hope Cunningham will not give us the pleasure of his company any day.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & enclosed I send you a ten dollar Bill to send Miss Hill.  General Martin has sent a large bundle for Susan which I will send Tuesday by Wells,

	I have no news to write you except what is contained in the two letters sent you for the Patriot.  Mr. Elford returned home Saturday morning, & will return to Columbia Tuesday.  If you have any letters from the children which would interest me you can send them by him.

	Instead of going to church today with Mr. & Mrs. LeConte as they requested me, I have been writing all day.

	Major Wright came to my room last night & left with me a brief in the case of Bonys�& delivered a message from Mr. Robert Maxwell that he wanted me to argue the case in the court of appeals & he would be responsible for my fees in the case.  This is good news, for I thought it doubtful, whether I should get anything out [of]  Bonys & Mather.

	I thank you  for your Editorial about the paper rece[ive]d from Bradford.  It was your first, & you have done so well that I believe I shall take you as a partner. 	

	I made a good speech last night before the committee on my Bill for reorganizing the college, and I think I carried the committee in favor of it.

	I am sorry your mother is so much worried about her apprehension of her house being broken open again.  I do not think there is any danger.  It would have been as well for them not to have proceeded at all against Perry.

	I am very much afraid Hammond will be elected to the Senate.  All the prominent men in the Legislature are against him.  Col. Hampton, Col. Preston, the speaker & President, Col. Memminger, Yeadon, Col. Means, Col. Irby, General McGowan, Col. Marshall, McCready, Col. Dudl[e]y & in fact all the gentlemen.  But the hoi pelloi are for him.  Petigru was very severe on some of them the other day.

	I a very wiling that Wiley & Charles should cut & have your mother wood as long as she desires.  Wiley must see about getting corn & fodder from Turner or someone else when it gives out.

	I shall endeavour to run home Saturday & return Tuesday.  Nothing will be done in the Legislature [on] Monday which is college commencement.  But the courts may detain me.

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I was disappointed in not receiving a letter from you on Saturday, the day on which I usually hear from you.  But I will write you a few lines, as you say you want me to write you once a week whether I hear from you once a week or not.

	My letter will have to be short for a very obvious reason, which is, I have�nt anything to write about.
	I have been enjoying the luxury of a holiday for a few days past, in consequence of this last week being Thanksgiving week.  Thanksgiving day is a great day in this part of the country, and is as much thought of as Christmas is among us.

	I received a letter from Pa the other day.  He is now in Columbia.  He had a run off as he went down but no one was injured.  But I expect he has written to you since he has been in Columbia.  This will be the first Commencement that I have not attended in Columbia for a good many years.  No doubt there will be as large a crowd as usual at it.

	I went yesterday to church three times in Boston, which shows how religious one will be when he is not compelled to attend Church.  In the morning I went to hear an Abolition preacher, but he did�nt touch much on politics.  After dinner I went to hear a man who pretended to be in a trance, and to preach while in that state.  He merely shut his eyes, and preached away.  He was a spiritualist, and preached on spiritualism.  He also delivered a poem, pretending to be influenced by the spirit of an Italian poet.  It was all humbug, but no doubt would have delighted Gen. Thompson as he believes so strongly in Spiritualism.

	I went to see Mr. Winthrop the other night, which I think will be the last of my visiting.

	I will close this letter for want of room and words.  You must write to me as regularly as possible.  If I were you I would drop some of my correspondents.  Your affectionate brother, W.H. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter enclosing two of Franks.  This has been a day of great excitement here in the election of United States Senator.  Governor Hammond was elected by twenty five votes over Col. Pickens.  There was Great exullation on the part of his friends.  I do not feel mortified very much.  I feel sure that he will be a supporter of the administration & will do very well in the Senate.

	Governor Manning & myself went to call on Pickens & were the first to tell him the news.  He bore his defeat very well & said to me he never would forget my friendship & support.  I think Manning might have been elected.  But it is all over now & you know I always make the best of misfortunes.  I do all I can to prevent them & then submit quietly.

	My idea is to elevate & not lower the standard of education in the South Carolina College.  This I will do by mak[ing] it a university.  They who wish can take a full course.  After graduating at Charleston, Spartanburg, Greenville & Abbeville the students can then go & finish at Columbia.

	In regard to my opinion	about Perry it is correct & the court who tried him were wrong.  But it is my will to make him quit the state.

	I am truly sorry to hear of Spartan Goodletts illness.  Wells tells me he cannot live.  Poor fellow�cut off in the prime of life, after all his trials & struggles against poverty & obscurity.

	Col. Memminger has just been in my room to talk about Hammonds election.  He regrets it very much.  I told him it was owing to the fanaticism of slavery.  Hammond had written ably on that subject, & every fool in the state thought his negro people�in danger & Hammond the Man to defend it.

	I saw old Mr. McBee this evening as I & Governor Manning were going to see Col. Pickens.  The old man says nothing new has occur[r]ed in Greenville.  I saw Wells just now & he promised to take Susans bundle.

	George Wells & D�s son are both admitted into the military school here.  I see that E.D. Earle & B.T. Earle are admitted as well as pay scholars from Greenville.  Who are they.  Perhaps Elias D. Earles sons.  Westmorelands son is also admitted as a pay scholar.

	I have just come up from the supper table where I met Mrs. Herndon the old colonel.  Mrs. Herndon says she is going to send her daughter to Bishop Davis school next summer.  She & the colonel enquired about you & all the children.  

	Col. Carn told me & Mrs. LeConte the other evening, that his wife had fallen in love with Anna. Two years ago�that she was a devoted reader of my paper & so much an admirer of me that it had excited a little his jealousy. Col. Carn is from Walterborough you remember.

	The ladies are beginning to come in.  Mrs. Garlington is here�Mrs. Chesnut &c.  But Mrs. Chesnut does not come to the table.  I have seen nothing of her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Report of the Committee on Bursary

	The Committee to whom was referred the letter of Professor Williams & the Memorial of the Students of the College on the subject of the Bursary have considered the same and beg leave to

Report

In the opinion of a majority of the Committee it would be impoliti  at this time, to break up the Commons, as suggested by the Memorial of the Students.  In order to satisfy themselves as to the fare in the Stewards Hall, the undersigned members of the Committee, without giving notice of their intention, went to the Commons last Saturday & dined there with the students.  They found the Hall, the tables & everything appertaining to them neat & cleanly.  The food was good & well cooked consisting of boiled mutton, roast beef, good bread & butter, sweet potatoes & rice, pickles &c.  The rice was better cooked, & the mutton sweeter & better prepared than any your Committee have tasted in the Hotels of Columbia.

	There was not the same variety on the table which one will meet at the Hotels but the food was better prepared.  In order to give a greater variety the Committee recommended that the board be increased to three dollars per week.  Everything is higher now, than it was some years since, when the rates were reduced to two dollars & fifty cents per week.

	In a conversation which the undersigned members of the Committee had with Colonel Gladden the Bursar, they were assured that he never purchased any meats in the market except the best.  He may have been occasionally mistaken in his selections. 

	Your Committee have no idea that the proposed increase in the rates of boarding will enable the Bursar to give entire satisfaction.  And perhaps ten dollars per week would not.  Your Committee are apprehensive that the Students have a prejudice against the system of boarding in Commons and that they entertain a hope of breaking it up by their continued opposition to it.  Whether this hope is encouraged, by the approval of the Professors, & any action of the Board of Trustees, there never will be anything but discontent on the part of the Students with the Commons.

	A majority of the Committee think it would not be in good faith to Colonel Gladden to break up the Commons without giving him due notice of the same.  If permitted to board in town, it is greatly to be feared that the Students would be under less restraint & more liable to go astray.  As to any improvement or deportment in their manners or deportment by boarding at private houses or hotels. Your Committee would state, that they never saw young gentlemen act with more propriety at any table whilst taking their meals.

	All of which is necessarily submitted.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter and one from Anna which I will send you.  I have to meet the Board of Trustees tonight & will write you a line before I go down.

	I have nothing special to write you except that I have just seen Alston Kayne who is on his way to Charleston with Mrs. Hayne & children.  He tells me Mrs. Hayne will increase his family, with good luck, in ten weeks.  He seems well pleased with Pendleton--says his mother spent the summer with him & her health is much improved.  He tried to get in at this Hotel, but could not.  He went to the American.  He looks rather rusticated , but is joyous & happy.  He enquired after all of you kindly & said he never heard of your mothers illness till recently.  He says he had made a fine crop.  Mr. Sharpes family have been sick.  He seemed glad that your uncle Arthur was not put in nomination for the Senate.  He expressed himself very much gratified too of the election of Hammond.  He has formed a very high estimate of Hammonds talent.

	Mrs. LeConte told me just now that she had just rece[ive]d a letter from her daughter in which she speaks of Annas saying a great deal about me & expressing her wish to be with me.  

	I see Tench Carson is here going up in the morning.  Wells tells me Spartan Goodlett is beyond all hopes of recovering.  Campbell is down here & says he will stay till after commencement.

	I was in court today pretty much all day waiting for my cases in Law, but they were not reached.  I shall be there tomorrow too.  The Bank question is being discussed in the House.  Gregg, Whaley, [James M.] Gadberry & [James J.] McCarter made speeches.  McCrady has the floor for tomorrow, but sent word by Memminger that he would yield it to me.  I do not care to speak.  Nothing can be done with the Banks.  They are more powerful than the Legislature.

	Governor Manning had a long talk with [me] today about establishing a new Paper in Charleston to advocate our principles.  It has been determined on, & will be in opposition to the Charleston Mercury.

	I and John Cunningham get on very well together now.  He seems quite friendly and I supposed intended nothing but a little playful humor in his remarks to me on Sunday.  

	I was in conversation with a parcel of Hammond men today & told them that their�was not so great as Hammond was with me in giving the election of Electors to the people with me in opposing the opening of the slave trade, indifferent about a national convention, and I had no doubt would be an administration man & act with the Democratic party.

	I wish to see you & the children very much, & it will be a great pleasure to be with you a day.  I shall go home on Saturday as a great many of the members will do, & return Monday.  So I shall not be at the college commencement.  My visit home too will be an event in the routine of business here.  We will then talk over matters & things in general.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have been in court all day arguing the case of Bonys & Sloan from Anderson & am very tired.  I have to conclude my argument tomorrow, & then all of my cases in the law court of appeals will be over.  Next week same term my equity cases will come on.  I think I shall get a new trial in Bonys & Mather & then a good fee,

	I shall go home Saturday & return Monday.  This therefore is the last letter I will write you till I see you.  I have just rece[ive]d Fannies letter & was glad to hear from you.  

	Mrs. LeConte proposed today at dinner that I should let Anna go with her sister Miss Graham to Philadelphia & consult some eminent Physician who makes the throat & lungs his peculiar study & see what is the matter with her.  I have just written to Bishop Doane to let her go.  Mis Graham will go over next Friday & take Anna & Lula to Philadelphia.  Mrs. LeConte is now writing to her sister & to the Bishop.  They will stay till Monday & return to Burlington.  This will be some satisfaction to us to know what does cause her cough.

	Governor Means told me a most horrible thing on John Cunningham last night.  He was indicted last court, the other day in Charleston for a rape on an Irish girl whom Mrs. Cunningham had sewing for her.  He went to settle with the woman & abused her.  She took out a warrant & the attorney general handed out an Indictment.  Eleven of the Jury were for finding a true Bill, but it required a twelve jurors, & so he was discharged.  She was a great big fat girl & it was said ought to have been strong enough to have defended herself.  But one more Juror would have put the gentleman on his trial for his life & death!   I suppose he does not deny having intercourse with her, & that he used some force, but she did not tell of it soon enough or it might have taken his neck.  What a villain he is.  What a derangement he seems to have on that subject.  He looks as imprudent as if nothing had ever happened. I will tell you more about it when I see you & in the meantime burn this letter for fear it may fall into the hands of the children or someone years after this.  And I would not like it known that I had written such a thing to you.

	I must now conclude my letter.  How happy I am at the idea of seeing you & the children Saturday evening.  What a joyous meeting it will be.  Kiss the children for me.  Oh how I long to kiss you all myself & how the little fellows�around me once more.  Col. Irby goes up with me as far as Laurens & a great many of the members will go home to avoid the College Commencement.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & I have become alarmed about your cough.  Mrs. LeConte will write this evening to her sister Miss Graham to go over to Burlington & take you & Lula home with her to get some eminent Physician in Philadelphia. Who make[s] the throat & the lungs his exclusive study  to examine your throat & see what is the matter with you.  Mrs. LeConte says her sister will go after you on Friday & let you return Monday.  Saturday Major LeConte will send for a Physician to see you & have a full & perfect examination of the cause of your cough.  I shall then be better satisfied.  So you & Lula may prepare for a pleasant excursion to Philadelphia.

	I will write a letter & enclose it for the Bishop to let you go.  He must not refuse.  I sent your letter to your mother last night & I know it will distress her very much.

	They are all well at home & doing well.  I am going home day after tomorrow & return Monday.  I shall therefore not be at the commencement in College.  Already a good many ladies have come down to attend the commencement--Mrs. Herndon, Mrs. Garlington, Mrs. Chesnut, Miss Withers & others.

	I have just been arguing a case in court all day & have not been in the Legislature at al today.  They are discussing the Bank question.  I shall take no part in the debate.

	White of Abbeville took first, Rivers second and Keith of Pickens third honor.  But Keith felt that injustice had been done him & refused to accept the third honor.  He was suspended.  I saw young Buist who is teaching school in Barnwell.  He has grown a good deal.

	I heard from Frank last night & he is well.  He Gave his likeness to Alice Green & is going to have another taken to send his mother.

	I will now conclude my dear daughter & write a letter to the Bishop.  Give my love to Lula LeConte.  Tell her that her Father delivered a beautiful, able & most learned & scientific Inaugural last Tuesday night in the House of Representatives before a brilliant audience which drew further admiration from all who were present.  Her uncle will deliver his Inaugural next Tuesday night.

	I am happy my dear daughter to know you are satisfied & I hope your cough will soon be better.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I enclose you a letter of Anna�s, but have not time to write you.  I am very much distressed about Anna & shall write to her tomorrow to quit her studies.  It is likely that I will go on for her as soon as I hear from her Physician in Philadelphia.  

	I did not reach here the day I left home till eleven oclock in the night.  The up train ran off & left the cars on the road.  Today I was busy in�case & they have decided not to do anything till the Alabama case is decided.  I will write to him tomorrow.  

	I have just returned from dinner with Mr. Speaker Simons & a pleasant company of gentlemen.  

	It is now twelve oclock.  I have just seen Mrs. LeConte &the Dr. who read me a portion of their daughters letter about Anna which is pretty much as Anna writes.  

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte leave in the morning for Savannah.

	I did not hear from you this evening as I expected.

	I have been engaged in court all day today.  It is now five oclock & the Legislature have a night session at six.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & the Bundle by Wells.

	It is expected that I will make a speech on the Bank question & perhaps I may tonight.

	The House is now full of ladies.  But I have not had time to make their acquaintance or even enquire who they are.  Mrs. Fair is here & Mr. Dr. Fair has returned.  Wallace Thompsons daughters are here.

	General Gadberry told me a good joke & a compliment paid me & Mrs. LeConte the other day.  Sitting together at the supper table this gentleman supposed we were husband & wife & remarked that we were the handsomest & finest looking couple he had ever seen in his life.  General Gadberry said he concurred & responded to the sentiment.  I told him if he had seen Mrs. Perry he would have thought we were still a finer looking couple.

	Mrs. LeConte went off today.  She remarked last night she had never seen me so much distressed as I was on hearing from Anna.  I could not sleep well & have been distressed all day.  I wrote to Anna this morning to quit her studies.  I hope the next letter may contain better news.  But I presume she had better return home.

	I hope your mother & Anne may like Center & take her.  It was a great bargain.  She is worth two or three hundred dollars.  

	I dined with Col. Sem� yesterday & spent a pleasant evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was greatly distressed to hear of your feeble health.  You must suspend your studies till your health improves.  If you do not get better in the course of a week or two I will go for you & bring you home.

	I am anxious to hear what the doctor in Philadelphia says about your cough.  Write me all about what he says.  I should be glad if he would write me himself.

	I went home last Saturday & was actually on the road whilst you were writing to me.  I came back Tuesday & did not reach Columbia till near eleven oclock in the night.  We were delayed by the up train breaking down.

	They were all well at home.  But your mother has no doubt written to you all the news & I will not repeat it.

	Mrs. LeConte leave[s] here today for Georgia.  Mrs. LeConte read me portions of Lula�s letter last night.  Give my love to Lula.

	The House has been crowded with young ladies.  But I was absent & have seen very little of them.  The Ball passed off very well says Mrs. LeConte.  The most pleasant & agreeable one they have had for years.  

	The Governors daughter is not here.  She is not very pretty but a sweet looking girl.  His son is not remarkable for his appearance.  Mrs. Chesnut is handsome.  I saw Miss Eliza Irby (that was) & her fat husband.  Yesterday we had quite a display of Ladies in the gallery.

	I dined last evening with the Speaker Col. Simons & met Governor Manning.  I also met a gentleman from Virginia who married Miss Manning Sm� who was a great beauty but I suppose you never heard of her.  She went to school at Greenville and was born in Spartanburgh.

	I made a speech on Friday which seemed to exhaust all my strength & made me feeble indeed.  I am now well again.  I spoke an hour & a quarter on the Bank question & General McGowan tells me everyone says it was a great speech & one which made many converts against the Banks.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Dr. Gannts [Gantt] which made me more�about Anna.  I have nothing to write you except what I have written to the Patriot.  I enclose you two sheets which you must take as a letter.

	I see Mrs. Brooks here on her way to Greenville.  She has been to see her daughter below.

	General Thompson & wife are here on their way to Greenville.  Charles Hammond is here on his return from Dr. Allens marriage.  Easl[e]y, Gantt & Jones went up Saturday.

	I cannot say when we will adjourn.  I am overrun with business in court & the Legislature.

	You need not trouble yourself about Willie & Lula.  Thomas said {word obscured] joke.  Nor need you think anything about what Lula says.  The girls are mischief making between her & Anna.  Tattlers are abominable.  

	I do not like to talk about Perdicaris to Col. Memminger.  They are very great friends.  No doubt the sickness of his son, only child, has absorbed all their thoughts & you must excuse them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening enclosing Willies & Franks.  It is now nearly twelve oclock in the night & I have not time to write you.  Enclosed you will find my letter to the Patriot giving you all the news I have.

	Governor Swain goes up to Greenville tomorrow & I asked him to call & see you & my library whilst in Greenville.  He said he would do so, if he remained a day in Greenville.  He is on his way to Asheville.  He says he remembers seeing you & your mother & sisters.

	I hope Lindy & all the servants are behaving better.  I have not heard anything more from Anna. Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

       Col. Hayne gave me a bundle for you from Charleston today which I will send by Wells.

	Enclosed I send you a short letter which I wish put in the next Patriot.

	I have just read your letter &�take a few minutes to write you.  Enclosed I send you five dollars as directed.

	I have heard nothing from Anna.  I suppose she has gone to Philadelphia.  I hope she will be better.

	I am glad to hear Mahaffey is hauling corn.  I was afraid he had not sold it.

	We are very quiet here now & all the ladies have gone.  Did you see or hear anything of Governor Swain.  

	I suppose your remark about Mrs. Thompson is a hint to me in not pressing you to come to Columbia with me.  Nothing would have given me more pleasure than to have had you here.  But you know you declined coming on account of Arthur.  Next Fall I will visit & bring you.

	General Thompson went up Monday.  He met Mrs. Thompson before she reached Florida.  

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Enclosed I send you a letter from Mr. Perdicaris which explains all you have been wishing to know.  It is the latest intelligence which I have had from Anna by ten days.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Franks Report.  It is pretty well.  He stands about midway in his class which does very well considering all the boys are older,

	I rece[ive]d a letter today inviting me to the anniversary dinner of the New England Society in Charleston on the 22nd but I cannot attend.

	I have just left the House of Representatives & feel sleepy so you will have to put up with a short letter.  The letter to the Patriot will answer instead a letter to you.

	I bought Luther a very pretty cap for one dollar today.

	The election of Trustees takes place tomorrow.  General McGowan chairman of the committee to nominate says there will be no difficulty to mine & Memmingers nomination & election.

	Elford goes up in the morning & will carry my letters.

	Mr. William Lyles of Fairfield presented me with a new book �The Calhoun Tribute� today in the Bookstore as a memorial of his friendship although differing so widely in politics.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just read your letter and have but a moment to write you in reply.   The House meets at six & it is now within fifteen minutes of that time.

	I rece[ive]d this evening the Patriot & Enterprise.  This morning I was engaged in court & disposed of all my cases but two which were continued till May.

	I wrote Frank a letter today in the House.  I have also written to Mr. Perdicaris.

	I am sorry Wiley is behaving so badly.  He will do better when I return.  I am glad you saw Mrs. Stokes & Mrs. Gilreath.   I am sorry you did not see Governor Swain, & he did not see you & the children & my Library.  He is truly & sincerely my friend & admirer.  

	I think it probable now that I shall be at home Monday night, & a happy return it will be for me.  I anxiously wish to be once more with my wife & children.

	The committee reported today, my nomination as one of the trustees of the college.  The election takes place tomorrow.  I care nothing about the position since I have sent my son to another college.  Col. Carn,[John A.] Inglis & Legare have been nominated in the place of Preston, Hampton & Gillespie who refused to serve any longer.  

	The Legislature have done nothing of interest today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [John LeConte, Washington, DC]

	Your kind letter has just been rece[iv]ed.  It will be a great favor to me, if you will take charge of my daughter and bring her to Columbia.

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Miss Graham in relation to Anna, & shall leave here in the morning for Greenville.  If I find that I can reach Philadelphia sooner than you will leave there I may go on for Anna.  But if I do not I have written to Miss Graham to send her by you.

	In taking charge of my poor child & bringing her to Columbia you will place me under great obligations to you.  Let me know in Greenville the day you will reach Columbia, & I will meet you here.

	The news of my daughters health will be very distressing to her mother, but I hope a southern climate & free exercise in the open air will restore her.

	I wish you, my dear sir, the success in your lectures, which they merit.

	With the greatest respect I am truly & sincerely yours &c., B.F. Perry

	Enclosed I send you a hundred dollar Bill to pay the expenses of my daughter and any little matters she may owe in Philadelphia.

	This is Sunday & I cannot purchase a check on New York.  I leave in the morning for Greenville before the Banks are opened.  I hope you will be able to get the Bill off.

	I wrote you some time ago in reference to bringing my daughter to Columbia.  I am laboring under a severe cold & do not expect to be able to go for Anna as you have kindly offered to rake charge of her.

	I am with great respect & esteem truly & sincerely yours &c., B.F. Perry

Dear Mama

	I received a letter from you yesterday; I also received the one containing Fannie�s Christmas present, for which I am very much obliged to her.  They came just in time, as I had lost one of mine.

	I wrote to Pa last Sunday, and directed to Columbia, but I�m afraid he had left Columbia, before my letter reached there.  I received a letter from Anna the other day, written in Philadelphia.  She says that the Physician says she must go home, and she is going with Dr. John LeConte.  She says that she is going on the 31st of this month, so she will be at home not long after this letter reaches there.  I was very much surprised.  I had no idea that Anna was so unwell.  I am sorry of it, but will be glad to see her at home when I get there, and I hope that she will be well by that time.  I will write to her today, but I expect she will have left Philadelphia, the letter gets there.  I thought it was all humbug sending her off to school so far, from the first.

	In my last letter I told you that we were invited to Mr. Winthrop�s to dinner yesterday (Saturday).  Though I did�nt at first intend to go, I had concluded to go, but it snowed so hard all day yesterday, that neither the Memmingers not myself could go.  I did�nt care about going at first, and was glad that the snow made a good excuse for not going.

	We went last Tuesday night to hear an oration by Mr. Everett, and liked it very much.

	Today is Sunday.  The ground is covered with snow, and it is as cold as anything.  Day before yesterday was Christmas.  I hope that you have had a merry one.  I cant say that I have.  We had holiday that day, which was very acceptable.

	The time for going home is now approaching and you don�t know [how] glad I am of it.  Being so far from home makes one value a visit home more.

	I will be all the way with the Memmingers now, on the way home, as I wont have to go by Annapolis.  I forgot, I wont be with them, as I will certainly go by Annapolis to see Frank; but I will be with them that far.  There are two students in our class from Baltimore, who will be with us that far.

	It is near dinner time, so I will close, as I will have to go to chapel this evening, and write to Anna too.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Anna

	I received your last letter in due time.  I was rather surprised to see that you were in Philadelphia though Ma had told me that you were, perhaps going there.  But I was still more surprised, and sorry to learn that you were so unwell as to have to go home.  Though you have been telling me about your cough, I had no idea that it was as bad a one as it is.

	I will be glad to see you at home a good deal more so than at Burlington.  Of course I will ride with you.  

	I am not certain whether you will get this letter, for today is the 27th and you are going to leave Philadelphia on the 31st.   I would�nt like to write a long letter to be sent to the dead-letter office.

	You will like Dr. John LeConte I expect, for he is a very clever man.  It is well that you have so good an opportunity to go home, for no doubt Pa would be busy.  I will reach home sooner as I wont have to go by Burlington.  I hope that when I get home I will find you perfectly well.

	It is only about three weeks now before the time for me to start home.  You may believe that I am glad of it.  

	As I don�t know whether you will get this letter, I had better bring it to a close.

	Remember me to the girls & young ladies I should have said, when you get home.  Your affectionate brother, Willie
