My dear Liz

	Mr. Thompson was here this morning & I write you a line merely to inform you that I shall be at home tomorrow.

	I had only three small cases here & two of them have been disposed of.  The other will not be tried, but requires my presence today.  Col. [James H.] Irby is here, came last night & I wish to close our trade with his note.  He informs me that Maria is satisfied, & from what he tells me of the management of his negroes I have no doubt he is a good master.  He is anxious to get�home again.

	We have quite a number of Lawyers here in attendance on court.  Col. Dawkins, Irby, Waites, Thompson, Young &c.  They are all complaining of hard times in their profession.  Henry tells me that both he & Dean who are in copartnership will not make $1000 this year between them.  He seemed greatly surprised when I told him that I had already received $900 this year.

  	I am very much pleased with Judge Withers.  In my opinion he is the ablest man on the Bench.  He is quite pleasant & agreeable on the bench.  There were some doubts about his temper.

	Kiss the children for me & tell Willey he must continue�.  There is to be a great Fair here tonight & if any little thing suits I will buy it for a present for the children or you.  Thompson is leaving.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am not well this evening.  Last night I had an attack diarrhea prostrated me for a time.  Today I have been all day labouring in a capital case for which I shall receive no fee.  The poor fellow is unable to pay a lawyer for defending him.  He was convicted last court of the murder of Vance & got a new trial.  In the absence of Col. Leitner I have been assigned counsel for him by the court.

	I hope I shall feel better in the morning.  If I do not, I shall not be able to continue in the management of the case which will take all day again.

	I have seen Dr. Teague but have not had a settlement with him yet.  I must�in the morning.  I expect he will not feel very willing to pay me as much as I think I ought to have.

	Elford Thompson, Speers & Wells came down this morning in the stage, but brought me no news from Greenville except that my dog & Moony�s son were all the talk there�great threats are made against�.  I hope Jim will not let him be killed before I return.

       I have not seen any of Captain Cunninghams family or heard from them.
       
       I came down all alone on Sunday�stopped on the roadside & ate my dinner by myself.  
       
       I hope to hear from you Thursday morning.  I shall return home Friday if [I] get no worse.  I find the Judge complaining in the same way with myself.
       
       This morning (Wednesday) I feel much better than I did last night when I wrote the above lines.  Sleep has in great measure restored me.
       
       Kiss the children for me.  I am anxious to see you all again.  In haste, your husband, B.F. Perry

	The weather is so bad this morning that I shall not return home today unless there is a change.  The rain has been pouring down in torrents for the last two days.

	I have got through with my business & am anxious to be at home on many accounts, but I have too much love for my wife & children to expose myself {on] such a day as this is.  Besides I have some regard for my own comfort & health.

	I was quite unwell when I wrote you last, but am pretty much recovered now.  A ride in the rain all day might make me sick again.

	I saw Richard Harrison who informed me you were all well, which I was glad to hear but you ought to have written to me.  I did not know him when he first spoke to me.  He came up behind me at the Bar & shook hands, and I was not going to say anything more�supposing it was some young man about the village.  When he told me he had seen you, I then noticed him & recognized him and was very glad to see him.  He is a clever young man.  As he was leaving the Bar I told him to give my respects to his Bride.  He said there was no other lady in Sumter., that I ought to send some compliments to, for she was greatly�with me and had a great deal to say about our meeting at Saratoga Springs.  It was Miss Nelson, a relation of the Bradleys.  

	The poor fellow I defended the other day has been convicted of murder.  I did not make a speech for him, for I know it [was] not worthwhile.  Mr. Speers & Garlington spoke in his defence.  I examined the witnesses.  They are now trying his accomplice & will convict him of murder also.  The next case is a woman for killing her child! and she will be convicted too.  

	I truly regret that I shall not be able to see you & the children tonight.  Kiss them for me & tell Frank to pray for Pa to come�home.  Tell Will to keep head and Anna to learn her book so as to say her lesson to me.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as Col. Thompson says he will return in the morning.

	I shall probably get off Thursday though it is uncertain how long a certain case will occupy the court.  I am trying to compromise it, but do not expect to succeed.

	We have very little business here & a prospect of less next court.  I have recd two hundred dollars on Mattisons note.  Suddith says he will pay me $50 at Greenville court on Fowlers note and $100 from Major Henry in Mr. Thomas Case will enable us to square off & have some balance.  But the Sawyer�s prospect bis now a gloomy one.

	I find it rumored here that I will be a candidate for Congress, but the more I think of it the less inclined am I.  How can I give up the pleasures & vexations of you & the children for six months?  How can you & the children do without my counsel & advice?

	General Whitner has given me an invitation to go see his wife, children, & coons.  I told him the wife & children were inducement enough without putting in the coons.

	I have sent Col. [John] Bausketts money to General McDuffie by Mr. Perrin.

	We had a pleasant dinner on the roadside on Sunday.  Butler made a fire & we ate in great comfort.

	I have neither seen nor heard anything of Mr. Sharpe.

	I hope you & the children are doing well & the servants giving you no trouble.  

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours truly &c, B. F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just written Col. Townes a long letter on the prospects of the Rail Road.  The people of Columbia are now very much in favor of it.  Col. Preston made them a speech which has completely revolutionized them.  

	I have nothing to write you of interest.  We had a pleasant journey down, Col. Coleman, Mr. McBee, General Thompson & Major Earle.  We feasted high on the road every day at twelve oclock.

	I have not yet had time to purchase Vardrys chair.  I am much pressed with business�have been appointed to examine law students�have to argue a case in the Court of Errors tomorrow�have to attend the Rail Road meeting &c &c.  You must therefore value this hasty epistle, written amidst so much hurry.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell Will I shall expect to find him head of his class.  I will endeavour to bring all the children some little present.  I wish you to write me every mail.  It is a great relief to my mind to hear from you. 

	I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Webster in Columbia on Thursday.  They are making great preparations to entertain him.  I expect I shall have to attend their Ball.

	It is probable that Mr. Kilgore will be elected President of the Rail Road Company.

	I have seen nothing of Col. Taylor or any of your kin.

	Col. Dawkins & his new wife have gone to Charleston to see Mr. Webster.

	Col. Herndon has given up his dye for his hair & he is now as gray headed as any man you ever saw.

	We have very few lawyers here at this time.

	I suppose Susan is staying with you & I hope you will find her company pleasant & a satisfaction to you in the absence of her husband.

	Kiss the children & believe me your truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	The rail road convention adjourned last evening, & I now have time to write you, which I had not before.  

	I recd your letter last night & thank you kindly for it, but�.you know too well my deep feelings of love & affection for you & the children�anxious to hear from you every mail.

	Your letter was handed to me as I was starting last night at nine oclock to see Mr. Webster at Col. Prestons.  I stopped a read it here & then again this morning.    The Party at Preston�s was a magnificent one.  Mrs. Preston took my arm & carried me to Mrs. Webster & gave me an introduction.  Mrs. Webster is a very tall masculine & intellectual looking woman about forty five, dresses very fine & has no children.  I had no opportunity of talking to her, as she was engaged in conversation with some one when I was introduced.  Mrs. Preston enquired about you & why you did not come with me to Columbia.  She said she regretted that she did not hear you were here last winter that she would have called to see you &c &c.

	Mr. Webster looked very much pleased at his reception.  I told him I was happy to see him in South Carolina & he thanked me very politely.   He made a short speech to the college Boys from Col. Prestons Portico.  They had illuminated the college & formed a torch light procession.  The Judges were all present.  The supper was a magnificent display of strawberries & ice creams, wines of every description.  I never before saw such a quantity of Strawberries.

	Dr. Lieber gives a party tonight & I have recd a written invitation.  The governor gives a dinner tomorrow at 5 oclock & has sent me an invitation done up in most beautiful style.  They have a Ball tomorrow night to which I am not invited, but can invite myself by paying five dollars.

	Judge O�Neall has been elected President of the Rail Road company�McBee, Coleman & Kilgore directors for Greenville.  We had quite an interesting meeting.  On my motion Col. Preston made a most magnificent speech to the convention at night.  Mr. Poinsett, Col. Elmore & many other distinguished men were at the convention.

	I forgot to mention that I saw Mrs. Poinsett last night at Col. Prestons.  She enquired most kindly after you & the children.  I told her I had just rece[ive]d a letter from you in which you stated you had been out to her residence after Strawberries, but found none.  She said she was very sorry to hear the vines were not bearing.  They go to Greenville on Monday.  I have just recd a valuable present from Col. Summer of some hundred fifty volumes of Congressional books�Executive documents &c &c.  They are all bound & very large works, & will fill a large book case from top to bottom.  It will be a large addition to my Library.  He bought them with the printing office & has no use for them.

	I saw Judge Butlers little daughter at Col. Prestons.  She told me that she was looking for her Father to come after her�that she was well pleased with Columbia but liked Greenville much better.  She seems very grave & sedate, as much as her grandfather Hayne.

	Mr. Webster has just been into the court of Appeals where I saw him sitting on the bench with the Judges & a great crowd in the court house to see him.

14 May 1847

I will this morning conclude my long letter as I shall not have time to do so this evening after my return from the governors dinner.

	I expected to have gone last night to Dr. Liebers party, but I felt so much fatig[u]ed & exhausted that I could not muster courage enough to walk through the mud & sit up till twelve oclock again.  And these parties are dull places�great crowds of strangers thrown together & nothing to talk about.

	Mr. Webster dined with the Miss Hamptons yesterday & went to look at Hamptons negroes & see their mode of living &c.

	I have purchased for you Amy Herbert & Holmes Gardner�s but could not get the other books on your list.  The other purchases I will make in due time.

	I do not know when I shall be able to leave here, perhaps not before Tuesday or Wednesday next.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell them to be good & Papa will bring them something.  I am glad to hear Will has turned down four more boys.  I hope he will soon be head.

	I must now go to my breakfast.  I will write you again before I leave Columbia & give you an account of the dinner.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your short letter by Fridays mail, & I truly regret that Susan & Luther are not doing better.  He is a great fool & I have no doubt a very disagreeable husband.  But Susan should reflect that she was not a stranger to him when they married, & she promised before her God to love, honor & obey him.

	General Thompson did speak to McBee as we came down about doing something for Luther.  He said he was afraid to mention Pinckney on account of his interest.  McBee told him Luther was not capable of doing anything, that he & Tench Corson had already spent for him $30,000.  This I should suppose hardly true.

	We had a pleasant dinner at Governor Johnsons & all made speeches, drank a good deal of wine, & went to the Ball.  Judges, Governor, Webster & all.  There was a very large assembly at the Ball, but very little beauty.  I did not see one pretty face in the room.  One of two things has certainly happened to me.  The Ladies are less pretty than they used to be or I have lost my perception of female beauty.

	Col. Dawkins & wife were at the Ball.  I had considerable conversation with her & she was the only lady I did speak to.  She seems pleasant & agreeable�  She said all wives were ambitious for their husbands to be great men.  

	Yesterday I was invited to dine at Dr. Gibbes with Mr. Webster & the Judges & Professors in college.  The dinner was the most interesting party I have yet been at.  Webster covered a great deal & his conversations were remarkably interesting.

	I went to church this morning & sat with Dr. Gibbes & Chancellor Harper.  Mr. Webster & lady were there.  The new Episcopal church is a magnificent building & beautiful inside. The handsomest church in South Carolina.  Mrs. Alexander Taylor was just in front of me.  I went up to her after service & she seemed really glad to see me, took my arm & I conducted her to her carriage.  She enquired after the children & yourself, said her children had the [w]hooping cough.  She invited me to call & see them.

	I recd your letter this evening dated Friday evening & was truly glad to hear from you.  In it you mention the expected marriage OF Miss Walker.  I heard a [piece of scandal which I will mention.  Dr. Ellet & his wife have separated on account of that little�fellow Theodore Gourdine!!  And it is said he seems rather proud of the�
  
	I shall not be able to leave here till Wednesday or Thursday.  If anything should occur tomorrow I will write you again.  Kiss the children for me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I shall start home after breakfast this morning, but Mr. Willington has kindly offered to carry this letter which will reach you [a] day sooner than I shall, as he goes up in the stage.

	I have nothing to write you since I wrote you last, except that I have made some purchases�a little chair for Susan which I have sent by the stage�two large rocking chairs for you & myself price $7.00 with cane bottoms.  They will be sent up by wagon.  I have purchased a ball for William, a glass doll for Anna, a knife & a trumpet for Frank and I will give William my old knife as I have bought a new one for myself.  I have purchased two beautiful gold Birds price $3.25cts for you & Anne.

	I have just returned from a rail road meeting & it is now later & must conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Mr. & Mrs. Thompson who go to Greenville in the morning though I have nothing worth telling you.  But you requested me to write when I was about starting & I will do so.  

	I hope you & the children are all well & doing well in my absence.  How long I shall be detained here is very doubtful, perhaps till Friday.  Two of my cases have been continued, & the other is at the foot of the Dockett.  You must postpone your contemplated event till I return home.  Next week is the proper time.  I will then be at home.  But I should not regret my return to find you well & an additional member of the family in this happy world.

	I have been fortunate in seeing today one hundred dollars of Major Henry as a part of my costs in the case of Croft vs. Thomas.  This was rather better luck than I expected when I left home, for I remember saying to you I should not receive a dollar.  

	Chancellor Caldwell is presiding & it is his second circuit since his election to the Bench.  I am much pleased with him as a Judge.  He is very kind & civil & sufficiently learned to make a good chancellor.  Col. Herndon & Mr. Young are the only lawyers here from the adjoining districts except General Thompson & myself.

	Mrs. Thompson says her health is very much improved from her short visit to the Glenn Springs.  Miss McClanahan, daughter of Sam McClanahan of Greenville, took the first honor at the Lexington school the other day, a good medal worth ten or twenty dollars for the first composition.  This will fill Sam with joy.  There were thirty competitors.
	
I see Mr. Tench Carson here.  He looks quite gray.

	I saw the Dantzellers on Sunday expecting to get dinner.  You know I  refused to carry everything with me to eat.  I saw a good many persons in the House & enquired if Dantzeller was at home.  They informed me that he was a corpse in the house & had died that morning!  I rode on without dinner to this place.

	I have enclosed an editorial notice of the Spartanburgh Paper on the Southern Quarterly which I am sure you will read with pleasure as it contains a compliment to your husband.

	I met the family of Mr. William Elliot here on Sunday evening at supper but though they were some of the ordinary borders till they had gone the next day.  They are certainly very ordinary looking.  I sat opposite to them & thought they were the�of some shop keepers.

	Old Mr. Parker enquired about your mother today & said your uncle John McColl married a very near relation of his, a Miss Lesesne (Lesayne). This is all news to me.

	Look for me about Friday.  Good night & kiss the children.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as you requested me to do though I have nothing to write you about.  It would be much more satisfactory to [me] if I could hear from you.  I hope however that nothing will happen till I reach home.  You must postpone as you promised and I will endeavour to be at home on Saturday.

	I shall leave here tomorrow evening & go as far as old Pendleton.  The next day I will stop & see Mr. [John C.] Calhoun & spend an hour or two with him.  I will also call to see Mrs. Sharp if I possibly can do so.

	It is pretty generally rumored here that I am to be a candidate for Congress & I believe is generally approved of.  Mr. Keith told me that it was the general wish of the people of Pickens district.  Mr. Sloan says he will not be a candidate as I have been informed.  Mr. Webb tells me that Col. [James L.] Orr had an idea of offering but that he would not oppose me.  The impression is that I will have no opposition if I become a candidate.  

	Mr. Perrin is the only lawyer here from the other districts except myself.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not well.  Mr. & Mrs. Roper arrived here this evening from Greenville.  I saw Mr. Isaac Henry who told me something strange had happened in Greenville since I left home.  I did not see Col. [Benajah] Dunham as he hoped though whilst I was in Court I heard Mr. Roper saying this evening at the supper table that he was delighted with Greenville, that place was beautiful & the people very dear &c.  It seems he had been staying at this House sometime before he went to Greenville.  His wife is quite a contrast in size to himself.

	This has been a delightful day.  I hope Charles will go on with his plowing.  Sunday was a drizzling day & my mare behaved badly.  Broke the trace as I expected when I started, fretted a great [deal] with the fl�.   I mended the trace & came on very well.

	You must write me a line by Col. Townes or General Thompson who will both come over to Pickens on Wednesday.  Write what letters have come for me.    How you & the children are doing [well] & the servants.

	I must now conclude this letter & bid you good night.  Kiss the children for me & tell them to behave well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight as Colonel Townes will return in the morning.

	We had quite a spirited meeting here today, & I made a pretty good speech which has taken well.  My prospects are as good as I could expect & I rather think that I will beat Colonel Orr at almost every Box in the district.  From Pumpkin Town Esquire Sutherlin writes me I will get two thirds of the Box.  �& others tell me that I will get three to one at Fair Play.  W. Lee says I will not loose a vote on Corneross.  At Bachelors Retreat I will beat�  The news from other places is very similar.

I saw Lee & gave him the bundles for Mrs. Dunlap.  He gave me one for Anne.  I saw Foster & his son Clark.  Josiah was not here.  His health is bad.  The rest of my relations are all well.  Josiah has a fine crop.

	In consequence of the absence of General Tompson I have been employed in several of Keiths cases.  I do not now expect to get off from here before Friday morning.  William seems very well satisfied & is now sitting up reading Headey�s Lives beside me & it is near nine oclock.

	Colonel Townes left home this morning at four oclock he tells me & returns in the morning�a pretty flying visit.

	I have nothing more in the way of news to write you.

	Kiss the children for me.  Will had a present of chesnuts today from a countryman & will carry them home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have but one moment to write you by Mr. Elford as I have just understood that he is going this morning.

	Willie is behaving like a little man & is the admiration of all who see him.  He sits in court, goes to the tavern, plays with those around him & reads Hendleys Washington & amuses himself very well.  He says I must tell you & Anna, Frank, & Fanny that he wishes to see you.

	There is very little business in court & we shall probably get off Thursday morning.  I have been employed in several cases since I came here.

	In regard to politics I am doing well & have flattering news from all quarters.  We have a public meeting today on the Wilmot Proviso.

	Tell Jim to sow & plough in the rye.

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening & received your letter after tea, for which I thank you more sincerely.  It always gives me the greatest interest to hear from you & the children although you may have nothing more to write than that you are all well.

	Major Earle informed me last night that his wife & children passed through Columbia yesterday evening & that he only got to see them in the streets.  I told him that if I had been in his place, they should have staid all night or I would have gone with them.  He had not seen them for four weeks!
He should be ashamed to mention the fact and I rather thought Major Jones who was present was ashamed of his conduct.  But you need not speak of it.

	You must not pay any attention to the reports & news your friend Moore tells you about election.  I know how to understand these matters & you do not.  They are too idle & foolish to do me harm.  I think the Rail Road will have a good effect on the election in Laurens & perhaps loose me some votes in Anderson.  

	I met Dr. Goodwin last evening in the presence of Reed & Alexander who expressed his great regret at loosing me in the Senate, & joy at my having a wide field to display my usefulness in.

	Yesterday I travelled in company with Col. & Mrs. Coleman & we stopped on the road at dinner together.    Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett did not start so early.  The company was all pretty much behind.  

	Major Jones & Col. Townes fell in company at Newberry & had the pleasure of riding in the stage to Columbia.  Townes told me he saw you riding out & supposed you were all well.

	I am glad to hear that Mr. Bradshaw speaks so highly of Anna.  I think she is remarkably smart & will no doubt learn fast.  Keep her at school.  We have great cause to be thankful for all of our children.  They are all uncommon children�very handsome remarkably smart, very good & well behaved & seem kind & affectionate.  I think you have a great deal to be thankful for in this life & I hope we will both appreciate it & enjoy it�not disturb ourselves by looking on the small dark speeches which may be seen in our�or which we may imagine we see.

	You say I must write about Edward.  He does well, & I hope he will be of service to me and will learn a great deal.

	I have not much to write you this morning.  If anything of consequence should transpire during the day I will write you again tonight.  I write now because it is before breakfast & I am at leisure.

	I have seen very few persons yet.  All the Greenville delegation board at this house except Col. Townes.  He stays at Hunts just opposite & came over last evening to see us.  Major Henry says he caught cold at my house & has not been well since.  He seems inform.  I saw John Cunningham at Newberry.  He says Pamela has had chills & fever since her return from Charleston & is very much reduced in health & spirits again.  She is at Ben Yancey�s.

	Tell the children they must behave themselves & I will bring them a present.  Willie must write me.  Let me know how all the servants are doing.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Willie

	I have just received your pretty letter, & am delighted with it.    Col. Townes could hardly believe it possible that you had written it.  I hope you will write me another one soon.  It will give me great pleasure to hear from you & see your letters and the writing of them will improve you very much.

	I look to you my dear little son to sustain & improve on what little of reputation I may have for talent & usefulness.  Your opportunities will perhaps be better than your Papa�s & therefore you must endeavour to be a smarter & greater man than I am.  I think you have a great deal of talent, & if you will only study & be good you will one day make a great man.  But first of all learn to be a good boy.  Never tell an untruth or do a dishonorable thing�never quarrel or fight�always be kind to your little play fellows�love your little sisters & brothers, be good to the servants & everybody & then everybody will love you.

	The next time I come to Columbia I will bring you with me & perhaps I may carry you to Washington withy me should I be elected to congress.

	Since I commenced writing you this letter I have had to stop & go to the College to attend a meeting of the Board of Trustees.  I have just returned through the rain &�, & it is now near eleven oclock in the night.

	I hope to see you in College in the course of seven or eight years.

	Tell you mother I wish to see you all very much & that I have recd her letter tonight & thank her for it.  

	Tell Anna & Frank they must be good children.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I hope to hear from you tonight but I cannot write you after receiving your letter,

	The Board of Trustees meet this evening at ? past six oclock & I must attend them.  Yesterday I was engaged all day in the Court of Appeals & Errors.  The day before we did little or nothing in the Senate & today not much.

	I have seen Col. Taylor & General Martin.  They enquired kindly after you & said their families were all well.  I told Taylor that I had some packages for his wife, but it has been raining so much that I have not sent them up.  I saw Judge Butler this morning.  He looks very well.

	You may tell your mother I have engaged a chair at $3.50 if I can send it up.  I have bought me a Buena Vista coat, price $9.00, socks made out of�--vest $3.50 & pantaloons $6.50 & boots $9.00.  These are my purchases & nothing else.

	I saw Mr. Symmes just now, who enquires after you & your mother.  He gave me a long talk about Congress.  Says Orr is a particular friend of his & he told him he ought not to have offended me.

	There was some talk of running me for Chancellor until Colonel Memminger took the field.  Hew is a candidate & General Whitner is not.

	Edward does very well & is some help to me.  He seems very much pleased.

	I really begin to wish to see you & the children again, & have been thinking how & what I will do when I go to Washington.

	Nothing new on the Rail Road subject.  What will be the result I know not.

	Kiss the children & take care of them & yourself.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I know you will be glad to receive a letter from me although it may contain nothing of interest.  I can well imagine myself in your situation every mail night, waiting to receive a letter & I know that I should be disappointed in not receiving one.

	I hope to hear from you again tonight & perhaps Willie may be enduced to write me again this week.

	I sent your package to Mrs. Taylor yesterday by Edward.  He saw no one but Colonel Taylor.  I have not seen the Colonel since.  Yesterday I saw Col. Isaac Hayne.  He says they are all well in Charleston & enquired after you & your mother & family.  I do not think he looks altogether as well as he did last winter.

	Gilmore Simms called the other night at my room after I had gone to bed & paid me a long visit.  He was deeply interested in the election of his friend Col. Aldrich, who was a candidate for commissioner in Equity for Barnwell & who was yesterday elected.  Tell Anne that he expressed a deep interest in her health & welfare�said she had made a lasting impression on his mind, & from the way he talked one might suppose his heart too.

	General Martin tried to dissuade me from going to Congress the other day by telling me that I  would be elected President of the Senate whenever [Angus] Patterson retired, & that this was a more honorable position than a seat in Congress.

	I have purchased Kohl�s Russia, Austria, England, Ireland & Scotland in three volumes for six dollars.  You may remember extracts from the work & know how interesting they were.  I have got them to read to you this winter.  I have also purchased ancient & modern sculpture, a very fine & large English work, full of the most beautiful plates for three dollars fifty cents.  This work in England I have no doubt [would] cost ten or fifteen dollars.

	I have just recd a letter from Keith of Pickens giving me good news about the election.  Col. Grisham & Miles Norton are here, & they speak favorably of Pickens.

	The election for Chancellor will take place next week & there are several candidates Memminger, Whitner, Dargan, Haynesworth, DeSaussure, Wardlaw &c.  I suppose Col. Memminger will be elected & I am sorry that Whitner permits himself to be run.  He had better keep back for the law bench.

	We have nothing new on the Rail Road subject�nor have we done anything in the Legislature.  General Thompson is here & expresses a great interest in my election.  He had some sharp sparring with [James Lawrence] Orr at Newberry.  Orr charged Greenville with a want of courtesy in debate.  I replied & he stopped me & said it was no I that he alluded to, but some other member.  Thompson told him to name the member, but he declined doing so.  

	Tell me what present I shall bring you & the children.

	My breakfast is now nearly ready & I must conclude.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  I had received no letter from you the mail before this.  I hope you & Willie have rece[ive]d the letters I wrote you some days since.  Tell Willie he must answer my letter.  Col. Summer enquires after him & I told him Willie said he must send his dog.

	I forgot to mention in my first letter that something passed between Choice & myself about swapping your mother�s carriage for his.  He has a very large one coming on from New York, & intends keeping the present one for himself.  I told him it was not a suitable carriage for a gentleman, & that Mrs. McCall had one that was & did not suit her, that his would suit her & that probably they might make a swap.  He promised me to look at it.  His carriage would suit your mother very well & is remarkably cheap.  It cost only $325.00 harness & all, delivered in Hamburgh.  I think it a very fine carriage for a family & would suit your mother.  When I return I will endeavour to make the exchange if your mother desires it.

	I have been writing letters all day today to my friends in Pickens.  Keith sent me a long list of names to write to.  I think it is the best & easiest mode of electioneering.  

	Last night I went to the Theatre with Major Henry, Col. Ware & Mr. Duncan.  The performance was only tolerable & the theatre is an old & uncomfortable building.  There were not more than one hundred persons in it.  

	Tonight a boy brought me a letter & said that a man below was waiting for an answer.  I broke it open & it commenced �Dear Father.�  I looked at the signature and saw C.C.P.  I then turned to the superscription & saw it as directed to Col. Benjamin Perry.  I felt very sorry at the mistake.  It is very likely some of your letters may be sent to my namesakes room, & he will commence reading about Col. Orr & the rail road & Laurens & Anderson and suppose his wife has gone crazy.

	I have really nothing of interest to write you.  I did not go to church today.  Edward did go twice.  He put on his Sunday coat & looked quite neat.  He does very well but is rather small to be of much service at so crowded a table.  

 	Major Jones came to me the other day to borrow fifty dollars, & said he was out of money.  I told him I had none to lend nor have I�you must not speak of this however [page torn].  

	I am very anxious to see you all.  Fanny cannot be sweater than she was when I saw her last.  How I should like to be with you all this evening.  I told Col. Ware that I thought [if elected] I should stay in Congress about six months�that I could not bear the thought of being from my family.

	Mr. Simpson came here tonight on his way to Washington.  He says Mrs. Simpson will go on in May next.  

	Tell Pamela [Cunningham] if you are writing to her that I shall value very highly her present.  Mr. Calhoun & Burt are expected here tomorrow.  If anything occurs tomorrow I will write you again.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter yesterday & have not heard from you since.  But I am in the humor of writing again, & what is more I have time to write you this evening, & may not have tomorrow.  

	The business of the Senate is growing full of interest.  Yesterday I made my first speech & succeeded in defeating a claim of my friend John Bradly of Sumter for a negro killed whilst working on the road.  I thought the claim unjust.  Therefore went against it although it was the claim of a friend.

	Last night the Board of Trustees met again, & we had quite an interesting meeting & considerable speaking.  I took a part for the first time on the Board.

	Today we had quite an interesting discussion on the Electoral Bill.  The rear of the Senate chamber was filled with Ladies, & in front of me on the other side were several members of Congress on their way to Washington.  Black opened the debate & I followed.  It was not a set speech, but I did very well.  Miss Yates, as she came by me, whispered that she was delighted to have an opportunity of hearing me speak.  I had not spoken to her.

	I drew up a long Report on the Mexican War which I first read in the Committee on Federal Relations and they addressed it in full.  I then read it to the Senate in the presence of Judge Butler & other members of Congress, some from Georgia.  I afterwards went to speak to the Judge. & he asked me for a copy of it.  General Harralson of Georgia & Shannon of the Military Commission in Congress, said he was delighted with my report, that he approved every sentiment & was gratified to find such sentiments to be popular in South Carolina.

	There is a very strong war feeling in the State & in the Legislature especially.  Colonel [Franklin J.] Moses moved to have five hundred extra copies of my speech printed for distribution amongst the people.  Colonel [G.W.] Dargan moved that it be made the order of the day for Friday next.  I drew it up hastily & had no idea that it would produce the sensation it did in the Senate.

	They are going to move against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson in the House with a view of making him resign.  I feel sorry for the poor old man.  It is very likely he will resign this week.  Allen of Barnwell is the member who is going to move on the subject.

	    I find that I commenced my letter on a half sheet of paper & shall have to continue it on another half sheet.  Since writing Col. [Thomas E.] Ware came in & has delayed me.  Our member of Congress Richard F. Simpson is here, & spoke to me today to form a copartnership in law at Anderson C.H. with a Son of Dr. Broyles who has just been admitted to the Bar, & who is a clever & talented young man.  I told him I would do so with great pleasure.    He is a nephew of his wife.  

	I saw Mr. {Joel Roberts] Poinsett today & he will remain here for some time.  Several of the members of the Legislature have made enquiries after you & the children,  They seemed to have been struck with my family & observed that they could but admire us as we were walking about with the children.    Dr. Waldo made this remark this evening.

	I have made arrangements with Dr. [Edward] Sill of the Columbia Telegraph to send off two or three hundred copies of my Report.

	I must now conclude.  I will write you again tomorrow if anything of interest occurs.  Edward is a great help to me.  Tell Wille to write me.  Edwin P. Jones is making application for admission in Equity.  I was put on the committee to examine the students in law but could not serve.  Jones came to me today to write his Petition & give him a certificate of moral character which I did with great pleasure.

	Kiss the children for me & believe me truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I have just been to the Post office & recei[ve]d your letter & also one from your mother.  I was very much pleased to hear from you all & learn that you were all well & doing well.

	It gives me great pleasure to receive a letter from you & you write so well too that it makes me feel proud of you.  I suppose however your mother helps you a little in dictating the letter.  But it is written remarkably well & if you go on improving fast you will soon write a better hand than I do.  I showed your letter to General Thompson & Mr. Duncan but did not let them read it.

	I wish my dear son that you were with me.  In travelling you are great company for me & I like to have you with me in my room & hear you ask questions.  I love you so much & am so proud of you that I should like always to have you with me.

	Colonel Summer enquires about you very often & says he is sorry he has no dog to send you.  The free dog he brought with him from the north he has given to Colonel Leitner of Spartanburgh.

	 I will bring you the presents you desire when I return.  Tell your mother I will bring hers also, & say to her that I was very glad to receive her letter.  I put one in the Post office for her this evening.  You ought to have recd your letter one mail sooner.  I sent Edward with it about daylight to the Post office, but I suppose the mail had been made up.

	Tell your mother that nothing has occur[r]ed today or I would have written to her again.  It is rumored that Judge Richardson is to be impeached.  They have given him till Saturday to resign, & if he does not resign by that time articles of impeachment will be proferred against him.  I am truly sorry for the old man.

	Next Monday is commencement in College when all the boys make speeches before the Legislature, Judges, Trustees, Ladies & people generally.  It would give me great pleasure to have you in College & sit & listen to your speech.  This pleasure I hope one day to enjoy.  You must make haste & prepare yourself & when you are in College you must study hard & take the first honor.  I believe Judge Frosts son takes the first honor this Winter.

	But my dear son the first object of my heart is that you should be a good boy & grow up an honorable and correct man�never do anything wrong or behave badly.  I must now close this letter & send it to the Post office by Edward.  Kiss Anna, Frank & Fanny for me.  Edward says I must tell you all howdy & say he likes Columbia very much.

	Kiss your mother for me & tell her I will write by the next mail if I have time.  I have made arrangements to  send off about 300 copies of my Report on the Mexican War.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I must write you tonight for I am sure I will not have time to do so in the morning or tomorrow evening.

	We have a great deal to do tomorrow.  I shall be engaged in court in the morning attending to a case for Mr. Choice.  The Electoral Bill is discussed in the Senate at one oclock.  The Trustees meet at night & there is an exhibition in the college.

	I went this morning to get my razor mended & found General Martin looking at some beautiful broaches for Ladies, & he proposed that each of us should purchase one & send to our wives.  We did so.  The price is only $1.50 cts & they are really beautiful & a new fashion made out of wire beautifully wrought, large, & intended for common use�but fine enough for any occasion.  

	I have been engaged in court today & heard John Cunningham make a speech.  He speaks well.

	In passing up street I saw one of the finest looking men my eyes ever beheld.  He had a foreign aspect & genius stamped in his face.  I could not keep my eyes off him.  Dr. Gibbes stopped me, & said let me introduce you to Mr. Gliddon of whom you have doubtless heard.  I said to him that I had had the pleasure of reading a most interesting book written by him.  He bowed gracefully & thanked me for the compliment.  He was excessively polite & strikingly handsome, about my age, & height�perhaps not quite so tall.  He is going to lecture on Egypt.

	There was an effort to give Chancellor Harpers heirs [a] years salary today, but it failed by two votes.

	The magnetic telegraph is now in operation between this & Charleston.  	Col. Perry enquired how his sister was & in ten moments the news came back that she was better.  Various messages have been sent to Charleston.  If you wish any word sent to any of your friends I can do so & get an answer for a few cents.  They have messengers at the office to send all over town.

	We have very wet weather & walking is most disagreeable.

	I have made a report on the Mexican War & sent copies of it all over the congressional district.  I made arrangements with Dr. Sill to send them from the Printing office.  

	Tell the children that I was going into Heises today to buy some toys for them & saw some ladies & passed on.  I will get the candy & knife & marbles & doll & rattle &c &c.

	In regard to my books you know that I have a weakness in that way.  But I have derived so much happiness from them that I cant resist the temptation.  My wife, my children & my books are my sole sources of happiness.  With them I can be happy independent of the world & regardless whether elected or beaten for Congress.

	Poor Judge Richardson is to be impeached Saturday.

	Kiss the children for me.  I recd a long letter from Spears on the R Road.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	
I received your letter by Friday�s mail, & hope to get one from you this evening.  You commenced your last letter by saying you had nothing to write & yet I think it was the most interesting one I had recd from you this Session.  You spoke of your children & yourself, your household. Servants, &c.  I am exceedingly anxious to be one of your household again.  Indeed, my dear wife, I do not think I can bear a winter in Washington from you & the children.  I begin to have great misgivings about the course I have pointed out for myself.

	I have made a few purchases for you & the children in  ..ioner with your request & instructions.  For you I have bought the beads, also a strand for Susan.  Tell Willie I have bought him a pretty little knife with two blades.  For Anna I have bought a glass doll, and a sheep with a little girl on it, which is very pretty.  For Frank, a knife with a green handle & also a set of marbles.  I have also bought a large quantity of candy of all kinds & shapes, four pounds.  I will purchase a basket for Anne, if I can find one�if not something else.  I wrote you in my last letter about the broach.  For Fanny I have purchased a rattle, whistle & ivory ring all in one, which may be separated into three pieces.

	Yesterday we had the Electoral Bill under discussion & will conclude the debate on Tuesday.  Col. [Franklin J.] Moses made a very able speech in favor of my Bill.  He, all the week kept postponing his speech & at last I found out the cause.  His wife was expected & came Friday night & was in the Senate chamber yesterday waiting to hear him.  She is a tall fine looking woman & is said to be quite intelligent & accomplished.  You may remember how ugly the Colonel is.  Mr. Carrol & Miss Charlotte Smith were in the Senate chamber yesterday & I spoke to them.

	Last night I went to hear Mr. [George] Gliddon in company with General Thompson & others.  I had the pleasure of falling in company there with Col. Preston & Dr. Henry.  There were a good many persons present at the lecture & some ladies.  I was much pleased with the lecture & would tell you a great deal about it if I had time.  I saw a variety of Egyptian curiosities, four or five thousand years old, a mummys coffin, arm, hand, head, scull &c. &c., clothes, shoes, sandals, writing, �&c. &c. The likeness of Cleopatra & her son Caesoria.  In looking at Cleopatra I was reminded of Anne�s face & skin, expression &c. 

	Yesterday I dined with the Governor.  There was a large party, Poinsett, the Judge, Chancellors, Governor [Edward Bishop] Dudley of North Carolina, Governor [John P.] Richardson, Dr. Mr. Petrus who married Miss Harper.  He is a very large & old man, was a widower, & the cousin of Mrs. Harper, had been a member of Congress, did not offer to be anything very great.  Governor Dudley is very large & rather good looking.  General Thompson & General Whitner & Major Henry were also at the dinner.

	  I have been interrupted two or three times since I commenced writing by persons coming into my room.  Colonel Hodges is here from Greenville & he has been to see me.  General Thompson started for home today, by the way of Edgefield.  Tomorrow is commencement in College.  Someone sent me through the Post office a Ball ticket for Commencement Ball.  The ticket has the name of Lipscombe on it & perhaps he sent it.  I suppose he is a student in college, & perhaps a manager.  We had quite [a] contest in the election of two Trustees of the College on Friday night.  Mr. Poinsett was run but got beat by [Robert Wilson] Gibbes & [Francis Hugh] Wardlaw.

	The name you could not make out was Gilmore Simms, the novelist &c. [pagetorn] had just put him in nomination for Lt. Governor last year.  They became rather intimate.  I write you in such haste that I am not surprised you cannot read my letters.

	The Resolutions against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson were introduced yesterday & will be considered on Tuesday next.  The old Judge seems to have brushed up since his impeachment.  He looks five years younger.

	I will now conclude my letter, & go to the Post office to get one from you.  I have been writing out a speech today on the Electoral Bill.  Tell Willie he must write me again.  Tell Anna I am glad to hear she is reading so well.  Tell Frank I think of him dream of me every night.  I expect Fanny will be so much grown I shall hardly know her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Col. Dargan will beat Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger for Chancellor.  We have had three ballotings & no election but Dargan is 21 votes ahead.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not running.

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College commencement & will write you a second letter for this mail.  I do this because I have a leisure & may not have time to write you by the next mail.  The business of the Session is now pressing on us & Judge Richardsons impeachment comes up tomorrow.  The Senate have agreed to adjourn on Tuesday 14th but I have no idea the House will agree to it, or that we shall adjourn that soon.   

	Col. Dargan has just been elected Chancellor by a large vote over Wardlaw & DeSaussure.  Col. Memminger withdrew.

	My Report on the Mexican War has just passed the Senate with only one dissenting vote.  It has been sent to the House & will come up there tomorrow.

	Governor Richardson came to me today, to talk about the Judge & his impeachment.  He says he will defend himself & then resign.  I am truly sorry for the old man.  The Governor asked me my opinion & I gave it promptly that he ought to resign.

	I recd your letter last evening & thank you for your punctuality & kindness in keeping me advised of the news of your household.  It is indeed a great pleasure to hear from you & the children very much.  When absent I love you all more than I do when at home or rather at home I do not realize or feel the extent of my love.  It remains dormant in some measure & is called forth by absence.  I should indeed like to take a peep into my Home this evening & see you & the children.

	I enquired of Col. Isaac Hayne the other day if he had heard from his wife lately & he said she had not written to him  since he had been here.  He then said by way of excuse for her that she did not expect [him] to stay long when he came.  This reflected on him, if he had not written to her since his arrival in Columbia.

	The college commencement was very fine today.  I never saw such a crowd in the Chapel before.  There was an immense crowd of ladies from all parts of the State.  On Saturday they sent a message by means of the magnetic telegraph to Clarks Hotel from Charleston, that a company had just got in the cars for Columbia which would want sixteen rooms.  When they arrived the chambers were all provided for them.  

	Mr. [Richard] Yeadon paid me a visit last night, & will remain here till next week.  I saw Mr. Barnwell the minister in the Senate chamber on Saturday, & I got him a seat by my side & we had a great deal of talk.  He was very pleasant & facetious whilst the debate was going on as to the Electoral Bill.

	Col. Preston made a very fine speech today in College.  All the students did well.  Tell Willie I one day hope to hear him make a speech in college & take the first honor of his class.  Judge Frosts son took the first honor today.  He does not seem to be very smart & has a little squirt in his eyes.  A young man from Camden whose name was Villepigue made the best speech �on the character of Benedict Arnold.�  Whitemarsh B. Seabrook had a son who took an honor & made a good speech.  The latter sat next to me on the platform as one of the trustees & I enquired of him if the young man was a relation, whilst he was speaking.  He replied that he was his son.  He is good looking & better looking than Archey.

	I must now conclude & go to my dinner.  I am really asked to write you such scrawls as I do.  But it is [the] reason I write you so much & so fast.  

	My love to the children & mother & family.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F.  Perry

	I wrote you two letters by last mail & did not then suppose I should have time to write you so soon again.  I have a few moments leisure before breakfast.  I hope to hear from you tonight but shall not have time to write you afterwards.

	Yesterday the Electoral Bill was discussed in the Senate & we had an immense crowd of ladies & gentlemen to hear the debate.  I never saw the Senate chamber so much crowded before.  The ladies actually took the seats of Senators & looked as self possessed as if they had actually been members of our great body.  I was going to speak & therefore could not give up my seat as I was taking notes to reply to Col. DeTreville.  Some fair damsel came in & took a seat beside me which she continued to occupy until I had finished my speech.  I spoke about three quarters of an hour and I believe acquitted myself very well.  Today the discussion is resumed & I shall speak again at one oclock.

	Monday night I went to Dr. Gibbes to meet Gliddon & others.  We sat around the table & ate fruits, nuts, cake, drank wine, talked & spent the evening very pleasantly.  He is quite an interesting man in conversation, but did not have much to say about Egypt.  I suppose he keeps his information on the subject for his lectures.

	At ten oclock I went to the Ball, having been presented with a ticket.  General Adams & myself made arrangements to go together.  The room was a very large one & quite crowded with young ladies from all parts of the state.  They were very tastefully & finely dressed.  �The Miss Hamptons in rose colors.  I saw Miss Cornelia Crittenden there & spoke to her.  She is assisting in a school here.  Judge Wardlaws daughter was there.  I saw a young lady there, whom I had seen & known very well fifteen or twenty years since.  I told Black that I knew her as Miss Pride and I wished to know what her name was now.  He told me she was still Miss Pride.  Judge Withers told me she had been in Europe & was quite an accomplished woman.  I did not renew my acquaintance.

	After staying an hour or two at the Ball I came off before supper.  I was much amused in looking on at the different faces, & the dancing & waltzing, which is quite affectionate in the position.

	Major [Nathaniel Ridley] Eaves a senator from Chester returned Monday night from Mexico & took his seat yesterday in the Senate.  There was a great to do & he made a speech.  He tells me that Goodlett & Elias Earle are both quite well in the city of Mexico & that he shook hands with them when he started.  

	General [James] Shields & [John A.] Quitman are to be here tonight.

	When I commenced writing I intended discussing about the children & our household, but have not time now.    Dr. Prior has just called with a letter from Mr. Howard on his way to purchase at Greenville.  He seems a fine gentleman.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

	I now have scarcely time to eat my meals as a man should.  Yesterday morning I rose before daylight, shaved by a candle, dressed & commenced writing my reports as Chairman of the Committee on Finance & Banks which I continued till fifteen minutes before nine, when I went to breakfast.  At nine oclock I met the committee on Finance & Banks & sat till ten oclock, when the Senate met.  I sat in the Senate from ten till five oclock, when we went to dinner.  At six oclock I was back in the Senate chamber sitting on committee.  This continued till nine in the night when we adjourned to supper.  I read the newspapers & went to bed.  And I am now writing to you at seven oclock.

	I saw Mr. Elford last night.  He called at my room about ten oclock, handed me a letter from Mr. Choice� & said he had a bag from you to me which he would send me this morning.  Mr. Speers arrived here Wednesday night, & I am always glad to see anyone from Greenville.  But they brought very little news.  I thought that you were out of the way of news, but that if I could see anyone from Greenville they could tell me a great deal.  This was a mistake.

	I am truly glad to hear from your last letter that Hooker is going on with the fence.  Tell him to have it finished before I return.  It would give me great pleasure on my return to see the old fence removed, which has been an eye sore to you so long.

	Tell William I recd his letter & will write him as soon as I can.  You will see a report of my speech on the Electoral Bill in the Daily Telegraph which I still send you zi suppose.

	Chancellor Dunkin gave me $25.00 for Mrs. Doyley again.  You will expend for her the balance I left with you if you have not already spent it for yourself.

	I have recd another letter from Heath giving the most flattering account of my prospects in Pickens.  Everyone who hears Orr speak is astonished that he should have the impudence to oppose me.  I have made some good speeches on the Electoral Bill & have acquired some reputation for speaking.

	There is a Bill reported to elect an additional Judge.  I have opposed it in committee & shall continue to do so in the Senate.

	The trial of Judge Richardson comes on tomorrow.  What will be the result I cannot tell.  The House has agreed to adjourn Friday week 17 inst.  The Senate have not concurred yet.

	The Senate gave Judge Harpers family $2000 yesterday which I voted against.  His family are said to be penyless.

	Write me all about the children.  How I should like to see the dear little creatures.  Fanny, I shall hardly know.  Tell Anna that she must learn fast & be a good girl.  Tell Frank to dream of me & be a good boy.  Tell Willie I am glad he is head.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received & read with great pleasure you letter of Friday last, in which you say you will make me a kind sweet wife.  This you have always done, and I require no change for the better but am content with what I already have.  I believe that it has been our lot to pads through life so far with as little matrimonial differences as ordinarily fall to the lot of those whom God has joined together.  I, at least, think myself greatly blessed in my wife & children.  And it would be hard for me to love either more than I do.  When I am with you all, it seems to me now, that I do not know the extent of the feelings of my heart, & it is only when absent that I am made aware of it.

	But I have been thinking very seriously about the absence which must necessarily occur if I go to Congress, & it has affected my resolution very seriously.  Perhaps I can make some arrangements to carry you all with me.

	Yesterday the trial of Judge Richardson came on.  He appeared at the Bar of the House & made a speech of two hours in length & showed pretty clearly that he had his mental faculties about him.  The House acquitted him by a vote of seventy four to thirty two.  The Greenville members voted for his acquittal.  I had no vote till It should come into the Senate.  But the whole matter is now dismissed.

	Governor Richardson came to me some days since to know my opinion & I spoke very freely, that the old man should resign.  The governor told me that the Judge intended doing so after the trial was over.  But I doubt whether he does.

	The Rail Road Bills have all failed, & the state will not aid in the construction.

	This evening I took a ride on horseback.  My mare is so fat & so much improved that you would hardly know her.  Tell Jim I now see what good keeping & care will do for a horse.  He does not seem to be a good hostler.  

	The purse sent by Elford is a most beautiful one, and I have just written a letter to Pamela thanking her for it.  It is too pretty to use & I am afraid would be very easily injured.  I gave her an account of you & all the children and I told her you wrote me a letter every mail�that Willie was the smartest boy of his age that I had ever seen�that her godson [Frank] was the universal favourite of everyone�That Anna & Fanny were sweet children�that my children were so pretty & smart that I was willing to have twenty &c.

	Major Henry told me that his daughter had fallen in love with you, & that she talked of nothing else for a week after her return home.  

	If I have time I will write Willie a letter tomorrow evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Monday morning�Tell Anna I am delighted to hear she is so industrious & smart as to set the table &c.  I hope she will make a notable wife for some fine young man.

PS�I sent your mothers chair by Col. Hodges wagon.  He will send it down by the first opportunity from his House.  BFP

	There is now so much commotion & such a press of business in the Legislature that I have not time to write you as I would desire.

	We shall adjourn on Friday night & I will leave here Saturday morning, which will enable me to reach home Monday night or Tuesday.  If the roads are bad I shall not be able to drive it in three days, as my horse will have been standing idle so long & become so fat it would hurt her.

	Tell Willie I have not had time to write him as I desired to do.  I am sorry he is not with me.  Mr. Sullivan brought his little boy down with him & sent him back the next day in the carriage.  Mrs. Sullivan has now come down in the carriage with another one of his little ones.  She is staying at this House.

	Tomorrow General Shields is to arrive here & there will be a great show.  I have been appointed one of the committee on the part of the Senate to receive him to the State House where the governor will address him & the multitude be present to receive him.

	If I should have time I will write you or Willie after he reaches this place.  I hope to hear from you twice before I leave Columbia, Wednesday & Friday.

	I have bought a set of chess men, a board for $2.25 which are very neat & pretty.  I have also bought a cup for travelling, which looks as well as silver & is a very pretty pattern for $2.00.

	I must now go down to the Legislature, & will finish my letter tomorrow.

	I have just taken my seat to finish my hasty letter.  The arrival of General Shields has thrown the whole town in an uproar.  As one of the committee I went down to the Rail Road depot to receive him.  The procession was immense.  He is a small but noble looking fellow, with a foreign air & look.  The crowd some five thousand persons called for him in the streets.  He went out & addressed them from the second story of the Hotel & made a thrilling speech.  Just before we were going to sit down to dinner, DeSaussure came to me & said the governors table was too small & that part of us must go & dine with him.  I went & spent a pleasant evening�never saw Mrs. DeSaussure before.  She is fine looking & very masculine.  I saw Mrs. Bull, she has faded very much.  Col. Hunt, Davie, General�, Col. Orr, Boykin, General Wallace all dined with DeSaussuere.

	I have not yet read your letter but will in a few minutes I hope.  It is now 8 oclock & I must hasten back to the Senate.

	Kiss the children for me &   believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The Legislature will adjourn tonight.  I shall start home in the morning�glad enough to get off & be on the road to my wife & children once more.

        I have very little time to write you this morning & will postpone telling you all the news untill I see you.
       
       General Shields has turned all Columbia crazy.  They had a grand illumination, torch light procession &c.  Yesterday the General accompanied by the governor & committee of arrangements, of which I was one, visited the House of Representatives which was crowded as I never saw it before with men & Ladies.  He made a speech sat awhile & then went into the Senate which was a squeeze�jammed full of ladies & strangers.  There he made another speech, shook hands with the ladies &c.  He is a single gentleman & I thought some of the ladies liked him the better for it.  He is about forty, good looking, fine countenance, & noble bearing.  He says he is only thirty-eight.  Yesterday I dined with him at the Governors�a very large party & pleasant. 
       
	I bought a Broach as you directed which was the last�was in the shop.  You can present it to Behethland Butler.  I am at a loss for a present for Anne, I have not room for a basket.  My trunk is full up & over.

	I am truly sorry that I cannot get home as quick as those who go in the stage.  Col. Townes will arrive as soon as you get this letter & Major Jones.

	Tell Willie I shall be happy to see him & am sorry I have not time to write.  Tell Anna that I am delighted to hear of her goodness & industry.  And say to Frank he is a sweet boy & I love him very much.  Fanny I will not trouble you with any compliments to but will tell her myself when we meet.  Col. Northrop says there should always be a baby in the family if the family is able to afford it.  I think with him.  Your husband affectionately &c, B.F., Perry

4 oclock, Friday evening

       I have home to eat dinner & whilst waiting for it will add a few lines to my letter.  We shall not get through before tomorrow morning.  I have received a ticket to a grand Military Ball tonight & shall go round & peep in about ten oclock & see the ladies look at General Shields.  Now is his time to marry somewhere.  He said he wished he was a Carolinian in his speech to the crowd�a voice replied we can make you one.  It is said that is left for some fair lady to do.  
       
	I have just been shopping a little more�a beautiful pair of bracelets like the broach of wire &2.50.  You can give one to someone�or wear both�a beautiful Box in the shape of a large apple with lock & key, very pretty & small $1.00�labels for spirits & wine 1.50.

	Col. Colcock told me this morning he was going to carry Mrs. Colcock to Washington in April to see how they would like & if they do not like he will not be a candidate.  He gave me some�  I will endeavour to be at home Monday night.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Col. Townes, who returns to Greenville in the morning.  I shall probably be at home Thursday evening.

 	In the way of my election I am doing as well as I could almost wish at the home of my opponent.  I am much stronger in Anderson than I had any idea of being.  From all parts of the district I have favourable news which I will tell you when I return.  In Pickens too I have the most flattering accounts.  Indeed I should not be surprised if I beat Orr in Pendleton election district.  Colonels Sloan & Taylor members of the Legislature, living near old Pendleton go for me & the Maxwells & Earles also.

	I took tea last night at Elias Earles, the brother in law of Mrs. Mays & spent a pleasant evening.    Today I made a speech on the Wilmot Proviso which took well & has been much complimented.  

	I have recd of Vandiver eighty five dollars, my fee in Carsons case  I was employed by Cooley in a case yesterday but business is very scarce.

	It is now late in the night & I must go to bed.  Kiss the children for me.

	The Judge is pretty well.  The rail road engineers are here on their way to Greenville.

	Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  I have written & sent to Mr. Wells an obituary notice of Lt. Rodgers as Mrs. Butler requested.

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I rece[iv]ed your letters this morning and was truly glad to learn that you and the children were all well & had safely arrived at the Cunninghams�.  My election is going on as well as I could wish in this district.  At the muster which I attended on Saturday there was very little division.  The same may be said of the whole Ennoree side of the district.  I stopped on Sunday & heard a sermon from Mr. Lewis, eight miles from the village & the most flattering intelligence from the neighborhood.  Dr. Dillard told me to say there was no division in his neighborhood.  Major Cunningham said my prospects had been growing better all winter.  Frederick Nance said he had taken pains to ascertain from persons here today, what my prospects were & that I could not wish them better.  My speech last Court on the Wilmot Proviso & my address this winter have secured my election in this district.

	The Barksdale affair has blown over almost entirely.  I had a long conversation with him this morning & he seemed entirely satisfied.  I saw his brother with whom you staid & thanked him for his kindness.  He said he should have known the children from their resemblance to me & complimented you & them very much.  He is a most worthy & respectable gentleman, & one whom I have always esteemed.

	The evening after you started from home I spent in reading Kendall & found the House lonely in the extreme.  I never could reconcile it to myself to live the life of a widower.  Monday I saw a great many persons at Greenville & recd $60.00 from one of my clients, which came in good time.  Last Friday night I came to Jones & was most kindly recd.  The next day I went to the master & made a speech.  That night I staid at General Wrights & was much pleased with his family.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to see you at Mr. Cunninghams.  My business will not permit me to leave here before Sunday morning.  It would give me great pleasure to see them all but you must make my excuse.  To go there & return here would take two days.  We will meet Sunday night at home.  You had better stop again with Mr. Barksdale.  The other one does not live on the road.

	I need not say how happy I should be to see you & the children & really when I think of being absent from you & them in Washington, I wish your apprehensions realized about Coil. Orr�s beating me.  I have no doubt it would be the greatest kindness he could do me.

	I invited the Col. To take tea with me this evening & we spent a pleasant evening together.  He has just left me.

	I will write you again if I have time.  Do not say or think anything about the Election.  Leave this to me to manage.  Take care of the children & yourself.  Give my love to all the household & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Mr. Elford who leaves in the morning.  I shall probably leave here myself tomorrow evening & go to Pendleton, thence to the Tugaloo side of Pickens.

	I find my prospects here better than I expected.  Some of my friends think that I will beat Col. Orr in the village of Anderson.  Esquire Cox told me that with the business men he knew I would and named the following persons who would vote for me�Benson, Earle, Brown, McCully, Griffin, Reed. Whitner, Dr. Webb &c.  In fact the prominent men throughout the district will mostly support me.  Young told me this evening, that every gentleman in the district of Laurens would vote for me.  That they were not sating much & that Orr�s friends were drinking fellows who made a fuss & deceived him.  

	About old Pendleton I have a good many friends.  Col. Taylor, Maxwell, Seaborn, Burt, Sloan & others.  Burt has taken charge of the Pendleton Messenger.  He wrote me a kind letter inviting me to spend a day with him on my way to Pickens. 

	I have seen Keith & Robbins from Pickens.  The Wolf creek where I was to get no votes, Keith said he was last week in company with twelve persons & nine of them were Perrymen.  He said Col. Hagood told him there was no comparison between me & Orr & that he should vote [for] me although he did not like me.  You know I have had several very important cases against him.

	There is a place in this district called the Dark Corner.  Billy Sherrord is king of that neighborhood & they are all whigs.  He informed me last night that he should vote for me.  Reed told me down on Broadmouth in a company of one hundred there were ninety for me.

	Coil. Orr has reported that he will get two thirds of Laurens district & seems very confident of success.  This is very well to encourage his friends at home.

	I found my copartner here rather desponding.  I was employed in a case of perjury for next court.  There is very little business in court.

	Tell Jim to go on planting the corn as fast as he can.  Let him scatter the manure & plant the ground already laid off.  Let Mary go out & help.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  As I came in this place I overtook Esquire Long from Slab Town in this district.  He told me I would [receive] a very strong note in that neighborhood.  He said he had taken beef to your mother.  [I] enquired how Anne was.  Said McBees wife was the heartiest looking lady he ever saw�that he was one day praising her appearance at your mothers, & Mrs. Perry enquired if she was not just as good looking.  I think the old man has made a mistake & took you for Susan, & that it was Susan who made the enquiry.  I had a great notion to tell the old man of his mistake.  

	Tell Willie to learn fast & be head when I return.  Tell Anna she must also study hard.  Frank must learn his letters at home.  Good night, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I reached here this morning and was much gratified to receive your letter.  I hope Mary may soon be able to relieve you of your charge.

	I will now give a brief�of my journey thus far.  Friday the day I left home, I met Major Wright & his bride & three young ladies from Pendleton going to General Wrights.  We stopped & had some conversation.  At Major Bollings I met Mr. [S.A.] Goodman, the editor of the Laurensville Herald.  I took dinner there, rode with Goodman some distance on the road to Laurens C.H.  Went to Esquire James Cunninghams & staid all night.  Found General Thos Jones there.  Cunningham told the people were disappointed in Col. Orrs appearance, that he would have done better not to have shown himself.

	Saturday morning I went to the muster & found a large crowd.  In the evening the rain commenced falling & we had no speaking.  The people seemed a good deal divided between Orr & myself.  That is his stronghold in Laurens.  In the evening I drove down to Captain Andersons & found him absent.  I then stopped a few minutes in Bowens & went on to Captain Cunninghams.  There I met Mr. Buist & Col. Evans of Spartanburgh.  Miss Pamela was unwell & I did not see her.  Mrs. John Cunningham was there.  They all desired to be remembered to you.  The grounds & gardens look beautiful.  Dr. Hillhouse & his wife had been there the evening before.  Mrs. Cunningham said she was very much pleased with my cousins.

	Sunday morning I went to church with the family.  It was a Presbytery meeting & a large concourse of persons present.  I found a great many friends there.  Col. Orr was at the muster & also at the church.  I went to my friend Nances.  He lives in great style & has a magnificent house.  He is active for me & so are all his neighbors.  His wife is a good looking ladylike woman.

	Monday morning I went down to my client Dr. Teagues & took dinner.  Saw a great many persons & they all seemed for me.  Mrs. Teague is a warm friend & I have seldom seen an old lady of more dignity or finer manners.  I was quite surprised.  We had a good dinner.  Told me I need be under no apprehensions about that neighborhood.  In the evening I went over to Jesse Youngs where Major Coleman & others were dining.  I returned to Col. Williams who is a most influential friend & staid all night.

	Tuesday morning I went to Col. Watts who married General Jones daughter but did not see him.   He is against me & influential.  But his uncle Col. Williams told me he would control him if possible.  About ten oclock I fell on the track of Col. Orr.  He had gone but a short time, whilst I had traveled over fifty miles & seen hundreds of persons.  I can beat him electioneering.

	This evening we were both invited to a Ball given to Major Wright.  I have just returned from it.  I was introduced to a good many ladies & made myself very agreeable to them.

	   In regard to my prospects I have seen everything to flatter me, & yet my friends tell me that the race will be a close one in Laurens.  I think I know better than they do.  They judge from the Saluda side of the district whilst on the other side my support will be almost unanimous.  

	I am greatly indebted to Col. Williams.  He is a man of great influence, princely fortune & high character.  He espouses my course with boldness & zeal.  I do not think I have a warmer friend in the Congressional District.  What makes it more remarkable he was a bitter nullifier & the mortal enemy of Capt. Cunningham.  He is the grandson of Capt. Williams who was killed at Kings Mountain & between whom & the Cunninghams there existed a mortal feud.

	I do not know wqhat course I will take in the morning.  Good night.  God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived in Columbia this evening at four oclock & found your letter.  I called at the Post office as I drove down street & enquired but my letters had been sent to Col. Maybins.  I was very glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home, because many things have occur[r]ed & I have seen several hundred persons.

	The weather is excessively hot & I am almost in a state of �meltiness� as Miss Fanny Kemble says in her book of travels in the U. States.  I shall therefore be very brief in my narrative.

	Thursday night I spent at Mr. Conners & was much pleased with him & his wife.  They are very pleasant & genteel persons indeed.  Conner was hesitating about the election.  Col. Orr had been there the night before.  I have no doubt he is for me & he has great influence.  I stopped at several houses above there & found them all for me.

	Friday morning I went to muster early & called at every house on the road�got on Orr�s track again.  There were not a great many persons at the muster on Friday.  That evening I went to Dr. Hunters.  He was not at home when I arrived.  I found that he is a single man & lives with his mother & sisters.  The place is a beautiful one & displays more taste than any I have seen except Rosemont.  Miss Hunter met me at the door, & I introduced myself to her.  She is a very pleasant, intelligent & handsome young lady.  After conversing a few minutes, she said �you have not been at dinner,� and in opposition to my intreaties observed that she would �go & have dinner prepared.�  The Dr returned & I spent a very pleasant evening.  Invited Miss Hunter to visit Greenville.

	Saturday Col. Orr & myself made speeches & the feeling of the crowd was decidedly for me.  Whilst speaking one fellow stepped out & said to me �we are all going to vote for you here.�  Someone else observed to Col. Williams that �a nigger could tell the difference in our speeches.�  Esquire Brown came to me & said he was going to vote against me but there was too great a difference between us & he should vote for me.  The expression was general that I had gained a victory & that the scale was turning rapidly against Col. Orr.  So Said Col. Mosely, Col. Williams, Major Anderson & so felt everyone.

	Saturday night I was going to Col. Kern�s, but stopped at Pitts & he made me stay with him.    He said �there are twenty votes you will gain by staying with me.�  I replied then put up the horse.  He keeps a store & is a man of great influence & wealth�has a magnificent house, but lives as plain as any one.  He sent off for his taylor,�, blacksmith, carpenter, hirelings & neighbors.  I drew my bottle of old brandy & it was drunk up directly.  I have never seen a kinder man than Pitts & I left him as warm a friend as Col. Williams.  He had been rather opposed to me.

	Sunday morning I went to Col. Kerr�s & saw him.  He feels the responsibility of the change he is about making, & when I spoke of Miss Earle, the tears filled his eyes.  He is a most excellent gentleman.  He said whilst courting he had given me as one of his references.  He has a handsome house & richly furnished.

	I stopped at every house on the road till I got to the Newberry line.  My run will be general & almost unanimous in the lower end of that side of Laurens.  In the upper end of the same Ennoree side, Esquire Griffith told me a relation of his told Col. Orr he would not get ten votes!  Orr replied he liked for persons to speak the truth to him no matter how discouraging it may be.  

	I saw Major Simpson this evening.  He came to meet Mrs. Simpson & two children & carry them to Washington.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here on their return from Charleston.  I was introduced to Mrs. Brown the engineers wife this evening.

	I shall leave here this week & go back to the Battalion muster on Saturday & return again next Sunday in time to attend to my cases in the court of Appeals.  So you see I am disposed to be quite industrious.  I do not know when I shall write you again.

	I drove today forty one miles between 7 oclock & 1 & ? after 3 oclock P.M.  This is�travelling.  In conclusion let me say that my prospects are brightening & I could not have desired greater encouragement than I have recd.

	I have not been out of the Hotel since I came.  Have seen a great many persons however.

	Take care of yourself & the children & servants & household generally.  I am truly yours, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter of last Monday & was glad to hear from you & the children.  Mr. Keith of Pickens & Mr. Henderson of Laurens both went with me to the Post office & enquired for letters but rece[ive]d none.  We seem to be more regular in our correspondence than any other husband & wife from the upper country.

	Today Col. Fair was taken sick & had to get me to argue his cases in the court of Appeals.  In this I had good luck, & gained two out of three�one more to argue.  But I shall return to Laurens tomorrow to attend the Battalion muster & come back on Sunday evening or Monday morning. 

	I have no news to write you.  My cases in the court of appeals will not come up before tomorrow week.  I may not be at home before Sunday week�perhaps not then.

	I have been looking at some beautiful dresses for you & Anna & will purchase some of them.  I saw some of the most magnificent window paintings or curtains & arranged to purchase a couple of them for $10�rods & tassels &c�oil paintings.  I saw some at Cunninghams, though by no means so pretty.

	Mr., Crawford gave me a package this evening to carry [to] Col. Kern, containing a gold watch & many valuable trinkets for the bride.  I think Miss Earle is going to do well, & you may say so, & that the Col. Is an intimate friend of mine.  He is about forty five�good looking�very rich.  It is thought that my friend William Mills is to marry the other Miss Earle.  He is about the same age�rich & clever�good looking.  I think Mrs. Earles daughters have done well.

	My election is very much talked of here.  Everyone is enquiring about it & all wishing me success and saying we now want talent in Congress.  I have no apprehensions about my election.  It was just so when I ran for the Senate.  My friends were alarmed but I was not.  The rumor everywhere was that I would be beaten.  It is always so.  My enemies first speak out & make a noise�my friends say nothing.  But in due time they speak out also.  Everyone says I am gaining rapidly but that is not [page torn] the case as is supposed.  It is only my friends speaking out.  

	I have been writing letters since I have been here & will continue to do so.  I must now conclude for that purpose.  I have carried your shoes to have made up.

	Tell the children I will bring them all a present & they must be good.  I am glad you have heard from Miss Rodgers.  They have sent for a bracelet like hers & I will get it next week on my return to Columbia.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as I promised, though I have nothing of interest to tell you.

	The morning I left home, I got lost, was caught in the hardest rain I ever saw fall, driving over the worst road I ever travelled in a buggy.  I met Mr. Jacobs who told me Col. Orr could not get more than one hundred thirty votes in Greenville.  He said he did [not] know a man who would vote against me.   He laughed at the idea of my loosing three hundred votes in Greenville district.  He is a man of good sense & great candour but does not know as much about the election as I do.

	In Anderson I stopped at old Mr. Douthits a Methodist clergyman.  He seemed glad to see me & said he knew me, my character & politics about as well as I did myself, & he had known me as long as I had known myself.  His son told me I would divide equally the votes in that neighborhood.  But I sha do better than that.  In fact all along the road on Saturday I found very little opposition.  I went to my old client Joseph Rodgers & saw three of his brothers.  They insisted on my staying all night but everything looked uncomfortable & I determined to go to Dr. Andersons.  He is a whig & an old union man, lives in considerable style, has a fine wife, & two very pleasant daughters.  They were all glad to see me, & I spent a very pleasant evening.  The Dr. told me there was no division in his neighborhood, & there is an election ground at his house called �orrsville.�  He said he did not know that I would loose a vote.  He lives within ten miles of Anderson C. House.  I saw a good many voters at his house.  Mrs. Anderson told me Dr. Butler was taken sick at their house & remained there some time when electioneering & that Mrs. Butler came over to see him.  She said Mrs. Butler was a remarkable woman.  She told me a great deal about Col. Bee�s visit at the same time.

	 Sunday morning I came to Irbys.  He told me I was gaining.  I stopped for dinner at Frank Hammonds & fared sumptuously though I believe he is an Orr man. He is the stepson of my friend Jenkins Hammond.

	I met here Sunday evening Miles Norton & Elliott Keith and as usual Norton was crooking & Keith looking only at the bright side of the picture.  Keith told me that the Burnl[e]y appropriation was doing me a great deal of service.

	I saw today Mattison from Craytonville.  He says I will get thirty votes there out of eighty, the box at which Orr was born.  Sherrod told me that the Rev. Mr. Chalmers a seceder had come out for me.  In fact the news everythere seems to be that I am gaining ground.  Col. Orr has come out for Taylor under the hope of carrying the Whigs.  But he will not succeed & find all of the Democrats are opposed to [page torn] some of them go for [Lewis] Cass.  My position is one of neutrality, or opposition to both & with mew are most of the Democrats, Burt, Maxwell, Benson &c.

	I shall go up tomorrow to Pendleton & thence to Pickens.  You must write me by Coil. Townes & send my papers & letters. Tell Jim to hurry with the plowing.  I hope you & [the] children & household are getting on well.  I am in fine spirits about the election & have heard from Laurens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I intended writing�last night but was engaged in Sullivans office examining witnesses in Dr. Andersons case till near eleven oclock.  I have time this morning only to write you a few lines before the mail closes.

	My prospects are growing better every day is the information of my friends.  Major Anderson & Col. Williams tell me that I will only loose ten votes in the village of Laurens.  Captain Cunningham says there are only two persons against me at Waterloo.  Mr. Mills informs me that there is scarcely any division on the Ennoree side of the district from Scuffletown up to the Greenville line.  The information is decidedly more favorable from the Sullivan�

	The communication on the Burnl[e]y appropriation has excited Sullivans opposition for me a good deal.  But he was doing all he could before secretly & now he is more open in his opposition.  And in that respect it will be better for me.  He has written a reply to the Herald which you will see.  In fairness he should have published my letter but it contained expressions which did not suit him, so he gave a garbled statement of its contents.

	I shall be here till Sunday.  The Teague case has been postponed but Dr. Andersons case will occupy three days in trying it.

	Mr. Cunningham says that Mrs. C & Pamela are going to Charleston as soon as he returns home.  Mrs. John C. is to return & take charge his household.

	Mr. Mills is about commencing a fine large house in the village of Laurens.  This looks as if he has been successful in his excursions to Greenville.  He is a strong friend of mine & I should be glad to aid him in his election in Greenville if there is any difficulty about it.

	All the democrats in Laurens  [Zachary] Taylor & the Whigs are not� for him.  Col. Orr will find himself mistaken�.  The Col. Is not here.  Why I know not.

	In great haste.  Yours truly & sincerely, I hope you had a pleasant time with your kindred & that everything went on as well with your household.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I shall have to remain here till Tuesday.  We commenced the case of Anderson & Neely yesterday morning & did not get half through.  It will be a very long case & I may not reach home before Wednesday.

	I am however killing two birds with one stone.  Tomorrow is sale day & there will be a great crowd here.  I shall of course charge a fee proposition to the time occupied in the case.

	General Thompson told me yesterday that he never thought before I would be elected�that he believed now that I would beat Col. Orr five hundred votes in Laurens district.  I replied that had been my calculation all the time.  He made great efforts to get me to hoist the Taylor flag�sent Mr. Garlington & Capt. Cunningham to me very much alarmed but I soon satisfied them to the propriety of my concerns & they admitted that their alarms were entirely groundless.

	There is a large Presbyterian meeting here today.  Mr. Buist is down here.  I was invited to tea at Wrights yesterday morning but could not go and to Mr. Garlingtons the evening before but declined.  I was also invited to a ball the evening I arrived here, but I was so much fatigued I could not muster enough of courage to shave & put on a clean shirt.

	I am very sorry I cannot go home today.  Sullivan and myself are both engaged on the same side of Andersons case & quite friendly.  

	I write you in great haste & merely to account for not returning this evening.  Governor Johnson had 22 little negroes burnt to death in one house the other night.  Be careful of fire.  God bless you.  Kiss the children for me.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening instead of exposing myself to the night air instead of going to a temperance lecture where everybody else has gone.

	I have just had a long talk with my friend Billy Mills & he is really a warm friend.  He assures me that my prospects are growing better daily.  The same assurance has been given me today by Mr. Garlington, Col. Williams, Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Simmons, Col. Irby &c.

	Col. Orr�s communication will operate against him as I am informed by almost everyone & amongst them Dr. Simpson & Deaton & Godman.  They were all pleased to hear that I intended replying to him mildly.

	I have been in the Court House pretty much all day & Col. Orr has not shown himself in the Court House at all.  He is here however & his face looks as red as a bottle of rum.

	I saw Col. Kern today & he reports favorably for me in consequence his going for Taylor.  Not one friend has left me in consequence of my opposition to Taylor.

	Col. Kern looks well & seems very happy.  Mills admitted to me that he was to be married�said he would be at Greenville again before the grand occasion.

	I finished my article in reply to Orr last night, & handed it to the Editor this morning.

	I hope to hear from you in the morning.  I will write you again before the mail leaves.  It has just occurred to me that the mail comes down instead of going up in the morning.

	The court will probably last all the week.  One of my cases has been continued.  General Thompson is here.   I met William Butler returning from Charleston Tuesday night.  I recd your letter & the one from Folger�heard nothing of the old letter.  I was glad to hear from home & that Fanny was better.  Folger is at enmity with the Hol� & wishes to prejudice me.  

	I have just got through with my speech in the case of Maddox & Williamson�Young & Sullivan speech tomorrow.

	My friend Norece told me this morning that General Griffin & Major Calhoun had better quit Orr on account of his communication.

	I met Orr this morning & we shook hands & passed the ordinary civilities.

	I have not been well since I have been here�took pills last night, & they have made me feel a little unpleasant.

	General Thompson has gone on to Washington City.

	Orr�s Taylorism is losing him votes very rapidly in Laurens.

  	I do not know when I shall be at home.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

I saw Major Reed & he says he will be in Greenville in August.  BFP

My dear Sir

	I thank you for your letter received last night & in reply to it can only say that you have very happily expressed my position in regard to the Presidency.

	Neither of the candidates is acceptable to me, but if forced to choose between them I could not hesitate to take the nominee of my own party with his endorsement of the Democratic creed. In preference to the nominee of my political opponent, who has not expressed himself in favour of one solitary principle beneficial to the South.

	I was anxious that the State should not take sides at present in the canvass.  Her neutrality will give her influence & position in the settlement of this territorial question.  Moreover both candidates being objectionable is a strong reason why we should not be in haste to enlist under the banner of either.

	But the American people are impatient, & must take sides in all elections.  The people of South Carolina are so in the present contest.  Neutrality will not be endured much longer.  In regard to the Congressional Election it has nothing to do with the election of President.  And I do not see why it should be made a test question between Col. Orr & myself.

	I am disposed to maintain my neutrality as long as possible.  But when forced to give it up I shall not go into the ranks of a Southern man who is afraid to avow himself in favour of Southern rights & the equality of the States, who has expressed himself in his �signal letter� in favour of the Wilmot Proviso by opposing the ordinance of 1787 & declaring against the extension of Slavery.  General Taylor has also abandoned the veto power which is the great protection of the South, in the administration of the government by a Southern man.  

	The party supporting General Taylor are our hereditary enemies on the Tariff, Bank, Internal Improvement & latitudinarian continuation of the Constitution.  It is impossible for South Carolina to Take position in their ranks & fight against her old principles.

	I am glad to hear that my reply to Col. Orr has met the approbation of my friends.  I hear this is the case from all quarters.

	You will please give my respects to Mr. Maxwell and I hope on your return home you will call & see me in Greenville.  Truly yours, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the muster & am very much fatigued but will write you a few lines for the mail in the morning.

	Saturday night I staid with my friend Joseph Rogers fourteen miles from Anderson C.H.  He informed me I would scarcely lose a vote in that neighborhood.  Sunday I went to the camp meeting, took dinner with Dr. Anderson.  He is still my friend & says his neighbors all go for me although they are [Zachary] Taylor men.  I saw my friend Dr. Reese & he says I will best at his Box below old Pendleton.  I heard from other places & all favorable.

	Sunday night I staid at Bensons.  He is for me warmly.  Vandiver thought my address had injured me with the Whigs.  Reed thought the same.  But I know it has gained ten for me lost.  I went to the drill muster on Monday.  Heard favorable news from the Saluda side of the District.
 
	Monday night I was at John C.  Norriss�& perhaps made him my friend.  Spent the evening pleasantly.

	Tuesday Col. Orr was not able to attend the Review.  No speeches were made.  It was a Whig country & perhaps better.    Col. McFall is still my strong friend.  Says I will divide at Majors, Store�, & Caspers boxes before Anderson.

	Tuesday night I spent at Dr. Brown�s who married a Broyles.  He said he wanted to vote for both Orr & myself.  The people [are] very equally divided in that neighborhood.

	Wednesday I came here through Orrs stronghold, the Tumbling Shoals where they are more equally divided, but all will go over when they ascertain that Orr stands for Taylor.  I stopped at one house where the man was for Orr & the woman for me.  She told me that she had said to her husband, if he did not vote me, she would make him drunk on the day of the election & prevent his going out.  I took dinner with them & the husband promised to vote for me.  His name was James.

	I paid my printers bill at Anderson & had 37 ? cents left for crossing the Bridge over into Laurens.  I paid 25 cts & had 12 ? left.  I had sad feelings.  Here I was in a strange place, a candidate for Congress & no money.  Whilst brooding over my necessities who should I meet in the public Road but my old client Maddox.  He pulled out his pocketbook & paid me a fee of Fifty dollars in cash.  Hurrah for good luck �thinks I to myself.�

	The news from every portion of this District is one entire change to my side.  In some neighborhoods where the vote did stand 35 to 42, it is now 6 for Orr & 70 for me.  This is pretty much the case throughout the Ennoree Regiment.  I never met so many friends before at a muster, not even in Greenville.  They all come up to speak to me & shake hands & were really glad to see me.  They were all intelligent men & gentlemen.

	The people enquired if Col. Orr was still a Taylor man.  He had not then erred & I thought was sick at home.  The news had reached them that he was for [Lewis] Cass or neutral.  I told them I understood him differently.  In the course of the day he came & even made several speeches.  He made a strong Taylor speech which�his fall in the Ennoree regiment.  If he will only make the same speech next Saturday my majority in Laurens will be seven or eight hundred.  He spoke well too, better than I ever heard him before.

	I will be at home Sunday evening.  Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter by General Thompson, & it contains better news than he brings.

	In this district the votes are not counted.  I have beaten Col. Orr about two hundred votes in this district.  

	There never was greater effort made by a man & his friends than Col. Orr & his have made at this Box.  He opened the grocery & had the Liquor free.

	My estimated majority is two hundred but this is uncertain.  It may be more or less.  The Whigs have all turned against me except a few gentlemen.  This reduced my votes from a majority of 500 to 200.

	I regard the Election as very uncertain.  From old Pendleton I heard Monday at 12 oclock we were even.  At Dr. Andersons he beat me {by] a few votes.  At the Trapp Thompson says I only beat [by] 10 votes.  Several other Boxes he mentions unfavorably in Anderson.  But this is all uncertain.  You perhaps know by this time.

	I did not receive your statement.

	I write you in great haste.  I do not expect to be at home till Saturday or Sunday.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have written Col. Townes by this mail.

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines to inform you that I shall be detained here all the week.  I have been employed in several very important cases, both in law & equity, since I came here and in them will receive handsome fees.

	I was employed on Monday in a very exciting case by Mr. Richardson of Sumter, whose boy drove the carriage against Mr. Barksdale.  Barksdale immediately commenced an assault on the negro boy and Richardson�a dish on Barksdale.  They both indicted each other & the boy was indicted.  Richardson is a gentleman of large fortune & was returning home with his mother in law Mrs. Spann the sister of Mrs. Colonel Calhoun & their families.    They were detained here two days.  Many of my friends came to me & told me not to defend Richardson & his servant that it would injure my election.  I replied that I should think meanly of myself if I shrunk from Professional duty on that account, that I was always disposed to do my duty, be the consequences what they may.

	I did not know Richardson, but he had seen me in Columbia & knew me, asked my professional assistance as a stranger &c.  I became acquainted with his wife, who is a very handsome & pleasant lady, & in her manners very much like her cousin Miss Calhoun.  Mrs. Spann reminded me a good deal of her brother Warren Davis.

	We had a large public meeting here yesterday at which I made a good speech.  Col. Orr also spoke & General Whitner, Sullivan, Young, Irby & Summer.

	My election is going on well as I could expect, though I have been too busy to electioneer any.

	I was at the Episcopal Fair last night & bought some little things�a needle case for you & a pair of mit[t]s for Anna & some candy for Frank & Will & an emery for you.  I saw Mr. Arthur.  The church is a very pretty one.  

	I recd your letter by Elford.  Mrs. Rowland must make Hodges pay the note.

	I have not seen or heard from Captain Cunningham and send no money except $30 paid me by Richardson for defending his servant.  His own trial put off till next Fall.

	The great equity case I mentioned to you & have been employed in�also in one other case involving eight negroes to assist Col. Irby.

	In great haste�kiss for me the children & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry

Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this morning and thank you for your kindness and affection.  I was glad to hear you say as I was starting that you were as happy as you are well.  I am sure I can say so with truth and propriety.

	As I came here on Sunday Mr. Satterfield told me you had done one good thing�refusing to purchase Allen Merrits chickens and he told me a long story which Merrit told him.  I have a suit now in Anderson court against Merritt.  Indeed I had a great deal of weight to carry in the election�all against whom I had cases voted against me.  All the drinking whiskey men opposed me.  The Taylor men were united against me.  The old ignorant nullifyers remembered their ancient hatred of me and last, though not least I was a gentleman.

	Reed told me today that Col. Orr said his election had cost eight hundred dollars.  On the day of election the spirits used would amount to $250.00 cts!

	Burt says he was instrumental in depoting me by inviting me over to Pendleton.  If I had staid at home & not made any speeches I would have been elected.  Col. McFall told me I beat myself, by espousing  the cause of General Cass.  He is a Whig & a Taylor man & a strong friend of mine.  Major Gilmore told me great changes had taken place at the Rock Mills just before the election.    He was still for me.  He said captain Garrison remarked any man who voted for Col. Orr admitted I was the best qualified.  He said Cass would be elected and I ought to be his secretary of War & would fill the office with great ability.  

	On the road I met several persons who said I must �try it again.�  Really in walking about the court yard today, I was surprised to find so many friends.  It seemed to me, that one half of the persons (intelligent men of character) were for me.  How different my vote in Anderson is from Orr�s in Greenville.  Everyone of my votes in his district is a man of character & intelligence.  Almost everyone of his voters in my district is either worthless, no character, or mean men.

	I have heard Jones is a great deal better & therefore I shall return to Greenville.  �perhaps Wednesday evening.  We have very little business in court.  I had two cases & was employed to assist Mr. Harrison in another today.

	You said nothing about Willie & the other children.  I hope they are all doing well.    As I came on here whilst stopped to eat dinner Powell rode by, & I invited him to dine with me, which he did.  He praised Anne very much.  Saw [her] at the examination.  He says his son is to be married in December to Miss Mullins daughter of Captain Mullins of Charleston & very rich�that he is a very promising fellow &c.

	I have now told you all the news.  Mrs. Dubac, no doubt, had a great�to you.

	I am with great affection, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recei[ve]d your letter & weas truly glad to hear from you & the children & learn that you were all well�Fanny poor little thing is better.  I hope to see her walking to meet me on my return.

	In regard to Reuben I do not know what to say.  James Harrison is altogether mistaken in his report of our conversation.  I said we could not trade�that I could not give more than $500.  This was all that passed.  I made an offer at all.  It would not be convenient for me to pay the money at present.  But James Harrison said that would make no difference.  He may be mistaken in this as he was in our conversation.  But if they will take my note bearing interest, payable within twelve months, I will purchase Reuben if you desire me to do so.  I leave you to make the trade with Mrs. Harrison.  She can make a Bill of Sale & warrant the soundness & I can give my note on my return home.  It may be that I will pay the money in a short time.  The trade of course cannot be completed until my return.

	I have been going on bravely with my cases in the Law court & have nearly got through.  When my Equity cases will be taken up is doubtful.  I have unquestionably got a new trial in Col. Dunkins case & also in a case of Monsels in Pickens.  I am preparing myself in Dr. Andersons case.

	In regard to elections I have done a little for Col. Hayne.  I believe all the Greenville delegation will vote for him.  I told Col. Ware if he did not you would never vote for him again.  He is for him.  General Martin invited me to dine with him tomorrow & I am to do so.  I introduced Col. Hayne to Major Smith & Col. Williams & told them he was your cousin & a candidate for attorney general.  

	I have not yet been to the State House�all my time in court.  And I have really nothing to write you about.  I must go in a few minutes to the College to meet the Board of trustee.  I have not yet had time to look at carriages or anything else.

	I have bought Mrs. Ellets Book & it contains one of my articles & makes honorable mention of me.  I see my article [on] Dicey Langston has been published in the New York papers & in the Palmetto Banner.

	I do not wish the other hogs killed until my return home.  They are young hogs & do not fatten well.  I wish Jim & Charles to keep clearing up the pieces of ground pointed out to them & splitting rails.  The garden is to be spaded�leaves�& thrown in the stable lot &c.

	I must now conclude by saying to you if you desire Reuben make the purchase.  I do not know when I will be at home.  Perhaps I may return in the stage or I may write to you to send down the carriage.  

	Tell the children to be good & learn fast�no danger of hurting themselves by studying.  I shall bring them something.  In haste, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter which is the longest I have ever had the pleasure of receiving from you.  You have indeed scolded me good [several lines interlined, illegible]

	I am sorry to see you manifest so much want of decision in the purchase of Reuben.  There is a great deal of uneasiness avoided in this life by doing a thing at once & having done with it.  Never brood over it & think it may not turn out well.  There is to me a pleasure in casting off my mind what is over & cannot be remedied.

	I have no doubt Reuben has his faults & may be in some respects worse than Jim & in others better.  As to getting a servant who will do as he ought to, I never calculate on it.  I am not faultless myself & shall not worry myself in trying to do it.  I am not faultless myself, & I cannot expect to find more perfection in a poor, ignorant, degraded cast of creatures..

	Today I have been very busy in electing a President & preparing the papers.  Yesterday I was all day in the Court of Appeals hearing opinions.  The day before I was all day in the College.  Last evening Major Henry & myself went to see his daughter at Mr. Hooks school.  Mrs. H� made a great many enquiries about you & the children & Dr. Crittendens family.  She really seemed glad to see me. 

	Monday night after writing you a letter I went with General Adams, Col. Dawkins & Mr. Middleton to the Ball, having been invited as trustees.  There was as usual a large number of ladies & gentlemen.  They waltzed & danced.  We took champagne and looked on for an hour, & then went to Col. Alstons room where we sat till one oclock eating & talking &c.  I saw Miss McDuffie at the Ball & Col. Taylors daughters, Miss Brooks &c.  I enquired of Col. Taylor who that was with a rose in her head & he replied, �she is my daughter� & �it will give me great pleasure to introduce you to her.�  I laughed at the mistake & apologized.  

	When I shall get through with the court is very uncertain.  Today the students were examined.  My name was on the committee, but I could not serve.  Tomorrow the Court of Errors will sit.  The case of Dr. Anderson is not yet tried.  I have to send a letter from him.  The printing of the Brief cost $32.00.

	I voted for Thompson Earle to carry the votes to Washington but Black was elected & has gone.

	General Thompson is still here.  Col. Townes is quite well.  � Earle is not sick, but drooping.  Col. Elias Earle told me today he was a candidate for Comptroller General,  He is an abominable fool.  Mr. Speers & Major Jones are here yet & will return tomorrow. 

        I have made no purchases since I wrote you except a pair of small candlesticks $3.00.  The forks are as good as silver & no one can tell the difference.  They will last a great while.  The German silver is too common & too well known to be genteel.  The silver spoons were needed, so were the knives & forks.  I may look for a dinner set, but will purchase nothing unless very cheap.
       
       Col. Dawkins told me that Union district felt almost as much interest in my election as in General Wallaces�.  Mr. Church, a representative from that district told me he said that he would much�I should be elected than to be elected himself.
       
	Tell Willie I have looked at a glass slate for him & I have seen a great many pretty things for Anna & Frank.

	How happy I should be now to peep in & see you & the children.  I do not think I will ever offer again for Congress.  It is all right.  I will not try & make something to educate the children with.

	I have now written you a long letter in return for yours & am sorry I cannot pay you with a kiss.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	 
	We are still in the midst of Dr. Andersons case.  I concluded my argument today.  General Thompson�Young followed.  Sullivan finishes [to]morrow.  This will end my business [h]ere, & I shall certainly be at home [F]riday night.  How happy too I [s]hall be to meet once more you {&] the children.  And how glad I am to be able to leave before the Legislature adjourns.  

	The election for Governor takes place tomorrow & Col. [John L.] Manning will no doubt be elected.  Col. Irby is�with him for Lieutenant Governor.  I have understood today that a great many of the members of the Legislature will vote for me for President of the Bank in opposition to Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore.  The election will not come on for a two or three days.  The Bank question is now being discussed in both houses.  Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger made a very able speech against the Bank.  Major Henry replied to him, but it was a feeble effort.

	I read your short letter on Sunday evening, but did not see Mr. Smith.  I hope to hear from you again before I leave.  I looked for carbon sales, but can find none of the paper size.  I will look again tomorrow.  Not yet in the book store the In regard to subscribing [to] the Ladies Book &c., there is no ag� here for the work.  When I re[turn] home I will write on for�.

	I have added fo�more beautiful toys for my collection.  They are quite a pretty collection, &�amuse you & the children Ver[y] much.

	I went to church on Sund[ay]  to the Episcopal & heard Mr. Shand.  [Shand] is a poor preacher.  The church [is] a beautiful one.

	In regard to my cases in Court, I thought I had written you the result.  I have succeeded in Col. Duncan�s�case, also in the case of Walker & Bradford & in the case of Moon in part.  In Pickens I think I have gained the case of M�vs. State & have lost the case of Gordon & Gordon.  In Laurens I have gained the case of Maddon; lost that of Mr. Filson, also Hunter & Garrett.  Dr. Anderson not yet decided.

	The weather is as warm as Summer.  I have bought no books.  In great haste my dear wife, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

Friday night, 1848, [ca. November, December]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Post Office with your letter & thank you for the punctuality in writing.  I assure you it gives me great pleasure to hear from my little family and I begin to count the days when I may return to them.

	I might go up in the morning with perfect propriety.  But I am sure if I did, Dr. Anderson would never forgive me.  His case came up today & I spoke three hours & did not quite finish my argument.      General Thompson & Mr. Young follow me & Sullivan concludes on my side.  I might now leave my authorities with him & go home, having done for Dr. Anderson all I can.  But he would not think so & the people would say I had not done my duty.  The court will not sit again till Monday.  They will be all day delivering opinions.    Consequently I will not get off before next Thursday morning.  Perhaps, however, better luck may befall me & I may start Tuesday morning.

	Col. Townes & Col. Ware went with me to the Post office & I believe both recd letters from home.    Choice & Walker came down this evening.  I have seen the latter but not the former.  They are on their way to Charleston.

	You say Susan is going to housekeeping & I must make a substantial present.  I do not feel any such obligation.  Her husband is or will be worth five times as much as yours.  His children will be rich when ours are poor.  I have already given several handsome presents to Susan, a diamond ring, gold pencil case, gold thimble &c. &c. and have never received the first memento from her.  Her conduct too towards me lately has been foolish & vindictive for my bold & generous & kind efforts to keep her from taking a step disgraceful to a wife.  My feelings towards Susan are not kind & I do not know that they will ever be again.  

	I have made my dear Liz for you several purchases & for which you will no doubt scold me again.  But wait till you see the presents.  A handsome �flowing blue� set in china for dinner & tea, late & fashionable pattern just imported.  I went up to look at the Box after being packed, & to my astonishment saw a big hogshead, which it took to contain them as large as three or four flour barrels.  They cost $32.00.  I also bought the most magnificent set of waiters you ever saw for $2.00.  They are beautiful pictures, landscapes, birds, flowers &c.  Two beautiful spittoons & a butter box of beautiful ware, to keep butter in.

	When you have got through with the scold for the�purchase & begin to breathe freely again I must tell you of another purchase.  The most beautiful, ornamental & useful collection of toys &c. for you & the children amounting to $12.00.  Three knives, one of them a curiosity for its tinny size, inkstand ivory, letter press, glass ship, goose &c., a waxen cupid in a glass case semetrically made, Christmas cards &c., ivory match box, parlor ball, silk real, 2 medallions, pearl waxen, 4 cakes of wax, 4 exquisite needle cases. toy carriage, �mory chair with a glass in the back, 3 pictures framed, one looking glass &c. &c.  What say you to all this.  I am afraid you will think I am crazy, & the next news you hear of me will be that I am in the Lunatic asylum.  But I like to grattify the children & hear their wonder on my return home.  I am sure too you will be pleased at my curiosity shop.  Moreover the Legislature have passed a resolution to pay me about thirty dollars for voting General [Lewis] Cass.  I must get a big fee from Dr. Anderson, Col. Dunham, Eaton &c. 

	Yesterday there was a great todo, in the Legislature, in receiving a visit from Mr. Calhoun.  I did not get to speak to him & did not care to.  My feelings are soured towards him.  The other morning he met Col. Orr & introduced him to Mr. Campbell.  Campbell�enquired who Orr was.  When I told him he said I was joking & seemed I had�at his vulgar blackguard looks.  He had evidently been in a debacle the night before & that he will go the same way that Sims has is evident.  

	It is a mistake to suppose that General Thompson has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.  I had a very long talk with him the other night.  I must now conclude my dear wife & write a few lines to Willie.  Isaac Hayne returned from Charleston yesterday all Well.  Mr. Martin has something to send up by me.  Col. [Adley Hogan] Gladden is elected Bursar.  Col. [John L.] Manning will probably be elected Governor.  Col. [Francis W.] Pickens is here but stands no chance.  Miss Martha Calhoun came down in the last stage & was turned over between Newberry & Columbia in the night, but not hurt.  I saw Edward Earle this morning looking unusually smart & genteel.  I told him of the arrival & he seemed not to have heard of it, but it was all pretense.  Tom Pickens came down with her & told me of the accident.  

       General Tompson seemed pleased that you thought Mrs. Tom Jones pretty.  I am glad you have displayed so much freedom in your arrangement with Mrs. Harrison.  When we meet we shall have a great deal to talk over & arrange & I wish it was Sunday night, but here I shall have to stay.  Dear little Fanny how I should like to see her smacking her lips with a bone in her hand.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

 My dear Liz

	I have just returned from a large dinner party at Dr. [Robert Wilson] Gibbes & have time only to write you a few lines.

	I begin to wish to see you & the children very much & I have frequently thought whilst here that it was well enough I was not elected to congress.  I am sure I should be homesick before the Session closed.

	Your letter was recd Sunday evening.  Col. Ware, Ed Earle & myself walked to the Post office.  I pulled off the motto & gave it to Ware.  You feel quite too much interest in my public preferment.  I am pleased at your high estimate of my character & usefulness.  But they are overrated  

	Col. Hayne is elected Attorney General.  Col. Bonham Solicitor in place of Col. Edwards.  Col. Dawkins came very near being beaten by a lawyer not known out of his District.  I�about the grade of Jefferson Choice.  Dr. Griffin beat Col. Gladden for Treasurer very badly.  Thos P. Butler is elected Commissioner for Greenville.  It is thought Col. Manning will be elected Governor.

	Today I attended the College commencement.  The speech of Col. Preston was a noble one.  A young man by the name of [William] Faber, a nephew of the Rhetts, made one of the best speeches I ever heard from a graduate.  He is an extraordinary fellow.  Wm Elliott says the Barnwell blood has shown itself in him.  General Thompson gave him an invitation to come & live with him & read law with him & myself.

	Nothing further done in the Court of Appeals.  Nor do I know when I shall be able to get off.  Tomorrow the Judges deliver opinions.  Next day we vote for President.  It is probable I may get off Saturday morning in the Stage.

	I have priced the Buggies & they are as dear as they are in Greenville.    I have seen no carriage to fancy.  The carriages now are all coloured, not black.

	I sat beside Chancellor Dunkin at dinner today & had some very interesting conversation.  He said my address was of great service to his son�s election in Charleston. Col. Alston spoke in high terms of it.  Chancellor Dunkin did not believe it possible that Mr. Calhoun voted for Orr.  

	Tell Willie I must write him by the next mail.  I hope you will be pleased with Reuben if you have bought him.  In great haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

P.S. [Richard T.] Brumby has been elected Professor of Chemistry.  Tell Willie I want him to study hard & prepare himself for college.  It would give me great pleasure to see him make a speech & take the first honor.

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to say to you that I have been very busy defending Keith�s election today before the board of managers & have been successful.  I was employed as a lawyer & will charge a good fee.  It is said I have gained many votes by my defence.  It has united all of Keiths friends on me.  Many of [Frederick Newton] Garvins also go for me.  

	I start in the morning to Cheohee with Col. Norton who is to�me the rounds.  I go on horseback & will not reach Pendleton before Sunday or Monday evening.  I have to make a speech here on next Monday, which is sale day & I shall spend the time in the District.  You can go to Pendleton & remain there till I go there or you can go on home.  I will perhaps get there Saturday evening, but if so I shall come up to Pickens on Monday.  

	I hear favorable accounts from old Pendleton.  Col. Orr has the fever at Caesars head & has sent to Greenville for a doctor.  So you may know he is not doing mischief.

	There was a great crowd there today & a favorable account from all quarters.  

	Kiss the children for me.  I hope you may spend your time pleasantly, Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening, as I understand Mr. Elford will return in the morning.  And I shall pursue the same course you did in your first letter to me rece[iv]ed this evening, that is give you a journal of my activities & doings since writing you last week.

	I came to Pendleton Wednesday evening & stopped with Hubbard.  Several gentlemen called to see me, & amongst others William Hayne, who invited me to Mr. Sharpes.  Sharpe was not at home.  I went round the next morning & saw Francis & the children.  The two first or eldest are fine looking children.  The third is not so good looking.

	William Hayne called to consult me as a lawyer in regard to his situation.  I was two hours in conversation with him.  My impression is he is going to marry Miss Sharpe.  I judge so from his conversation & from what I heard.

	Francis sent your mother some beautiful presents & some for Susan & Anne & perhaps you.  They are in my trunk & I have not examined them particularly.

	Mrs. Hubbard & daughter enquired a great deal about you.  In the morning I went to Burts & saw Mrs. Burt�spent an hour very pleasantly with him, & he rode back to the village with me.  I crossed the river at John Maxwells & stopped a few minutes.  He was there all alone with his overseer.  He drank some of my brandy & invited me to eat �the meanest sort of a dinner� or wait till he could have a better cooked.  I declined both.

	Thence I went to Browns store & there heard the most flattering news about my prospects.  Thence to Fair Play.  Reeder told me I would not loose more than fifteen votes at that Box.  Thence to Josiah�s where I spent a sad time.  He is a mere skeleton & unable to leave home.  I went in sorrow & deep grief to the graves of my father & mother & so much affected was I that I shed tears all the morning.  Thence to Bachelors Retreat where I saw Verner & family and others & heard the most flattering news of my prospects.  I stopped at a great many houses on the road.  Came to Mrs. Duboses, who was extremely glad to see me.  I delivered your letter & went on to see her Brothers & thence to Foster�s, where I staid all night.    My vote in that region is almost unanimous.  Fosters family were all well.  One of Josiah�s children had the measles.

	Saturday morning I went to muster at West Union & saw a great many people, where it was said Orr would beat me.  But that is a great mistake.  Some of my friends seemed astonished at my great excellence in electioneering.  Today I have seen a great many persons & find everything going well in Pickens.  I shall be at a long way in that neighborhood where Orr thinks he will get all the votes from the fact that they all voted for General Garvin.  Burt told me that he passed through that neighborhood the other day & found there to his great surprise all for me.  It is an old union neighborhood.

	Mrs. Col. Calhoun & Miss Martha have been electioneering for me strongly.  Mrs. Calhoun told one of her tenants that he might continue another year provided he would vote for me.  Miss Martha says publicly that it will be a disgrace to the district if Orr does beat me.

	I have been employed in several cases in court.  I may not return till the last of the week.  I send both of your letters & thank you for your advice.

	Tell Will that Trace is well & the tenor of the country.  South says he will take good care of him.  It is late & I have been interrupted by a good many. yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Col. Townes.

	I will probably be at home Thursday evening.  The murder case which I defend will be tried Wednesday.  I shall have no other business to detain me.

	In regard to the election I have nothing new to write.  My friends are greatly mortified at the result and my opponents are rejoicing.  Mr. Gantt told them they ought to be sorry for their country & not for him.  Elliott Keith says the people did not turn out.  A great many who would have voted for me staid at home, but my opponents were all out.  I have understood that Mr. Calhoun voted for Orr with an open ticket.  It is understood here that he threw the whole weight of his influence against me.    Col. Grisham says that was the cause of my defeat more than liquor.  The Rev. Mr. Kennedy said it was a great shame to see the people led by the noose by one man.  He said I was the most talented man in the congressional district so Boggs told me.  Kennedy was a strong nullifyer too.

	I must conclude & go�, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

       I rece[ive]d your letter by Col. Townes & the others sent me.  He was not able to bring the newspapers.  I thank you kindly for your letter as it gives me considerable pleasure to hear from my wife & children when from home.
       
       I came to Pendleton Tuesday morning about eleven oclock.  There I met a crowd of gentlemen waiting for the mail.  They recd me most cordially & all of them came to the tavern to see me.  I sat & conversed with them about two hours & I think we were mutually pleased with each other.  Dr. Symons, Maxwell, Seaborn, �, Sloan, Taylor, Lewis, Col. McCord, Maverick Starke &c &c.  Col. McCord gave me a most pressing invitation to go down & see him & offered to meet me at Pendleton on my return with his carriage & carry me down to his House.  Burt says I must come over & stay there three or four days & bring you with me for an excuse, & that I can do good business in the way of electioneering.  He counted about thirty votes for me in the village of Pendleton out of seventy.  He told me afterwards that two or three had said they were for me whom he did not count.
       
	I rode out to see Mrs. Mays but she had gone down to Anderson.  I took tea with Mr. Sharp, his wife & sister.  Mrs. Sharp looks very bad, & I am afraid she is rapidly passing to her grave.  They will be in Greenville next week on their way to North Carolina to see some of Mr. Sharps relations & restore her health.  They desired me to inform your mother.  I invited them to stay a day or two with [us] & come to our house.  
       
       I came up to Pickens Wednesday & came through a very�but they were all absent.  In Pickens Village my vote has increased from a bare majority to two thirds since last winter.  Everything is going on well.  The Burnl[e]y & Johnson debt has done me good service.  Col. Orr is the only democrat who goes for Taylor.  They are all pleased with my course on the Presidential election.  John Sloan who has been bitterly opposed to me, told Burt if Orr went for Taylor he should vote for me.  The Col. Has committed a great mistake in committing himself so soon.
       
       We have been all day trying a case in court, & it will take all of tomorrow & perhaps not finish it.  I shall probably not be at home before Sunday.  The weather is dreadfully hot.  
       
       I intend paying a visit with you to Pendleton this summer.  We can spend a few days there most pleasantly.  I saw Col. Bee who enquired after you all. 
       
       Joseph Powell is here, & told Miles Norton that he intended to vote for me�that Col Orr would not get 300 votes in Greenville�that I had always mistaken his character &c.
       
       Kiss the children for me.  Yours in great haste & true affection, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter this evening, & Willies on the same sheet.  Tell Willie he has improved very much in writing & I showed his letter to Col. Dawkins & Mr. Yancey who were sitting near me when I opened it.  Col. Dawkins asked me how many children I counted now & remarked I was not going on as rapidly as I commenced.

	I have just returned from the college through rain & mud.  We have made no election of Professor of Chemistry or Burser yet.  It is probable that Mr. Brumby will be elected & Col. Gladden will probably remain as Burser.  

	I think Col. Haynes prospects are pretty good for the attorney generalship.  I dined with Martin yesterday & saw his wife & children.  Porter, Perrin , Davant & Johnson were at the table.  Mrs. Martin seems to have very little to say.  I am to send your box to her to carry to Charleston.

	I went to the State House today for the first time.   Just as I entered the Senate chamber, I heard Col., Felder say in his speech �I regret that the Senator from Greenville who then adorned this Body is not now a member of it.�  He came to me after finishing his speech & said he did not know I was present & that I must have blushed.

	I saw Mr. William Elliott here yesterday.  He delivered an agricultural address.  I spent some time in pleasant conversation with him�enquired after his son & wife & told him you were intimate with her.

	I have made considerable purchases in the way of silver forks & tea spoons�two dozen (large & small) forks beautiful indeed & not to be told from entire silver for $18.00�one dozen of large tea spoons for $18.00�with your initials engraved on each spoon.

	I am not yet through the court of Equity.  My law cases are all disposed of�the result not known however.

	It is said the governor can hardly survive�is very ill�thought this evening to be dying.

	You are so much pleased with Reuben.  I suppose you & Mrs. Horn are well are mull[ing] such a trade.  I do not know when I shall return�not yet had time to look at buggies & carriages.  I think I shall go up in the stage.  The roads will be very bad.  I am sorry Jim had not reached home when you wrote me.  I was anxious to hear he had arrived safely.

	There is great electioneering here�never saw the like�had been in the Senate but a few minutes before Governor Richardson came to me to electioneer with me for Col. Manning.  I told him they were all my friends & I would not interfere.

	I met General Brisbane & Col. Edwards in the lobby of the State House.  Col. Orr was standing by me.  The General began to express his astonishment at my defeat.  Col. Edwards gave the hint that my opponent was present.  The General said��that fellow--he looks like a taper and seemed horrified.�  I have never before met with so many flattering & cordial expressions.  I think my defeat has given me great reputation.  Col. Alston said he read my address on the Presidency with great interest & approved it highly.

	I left my gold pen at home & I miss it very much I assure you.  Kiss the children for me�good night�God bless you, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a few lines.  You will have recd before this reaches you, the Box of Fruit sent by Jim.  I hope you & the children will enjoy it as a remembrance of�

	I have made considerable purchases today�coat, pants, waistcoat, hat. Boots, cravat & gloves for myself�two breast pins for you�got two steel broaches for $1.00�Mrs. Elletts book $2.50 for general reading & the young husband for my own special reading.  You see I desire to learn the duties of a husband.  You already know the duties of a wife.  My clothes cost $35.00.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne.  He looks this & sad.  He & Col. DeTreville are the only candidates for atty general.  The result is very doubtful.  I saw General Martin today.  He said Mrs. Martin was with him keeping house in Columbia.  Mrs. Taylor is purportedly confined today & is very ill.  Col. Taylor is absent in Alabama.  They are all well in Charleston.  Your box for Mrs. Hayne Col. Martin has promised to have sent to Charleston.

	I was in the court of Appeals all day�did not go to the State House�was studying Dr. Andersons case.  My business will not come up before Wednesday.  I may get through this week but will have to remain here all next week.

	My friends have greeted me in most flattering terms & express the utmost astonishment at my defeat.  They all lament in most sincere terms my absence from the Legislature.  General Thompson says that Elmore will resign & if so, I can be elected President of the Bank very easily.  I am sure there is a very kind feeling towards me in the Legislature.

	We had a pleasant trip down here but of this Jim can give you some account.  Col. Ware has not yet arrived.  Judge Richardson declines being a candidate for governor.  General Thompson was disappointed in Georgia.  Austen left no will.  He now goes on to Washington.

	In great haste, I hope to hear from you by next mail.  I feel some anxiety about Fanny.  Kiss the children.  I will get them presents before I return.  We are all well.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	It will be out of my power to meet you at Mr. Cunninghams.  I have been employed in several cases since my arrival here.  One of them is more trying & will take all day.  I must be at home Sunday night.  You will come up to Mr. Barksdales Saturday evening & I will meet you there & go home Sunday.

	I need not say how sorry I am not to be able to see Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham, Miss Pamela & all the family.  But I will pay them a visit this spring on my electioneering tour.

	The election goes on as well as I could desire.  I hear the most flattering intelligence from all parts of the district except the Sullivan neighborhood.  

	How happy I shall be to meet you & the children tomorrow.  But Court is now being called & I must stop.  Remember me to all.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I shall not be able to return today, as I wrote you by Mr. Elford.

	The murder case in which I was engaged was tried Tuesday evening, & resulted in a verdict of manslaughter.  There were some Georgia lawyers here & amongst them a son of Judge Underwood who told me that he had waited to hear my speech & he had not been disappointed�that it was the only speech that he had heard during our court although General Thompson & General Whitner had spoken.  Mr. Underwood was also a Whig.

	Mr. Allen another lawyer from Georgia told me in the presence of Judge Frost that Judge Dougherty of Georgia although a Taylor man, regretted deeply my defeat when he heard of the result of the election.  I became acquainted with Judge Dougherty some years since at Greenville.  He is a man of great talent & high character & �a noble fellow� as he said of me.

	General Thompson has been talking a good deal about my offering for the Presidency of the Bank.  He requested Coil. Townes to speak of it in Columbia.  Elliott Keith has proposed me as a candidate for the Senate of the U. States�says that some of the members of the Legislature here had promised to support me.  But this is all idle and I tell it to you for the want of something better to write.  My friends are all disposed for me to run again at the next election.

	 I recd Fifty seven dollars in cash yesterday my costs in the case of Reed vs Keith.  I filed a bill in Equity last night which will be worth fifty dollars.  General Thompson says that the chancellor has decreed in our favour in the case of Evans & Boston.  If so we shall get a handsome fee.  

	I saw Mr. Lee yesterday, also Foster & three of his sons.  They are all well.  Josiah is very low & speaks of coming to [Greenville] with aunt Foster.  In haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter and was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I had been invited by Col. Wigfall to drink wine with himself & Col. Manning & left the table when the mail was opened to get your letter.  The insisted on my not going but I said I expected to hear from you.

	I have but a short time, as I have to go down to the college immediately after tea to hear the Senior Class speak.  I was there last night till eleven oclock & as a trustee occupied quite a
conspicuous seat amidst the Professors & Judges, surrounded by a crowded gallery of Ladies & gentlemen.  The students performed well, and the college is in a most prosperous state.

	I arrived here Wednesday evening just in time to take my seat at the Board of Trustees and we were kept sitting until after eleven oclock.  We met again next Wednesday night�no election of Burser yet.  There are about twenty candidates.  I had hardly got out of the stage when Dr. Davis called to electioneer with me.  I told him I had to vote for Anderson but if he withdrew I would support him.

	I have been today performing a duty imposed on Mr. Withers, Col. Manning & myself as a committee of the Board of Trustees to Report on the communications recd from the President & Professors.  Tomorrow night I am invited by Col Preston to go round to his house & eat strawberries.  He wishes the Trustees to meet the senior class at his house.

	I have not yet, & am afraid I will not reach any of my cases in the court of Appeals, for a week or ten days.  In fact there is some danger of having to stay here till the last of the month.  But for my duty as Trustee I should return home & come back again.

	None of the lawyers from my circuit will be here before Monday.  We will then determine what to do�whether to wait or postpone our cases.  

	I came down all alone on the stage to Newberry.   There I was joined by Mr. Pope & two young men�one of them comes down to be admitted to the Bar.  Tom Jones & Players son Daniel came up last night to apply.  Jones looked so plain I hardly knew him.  He has cut off all his beard, & laid aside his fine clothes, & looks like a different being.  He says I must give him a certificate of moral character as he is better acquainted with me than any other lawyer here.  [James L.] Petigrus son does not seem promising.

	I saw�Butler & delivered his letters & bundles.  The package to H. Thurston I sent [page torn] Summer, who enquired for his little friend as soon as he spoke to me.    He seems to have been very much taken with Willie.  I have not seen or heard from Taylor.  General Bonham enquired after you all.  He seems very happy & talks about his anxiety to get back home again.

	I will write you again on Monday next.  Tell Jim as soon as he has finished replanting to plant the new ground, & sow the herds grass in the wet places, where it is too wet for corn.

	I will execute all your commissions contained in your letter.  Tell Will I will bring him the ball &c.  If Will goes to school again, make him come home at twelve oclock.  Take care of yourself & the children, my dear wife, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and thank you for it.  I was anxious to hear from you, & walked up to the Post office before the hour for opening & delivering letters.  The post master saw me through a crack & opened the office.  Whilst I was standing reading your letter in the piazza of the office Judge Evans came up & enquired how I could get letters out.  I replied the post master knew me & supposed I was anxious to hear from my wife.  The Judge said �do you not thank God that you were not elected  [to Congress--you ought to.�

	Since writing to you I have bought a beautiful wig for $10.00 & it has improved my looks very much.  I immediately made Col. Herndon buy one to cover his grey head.  He now looks about thirty five.  I told him when Mrs. Herndon comes down this week I intend to have them married over again.  She would hardly recognize him.  

	I have made considerable purchases since I wrote you besides the wig.  Col. Dunhams agent offered to pay me if I would take out the draft in his store.  I thought it best to do so & purchased the following articles�one dozen tumblers $5.00�dozen wine glasses $6.00�all the finest cut glasses or stone�a set of beautiful decanters, cut glass, 4 in number $16.00�two wash basins & pitchers 3.00�two vegetable dishes $3.00�one entry lamp (gas light) $6.50�a most splendid affair�one chamber lamp (gas) $2.50�cream pot 75cts�molasses pitcher�do very handsome $2.50�one small beautiful basin & pitcher for Annas room &c &c.

	I have also purchased two bedsteads for $8.00 & $6.00�three mattresses $6.75 a piece�one mahogany folding table $14.00�one crib mattress $2.50.

	I do not expect to go to Charleston or purchase groceries till I return home.  Next spring we will go to town as you suggest & lay in our supplies.  Tell Anna I will buy her ear rings.  I will get the shawl for Anne &c &c.  But have not yet had time.

	I saw Captain Cunningham this morning.  He called to see me & is a member of the convention.

	There was a meeting of the delegates yesterday evening & it was agreed that we would not do anything more than organize a central committee to correspond with the Southern people.  Tomorrow the convention meets & there is a great crowd in Columbia as we usually see at the meeting of the legislature.

	I was employed in a case from Newberry to be argued before Judge Frost at chambers Wednesday & shall get a good fee.  The case is a dispute about a child between the grandmother & the aunt of the child.

	It is more than likely that our cases in the court of Appeals will not be reached & that I may return home the last of this week.  

	Col. Irby & Mr. Young came down this evening.  They brought news that Edward Earle was probably not alive.  Col. Irby tells me that he will pay the interest & desires to do so.

	I am sorry to hear of the death of Durbecs child & that Elias Earle was in the bar room so soon after the death of his wife.  His son came up to me the other day & made himself known.  He is going to school here.

	I have no doubt that Dr. Tiddiman is sick of his purchase.  You are mistaken in saying that I have a horror of long letters.  Yours are never too long except when you scold me, or give me too much advice.

	I hope the children are well and that Reuben is getting on well with the farm.  I am glad you have had a fine rain.

	I must now conclude.  You have no doubt heard of the dreadful in New York.  The last account is that 500 men were killed in the last one & that the mob had overcome the military and that they had sent to Philadelphia for aid.  
	
       I hope the children are through with the mumps & poor little Fanny rid of her complaint.  Yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from dining with Mr. Petigru & shall not have time to write you as long a letter as I intended to do before I shall be under the necessity of going to attend the college exhibition.

	Since my arrival here I have been busy, the greater part of the time in court listening to Mr. Petigru, Col. Hunt, Col. Memminger & Judge henry arguing some very important cases.  When I shall reach mine is very uncertain.  

	In coming down I did not get to see Col. Irby, but was told that he will be here Sunday night.  The draft Col. Dunham gave me has not been paid.  His agent says he owes him nothing so I shall probably not have funds to purchase many things or go to Charleston.

	At Laurens there was a passenger in the stage who had been overseeing all his life for wealthy planters in the lower country who amused me greatly as I came to town.  Amongst many others
he had overseed for Mr. Wigfall father in law of Dr. Simmons.  He says the Dr. has moved nine times since his marriage�that his wife is one of the finest ladies he ever knew�that he has spent a large portion of his fortune, but will have a handsome competency on the death of Mrs. Wigfall.

	At Newberry I passed Mrs. Walker without seeing her.  That night Mr. Higgins came to the Hotel and asked me to take charge of two young ladies, nieces of Col. Fairs, who were going to Columbia.  I found them very pleasant & agreeable.  One of them was from Florida.  They were going to Dr.  Fairs in Columbia.  We had a great deal of amusement with the overseer who told us about his family difficulties &c.  He & his wife lived very badly together.  The young ladies pronounced him a hen picked husband & his wife a�

	On my arrival in Columbia I found a whole troop of Arabs in Maybins tavern.  They are as black as mulattoes & two of them have fine looking English wives & children.  They are dressed in the Arabian costume & present a fanciful appearance.

	That night I attended the Board of Trustees & General Adams & myself were sent to the college to represent them at the exhibition of the students.  The college was crowded with ladies, & Adams said we were selected because we were the finest looking members of the Board.  Col. Summer said the ladies in the gallery made the same remark when we came in.

	I met Mr. Brumby on the stage in college but we did not recognise each other.  When I found out who he was I spoke to him.  He said I had entirely changed every feature &c.  He invited me to take tea with him & get an acquaintance with Mrs. Brumby who was an intimate friend of your mother.  I suppose he meant Mrs. Hayne.

	I have never seen so many lawyers in Columbia.  There are 70 here & more coming.  Petigru came to me in court today & said I must go & dine with him at Clarks Hotel.  We spent a pleasant evening & walked over the town off Columbia after dinner.  He told me that he wished to see me a Judge�that I was a great fool for coming out for Cass last summer�that he reached Pendleton two days after my declaration & if it had been two days before he would have stopped me.

	I have bought myself a coat, two pairs of pantaloons, two waistcoats for $23.00.  One of the waistcoats is French linen & I know you will oppose my taste.  

	I am anxious to hear from you & the children.  I saw the uncle of Mrs. Earle who was greatly shocked at her death.  Major Henry & daughter are here.  Miss Henry seems a great favourite with her teacher & Dr. Lieber.  She learns very fast.

	Kiss the children for me.  I will write you by the next mail.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before going to bed & I hope you will write me by Col. Townes Wednesday morning.

	I suppose our groceries & bedding have arrived from Hamburgh & that you are perhaps tonight engaged in unpacking.  I wish I was with you to help you & enjoy the pleasure of a first look at the different articles not forgetting the little matters purchased for you by your Aunt.

	I hope too that Col. Dunhams wagons with the paint have arrived & that Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell will commence the House.

	I had a very hot day on Sunday & severe headache Baylis Crayton & Wagstaff travelled in company with me.  We dined at the spring & there met a man & woman eating their dinner�also the man called me by name & Crayton seemed to know him well.  I offered him my bottle & then proposed making some toddy for his wife as I supposed.  I gave her [page torn] rush & was very polite.  When they started, Crayton told me the woman was Mrs. Patterson of noted fame about Greenville.  You maty imagine my surprise.

	There is very little business in court.  I have found it pleasant meeting Chancellor Dargan.  We served four years together in the Senate.

	It was reported the other day in Anderson that Mrs. Sharp was dead.  But Dr. Sloane told me he saw her riding out on Saturday.  She is so ill that she cannot lie down to sleep, but has to sleep sitting up in her chair.

	I had a dreadful headache today, & shall take pills tonight.  I did intend going by Pendleton, but shall not be able to do so.  

	I saw Mr. Keith here & told him he must collect some money for me at court.

	There is a fine crop growing on Josiah�s farm.  I go there in the morning.

	I saw Mrs. May�s carriage in the village this morning with a trunk behind.

	General Whitner is walking on crutches.  He was badly crippled in the ankle by a fall from his horse.

	I shall be at home on Friday.  Tell Reuben to keep ploughing & let Mary help hoe the corn.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will avail myself of the opportunity of writing to you by Mr. Choice whop returns to Greenville this morning.

	It is likely I may return myself tomorrow.  The case of Dr. Bivins & Col. Leitner has been postponed & another case in which I am concerned will be disposed of today.  Unless I am employed in some new business I shall have nothing to detain me longer.  I hope to see today some persons who were to settle fees with me at this court.  One on them I saw yesterday and recd from him sixty two dollars.

	I found poor Delia in a hopeless situation.  She sent word immediately on my arrival that she wished to see me.  She was dreadfully emaciated & unable to get out of bed.  I could not help shedding tears when she enquired affectionately after you & the children.  How long she may linger I am unable to say.  It is some consolation to know that she is with her mother & will not be neglected on her death bed.

	It is a sad sight to see one sinking gradually into an unknown eternity & reflect that they have to give up life and this world and all ties which bind us to life.

	Chancellor Dunkin is presiding & he enquired after you & your mother very kindly.  I stopped at Mrs. Dantzellers for dinner on Sunday.  She asked about you & whether you had altered or changed much.  She said I had not at all since the first time she saw me, twenty two years since�that I looked as well now as I did then.  I told her you were as young & as good looking as you were when you were married at seventeen.  I also told her & Judge Dunkin the mistake {page torn] client who took you [page torn] daughter.

	Mrs. Dantzeller enquired whether all of my children were as good looking as Willie.  I think I shall have to carry Frank with me on the circuit.

	I hope Fanny is better & that you are all well.  I have just heard of the death of General McDuffie.  It is well for him as he had outlived his mind and strength.  Mrs. Singleton is also dead.

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  It was my intention to have returned home from this place & then to have gone to Bachelors Retreat before Pickens Court.  But yesterday Mr. Burt had me retained in a case in court with a fee of fifty dollars, & directly afterwards Mr. Harrison came to employ me on the other side with himself & General Whitner.

	I shall not now be able to return home till after Pickens court.

	We had quite a strong time in the convention at Abbeville, as well as going & returning.  But the Rail Road has been secured to Greenville and the people of Anderson are very much outraged at it.

	You must tell Reuben to attend to the hogs in the field & feed them as they have eaten up all the peas by this time.  As soon as he has gotten the corn out of the other field, & dug the potatoes & ground nuts, he must turn the hogs in that.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  You must write to me at Pickens by some of the Lawyers.  I am so anxious to return home that I felt indifferent about getting a fee to detain me here.

	Tell the children to learn their lessons & get no more ther� from Dr. Laurens.  Yours truly, B.F Perry

	I shall be detained here till Saturday night, & will not be able to visit my brothers plantation on my route to Pickens court.

	General Whitner was taken sick yesterday, & I have been employed in all of his cases.  We have been all day trying a will & not yet through.  There are four or five other cases to try.  I hope I shall make something�by this court.

	I will be at home as soon as I can make my escape from Pickens.

	You must write me on Sunday by Mr. Elford, Townes or Choice and let me hear all your news�how you are doing &c.  How Reuben comes on with the corn &c.

	I was at a musical concert last night at Mrs. Daniels Academy & heard all of her scholars perform.  Saw & spoke to Mrs. Daniels, Miss Payne & Mrs. May�s & Miss Marion.  They all enquired after you.

	It is now eleven oclock & I have just prepared a speech for tomorrow in a will case.  I must now go to bed.  Good night, your truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I thank you most sincerely for your long & interesting letter by Mr. Elford & also for the letters from other persons.

	I am sorry I cannot write you one as interesting in return, but I will make it up in conversation when we meet.

	Mr. Elford is now about starting & I have just left the C. House to write you a line only.  

	It will probably be the last of the week before I return.  I have had a good share of business & have recd some money.

	Our client Young is to be tried tomorrow for counterfeiting.

       My business with Keith is likely to be profitable.

       Enclosed I send you ten dollars as you are out of change.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines, though I have very little to communicate.
       
	Nothing has been done in any of my cases yet.
       
	Mr. Farley has gone to Memphis, & has entrusted all of his business to me.
       
       In the case of Dr. Teagues, argued last summer in the court of Equity, the decree of Chancellor Dargan has been rece[ive]d & is in my favor.
       
       Dr. Teague was so much pleased at the result that he paid me two hundred dollars this morning.  He will pay me the balance in Columbia about one hundred more.  He had already paid me $140 or 150 dollars.  
       
	Mrs. Philson owes me $100 & promised to pay me a part this court but I have not yet 
seen her.  Her daughter Mary Dillon has a very important case in court & poor woman is about being confined & not able to be at court.  This is her second slip.  You remember she paid us a visit two years since.  

	It is very doubtfull whether Dr. Andersons case will be reached this court.  There is a woman to be tried here for murdering the mistress of her husband.  An unusual number of witnesses is bound over in the case.

I have been a good deal troubled with toothache since I came here & yesterday evening suffered 

	I hope to hear from you Thursday morning.  It is not at all likely I shall be sat home before Sunday evening.

Tell Rueben to go on & sow & plough in the wheat�take care of the horses�hogs--&c.  

	Cotton is rising & money is plenty in Laurens�negroes selling high $800--& will bring 
$1000 it is said before January.

	I have not seen or heard from Mr. Cunningham or his family.

	I hope you & the children & servants are all well.  Tell Willie, Anna & Frank to learn their lessons well and be good children.  

	Mrs. O�Neall is better. Says the Judge & he has been home since he was at Greenville.

	I am my dear wife yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

P.S. They are making the necessary surveys for the Laurens Rail Road and all seem in good spirits.

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this morning & thank you kindly for it though I wish you had said more about the children.  In writing to me always let the first topics be yourself, and children, the servants & Horses�Then our friends & neighbors &c.

	I have recd since writing to you a letter & package from Mrs. Cunningham enclosing a bay to you.  I will enclose her letter, which I broke open thinking it was directed to myself.  The Bay is a beautiful one & I wish I could send it to you immediately.

	It is possible that I may be at home Saturday evening.  I have tried only one of my cases, which I gained, Nashe vs Rodgers for land.  We are now trying another one of mine, Hudgens vs Kennedy.  The case of Dr. Anderson & Neeley has been postponed for want of time.  The case of Dillard vs Philsen I am afraid cannot be reached and if I find that out tomorrow I will leave here Saturday morning.  

	The woman has been convicted of manslaughter for killing the mistress of her husband.  It was a shocking case.  The parties were all poor & unprincipled.  It took place in Mr. Cunninghams neighborhood.

	I am sorry for�Simmons & it is a pity that such a man should not have more sense.  It seems hard that that some men should be placed in this world, wholly unfitted for it.

	I hope H. Judge Moore will do better in Charleston than he did in Greenville.  I am afraid that Miss Trott will find that she wants something more than Moore to keep her pleasantly tattling through life & the world.

	I am sorry too for Mrs. Power.  She never will be happy from her husband & perhaps never happy with him.  Poor woman deserves a better fate but no doubt her own imprudence has in some way influenced her destiny.

	I was greatly shocked yesterday in seeing a friend of mine. Griffin Williams, the brother of Col. Williams looking very bad & ascertaining that he had separated from his wife.  The cause no one knows.  He is a gentleman & an amiable man.  His wife was a �young�, & a fine lady.  They have children & a large fortune and are young people.
	My friend Nance was here as a witness in court.  He is a good fellow & I like him much.

	Kiss the children for me & believe me yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening although I have but letter to communicate.  Willie is seated by me reading the �Evenings of old story tellers.�

	We had a very dusty drive down here.  At Laurens we fell in company with Col Irby, Col Ware, & Major Smith.  On the road we fared sumptuously.

	I have met a great many of my acquaintances here from different parts of the state, who have all given me a most hearty welcome back to the Legislature.  Mr. Mitchell said he was glad to see me as Col. Memminger had had the House under his control long enough.  He wanted me to divide his influence.  Col. Fair told me that Col. John Preston asked him about my running for Governor. He replied that the upper country intended to run me for U. States Senator if there were two or three candidates from the lower country.

	General Whitner has gone to Florida & requested me to ask leave of observer for him, which I did today.

	I saw Col. Martin who enquired after you & said he had a box for some of you.  I told him I could send it up by Col. Townes wagon the latter part of this week.  I met Col. Isaac Hayne this morning in the Court House.  He seemed very careless about speaking & did not even enquire about any of you.  I showed equal indifference in regard to him & thought to myself how different his manner was last fall when he was electioneering.  I believe it is true, that we mutually dislike each other.

	I have bought myself a frock coat $20.00, pantaloons $9.00, do $7.00, hat $4.00. boots $8.00, gloves $1.25, cravat 2.50, cap for Willie $1.50, two books for Willie $1.50.

	I have not had time to look for a shawl yet.

	Col. Tandy Walker is here & a candidate for comptroller general but I should suppose with very little hope of success.

	There is a crowd of candidates for door keeper & no election yet made.  

	I saw today a beautiful�of pictures to be sold tonight�.

	Col. Irby insisted that I should take ten shares $200 in the Laurens Rail Road that he would�name & would get me fees to pay the installments. I told him I would promise to take in stock all the fees he would get for me at Laurens whilst the road was building.

	Willie is greatly admired by all who see him.  He takes care of himself�went up in the gallery today & sat there all the time the House was in session.  He must write you by the next mail.

	You had better have the top of the house cleaned off.  If the weather is bad & Reuben cannot plough let him & Charles split rails for the cross fence which is not high enough.  

        Tell the children I want to see them all very much & will bring them all some candy.  Willie is a great comfort to me & company for me.  
       
       I am my dear wife yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

P.S. I was shown a letter today from Mr. Stuart resigning his appointment in the Greenville Female Academy on account of his wifes health.  This is most unfortunate.  Smith is here & will take the position.

My dear Liz

	I was detained so long at the meeting of the Board of Trustees the other night that it was out of my power to write you by the last mail.

	I recd your letter by Mr. Elford & also the package which I have handed over to the shoe maker.

	Dr. Erwin told me yesterday that he left your letter in his old coat at home.  I was very much provoked at it & told him I has a great notion to whip him for his negligence, not having recd a letter from you by the last mail.  I was anxious to hear from you.  It is always best to send letters by mail.  

	Willie commenced writing you a letter the other day & will finish it to go by this mail.  The whole letter is his own production and was written whilst I was out of the room.  I only told him to write you all that he had seen & heard.

	I have bought him a very pretty suit of clothes, black cloth frock coat.  He looks like a little man with his cravat on.

I saw Col. Isaac Hayne the other day�& he seemed more cordial & said he would send Isaac to see Willie, but has not yet done so.  General Martin said Taylors son must come & take charge of him, but he has not.  Dr. Erwin brought his little son with him & he & Willie were together yesterday.

	I have bought Willie three very pretty books & he is now reading one of them & laughing heartily at the stories.  He behaves like a little man�went to the show last night by himself whilst I went to meet a committee.  He sits in the gallery till two oclock, then goes to the tavern & eats his dinner amongst the crowd.  The members do not dine till 3 oclock.

	I have written a long letter for the Mountaineer, which I will enclose to you [not present] to read Sunday night & send up to Wells, soon, Monday morning.

	I have not yet made any purchase of a shawl, as I wish to see how the ladies are dressed on Monday at the College commencement, whether they wear shawls or mantillas or something else.

	I have exchanged my gold pencil for a gold pen & pencil, the prettiest thing you ever did see & gave eight dollars to boot.  I have forty dollars left.  I think of purchasing an overcoat which is now worn entirely instead of cloaks.

	Tell Anna, Frank & Fanny that I will bring them something nice or pretty�certainly the cocoa cakes for Fanny. I want to see you all very much.

	I recd a letter from Mr. Stuart the other day.  Who the Trustees will select I am unable to say.  He thanks me for my politeness to him in Greenville & regrets that his wifes health will not permit his coming to Greenville.

	I am glad to hear Charles & Reuben are ploughing.  Hope the servants will all do well.  Kiss the children.  Yours affectionately. B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a letter this morning before I go to church for fear I may be prevented afterwards, as I was the other evening in attending the Board of Trustees.

	I have read a letter from your aunt Eliza requesting me to let Willie pay them a visit when next Jas. Conner returns.  But Willie says he will not go without I do.  He is a manly little fellow & I think a most remarkable boy.  Since he came here he has read three books of considerable size, I had to purchase another for him last night.  Dressed up in his suit of cloth, silk waist coat & frock coat he looks like a little man.  He goes to the State House, sits in the gallery alone, observed everything that is done in the House & comments on the proceedings at night as if he were a member.

	Yesterday we took a ride on the Greenville Rail Road.  The Judges were all with us & they all renewed their acquaintance with Willie.  The road is finished seven r eight miles.  The car purchased for the road is the most beautiful one I ever saw.

	Last night Mr. Yeadon & Judge Porter of Alabama called to see me.  The Judge said he would have known me any where by my Bust in Mr. Yeadons drawing room. Yeadon has got Clark Mills to make one from the mould in his possession, which Mills has preserved.  I was very much pleased with Judge Porter.

	I am going to the Episcopal church this morning.  Tomorrow is commencement in college & a great day.  Willie will see a great deal.  Yesterday he heard the cannon firing for the first time & at first did not know what it was.  

       Col. Isaac Hayne & his son called to see Willie & myself the other day & we were not in the room.  His son Isaac & William Taylor came in the evening and spent a few minutes with Will & invited him to see them.  He has not yet been.

	I recd your letter by the Fridays mail & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself in my absence.  I hope you will continue to dance.  I am anxious to return home again.  But having Will with me is a comfort & he behaves so well it is doubly pleasing & grattifying.

	It has now commenced raining very hard & I do not suppose we shall be able to go to church.  How I should like to be at home & spend the day with you & anna, Frank & Fanny�dear little creatures.  There is no place like home.  There are no persons like wife & children.  

	Elford, �, Green & Dr. Erwin are all here. But I have neither seen or heard of Jones.  The idea of his offering for solicitor is absurd.  Walker is here & ran twice for Comptroller General & got three votes both times.  Jones would not get as many for solicitor.  How people can deceive themselves.  Walker really thought he could be elected, & out of 164 votes recd 3!  Elias Earle was not a candidate.

	I do not know that I mentioned that Mr. & Mrs. Burt passed through Columbia on their way to Washington.  I saw them sitting in the gallery & Mrs. Burt was spruced up very fine.  Before I got an opportunity of speaking to her she left.  Burt & myself spent some time together & went to call on the governor together.  He has become as fat as a bear.  I saw Barnwell Rhett yesterday, who gave me a most cordial greeting.  He too is fattened up very much.  I was introduced to Heyward the other day who married Miss Smith or Rhett.  He enquired after you & your mother & Susan & Anne.  He was under the impression that Anne was married & Susan single.  Mrs. Isaac Hayne is here, but I have not seen her.

	Tell Fanny I will bring my pocket full of cocoa cakes for her.  Anna & Frank shall be remembered.  You shall be in the way of a shawl but I have not yet seen anything of the kind.  The four ladies I have seen wore mantillas & not shawls. 

	I have bought myself an over sack like my Canada sack only larger for $12.00.  It is worn over my coat & looks very genteel & is all the fashion.  Cloaks are thrown aside as old fashion. 

	I hope to receive a letter from you tonight.  The last mail Col. Fair & myself went to the Post office together & he said he was very anxious [to] get a letter from his wife, but did not.  I however recd one from you, & thought to myself you were more thoughtful of your husband.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am greatly vexed that you had not received my letters when you wrote me on Friday.  I have written you three times & sent you a long letter to read which I wrote for the Mountaineer.  Willie has also written you a letter & would have made it longer by was interrupted by a visit from his cousins.

	I was glad to receive your letter Sunday evening.  I hope you have recd all my letters before this reaches you.  Yesterday I went to church with Willie although it rained.  Today I have been in the college all day attending the commencement�Willie with me.  The chapel was full of Ladies & the young men spoke well.  I had some conversation with Col. Preston.  His health is better though he is very feeble.   
	 
	I wrote your Aunt Mrs. Eliza Hayne yesterday in reply to the letter sent me inviting Willie to visit them.

	I have been appointed on the committee to examine some students day after tomorrow.  The committee consists of Memminger. DeTreville, DeSaussure, Bonham & myself.  In the Board of Trustees I was appointed one of the visitors to attend the college next Fall & witness the examination of the students receiving the pay of a member of the Legislature.  Tonight there was a caucus to send delegates to attend a convention of the Southern States at Nashville next June.  I was to have been one of the delegates, but the appointment was postponed till next week.  In walking to the college today with General he suggested to me the propriety of my being the anti Bank candidate for Governor, which I declined.

	I have mentioned those little matters to you knowing the interest you take in everything which looks like a compliment to your husband.

	Willie is as great a book worm as myself.  He is now sitting at the table reading & it is near ten oclock in the night.  Mr. Keith has just informed me that he will leave here Wednesday morning for Greenville & I will keep this letter open till tomorrow evening & send it by him.

	I have nothing more to add since writing the above.  Willie says he will write to you in the morning.  He is the greatest book worm I ever saw of his age.

	I was looking at some shawls this morning, but was not altogether pleased with them.  They were $7.00 & $12.00.  I will take a good look before I purchase.  Shawls are said to be now fashionable.

	We shall adjourn about the 18th next.  No great question has yet come up for discussion.  Col. Williams told me this morning that the members of his boarding house had held a caucus last night and agreed on me for a candidate for Governor.  Really this thing is more spoken of than I had any idea.

	It is my purpose to carry Willie around to Taylors this evening, but I have no time to do anything.  Tonight I have to attend the Board of Trustees�attend the committee on the Penitentiary and I wish to hear Governor Hammond�s speech in College.

	Today the gallery was crowded with ladies.  Col. Pickens & his wife & daughters were there & I found it difficult to distinguish the wife amidst the daughters.  They all seemed about the same age.

	It is now near five oclock & I have yet to eat dinner so I must conclude.  Your affectionate Husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I reced your letters by yesterdays mail & thank you kindly for them.  I also recd Annas & was truly astonished at the writing.    I had no idea that she could write so well.  Really she writes a better hand than I do myself, & I told Willie she could beat him.  I think Anna a most extraordinary little girl.  There are very few in the State who can read & write like her at her age.  Willie is the admiration of all the members & behaves like a little man.  Really he seems more like a man in his behaviour & conversation than a boy.  You say Fanny is an extraordinary little girl & I agree with you.  She is in my opinion the smoothest of all our children.  Frank will have to depend on his good looks for his success in life.  But I think he too has talents & talents enough to distinguish himself.  Like all parents our young ones are all �ous.

	Last night Willie went with me to the Catholic Fair after I got through with the committee on the Penitentiary.  This was about eight oclock.  I never saw such a jam in my life.  It was indeed not decent for a lady to be there, for she was pressed in front, rear & each side, till not only the dress, but the figure of her person was changed.  The display was magnificent in every way.  In one room there were the most beautiful Tableaux vivant[s] the eye ever beheld.  Willie was en� with them.  He passed through & under the crowd in a dark room till he got in front of the ladies & close to the tableaux.  There he stood for one hour looking whenever the curtain was raised. 

	Today he went round to Taylors & staid there till the hour of dinner when he returned to the House & did not eat anything till 4 oclock.  I started to go with him, but met Eloise Butler & Col. Haynes little sons & I then turned back & yesterday I saw Mrs. Isaac Hayne in the Gallery & from the Hall she looked very well.  I think her features good & her face a fine one.  She looks very different from the idea I had formed of her.  

	The Gallery for two days has been crowded with young ladies & they talked so much & so loud  that the doorkeeper had to hollow out three or four times �Silence in the Gallery.�  Mrs. Dawkins is here, Miss Thompson & Miss Pickens.

	The election of Controller General resulted today in the election of McCully.  Arthur Simpkins came to me & said on account of old associations I must vote for him after Pickens was out of the way.  I told him I had pressed my friend Col. Williams to vote for McCully.  He said Col. Williams & himself were kin & it was strange that he should be electioneering against him.

	We have not yet had any discussion in the House.  I made a few remarks yesterday on a bill which passed making it a whipping offence to sell spirits to a slave.  Tomorrow the great discussion commences on the Bank.  Col. Memminger came to me & said he wished me to hold back & not speak till the latter part of the debate, so that I might reply to the onslaught which would be made on him.

	   Tonight I am going down to meet the opponents of the Bank & arrange for the battle tomorrow.  Willie will write you a letter whilst I am gone and tomorrow I will write one to Anna.

	You need not have sent the money to pay for the shoes.  I went to look at shawls again today, but the store was full of ladies, & I deferred the inspection.

	Col. Irby says if he had known that I was going to bring Willie he would have brought his little son Jones.  Col. Ware says the same.  So next Winter I expect all the members will follow my example.  Willie has a cloth pair of pantaloons & silk vest�.coat.  All fit well & he looks like a little man.  Major Henry calls him governor.  Willie says he expects Frank dreams about him at night with his eyes open.

	There are some beautiful canary birds here for sale.  Four dollars a pair & Willie is anxious to buy a pair for Anna.  They are sweet little things & I am almost tempted to do so.

	I wrote you last mail by Mr. Keith & about twelve oclock some time in Columbia.  If he did not put the letter in the Post office you were disappointed again in hearing from me.  But if you do not hear any mail you must know there has been some mistake or I am busy.

	General [James H.] Adams took me out the other day to tell me that my friends were going to run me for President of the Bank.  But I tell you all these little matters confidentially.

	I am invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow.  But it is likely I shall not be able to go.

	I must now go to meet my anti Bank friends at the State house & will leave Will at home to write you a letter.  Kiss all the children for me.  I am very impatient to see you all again.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Little Daughter

	You can hardly imagine how pleased I was to receive your beautiful letter.  I had no idea you could write so well.  Indeed you write better than Willie.  I told him so & that he must take more pains in his next letter to his mother.  You must write me another letter.

	There is a German who arrived here the other day with some hundreds of canary birds in little  cages & sells them at four dollars a pair.	 How would you like to have a couple of the little creatures.  If you will write to me perhaps I may purchase two of them for you.  They sing beautifully.  But strange to say all the singing & chattering is done by the male bird.  The female does not chatter at all.  This reverses what is common in our species.

	The other day in the State House the Gallery was filled with young ladies & little girls & they kept up a chattering all the time like the canary birds. & disturbed the members by their noise.  But as soon as they left the Gallery all was quiet again.

	In the course of four or five years I will bring you down here to Columbia with me.  I wish you had been here the other night to have seen the Tableaux vivant at the Catholic Fair.  They were beautiful little girls & boys & ladies standing, reclining & sitting like pictures & Statues.  Willie was very much pleased & I am sure you would have been too.

	Willie & myself have been invited to ride on the rail road to Camden next Tuesday & perhaps we may go if I can leave the Legislature.  But today the Bank question came up & it is too important a question to leave.

	I will now stop writing & finish my letter this evening after I return from the State House,  Something may occur which your mother would be glad to hear.  Willie shall write to you by the next mail.  He has some beautiful books which you shall read when we return.  They are full of pictures & such pretty stories that I have been reading them myself.

	I have just returned from the State House, ate my dinner went to the Post & recd your mothers letter of Wednesday.  I had just seen Col. Thos P. Butler who came down in the stage this evening & told me you were all well.  I was glad to hear from you by letter although it was a short one.  Willie had not eaten dinner today when the Legislature adjourned & therefore I did not go to dine with the Governor as I had been invited & had some idea of doing.

	We had a crowd of ladies in the gallery today & Col. Memminger your friend who you took for a man selling chickens made an able argument against the Bank.  Mr. F. P. Reed of Anderson replied to him, but in a very feeble manner.  General Adams will speak tomorrow.  I may speak Monday or Tuesday.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne & his lady in the gallery & spoke to the Col. after the Legislature adjourned.  He immediately commenced electioneering with me for his friend Dr. Stark.  I answered your aunt Eliza Haynes letter & wrote very politely & pleasantly.  She too had written me about her [husband�s]  office more than about Willie.  I told her it would always afford me great pleasure to serve her as her family & that she had only to command my service.

	I am glad to hear Sam Earle has bought his Brothers land.  He has paid a high price for it.

	I did not receive a ticket to the commencement Ball & therefore did not go as I usually do.

	I have bought for your mother one of the prettiest shawls I ever saw.  It is a dress shawl & quite large cashmere.  White in the center & large wide borders of flowers extending pretty much across.  It is fine, though not thick & heavy, & is such as I see the little ladies wearing.  I think your mother will be pleased with it & the price astounded me.  I cannot yet understand it.  It was $4.00!!!.  If the man had said $15.00 I should have given it.  I had looked at a great many priced from $7 to $12 and was not pleased with any of them.  Passing by a store I saw the shawl & went in.  I know it will please your mother & although not as warm as a cloak or a blanket shawl is warm enough.  

	Willie is now talking to me & I must�& go down to the State House as it is just dark.  

	You must write me again.   Tell Fanny I saw a great many cocoa nut cakes today.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Friday & was glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home & I am extremely anxious to return.

	The stage came in today at three oclock.  Col. Fair, Ware, Irby, Sullivan, Willie and myself went immediately to get some letters.  Col. Ware rece[ive]d three from his wife�Col. Fair none, Irby & Sullivan recd letters, but from whom I know not.  I suppose however from their better halves.

	  I have very little to write you since my last.  Yesterday Col. John Preston made a noble & eloquent speech in defence of the Bank, which I have mentioned in my letter to Wells.  General Adams made a good speech on the other side.

	Col. John Preston invited me to dine with him yesterday, but I could not go.  Willie was unwilling to be separated from me.  And the truth is all my linen was in the wash & I had not a clean shirt to wear.  But I have no disposition to attend any parties.  I like Col. Preston very much.

	Last night I was at the lecture on Geology by Professor Brumby in the House of Representatives.  It was a most learned & able & interesting speech.  I saw Col. W.C. Preston there & his health is better.  He seems very cordial towards me & said he was sorry I was not in Washington.

	I saw Col., Hayne & his wife but did not get to speak to them.  I spoke to E� Butler.  Mrs. Hayne looks dowdyish in her dress.  In other words she looks like an Alabama lady.  But she has strong features & I thought rather�

	After the lecture Genl Adams insisted on our going to the Catholic Fair but I positively declined & said one night was enough for me.  Today Col. Thos Pickens was giving me an amusing account of Tom Butler & Erwin Jones there last night.  I tell it to you in confidence & you must not speak of it.  Butler took $40.00 in raffles, won a gold watch & presented it to Miss Dangol, a beautiful, bold & impudent young lady, the daughter of a shoe maker, to whom he was very attentive & with whom he seemed desperately in love.  Jones was spending his money most freely in raffles & making presents to a Miss Beard who was equally bold & who lives in this place & was officiating as salesman.

	But I have done wrong in mentioning those things even to you.  But only think of Tom Butler head over heels in debt taking $40.00 in raffles & presenting gold watches to the young ladies!  His wife & children at home, perhaps needing some of the comforts of life.

	I have heard of Anne Williams & am afraid the fact of her coming down here at this time in the capacity of milliner will not add anything to her reputation, however pure her motives may be.

	Today has been a bad day & I did not go to church.  Willie has been reading his Testament. & I have been looking into the Bank question.

	You must send Wells� letter to him the night you receive it, as he may wish to commence setting it up.

	Lands have risen very much in Greenville judging from Cox�s & Dr. T� prices.  The Rail Road can take at a fair value any ones land for depot or right of way.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your long letter & Anne�s & am very much obliged to you both.  It gives me great pleasure to hear from you. Willie & myself left the�House at half after 3 this evening to go to the Post office.  The mail was not opened when we got there.

	I have not yet spoken on the Bank question but will in a day or two.  The committee of the two Houses meets tonight to nominate a President & directors.  Col. Gist who is on the committee told me that in all probability I would be nominated for President.  Mer. [Ker] Boyce came to me today & said the same.  I have never mentioned the subject to anyone & if I should be nominated my election would be very doubtful.  I have no idea Col. Elmore can be beaten.

	Mr. Choice came down yesterday & brought the three Clevelands.  As I was going down to the State House little Jerry spoke to William.  I did not know him.  He & Willie went about together.  They go to Charleston.

	I am afraid it will be out of my power to bring your bonnet.  Indeed I do not know how I shall get up with the birds.  The roads are dreadful & your bonnet would be exposed to the weather.  Moreover my money is coming to an end.  Your bonnet is very good & if you get a new one you had better get [it] in the summer.  

        Chancellor Dunkin gave me $25.00 for�in court the other day.  If you ascertain she wants anything in particular you can purchase for her & I will pay when I return.
       
       I have just been elected one of the Trustees of the College.  General Martin was beaten [by] one vote, & he dislikes it very much.  I got all but four.
	    
	It was determined the other night in caucus to elect those [who] were not in the Legislature to Nashville & Judge Cheves, Robt. Barnwell, Elmore & Gov. Hammond were elected.

	My cases came up yesterday in court.  Four of them were tried.  Today they were trying the Edgefield cases.  

	I am invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow again, & have accepted the invitation.

	The Legislature meets tonight & I must now go to the State House.

	Tell Frank I will bring him something.  Willie is sitting by me & talking all the time.  

	You must excuse this short epistle & expect short ones from this out.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am pressed to death for time to attend to my business in court, in the Legislature, writing out my speech on the Bank &c.  The Legislature meets tonight & I now have to go down there.

	I have just sent Willie to the Post office & he returned with your letter to him.  I was glad to hear from you all. If I could bring your bonnet I would, but this is impossible nor have I seen any very pretty ones.  Nor could I fit you.  It is too late to repent about the birds.  They are pressed too.

	I made a speech yesterday on the Bank & am now writing it out for publication.  It was a good speech & has been�complimented in the papers & by the Legislature of all parties.  You will see the notice in the Carolinian.  The Telegraph also compliments it though a Bank paper.  Immediately after my speech the vote was taken & the Bill lost by the vote of Smith & Earle against it.  If they had voted for it it would have passed.  Col. Ware is going to vote against it in the Senate & I told him he was misrepresenting his constituents.

	Willie is delighted with your letter & is now sitting by me reading.  He goes with me every night to the House & goes to bed about eleven oclock.  He sits in the gallery & listens to the speeches & tells me at night all that was done & said by the members.  

	How happy I shall be to meet you & the children again.  My name is still spoken of for high honors.

	General Martin sent me a large bundle for you.  I do not know its contents.  Yours, B.F. Perry

I have commenced on a sheet of Willies & have not time to get anything else.

	The Rail Road Bill giving $75,000 to the Greenville company has just passed the House for the road.

	I did not dine with the governor yesterday.  It was late when I got from the House.  

	Elford returns today & will reach home Sunday evening.

	I will write you a long letter next mail.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The weather is bad & I will write you a long letter instead of going to church.   I am really ashamed of some of my letters to you.  They were written so hurriedly & so badly & so briefly.  But I have been hard pressed for time to eat my meals.

	The other evening after finishing the four lines sent you by last mail I went to the State House immediately, was waited on by General Adams, General Foster, & Col. Gist, who informed me that they had been appointed on a committee to know whether I would permit my name to be used as a candidate for the President of the Bank,  I told them that they could vote for me if they saw proper, but that I would not be a candidate,  The next morning two communications appeared in the daily Papers announcing the fact that my friends intended to run me in opposition to Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore.  This acted like a bombshell had been thrown into the ranks of the Bank men.  My bank friends came to me from all parts of the House & insisted that I would not permit my name to be used.  Col. Williams, Thompson, & others were urgent.  I replied to them that I was no candidate, but I could not permit the anti Bank party from voting for me.  

	Col. Williams said they were going to run me for Governor & he was afraid it would hurt my prospects.  Reed of Anderson, Henry of Spartanburg told me they were going to run me for Speaker next winter.  I have no idea of being elected President of the Bank.  But I do not know if it will hurt me to be voted for.  In fact Col. Gist intended that it would only be the means of the anti Bank party supporting me for something else.   

	I have written out my speech & will probably give it to the Carolinian tomorrow.  I has been a good deal complimented by both bank men & anti bank men.  The question has been lost in both Houses.  Smith & Earle voted for the Bank in the House, & Col. Ware in the Senate.  In the Senate there was a great deal of excitement.  It is thought that a difficulty has taken place between Col. Memminger and Col. Marshall.

	I have just packed up my clothes & sent off my trunk by Col. Irbys wagon as far as Laurens C.H.  The roads are in a horrid condition & I was assured Skylock would not be able to pull Willie, myself, & trunk through the mud.  From Laurens the roads will be better.  I shall leave here Thursday morning & reach home Saturday evening.  

	Tell Anna that her birds are doing well.  I went to see them yesterday in their new cage.  How I shall get them home is doubtful.  The weather is so cold I am afraid they will freeze.  The man from whom I purchased them, has gone back to Charleston & taken with him the others.

	Whilst I was looking & selecting the birds, two very plain & homely looking females came into the shop & made purchases of birds.  On their leaving the shop I was told they were Miss John Preston & old Mrs. Hampton.  I took them for some very common shopkeepers wives.

	I hope to hear from you tonight, & if anything occurs tomorrow I will write you again.  Tell Frank I am going to buy him a Californian hat.  Willie will have to wear it home, & put his cap in the buggy box.  Tell Fanny I shall bring her cocoa cakes.  If it was in my power to bring your bonnet safely I would do so.  I will look for one tomorrow & see whether I can find one very pretty.  If so I may risk its carriage some how.  You know it gives me great pleasure to grattify all of your wishes.  Families bonds have been more devoted than myself, & my�have taken so much pleasure in grattifying the wishes of their better half.  

	I will now conclude.  Willie has been reading his testament & is now talking to me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	
       I have just returned from the State House & left the Legislature in session.  It is now near eleven oclock in the night.  We have just eaten supper & Willie is going to bed.  Tomorrow I shall be so busy as not to be able to write.  I have not yet got through with my cases in court.

	I hope to leave here Thursday morning & reach home Saturday night.  But it is possible that I may be detained here a day longer ibn consequence of the court.  If so I shall dislike it very much.

	The election of President of the Bank takes place tomorrow.  I have no hope of being elected but will get a great many votes.  They are given to me by the anti Bank men as a compliment & as such I shall appreciate them.

	Dr. Metts of Union who has been electioneering for me told me that Elias Earle said he never wanted to defeat anyone as bad in his life.  He is a most pitiable fool & seldom votes on any question without consulting Col. Irby, & never votes differently from him.

	He & � Powell are enough to disgrace Greenville as her representatives.  He wrote Ben Yancey a letter wishing to be friends and promised never more to interfere with his brother.  Yancey showed me the correspondence.          

	There is likely to be a difficulty between Col. Manning & Col. Marshall.  It was said this morning a challenge had passed.  This originated out of the Bank question.  

	Col. Ware & Smith are both going for the Bank.  The Bank is lending money to the members of the Legislature.  Reed got $900 last winter.  In this way the Bank is buying up the members.  I think Elias Earle got money last fall.

	I have just purchased for you the prettiest bonnet you ever saw.  White is all the fashion�nothing else worn by the Bell[e]s here.  And I think you prettier than any of them, & therefore to wear what the young ladies wear.  It is a beautiful bonnet with flowers.  I thought it would look so sweetly on you and the idea crossed my mind how sweet a kiss would be from your rosy lips encircled by the bonnet.  But I must now make you vain.  With your new shawl & bonnet on, I have you now in my minds eyes and how I should like to clasp in my own, the figure thus presented to my mind.

	The price of the bonnet was $6.00.  How I shall carry it up is doubtful.  Tell Frank I have bought him a Californian hat $1/12 cts.  I have also bought him a pretty little bow to shoot with�also one for Willie 25 cts each.  Tell Anna her birds are doing well & singing sweetly.  Tell Fanny I have bought her two pounds of cocoa nut cakes�also one pound of all sorts of candy and one pound of molasses candy to give the servants &c.  I have bought a Prayer Book $2.00�new razors & strap 4.50.

	I shall buy a little hat for Vardry perhaps.  I enquired for a chair such as Susan wished and the man had none.

	My money is about gone.  I have recd only $6.00 from Col. Grisham since I have been here.  Dr. George I have not seen.  I have spent the money given me by Chancellor Dunkin.  But hope that my pay Bill will pay my tavern bill�have some left.

	I hope tomorrow evening to hear from you again & I may then write if I have time.

	Col. Tom Butler spoke suspiciously of Anne Williams.  He had been to see her�so had Jones.  Poor woman I am afraid she is lost or will be before she leaves here.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry   
	
P.S. I thought I had covers for my letter, but sent them all off in my trunk.  I must therefore take another sheet of paper & will continue my letter.

	Butler informed me that Lewis Thurston & Hetty Doyley were to be married this week�that Lewis was greatly rejoiced at Moores marriage.  I saw Moore here the other day & he looked sad & seemed sad.  Butler says he has no principle�that he & Mrs. Thurston were engaged to be married.  She was expecting him the night the night the news came of his wedding.

	Tom Butler also informed me that � Butler the brother of Mrs. McBee had been off with Miss Gillison worth $50,000 & got married.

	My speech will be published next week.  I gave it to the printer today.  John Cunningham has written out his also.

	I must now go to bed & will add another post script tomorrow.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

P.S. Wednesday 3 oclock.  I have just returned from the Court House & have disposed of all my cases�two of them I had to continue.  So I shall start home in the morning.  Col Townes goes up in the stage & will beat me one day.

	I recd fifty nine votes for President of the Bank & Elmore 100.  This is about as I supposed the result would be.  It is a compliment & I regard it as such.  This is the voluntary offering of the members.

	I am delighted to return home again & see you & the children once more & forget in my domestic happiness all the excitement of politics.  

	Willie has been all day in the State House by himself.  He is now with me eating apples & we are going to look at the birds.  

	The weather is now good but looks like a change.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before the Stage leaves.  This I do because you requested it, not because I have anything worth writing about.

	Butler Thompson came down in the stage yesterday and told me he saw you and the children at church on Sunday.  That Frank was misbehaving, & your were giving him looks & trying to regulate him.  He also said he saw you riding in the carriage on Monday as I�him.  This I presume is a mistake, as Reuben was ploughing�unless you were riding in your mothers carriage.

	Dr. Watts informs me that Mrs. Cunningham & Miss Pamela are well in Philadelphia & will remain there till May next.  Pamela�s health is greatly improved, but Mrs. Cunningham is in bad health.
He also informs me that Mr. Cunningham had gone to Augusta to try to settle a difficulty between Yancey and Moroni [Moragne] editor of the Edgefield Paper.  They were to have fought last week.

	General Thompson is expected here this morning in the stage & I suppose Butler came down to meet him.  

	It is doubtful when I return home.  I do not think that we shall reach Dr. Andersons cases in time to try them this court.  There will be an extra court here the week of the Greenville court.  None of my cases have yet been reached.

	There is an extraordinary murder case to be tried this morning.  A Brother for the murder of a brother.  It is said the killing was in self defence.  They were quarrelling & the father was the only person present & now the principal witness.

	I hope you are getting on well with your household.  I wish you would write me by Thursday�s mail.  

	I saw here Mr. Fulk the father of one of those young ladies at Dr. Simmons.  He was very particular in his enquiries about the school.  Butler Thompson said to me that the same enquiries were of him& he could not in his conscience say much in favour of the school.  He thinks Dr. Simons the greatest bore & fool in the village, & that the girls will learn nothing & that it is most astonishing how he has succeeded in humbugging the community.

	My old friends here are glad to see me & some of them persuading me to offer again for congress.  

	Tell Fanny I have made no money for her yet.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I ought not to write you again.  Yesterday morning I went with Butler Thompson to the Post office after the mail had arrived & was greatly disappointed in not receiving a letter from you.  I hope however you are all well.

	It is probable I may be at home tomorrow night.  Dr. Andersons cases have been postponed, till the extra court, which will sit the week after Greenville court.  The case of Dillard will be tried today & if so I shall leave tomorrow.

	I was employed by Sullivan to assist him in a new case of Dr. Andersons on Wednesday.  I have also had some goods luck in receiving money.  Mr. Kennedy paid me Fifty dollars.  Dr. Teague about fifty & his Brother fifty more.  Col. Irby has not said anything about his note & I am glad of this.

	There is a great deal of business in court, more than can be finished in another week.  The case of Dillon is good for a good fee, though I am afraid it will be good for nothing else so far as my client is concerned.  Miss Mory appears in bad health since her misfortune, but it is said is to be�, as soon as her case is determined.  If she worried before it would abate & she has sacrificed her sister to maintain her action.

	I am very anxious to be at home again, & see you & the children & the improvements going on in the way of stables &c.

	Next Tuesday week or Monday there is to be at Greenville the most costly & magnificent circus that has ever been in the upper part of South Carolina.  Tell Willie the ponies are beautiful, & there is a whole circus full of them, & they play al sorts of tricks.  I am sorry shall not be at home top see the children enjoying the sight.  I shall be at Anderson court.

	I was invited to Major Wrights the other evening but did not go.  The Judge has been talking about hospitality &c.  We must invite him either to dinner or to tea during court.

	Kiss the children for me.  I am indeed happy that I am not in Washington & now I would not be induced to enter Congress, as I have said to my friends here this week, who have pressed me to offer again.  There is no place like home & we value it more when absent from those we love.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry
