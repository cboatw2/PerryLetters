My dear Liz 	

	I received one letter from Fannie last week & suppose you have all gone to Glencoe.  I hope you got there safely.  The roads & weather must have been bad Wednesday since we have had fine weather.  Now it looks as if we were going to have a change.  There has been only one wet day since I left Greenville & hope the servants have done a great deal of work.  Tell Alfred I shall expect to see all that old field cleaned up & the oats & rye sowed.

	The Legislature have agreed to adjourn Friday but it is very doubtful whether we can do so.  I shall go home Saturday anyhow.  We are getting on very pleasantly.  I have written three letters for the Enterprise giving an account of what we are doing & I will not repeat in this letter.

	I suppose you will send Hext down this week.  I will go up to Glencoe as soon as I get through with the Federal court which will be only a day or two if I do not have to return to the Legislature.  

	Dr. Croft & Col McCullough are both absent.  Boyce has to return Saturday.  If the Legislature does not adjourn Greenville will be unrepresented in the House unless Crofts son gets better.  He was�days since when I heard from Dr. Croft.

	I have seen your uncle & Col. O�Hanlon.  They both enquired after you & the children most kindly.

	I dined with Yeadon the day after I came down & spent a pleasant evening.  He looks badly.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte.  Very few ladies�in the gallery this session.

	The election of Judges will not come on this session.

	I was introduced to General [Leonidas] Polk�today.  He did not stop in Columbia.  He came down from Greenville�to Asheville next to see his family�had seen them only once in two years.  He is a fine looking gentleman & pleasant courteous manners.  

	I have nothing to write you & hardly expect you will receive this letter before I return home.  

	I hope you are enjoying yourselves at Glencoe  & that Fannie is pleased with the mountains�Hext & Hayne & Ben amusing themselves & getting their lessons.

	I saw Mr. H� who told me that he would assist�in purchasing�Bell for Glencoe�.

	I suppose you have�the beef & the hogs & are�.  When you want more beef steak you can kill the other beef & salt�.  If you can buy pork up there at 25 cts per pound you may purchase�.

       Give my love to all the children�.  I hope your mother & Anne are doing well & have got supplies on hand to keep them from starving�.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	We reached home last evening about half past five all safe, pleasant day, met a great many soldiers returning.  Bill Fisher & two others took dinner with us on the road.  They all abused Elford terribly.

	Just as we were getting out of the carriage at the kitchen Allston Hayne rode up & took supper with us.  He returned ai uncle Allstons & went home today.

	After supper a man from Anderson came to get me to issue a Bail Writ & I made five dollars in cash Sunday night.

	Today my office has been full of loafers & some Clients.  I booked five dollars today.  I got ten bushels of corn last night of Pool & Hext brought it home this morning, so I have somethiong to feed horses on.  I have written to Newberry C.H. for corn today again.  Times are terrible.  Susan paid eight  per bushel for Irish potatoes to plant.  Get all the�potatoes you can and as soon as you can.  I�to plant a great many at Gelncoe.

	Harry has prepared one bed in the garden for potatoes & I will plant tomorrow if the weather is good.

	I bought a parcel of garden seed of Watson today & will send you a part of them.  Sow the lettuce & one paper of radishes.  Get some more cabbage seed if you can but I bought two papers of Watson.  Sow the turnips as soon as you please.  Broadcast on one of your beds after manuring it.

	It is now raining half after six in the evening & Hext may not get off in the morning.  

	They all express great surprise at your staying at Glencoe.  Duncan told me everybody was about to st�, says Maj. Mauldin chose to sell negoers to live.

	Tell Carruth I have got his receipt for the five thousand dollars Bond & I paid eighty dollars.

	I am writing in my office & waiting for the mail.  The cars do not come till half after six & leave half after four in the morning.

	I recd a letter from Willie which I will send you.  I feel glad I am at home once more but wish you were here with me.  After fixing your garden you must come back & stay here.  In the summer we will go up there & live.  I have been very busy today & have not read the newspapers at all so I have no news to write you.

	Anne took dinner with us.  Midss Gordon paid me a long visit today.  She wishes tyo go back home & wanted me to asist her in getting a passport.  She says she is spending all of her money & soon will have nothing.

	I must now close & go to the House & see Hext & Fannie about getting everything ready & send after the papers.

	I do not know what time Iwill go to Charleston.  The city is still threatened.  I feel like not stirring from home again for a long time.  I loose so much by being�.

	If you see any of Zach Wards people engage five hundred pounds of bacon & lard.  Send Hext to Dr. [W.A.] Mooneys when they can & plow for the cherry trees or let Alfred walk down some Sunday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This has been a busy day and I have only a few moments to write.

	I was surprised to see Alfred, & yet I was glad to hear from you.  I thouight a great deal about you & how Hext got home.  To hear from you all  that you are well is enough to excuse Alfred in my feelings.

	I made twenty dllars today by advice & drawing papers.

	I will not go to Charleston.  In fact I cannot spare the trime.

	You must get all the Irish potatoes you can.  I wish to plant a field of them.

	I spoke to Ward about the Bacon.  I wish five hundred pounds of Bacon & one hundred of Lard or one hundred & fifty.

	The corn you have ought to do us.  I fear we acnnot haul it from Gosnel[l]s.

	I am glad Fisher is going to make the fence.  Let him commence next to Carruths.

	I hope McClure will go on with his clearing.  I don�t mind the Smoke House except the hauling.

	I would have sent you more seeds but it is too soon yet to sow them.  

	I cant get sage nor tomatoes but will do so hereafter I hope.

	I have no news to write.  If I had time to study I could write you a long letter but I have no time.

	I will try & come up soon & see how you come on.

	I planted potatoes Saturday & tomorrow will plant a variety of seeds.  I bought onion buttons today.  I have plenty of cabbage seed.  

	I have just got the mail, no news.  Isaac Hayne writes me to sell his negro for him on sale day.

	We all wish you at home very much & I think you may come back with me when I go up in good weather.

	Your mother, Susan & Fannie have all written to you & left me nothing to say.

	Do let the men go on with their oats & clearing & take care of the corn. It ought to do us.  If I could haul from Gosnel[l]sI would take his corn at $1.50 but I do not think that can be done.  

	There is great talk of Bacon rolled with the coast salt spoiing & I shall see Zach Wood tomorrow,

	McClanahan has provided some bacon.

	I have bought fifty bushels of corn from Newberry.

	Take care of yourself & children my dear wife.  Your affec[tionate] husband. B.F. Perry

In haste

	Harrison has just brought your letter & homespun.  He says his waggon will call in the morning.  Fannie will send you a jug of molasses & some strawberry plants.  

	I was glad to hear from you but would have been still better pleased if Alfred had got home before you wrote, so that you could have replied to our letters.

	I am glad to learn you are likely to get bacon & lard from Maj. Carruth.  Word is a hard customer.  He thinks of Charleston prices.  I think we can make out with the corn we have at Glencoe.  But I am willing to buy 50 or 100 bushels if near & can be hauled.  Sam McClanahan has promised to let me have bacon at 60 cents.

	I am gardening, have planted all the beds where we had Irish potatoes last year again in potatoes & in addition the whole bed on the right of the gate.  I hope here I shall have plenty.  The potatoes in the old beds were almost enough to replant them.  They were round & very large.  I have planted one bed in English Peas & another partly in cabbage seed, lettuce & radishes.  Today I have Charles, Charlotte & Rose working in the garden.

	I made ten dollars yesterday but nothing today.  I sent by Grady to Charleston to sell for me $2000 of South Carolina Bills.  They are worth 30 cts premium & this will make me $600.  I have $1200 more but did not send it.   I am going to invest my confederate Bills in a note of�H�me for $1606.47.  I took a note the other day from Collins on Scott & McCullough for $500.00.  I am trying to get rid of all my money in notes.

	There is no news.  I recd a letter from Col. S.O. Goodlett last night wishing me to come on to Wilmington to defend him but I cannot go.  I went to see his daughter the other day.  Gen. Evans has been acquitted & I fear Goodlett will fare badly.

	We are getting on pretty well.  But wo� you at home very much.  I will probably come up & see you next week before I start on the circuit.

	I hope you make the servants clear & plow the oats as fast as possible.  I hope Bill Fisher has commendced the fence & that McClures going on with his clearing.  Don�t take the servants from their work for anything.  You & Mary must manage the garden & Hext go on mess�.

	Edward is sick with sore throat & Hoke is attending him.  

	Edward Stokes is expected home this evening.  I saw Captain Williams the other day.  

	Old Mr. Pinckney was at the Mansion House last night.  He says Buncombe is very cold.  The coldest winter climate he ever saw except Boston.

	I wish to plant the most of the field around Alfreds House in potatoes.  Get all the seed you can, Irish & Sweet.

	In great haste, your affectionate husband.  Give my love to all the children, B.F. Perry

	Harrison came yesterday with your letters, all of which I read twice & was delighted to hear from you.  I am very anxious to see you all & really it is a great deprevation to be separated from you.  As soon as the weather is good I will go up & stay two or three days with you.  But you muast come down as soon as possible.  

	Fannie went down with Mrs. Barnett Cleveland yesterday just before your letters came & will probably stay till tomorrow.  Annie went also.  Fannie is verey anxious for you to come home.  She wished the other day that I should go & bring you down.  

	The household is getting on pretty well.  I have not seen Anne for two weeks.  Your mother carries to her meals.  Edward is getting better,  He had a rising in his throat which is so prevalent.Harry is spading up the garden.  Charlotte has hauled�manure one or two days.

	I will send you the thread or spun yarn by Moss.  The cost of no. 9 was $3.50 & the cost of no. 10 was $4.00  a bunch.  There are 16 Bunches, 10 of no. 10 & 6 of no. 9.  Sister brought your cotton bats, ten pounds more thatn you sent for.

	I have got 306 pounds of Bacon of Sam McClanahan at 60 cts per lb.  I bought 61  pounds of buttrer of a Buncombe waggon at 65 cts a pound.  It is very fine butter, but a little rancid or strong.  But it is cheaper than lard.  I had to pay 75 cts for lard & bought five dollars worth.  We are now eating turnip salad & hog jowls.  I still have beef.  Mr. Moore bought 100 bushels of corn for me in Abbeville at $2.00 per bushel.  It will be here next week.

	If you can get corn at $2.00 [per] bushel, engage 100 bushels.  Corn is now selling here at $2.85 & 2.50 per bushel.  Engage the corn at once.  If you can buy M� Carroll�s Bacon at 50 or 60 cts get it.

	The yankees commenced their movements towards Savannah the other day & bombarded Fort McCallister two days & quit.  They did no harm.  [Earl] Van Dorn gained a great victiry over the yankees in Tennessee. Killed & wounded 1000 , took 3000 prisoners &c.  His loss being heavy.  

	I have heard nothing from Willie saince Ed Stokes came.  They are now recruiting & following their�in the valley of Virginia.  Dr. � Williams came back the other day,.  He has an appointment in the Hospital at Atlanta Georgia   

	I have got some more garden seeds which I will  bring up.

	I have had no business lately oif any consequence.  Your aunt Sarah made her will the other day & wrote it herself.  I don�t know its contents.  I made $700 by my sale of S.C. Bills.

	Tell Frank Fisher to stay at home till sent for.

       I hope Hext, Hayne & Ben are saying their lessons every day.

	I sold Isaac Haynes man for $1400 & sent him the money.  At Brocks sale cows sold for $90.00, corn 85 cts per bushel, plates $100 a piece, bed quilts & counterpanes $15.00 a piece.

	Make haste my dear wife & come down.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Fannie has just written you a long letter & told you everything so I have nothing to write about.

	Willie was going up to see you Wednesday but Col. Butler wrote him to meet him in Columbia that day.  He returns tomorrow & will go up Saturday or Sunday.  When he returns I will go up.  Did not go to Pickens court.  There was no court & will be now at Greenville next week. �on the circuit.  I have been working five or ten dollars every day since my return.  But we stand in need of a great deal of money to pay for corn at $2.90 & bacon at 75 cts.  I am afraid it will take Alfred a long time to haul the corn.  That is as bad as paying for it.

	I got 100 bushels corn from�the other day costing me $2.20 a bushel.  I have fifty bushels engaged in Newberry.

	I hope the old field is finished ploughing.  Let them plough as much as they can.

	I cannot get nails.  The smokehouse will have to be built without nails.  But I will try to get them.

	Willie goes back Monday two weeks 6th day of April.  He brought 105 dismounted men with him to get horses.  It will take them 30 days to return on horseback.  Wiley came with him & will go back with him.  They will ride to one of the mens houses to let them go by the�.  Wiley looks well & has behaved well.  Willie is in good health.

	The rumor is that Charleston was to be attacked this day but no�have yet come although it is ten oclock in the night.  No news yesterday of any great importance.  The yankees attacked Port Hudson on the Mississippi & were repulsed.

	Spartan Goodlett was here & returns tomorrow.  He has been restored to his command but has not had his�yet.

	We all want you & the children to come home very much.  You must come back with me.  Plant your garden at once.  � will finish it.

	Goodnight.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

	Mr. Barton surprised me very much yesterday.  I thought something had happened to some of you.  He staid with me last night & this morning found his money at Holdmans.   A little girl found the Bill whilst sweeping the floor.  I am very glad for it would have been a serious loss to the poor man.

	Willie returned from Columbia Friday night & will go to Glencoe tomorrow or next day if the weather is good.  Perhaps I may go with him.  If so you & the children had betteer come down with us & go back again.  But I don�t think you ought to leave the children there by themselves.  But I will write more about this when Willie goes up.

	We are all well & doing well.  But we have had bad weather & cant do much in the garden.

	This is court week but we shall have no Judges & no court. I would like to come up & stay but I am making something here almost evrery day & my little helps these hard times.

	You had better engage the lard of Carruth.  I should like to have a bushel or two more of Irish potatoes.  I will send money by Willie to pay for the corn.   I think I can make out for money although I have bought Ha� note.  � Williams endorsed the note which makes it beyond dispute and really I do not wish to keep Confederate money or Confederate Bonds if I can get nothing good.

	I tried to get nails & found them one dollar a pound.  I will not puerchase at that price except enough to make the door of the Smioke House.  The roof can be put on very well without nails.  Have the cracks betqween the�wall daubed with clay & the smoke kouse will do very well for the present.  You ought to have the floor made of�& then dirt as�thrown over the�.  This will make a very nice floor & the best for a smoke House.  The�you can pick up around the�house or take those you have haulked out the garden.  Don�t hinder the men from clearing & ploughing.  They must not lose a day.  I am sorry the hauling of the corn will iake so long to haul, but that cannot be helped.  We must have corn.  Tell Alfred to be very careful of the corn & use it sparingly.  

	I have nothing more to write you, & Mr. Barton has just come into my office.   

	I want to see you & the children very much & it is a great deprevation to be without ouy.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. No war news of any great consequence.  A fight on the Rappahannock where Willie has been & 250 of our men killed, wounded & captured.  No attack on Charleston yet.  To the West we have been successful in two or three places.  But the enemy is getting a very large army in Tennessee. There will be bloody battles fought this spring everywhere.  Willie will not get back to the army till the last of April.

	I send you by Willie $250.00 to pay for the corn.  If you come down with Willie leave the money with Barton & send Jackson word that the money is there.

	If you think the children will not run wild in the mountains, or get hurt, or not be taken care of, you had better come down in the Buggy with Willie & stay till he goes then I will go up  with you & stay awhile.  If you think best, you & the children can come down in the carriage & let John come & carry the horses back.  Alfred & Johnny can be employed  in clearing on the branch below Alfreds house.  I am willing to any arrangement you may make.

	If you do not come down with Willie I will go up as soon as Willie comes back & bring you down in the Buggy & then when Willie goes off carry you back & stay awhile & then all come down

	Fannie is very anxious for you to be at home again and I think it best you should be with her.  

	I am doing some business every day.  Yesterday I drew a Bill in Equity for Thomas.  The day before I took a note for an old fee of $250.  But I am getting scarce of money.  I bought a sack of salt of Holdman yesterday for $31.25.

	General Thompson sent me a demijar full of the finest syrup I ever tasted and a parcel of sausages from Florida.  Barret will send me three bags of flour soon, one bag as a present.  McClanahan has promised yam potatoes so I don�t want Bartons.

	If Willie comes home Friday or Saturday I will go up on Sunday unless you come with him.  I can stay there Monday and bring you down Tuesday & then you will have five or six days to staY with Willie before he goes off.  Then we can go back Monday afterwards & stay a week & all come down.  But do as you please about it.  

	No news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	The morning I left you I met McMakin who told me the enemy had all left Charleston.  I stopped
at Dr. Mooneys to see the papers, but he had taken them off with him.  They will no doubt return again.  I stopped at Wearns but there is no chance of getting any yarn for several weeks.  The contrary report was false.

	When I reached home I found Hey� waiting to consult me about his distillery.  He is arrested & will pay me handsomely.  Whilst talking to him in my office, . Fannie came running in to tell me Willie had come!  I was very much surprised & gratified to see him & know that he was safe.  This will be gratifying news to you.  He was pleased with his trip to Charleston & told Miss McCord that when the yankees heard his cavalry had come down they all ran off!

	Willie left this morning for Columbia & will stay there till Thursday when he goes on horseback to Virginia.  Edward Stokes came up last night & will go back Monday morning.  Last night they had a big frolic at Col. Goodletts.  Fannie will write you all about that.

	The Buggy broke [word obscured] I came down & had to be [word obscured] the shop.  Hext went today after the flour to Westmore�.  He will go to Glencoe in the morning.  I am writing you now about noon as I am at leisure.

	The day after I arrived here I filed Bill for Maj. Clo� against Pleasant Jenkins for a negro woman.  I have made five or ten dollars every day since I came back,  Today I have been employed in an Equity casie in Pickens for Dr. Hunter against Hunt.

	I had to give Willie $250 more to carry him  and his men on to Virginia,  

	I have planted two beds in the garden in cabbage plants & one in beans since I came back.  Cnarlotte hoed out the Irish potatoes.  

	Vardry & ten or fifteen boys ran off & went to Charleston.  Vardry has joined�Regiment.  The others came home on furlough last night & say thery have joined Holl� artillery.  Susan seems satisfied with Vardrys running off & the McBees are all pleased at it,

	The weather is fine and I hope you have had the negroes well employed  in ploughing corn & breaking the land.  I have bought three pounds of nails.  Let Fisher nail plank over the big cracks in the smoke house & he can daub the small ones without plank.  I stopped at Earles mill & left $10 for flour.  Get your meat from Carroll.  It is selling at $1 per pound down here.  Ste� had his house broken open the other night $2500 worth of  tobacco stolen & some meat!  No discovery as to the thief.  Held� has sold Andy for $2500 & he goes to Augusta.  

	As soon as your smoke house is finished & the corn planted come down.  You had better drive Charley in the Buggy.  Bill does better in the wagon which goes slowly.  Let them take two days & bring provisions with them for horses & negroes on the road.

	We are all doing very well, but would do better with you.
	
	No war news of any consequence.  I will now close as Hext can tell you what I have omitted to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Brandy Station

Dear Pa

	I have not written you for some time past, because I have had nothing to write about.  I will write you a few lines today to let you know how I am getting on.  Yesterday orders came to cook this days rations and in the evening we took up march for Brandy Station about 5 miles; and we all expected to move across the Rappahannock this morning, but contrary to all expectations we came back about a mile and are striking a camp.  What is in the wind I am unable to tell.  Something is up though Hoods, McLaws� moved up this way a day or two ago and are now about Kellys� Ford.  I thought yesterday that a forward movement was about being made by Lee and that the Cavalry and several divisions of Infantry had been sent up here to cross but this morning there is a report that fighting is again on down about Fredericksburg.  This report and our delaying seems to show that the move is a feint or has been interupted by an attack from the enemy.  Gen. Lee, I suppose is the only one who knows all about it.  On Friday last we had a grand review of all the Cavalry under Stuart�s Command and a big show it was.  Five Brigades of Cavalry were on the Field and we charged about considerably.  Stoneman wont be able to make another raid while we have our present Cavalry force about here.

	My horses are improving a good deal and if we don�t have any hard duty to do for awhile, I think Wiley will bring them out to what they were when I was home.  I would like to send my sorrel horse home if I had an opportunity, but I would like to buy another first.  I think he may recover his eyes.  They are looking pretty well at present.  The horse I spoke of getting for Vardry is too small for me. 

        Joe Ferguson joined us yesterday at last, looking very well.  Jno. Ferguson read me a portion of his letter to you.  I hope you will not get him any position which will take him from our Company.  He was grossly insulted by Col. Butler but he can come back into the Company whenever he wishes to, and get out of his present position in the Commissary�s Department.  I am sorry that my boots cost so much but I need them as my present ones wont last much longer and when a man gets out of boots here there is no chance of getting any more this side of Richmond.  I don�t believe I need any clothes.  Joel Ketchum left my Carpetbag in Richmond, so I have only a change alone which is enough.  I can send for my carpetbag when these I have wear out.

	It is very cloudy & it is doubtful whether�will go or not this morning.  But I will write you a line or two.  

	At eight oclock I meet Col. Martin.  At ten court meets.  Judge O�Neall came last night & says he cannot sit more than one day.

	I was very busy yesterday & shall be more so today.

	We have no particulars of the great battle at Gettysburg in Pen[n]sylvania.  It is likely Wilie was not in it.

	I don�t think it will be possible for me to come up to Glencoe.  The Board of Trustees of the College are ordered to meet on Monday night.  But I shall not go�.

	Tell Alfred he will have to keep chopping in the corn till it is clear if it takes him to September.  I want all the sproats killed & grass cleared out so that I may sow rye in the field up toward Bil Fishers.

	As soon as the weather is settled & the wheat perfectly dry he must haul it & fence it in so that the horses may have a pasture.

	Let Mary & Lindy & Charlotte all chop sproats in the corn every day till it is cleared out.  Then fix your garden & road & yard.  Keep them in the field first.

       Col. Martin & I have fixed the following prices�wheat $3 bushel�Flour $18 Barrel�corn $2 bushel�rye $2�Bacon 75 cts & 70 cts�Lard 75 cts�Beef 30 cts pound�pork 50 cts�Peach brandy $5 gallon�Whiskey $4.00�oats 1.50 &c. &c.

Dear Pa

	For the first time in nearly a month I have an opportunity of writing you.  For the past four weeks we have been on a constant go.  We crossed the Potomac just two weeks ago tonight and have had a busy time of it ever since, and there is a prospect of its lasting some time yet.  But I am quite well and so is Wiley.  One of my horses is a little lame but not much.

	You have no doubt heard of the battle of Gettysburg which I think was about a drawn one.  We all thought we were going back into Virginia a few days ago, but now I expect we will remain and there will in all probability be another great battle in a day or two, so says Gen. Lee in a General Order published this morning to the Army.  Our loss in the Gettysburg battle was heavy, but the men are in good spirits and ready to meet the enemy again.  Our Regiment has had over a dozen fights and skirmishes in the last four weeks, and for the past 34 days not a day has passed without some portions of the Cavalry having a fight.  In the Gettysburg fight we were on the left and had a big Cavalry fight.  Gen. Hampton was pretty severely wounded, two sabre cuts on the head and a shot in the leg.  Our Regiment did good service in the fight.  Tom Butler was killed and several wounded.  But ours has been a lucky Reg[iment] so far.  We have been shelled over and over and suffered very little.  Gen. Hampton I suppose has gone home by this time.  Col. Baker of the 1st N.C. is now in Command of the brigade, and is a very good officer.

	I am writing in a very great hurry and don�t know when I will have an opportunity of sending off this letter.  If I had time I would give you a detailed account of our experience for the past month, how we went within 10 miles of Washington and captured over two hundred six�trains with the wagons and about a thousand yanks and negroes together.  But time is short, and we are moving nearly all the time.  We fared first rate in Pennsylvania.  The citizens gave us plenty of Bread and milk, and we took all the horses we could lay hands on.  Our Cavalry so far as I saw behaved very well, but the Infantry they say plundered a great deal.  I must close.  Stokes and all our Company are quite well.  Give my love to all.

	The news from Charleston was not so bad last night as we expected.  But the fall of Charleston is pretty certain in the course of ten days.  The fight on Saturday was a very hard one & a great many killed.  It was renewed Sunday night & we have not heard the result.  If the Enemy was driven from Morris Island, Charleston is safe�if not the city is gone.

	Your mother spoke to me last night about�going up with Hext.  She�was unwell  & you promised that she might go up.  Hext can bring her back in the buggy with Bill when you wish her to return.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  Lees army is in a critical situation but I think will succeed in getting out,

	I miss you very much & long for you to return.  But have no doubt you are making the servants do better thao if you were here.  I must try & come up & see you.  But the cxommissioners meet today & will be in session a long time.  I will send the�& hope it will reach you safely.

Dear Pa

	I wrote you the foregoing letter a week ago and have had no chance to send it and so will write you a few lines more today.  I was mistaken in my prophesies�but it was owing to the yanks not wanting to fight for Gen. Lee offered them battle for two days, and on the third night our army crossed the Potomac again and here we are again in old Virginia.  I don�t know what we are going to do.  Some think we are going back to the Rappahanock but at present we are picketing around this place.  Day before yesterday the yankees ran in our Pickets and took 11 men from Capt. McFie�s & Chasnut�s  Companies.  I hear this morning that they are fighting at Charleston, and we heard several days ago that Vicksburg was taken, but some don�t believe it yet.

	I am quite well  and so is Wiley.  Gen. Stuart with part of the cavalry drove the Yankee Cavalry across the river at Sheperdstown.  There are still some of them in front of us, but I don�t think they are across the river in much force.  I have no news to write you.  The men who went home for horses are expected here today.  We have had a great deal of wet weather here lately, but we have got so used to rain that we don�t mind it.  I have no time to write hardly.  All the Company are well.

	Give my love to all and write to me often.  I have not got but two letters in the past month; the mails are very irregular.  Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Pa

	I wrote you last, I believe from Martinsburg.  We reached this place yesterday, and I hope we will have a few weeks rest, for our horses particularly need it.  They have fared very hard indeed, having scant feed and hard riding.  Whether we will remain here and have the Rappahanock for a time or go near Richmond depends I suppose on the movements of the enemy.  If they try the Pennisula route we will have to go below Richmond to meet them.  At present most of our army is in this neighborhood, and the yankees are across the river.  I have no news to write you.  We found on reaching this place that the horse detachment were here waiting for us, which increases our force a great deal.  Three recruits have come on to our Troop, Thornburg, Cunningham and Earle.  Two men started West, and Good but deserted before they reached us.  Good is certainly a deserter and will be claimed as such by Capt. Williams.  I don�t know yet whether [he] can be considered to have enlisted or not.  They heard of our retreat from Pennsylvania and became disheartened no doubt.  McClanahan brought my boots and left them near Charlottesville where I will be able to get them when I need them which will be soon.  I am bad off in the way of clothes and must try and get my carpetbag which Joel Ketchum left in Richmond, which will furnish me for the remainder of the summer.  I received a letter from you dated the 20th.   I hope now we will be able to have regular mail communication, and hear the news daily.  It is a great deprivation to be cut off from the mails as we were in Pennsylvania  and Maryland.  I think our soldiers generally are glad to get back again to �Old Virginia.�  As for myself I don�t care much where I am, only, we have a more quiet time in Virginia than across the river.  I hope there will be no necessity for your Cavalry Company being called into active service.  I feel rather uneasy, though, about Charleston but I hope she will stand the storm.

	I must close.  Give my love to all.  Bill Beattie and others who have just returned from home say they had quite a lively time while there.

	I think you overate the importance of Vicksburg.  I never thought it would [be] so very serious a loss to the Confederacy.  Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I think Bill is to leave for Fannie & Hext to go up�day.  They went to a Partie at�last night and are tired thoroughly.

	The news last night was very important & I send you a slip of the Guardian.  No Columbia Papers come.  I saw Hawthorn this morning who told me the news in Columbia was that Lee had whipped the yankees in a great battle at Gettysburgh.  We shall hear tonight the particulars.

	I spent Sunday at General Thompsons with Col. Ware & Bolling.  Col. Martin came up & we met Saturday night and again yesterday & will today & continue till Friday.  Martin says the Commissioners all�pay at $8 for every day from our first meeting.

	Court is tomorrow.  I hope to be able to go up next Sunday or Saturday.  We have a�of our company.  We had a public meeting yesterday.

	The horses look pretty well.  I hope the corn will be hoed out in time to make some hay.  They were a long time cutting wheat.  But the rain delayed I suppose.

	I shall be very lonely when Fannie goes.  I miss you very much & am like a fish out of water.  

	I have nothing to write & Fannie & Hext can tell you all the news.  I don�t know which will get there first.  John or Hext.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I kept Hext here today to have Bil shoad & haul wood.  Bill was very much fatigued too.

	I have just recd your letter by Moss.  I could not understand your letter by Hext about the colt.  But since have seen it & will take it.  But Moss says he has sold it to O�Shields.  Pace may decide who shall have the colt, me or O�Shields.  He is a pretty good horse, but the haze in the face..his looks very much.  I don�t think I can sell Bill for anything.  He is worn out.  Let Hext bring Charley down with him.  I will not drive Bill or Monarch again.

	I will go up next Sunday if Hext & Hayne come down on Saturday.

	Judge [Andrew Gordon] Magrath did not come & we have no court.  I recd $260 from J� Sitton for fees in�cases.  I am receiving a little every day from ten to $20.    

	I send you Willies letters.  There is no news.  I saw Col. Butler yesterday.  He looks cheerful & is doing well.

	General Thompson says he spoke in high terms of Willie.  Says he was cool in battle & cares nothing for applaudes.   Said he behave[d] very gallantly in attacking a Regiment with eight men.  Col. Butler came in his carriage this morning to get �The Home Guards men� by�.  I loaned it to him as your�. He enquired about you very kindly.

	Mrs. Dr. Parker made me a visit Saturday about selling her lot in Charleston for $20,000 to [George A.] Trenholm.

	I will send you the newspeprs.  Charleston is not yet taken.  But will be I fear in the course of time.

	I received your letter last evening and was glad to hear Wiley had arrived safely with his horses.  Directly after reading your letter I saw Dr. Rutherford who owns Wileys wife and told him that Wiley would be at his house Wednesday & that he must meet me at Newberry Friday.

	I shall go up Friday & be at home Friday night.  There is nothing likely to be done in the Legislature of importance.  I introduced a Bill this morning to impress provisions for Soldiers families which will pass. 

	You have seen an account of the great fight in Georgia.  We are anxiousy waiting for the final battle.  The victory so far is dearly bought.  But of the greatest importance to the Confederacy.  

	I met you uncle Arthur this morning who wishes to send up two of Pinckney Alstons daughters under my charge as far as Belton.  They have been staying with him, & go to pay a visit to Alston Hayne.  He says they are twins & beautiful young ladies.  

	I am to up today & dine with Mr. Johnson at two oclock.  It is now one oclock.

	Yesterday I had Governor Manning, Speaker Aldridge [Aldrich], & Col. Hayne to take a glass of my whiskey & honey brandy which they enjoyed much.

       The House has taken a recess till five oclock this evening.

       You may send Frank McBee word that I recei[ve]d his letter & bought his Surveying Books, four for ten dollars [page torn] [and] will bring them up with me.

	I will go to see Mrs. LeConte this evening. [Page torn] Boyce is to go here this evening.  Your uncle says he is going to bring the Miss Alstons to the State House tomorrow.

	I did not see Tim �.  I saw Henry Cauble who brings down Vest as a substitute.

	Dr. Croft is asnxious abpout his son who was in the late Battle but has not heard from him.  The Butler Guards were in the battle but not heard from.

	I will write you tonight if anything occurs.

	Alston Hayne gave me the certificate of the Planters & Mechanics Bank & says the other is�in the Bank of SC.  It stands in the name of Hext McColl.  I will enclose you an order for you & Susan & Anne all to sign.  Send it to me & I will send it to your uncle or you enclose it to your uncle & write him a letter.

	I have paid Hext $2.00.  He is enjoying himself but has seen nothing of Col. O�Hanlon.

	Jim Moore will be elected Commissioner tomorrow through thr influence of his wife.

	The Battle of Chickamauga has been disastrious & every thing looks very gloomy.

	I have seen no one except those I wrote you in my last & have nothing to write.  The Senate have agreed to adjourn on the 5th of December.  I will probably be at home anyhow about that time.

Dear Ma

	I will write you a few lines today to let you know how I am getting on.  I have not received a letter from any of you since the 11th which was the date of the last one written by Pa.  My last letter was written just after we had come back from our last expedition when Lee advanced on [George Gordon] Meade.  Since that time we have been quiet, and are now located exactly where we were camped for a long time last winter, and I hope we may be allowed to remain here for some time enjoying quiet.  All we have to do now is to picket along the Rappahanock.  Our Brigade during the absence of Gen. Butler is commanded by Gen. Young who was promoted the other day.  He is a nephew or some relation to E.P. Jones, but notwithstanding is a very good officer and a very gallant one.  I have heard that Jno. Jones is on his staff.  Butler Thompsons son Waddy is one of his orderlies.  It was reported the other day that Gen. Butler had been assigned to the command of a Brigade of Cavalry on the Coast of S.C. and that our Regiment was to be sent there in exchange for Aikens Reg. which would be sent out here.  We were all very much elated at the idea, but it seems to have been only a rumor, for we have heard nothing further of it.  Perhaps it is just as well for us to remain here, for though we have more fighting to do, and are so far from home still we have good health which we might not have there.  Wiley reached me several days ago, with my overcoat & clothes.  I am very much pleased with the coat, which I think will do me good service this winter.

	Another detachment has gone home for horses, among them Blythe, Cooley, Goodlett & Willingham from our company.  If you should have a chance I want you to send me by some of these men or by some one a bushel or so of dried fruit and two or three gallons of homemade molasses.  I would not like to bother any of them with a box, but perhaps they may be bringing on a box for themselves and might put these things along with theirs or two boxes would not be much more bother than one at any rate.  The fruit Wiley brought was a great treat, as was also a canteen of molasses which he brought.

	How are my horses getting along.  Mention them in every letter.

	I will close as I have nothing to write.  Give my love to all. Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I have concluded not to go to Glencoe this morning�you being there�all purposes.  I saw Zach Wood yesterday, and told him I would be at his house Monday morning and I should like to go, but I should loose thirty or forty dollars perhaps by being absent Monday & Tuesday.  I have had profitable business every day since you left.  Absalom Blythe brought me his uncles Will the day you left.  He has left him thirty or forty thousand dollars.  Will Butler was here last night and told me Blythe & Miss Emily Earle were engaged.  She is going to do well.

	Yesterday another Will of McWilliam was brought me.  He had been to see me whilst I was at Spartanburg & then went to Spartanburg to see me.  It was important business.  I made five dollars each day by advice since you have been gone,  So you see I shall have to give up Glencoe to you.

	Last night I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie.  It was directed to you.  He is quite well & wrote Wiley had returned &c.

	There is no news of any importance.  I am glad our sweet potatoes turned out so well.  The lard you got & butter are very acceptable.  It was well to get it at once as Ward might have let it go to someone else.

	I will send you two or three bushels of salt which you can swap off for pork & Beef.  Engage all the port you can.

	Johny had better come down & carry back Charley to haul corn if you can get Bostons waggon & then plough in the wheat with Charley & the colt.  Tell Alfred he had better slip shuck the corn as he pulls it & throws it into the crib without further shucking.  It keeps better & will save time.  There will be enough straw & corn tops to winter the cattle with the shucks as the corn is fed away.  The crib will hold all the corn slip shucked.

	I dined with Mr. Boyce yesterday with Trescot & Wilson.  Fannie dined with Mrs. Dr. Earle.  You must come down Wednesday if a good day.  Charlotte & Sarah went to Williamston this morning.  Louis seems to do well.  We are all well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Recei[ve]d your letter this evening with hat & coat.  I am glad to know you are relieved on the scare of Alfred & Johny.  I had no�about the matter.  I knew the story was false.  I knew there was no motive to run off for the negroes are better than being free & I knew it was impossible for them to make their escape.  I am sure both Alfred & Johny will consider themselves greatly slandered.  

	Polk Mauldin is here sick & goes up in the morning.  He has been in the hospital in Richmond & has a furlough for thirty days.  Mr. Boyce goes up in the morning to bring Mrs. Boyce down on Monday.  I have not yet seen or heard of Col. O�Hanlon.

	You must feed the cow better & she will give more milk.  Don�t write to me about her anymore for I cannot help it.  If we have got a bad bargain it is too late to remedy it.  I acted for the best and that is enough & should satisfy you�.

	I have just returned from the committee & it is now near eleven oclock.  I have no news to write you.  Lee, Fair, Trescot & myself made speeches on the death of Col. James Perrin which you will see in the papers.

	I think I wrote you that General Jones told me that Vardry McBee would be admitted into the military school.  Tell Susan to have him ready.  Tell Fannie I have not yet been to see Hallie C�.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday, & I have just returned from church, eaten my dinner, lighted my pipe, & seated myself to write you a letter�not yet two oclock.  Hext & Charley Janney have gone off somewhere with Duncan Brooks.

	I went with Wallace Thompson to the Catholic church & heard a very learned Sermon on the Bible.  The Priests object seemed to be to place the church above the Bible.  He said it was all uncertain about the Bible out of the church.  It required [page torn] the church history to understand the Bible--portions were specious, left out & altered�portions not to be comprehended &c.  I thought the discourse was altogether a war upon the truth & authenticity & inspiration of the Bible.

	I saw Miss McEl� & the nuns.  I suppose I shall see Simms & his wife here this week.I have been out nowhere.  Governor Pickens has gone & Mrs. Pickens did not meet him here.

	I have written a letter to Col. O�Hanlon for I wish Hext to pay him a visit.  He is learning nothing & seeing nothing here.  He stays all his time with Janneys son  & Duncan Brooks.  I have had my wallet mended & gave Hext yours this morning.  He is very�& pleased with it.  Chancellor Dunkin said he did not recognise Hext in his homespun.  He though [page torn] too aristocrtic to clothe him in homespun.  My hat is very much admired.  Tell Edward I have not yet worn my homespun suit.  The weather is rather cold for it.  

	I was in hopes to have heard from you last night.  I wrote to John to send on the corn forthwith.  If Easleys negroes do not send fodder & shucks you will have to send to Perry Duncan.  If you can buy shucks or fodder do so�you wish beef kill the calf when the weather is cold enough.  Feed the cows well on meal &�slop.

	I wrote Willie a long letter yesterday.  But I see they have had skirmishes lately.  Sparkes is here & is now Lieutenant in a company in the lower country.  He looks well.  I have heard nothing of your uncle Arthur.  I saw Mr. D� Thornwell this morning.    He enquired after your mother & family.

       Col. Ware has been in my room & sat a long time.  But for this I would have written you more.  Tell Fannie I will write her this week.  I have written to Elford to come down this week as our Board will have to revise the prices.  I wish you would go into my office & look in my Paper case to the left of the door as you go in.  The upper part is unlocked�see a box marked �Commissions.�  In it there are two large packages containing lists of prices in an Envelope.  Get these Envelopes & contents & give them to Elford to bring down with him.  I want the prices to govern us in our revision.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just been down to get my letters but was disap[p]ointed�none from you.  It is  now eight oclock in the night.  Hext is asleep.  He will go up in the morning with Duncan Brooks, Nat Butler & Joel Goodlett.  I have bought him a gun which makes him anxious to go home & shoot birds.  He seems so anxious to go that I have concluded it was best for him to return.  He would be lonesome here after Duncan leaves & Col. O�Hanlon may not come up for some time.  Janney says he would not find much to amuse him at the Col�s.  I thought the gun was a good investment of Confederate money & it would give Hext so much pleasure.  Janney says if ever I wish to part with it he will buy it.  But it is a fine gun & will do for all the children as Hext grows too large for it.  It has two barrels & I really thought it worth twice what I gave for it.

	I was invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow & shall do so.  I saw Mrs. LeConte today & she invited me to take tea with her as soon as I could.  She said she would take charge of Fannie when she came down.  Miss Graham expressed  great anxiety to see you & enquired kindly after you.  I went up in the Gallery & sat some time with Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  Miss Lula has not been out.  Mrs. LeConte admired my hat & said it was exactly like one she had made for Dr. LeConte.

	We are doing nothing in the Legislature yet & not much to do.  I think I shall go home on Sunday & stay Monday, Sale day, & return Tuesday.  The Legislature will probably sit till the 15th Inst.

	I have seen nothing of your uncle yet nor heard anything from him!

	The news from Braggs army is rather gloomy.  Col. Beaufort Watts says it is time to begin to think of being subdued.  He said he wished Judge O�Neall, Governor Hammond & myself to be sent to Washington to treat for terms.  I told him such a proposition would be treason.  He said he knew it & would not do to talk about or to mention.

	I see they have had another fight in Virginia & are expecting a great Battle there.  Col. Elford will probably come down Thursday.  Tell Fannie I will go & see Hallie C� & then write her a letter.

O�Hanlon, your uncle � enclosing a draft for $3000, & one from General Easl[e]y about shucks & fodder. Tell Hext Col. O�Hanlon came up for him today in his carriage & felt greatly disappointed.  Frank McBee did not get a place in the military school.  Tell Vardry to learn to spell, cipher, write & read�but principally spelling.  He must have socks & underclothes.  The others are furnished.  Board & tuition & clothes are $300.  Vardry, Tench Pool, � & someone else were selected from Greenville�Dr. Goates son.  I have received $100 rail road dividend, & will draw my pay as Commissioner about $500 or $600.  Tell your mother her dividend in Planters & Mechanics Bank has been paid.  I suppose Taylor has it with that of Peoples Bank.  I will enquire about it.  I will send Col. O�Hanlons letter & your uncle�.  But I cant find your uncle � letter.  It was only three lines.  [page torn] draft I have in my [ page torn] Book.  Tell Fannie I will do as she directs.  You must feed the cow as much�as she will.

	I have no paper in my room but this half sheet.  It is now eleven oclock & I have just returned from Board of Trustees.  Donaldson goes up in ther morning [&] will carry this letter.  I will perhaps come home Sunday & stay Monday.  The legislature will not adjourn till 18th.  The times are gloomy indeed, & subjugation is beginning to be talked of as possible.  I saw General H� Brother Keith H� at the Governors.  He said the General telegraphed last night that he was living on cornbread & beef once a day!  He wanted something sent him to eat!

	I have just written a long letter to Fanniue & although it is late in the night I will write you one.  Col. Elford goes up in the morning.  He has just heard that his agent in Georgia has sold his last purchasse of a plantation for a profit of $20,000 & is uneasy about it.  I told him he was foolish to think of receiving $40,000 at this time in Confederate Bills & he should reinvest it immediately.  The money is depreciating every day.

	I will go up Sunday morning & stay till Tuesday.  I have drawn your uncle Josephs money $3,000 received your mothers from Taylor & now have a check for $710 for my pay as a Commissioner up today.  I do not know what to do with the money.  Don�t like to keep Confederate Bills & don�t invest it.

			I wrote Fannie last night about dining with Col. Hayne.  His wife looks old enough for his Mother!  It  looks so unnatural to see so youthful looking a man tied to a woman looking so old.  There ought to be fifteen years difference between a man & his wife.  There is something horrible to see a young man with an old & ugly wife.  Mrs. Hayne is smart & lively.  I spent a very pleasant evening with him, his wife,  daughter, son, Cols. Orr, Dawkins, Garlington, � & Dr. Croft.  Col. Hayne asked me to call & see them again.  Whilst at table Col. Dawkins knocked a dish over & spilt  the contents in my lap.  Mrs. Hayne offered to take all the grease out [word obscured] I would send my best to her.  But I was not hurt much.

	Col. Taylor told me he heard from his son frequently who is a prisoner near Canada on Johnsons Island.  He is well treated.  Your uncle Arthur is sick & confined to his bed.  Mrs. Hayne said there seems to be a prostration of the system.  I will go out & see him if I can tomorrow.  Col. Isaac Hayne brought �his little grandson to show�fine looking & very smart.  Miss �inner is quite pretty & his sons are good looking.
	I have just received a letter from Lake saying he will send corn in a day or two.  That he will be down here to see me Tuesday morning.
       The position Willie occupies is highly respectable & much easier & safer than to be in command.  He will still retain his position in the company, & it is only temporary.
	The news today is a little better.  Meade has retired before Lee and Grant has retreated before Bragg.  The yankees were terribly whipped at Chattanooga.  The Herald says they lost 40,000 men killed & wounded & missing!  Three companies of Col. McCulloughs Regiment were captured it is said�Captain Perkins, Capt. Mo� & Capt. Ben Goodletts�none of the Regiment killed it is said,
	I want to see you all very much & only wish I could stay when I return.  Tell Hext I miss him very much & am glad  he got safe home.
	Nothing doing in trhe Legislature of any consequence or likely to be done.I must now bid you good night & go to bed.  I think I have done well to write two long letters when I expect to see you next day after you get my letters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I owe you a letter and I will endeavour  to make you some sort of payment.  I don�t pretend to say that it will square us up but you must set it down to my credit and let me hear from you again.  You are the only man in Greenville except Dr. Buist who knows anything that is transpiring there, and your style of detailing it renders a letter from you a very interesting document; your own experience would be a subject for at least four pages.  I am very unfortunate in letter writing as in everything else having very little to say and a very poor way of saying it; but I wont expatiate on my own failings.  I wish it were convenient  for you to pay us a visit now, it being in our power to furnish a certain article that made your trip to Columbia so very expensive.  We are issuing the �Oh-be-joyful� to the detachment; occasionally one man trades for the shares of one or more of his comrade, and the consequence is that we have had several among us �gloriously tight� and correspondingly obstreporous.  Our mutual friend the A.A.C.S.C.S.A. not condescending to imbibe with such characters as John. H. White of Co. �F� and Samuel Youngblood Co. �E� and having no one with whom to take a social pass seldom visits my tent; which for the time being a sort of improvised grocery.  I think he is rather dissatisfierd with the small number of glasses (for glasses substitute tin cups) taken through the day, and if you were here to bear him company, take his position in sight of, or upon the cask and with Wiley as mixer of drinks pass the hours in greatest glee until both would be laid away to slumber off trhe effect of so great conviviality.  Let me describe this beverage color; that of very muddy rain water.  Enough said to make it very unpalateable when shaken sticks and straws float thick on the surface, with a green, greasy scum.  You are a connvisseur, what do you think of it.

	Our Camp is not very pleasantly situated but it is as good I suppose as can be found upon the Island.  We are anxious to get down to Adams Run to take possession of the quarters vacated by the Cavalry recently sent to Virginia.  I am afraid that the accounts we have of its being such a desirable location for camping are incorrect.  Perry I suppose will answer your letter shortly if he has not done so already.  I did intend to write you a lengthy epistle but am so disturbed by conversation

Dear Pa

 	Your letters seem to backwards.  Since I last wrote you I have received two letters from you and one from Ma, one from you I received yesterday dated Columbia 12th June. What in the world could have delayed these letters so I cannot imagine.  All that I received from Fannie came safely and promptly to hand though directed just like yours to Charleston.  I also received one yesterday from Stokes.  He does not seem much pleased with the idea of coming from Georgetown to this part of the coast, but I suppose they will have to come down here before long.  This place is as healthy as any in this vicinity, but that is not saying much for it, as none of this country is healthy; we have some sickness since coming here.  Our Maj. (Screven) has gone off sick, so has our Surgeon, and now we are borrowing a Surgeon.  Charley Lanneau has gone to the hospital, not seriously sick though.

	I wrote you that I am acting Adjutant.  It has kept me quite busy making out moring & monthly Reports.  I don�t think I will hold on to the position any longer than until our Company comes here.  

	I paid Capt. Earle a visit a day or two ago.  He is camped only about a mile and a half from us.  We have had some very hot weather lately.  Today is a little more pleasant as we had a shower yesterday morning.  Muskitos bother us a good deal.  If you had such a thing as a Muskito net or could get me one I would like to have it.  On Picket it is a great deal worse than in camp.  I have not been on Picket yet.

	We get a daily mail here, being only about 5 miles from Green Pond Station.  We get the Charleston daily papers every day, so are able to keep up with the news of the day, though for the past few days there has been very little news from either Virginia or Georgia.  But no news is better than bad news.  I suppose Fannie will soon be at home again.  Ma wrote that Charlie was lame.  How is he now and how is my horse Wagoner.  Are his eyes any better.  I wrote you that I had lost my bay horse, the first horse I have had to die since I have been in service.  Captain Williams wrote me some time since  that you wanted some certificate about the loss of John Greens horse, and that he referred you to me as I was in command of the Company.  If you want the certificate write me what is the nature of it. 

	I have no news to write you.  Everything is quiet along this part of the coast apparently.  My horse is not thriving as well as I could wish.  He looks gaunt and wont fatten though Wiley gives him every attention.  I am very well myself and so is Wiley.  We live in tents as in Virginia, and the life in camp is pretty much the same, though it seems more monotonous from the fact that we are not expecting to move every day as we were there.

	Give my love to all.  Your aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I will write you before breakfast Monday morning as I may not have time after breakfast.

	Hext reached here about four oclock just before a hard rain.  He looks like a wet dog & he will go up tomorrow.  Your mother says Susan is not going.  He can carry Alice & Annie.  Don�t let the Barouche come down again until the corn is finished�.  Tell Alfred he must clean out the whole of the corn if it takes him to September.  None of it must be given up to weeds & grass.

	Whilst working the horses they must be fed with corn.  When the Barouche comes down I will send up corn for bread.
	�.

	The people of the country are gloomy indeed.  �I regard as gone.  Charleston will fall in a few days.  They are fighting there now.  The Batteries were attacked on Friday.  Two were silenced.  The news tonight..the fall of the City.  Lee has had to fall back into Maryland.  Hampton and nine other Generals are wounded & three more killed.  The slaughter is terrible but we have no particulars.  They fought�days.  I will send you the papers which come tonight.

	I am very busy.  I find that I get $� as appraiser for every day since my appointment.  The pay continues as long as I am appraiser.  Next Wednesday I get $... a day as commission on Petigru�s case for four or five weeks.  I shall work something�day in my office.  The Court  of Equity is over & I did well in my business.  I am doing well amidst all of our troubles & bad things.

	No more papers can be purchased in the�so you must be careful of the papers sent you.  I will send you money by Hext to buy�& anything you�.

	Tell Ward I can do nothing for his mother as I wrote him some weeks ago.  Tell Bill Fisher there is a man here�up all distilleries & if he does not�he will be caught.

	Scott is making the fence but has not�to finish it.  

	If I have time I will write you tonight.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am writing you in the House of Representatives, & amidst great confusion.  But it is the only chance I have of writing to you.  I am very busy & time to do nothing.

	We arrived here safely Sunday evening.  Fannie went to Dr. & Mrs. LeContes Monday morning.  Dr. Ward & Hext went down with her.  Hext remained all day & came back in the evening & got his clothes & returned to the doctors to stay,  He seems to be enjoying himself there very much in shooting with John LeConte.  I have not been able to see Fannie since she left the Hotel,  Col. Johnson enquired after you all very kindly�said Mrs. Johnson would call to see Fannie today & that she must go & stay with them.  He is very kind.

	You will see from the Papers that Col. [Robert Bentham] Boylston has been elected Speaker.  The message of the Governor is published this mornibng.  The news from Augusta is very unfavorable.  It is  said the Enemy are in sight of Augusta.  Col. Martin telegraphed me that the Enemy was�towards his plantation in Georgia & he would not be able to meet me in Columbia.

	Judge Withers told me yesterday that Col. Le�cowleys Regiment had been sent from Willmington to Georgia.  But at Florence there was a dispatch to send them back to Willmington which was done.  I am not sorry for this change for there is I hope less danger in Willmington than there would be in Georgia.

	Fannie & Mrs. LeConte & Lula & Miss Graham are now in the gallery & I have just been up to speak to them.  Fannie has written you this morning she says.

	Youir uncle Arthur has been sitting by this morning enquiring kindly about you all.  He is as loquacious as ever & very much out with the town & ext� spirit of Columbia.

	I saw Vardry last night.  The cadets go to Augusta Thursday.  The Militia will all be sent to Georgia.  I have not seen Col. O�Hanlon.  I wish Hext to go down there before he goes home.  The weather is very warm, a great change since I left home.

	The spirit of everyone here is rather despondent.  Yeadon said yesterday that my expression �The State was going to the devil� was being rapidly realized.  This moment the Speaker read a telegraph dispatch to the Governor from General Bragg that the Enemy�s cavalry had broken rhe Savannah Rail Road thirty miles below Augusta & that General Wheeler was successfully pursuing them.

	I have just paid Col. Summer for the barrel of sugar $740.  Judge Withers told me yesterday that his family had only had one Barrel of Flour during all last summer & that they were almost starving.  He said he could stand it as he was raised roughly but his wife & children had not & it went hard with them. 

	I will now close as I have been very much�.  If anything happens before night I will write you again.  I hope to hear from you this evening.  Write me as often as you have leisure & anything to write about & I will do the same.

	Give my love to the children.  Tell Susan that Vardry was in fine spirits & delighted with his prospects.  He got his coat &c. by�.  Your�Husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz 

	I have a few minutes of leisure & will write you a line or two.  Last night I had to meet the Board of Trustees & on my return I stopped in at Dr. LeContes, but Fannie & Hext had gone to bed.  I saw all the rest of the family.  Today they were all in the State House with Fannie & Miss Holbeck.  The House adjourned about two oclock & I met them in the lobby & walked with the ladies into the Senate chamber where we staid some time.  Fannie went off with Miss Holbeck & says she is going to a dance tonight with Miss Holl� near her Fathers house.  Fannie seems to enjoy herself very much.  I introduced her to sundry of my friends today & amongst others�Gillmore Simms & Col. Pope.  She had already made the acquaintance of Col. Dawkins and Yeadon & others.  Hext is enjoying himself so much that I scarcely get sight of him. 
	
	The war news is pretty exciting.  There has been a battle at Grahamville & the result unknown.  Yesterday we heard of fighting in Georgia�was successful.  The Governor gets telegrams every day from Bragg, Chesnut & General Jones which are read to the House, but are not allowed to go imto the Papers.  It would seem that Sherman avoided Augusta & Macon.  The cadets were ordered from Hamburgh to the�head of Grahamville & may possibly have been in the battle yesterday.  But they could hardly have got there in time.  I have heard nothing from Willie & suppose he is at Wilmington.  Many persons thnik that Sherman is going to Richmond�that he will take water at Port Royal & try & get there before our troops can get back.

	Tell Anne I have sold her twenty dollar gold piece for $650.00 & her�for $750.  She will now have $1400 for the next year.  The interest of Col. Wares & Tuffers Bonds will more than make up for the capital�.  In truth Confederate Bonds are of very little value.

	I have not heard from you except by your letter to Fannie.  Do write me.  I was glad to hear you were to send for factory corn & that the Bacon weighed so well.  Your affec[tionate] Hus[band], B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Wares case comes up tomorrow before a committee ofvthe Senate & I, and C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan  & Col. T.B. Cou� are counsels in the case.

	It is now half after ten ocl;ock in the night & Chancellor Dunkin has just left my room.  I went to take supper with Mrs. LeConte.  Fannie & Miss Graham & young Holbeck went to the Tableaux.  Hext went to bed.  I came off to prepare for tomorrow & write letters.  The Senate will send for Beattie & Thurston in [Thomas Edwin] Wares election.  They will have to come down Wednesday.  I will have a Writ issued for Willie but I am afraid he cannot be obtained.

	They have had a severe battle at Grahamville where Willie was stationed.  His removal to Wilmington was fortunate.  We whipped the yankees.  I saw Col. Ball who passed by there today.  The yankees lost five hundred &�sixty killed & wounded.  Vardry did not get there in time to be in the battle.

	Dr. LeConte lives well & they seem as kind as they can be.  Fannie & Hext are enjoying themselves.  Hext does not wish to go to Col. O�Hanlons.  I will send him home next week  Fannie & all of them were in the State House today.  She says she enjoyed herself last night at the dancing party with Miss Holbeck.  Lula was unwell this evening & I did not see her.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  I hope you are all well.  I must now close as I have other letters to write by � Thurston who goes up in the morning.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter last night and was sorry to find you so distressed.  You don�t understand the Military Bill at all.  It applies to the troops already called out.  The second class from 50 to 60  were not likely to be called out at all & only in case of great emergency.  There is no danger of my having to go in in any event.  My broken leg disables me from marching.  So make yourself easy over that score.  The only contest in the passage oif trhe Military Bill was about the troops already called out being sent to Georgia.

	I did not see Fannie yesterday.  They were not at the State House.  Hext came to tell me that Mrs. Herbemont had invited Fannie & myself to tea at her house last night & that Fannie said I must come & go with her.  Mr. Lesesne came to me in the State House & said that Mrs. Herbemont requested me & my daughter to take tea with her.  But I could not well go.  Indeed I have no time to go anywhere or do anything except attend to my legislative duties.  

	Yesterday I received a very kind letter from General Hampton who is in Virginia.  He requests me to support Mr. Preston for governor.  But whether I do or not he feels assured I will do what I think is right.  The friends of the different candidates had their meetings last night.  I rather think Judge Magrath will be elected.  I shall vote for Preston but I cannot electioneer against the Judge.

	It is thought there will be an election for Judges & if�I am spoken of for Chancellor.  But it would be a ruinous step for me to take in these times when the salary is in fact little or nothing.  My practice & the various offices I fill are worth ten thousand a year.  A chancellor gets only three thousand.  I therefore think I had better remain as I am.

	We have issued summons for the witnesses in  Col. Wares contested election.  I have sent one to Wilmington for Willie but I do not know that he can come.  There will be a good many witnesses in Greenville�Cox, Beattie, B�, Thurston &c. &c.  They will come down this week.

	I am glad you have had corn hauled from Suttons & approve of your trading for corn, wheat &c.  I hope you have had the�killed & sold.  The weather is so warm that meat will spoil.  Let the hog get pretty fat before killing him & take care that he does not get out of the lot or be stolen.  I likewise approve of your contract with Fisher about renting the place & hiring Alfred.   

	I do not think I shall stay here till the end of the Session.  After I get through with Col. Wares case I shall feel very much like returning home.  I shall certainly not stay here longer than next week.

	The papers this morning contain all the war news which I have.  Sherman is making for Savannah & will probably occupy the city as a base for future operations in the South.  I saw a brother of Governor Brown�s & was asking him about Mrs. Harrison in Monetta.  He told me that she & her daughter Mrs. Earle remained there & were treated very kindly by the yankees.  It is said Sherman is not destroying private Houses in his move through Georgia.

	I will enclose you some stamps.  Envelopes are dearer here than in Greenville.  I will go & see Fannie this evening.  I think Hext had better go home this week.  Give my love to all the children.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday I dined with Gov. Manning & his mess consisting of President Furman, Dr. Furman, Cols. Wilson, Richardson, Mullins, Whaley &c.  I spent a delightful evening.Governor Manning walked with me to the door & said he thanked me for the pleasant evening I had given him & his friends & wished that I should come often.  Everyone of them are for me warmly for Chancellor.  Governor Manning insisted on my going with him to see Mrs. General T� Johnson who is in Columbia & a most accomplished Lady.

	After taking a cup of coffee I went to Dr. LeContes just opposite Governor Manning�s quarters & spent an hour or two with the ladies there, Dr. LeConte & Col. Gage.  As I came off I met Col. Dawkins going there.  On my return home I found five or six letters & one from you.  I was glad to hear you were all well & hauling the corn from General Easley�s.  But sorry the�are�you have not killed them.  Make John feed them well & fatten them.  Carry corn to the mill & have it ground to feed them with.  But food is so scarce they must be killed as saoon as possible & the hogs too.

	�Fannie reced a letter from Willie in which he sent his love to Lula.  She seemed unusually affectionate last evening.  I supposed Fannie had delivered Williams message.  H� was there.  Governor Manniung & Col. Trescott had been there one or two evenings ago.  They have a good many gentlemen to visit them.  

	I wrote a letter last night to Col. Orr about being District Judge in case Judge Magrath was elected Governor.  At present there would be no necessity of my living in Charleston.  I shall write�today.

	Tell Susan the terms in the Citadel are only twelve hundred per annum & the Boys find their shoes & under clothes & sheets &c. (See the Guardian advertisement).

	Fannie has a bad cold & has not been out since Saturday.  She is getting better.  Hext is quite well & wishes to stay longer.  He & John LeConte are great cronies & he stays there all the time.

	I am truly glad Willie is at Wilmington.  Had he remained at Green Pond he would have been fighhting.  Captain Earles Battery was in the Grahamville fight but the Capt. was absent.  Furman commanded the Battery.  They were fighting there on Sunday again, but we have not heard the result.  

	I have just taken my�& must close my letter.

	Major Bolling wishes a paper left with me by Collins.  I think it is in my paper case on the left of the door as you go into my office in the Box marked �Memoranda.�  Tell him to make Capt. Hart wait till I return home.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F.P.

	I have just read the newspaper & will now write you a line or two before breakfast.  I recei[ve]d your letter last night, & was glad to hear from you.  I hope the Beeves are killed & that John is able to attend to his wirk again.

	I saw Fannie yesterday in the State House & introduced my friend  � to her & Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  The members of the House went into the Senate Chamber to rattify  a Bill, & the ladies came into the Hall to look at some pictures.  Fannie has a bad cold, but was going to a party at  Mrs. Joseph LeConte�s last night.  I dine with the Governor today.  Capt. Williams passed through here yesterday on his way to Wilmington.  I thought he had gone on long since. 

	Mr. L� sent down last evening & paid me $256.61 fees in my sequestration cases.  This will help me pay my board Bill.  It is now raining and we shall probably have a long wet spell.  In reading the paper this morning I was shocked to see the death of Col. [James] O�Hanlon announced.  I wrote a letter to him yesterday about Hext & myself paying him a visit.  I had heard he was sick but did not suppose he was dangerously ill.

	I met yesterday in the streets William the son of my Brother Foster Perry with his leg cut off.  He lost it at Rome Georgia.  But he was looking well & cheerful.  He had come down to be placed on the retired list.  Wilbu & John Perry are in Virginia & Clark in the army of Texas.  Warren & William are at home.  Harriet & Eliza�s husbands are in the army.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter last night from Mrs. Cunningham about her card factory.  She is very much provoked & wishes me to oppose or restrict the Charter.  She sent me a bundle of papers.  I will see to what she wishes & write her.  John Cunningham is here & has lost one eye.

	Col. O�Hanlon died of inflamation of the bowels as did Gov. Hammond & perhaps brought on in the same way.

	The Legislature refused yesterday to elect Judges.  There is nothing doing & if it was not for Col. Wares case I would come home.  It is likely that Judge Magrath will be elected Governor.

	I have no news from the army except what you see in the newspapers.  Sherman is marching on Savannah.  The Governor has ordered all persons on this side of Savannah River below a certain point to move or destroy their property.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday I made a speech & defeated a Bill to extend the planting of cotton.  Col. Dawkins & Mullins took the same view.  We are all complimented for our efforts.  In the evening I dined with the Governor in company with Judge Conrad of Louisiana, Gov. Manning, Gen. McGowan, Cols. Dawkins, Porter, Boylston, Buist, DeSaussure & others.  We had a very pleasant time.  Mr. Janney was so kind as to lend me a horse & one for Col. Dawkins to ride out to the Governors three miles from Columbia.

	I did not see Fannie yesterday, but Hext says she is better & going about the house.  But the day was unfavorable in the morning & they did not come to the State House.  There is no news.  I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear from tyou.  I have not heard from Willie since Fannies letter from him.

	Tell Susan I will make the arrangement she desires when I return home.  I have heard nothing from Vardry since he was at Charleston.  I suppose the Cadets are now at Grahamville.  I expect[ed] to have seen the witnesses down from Greenville in Col. Wares case last night but did not.  I write you just after breakfast & as I have nothing particular to communicate I will finish my letter after the House adjourns.

	It is now past eight oclock in the night & I have just returned from a dinner at Col. Campbells where we had a very pleasant party of Ladies & gentlemen & a fine dinner.  After writing the above letter this morning I went to see Fannie & she had walked up street.  She afterwards came to the State House but I did not see her.  Col. Campbells daughter told me that she came into the gallery whilst I was speaking  on the contested election between Dr. McConley & [G. Allen] Huggins.  She is better & Mrs. LeConte takes good care of her.  Hext has been to see me twice today.  He wishes to sell his gun to Dr. LaBordes son for six dollars in gold which would be about $200.  I gave $75.00 for the gun.  I told him that was not enough.  He went off & said he would take $9.00 in gold which would be about $300.

	Col. Campbell has several daughters & they seem pleasant girls.  I was seated to the right of the lady at the head of the table�the post of honor.  But I do not know whether She was his sister or his wife.  Her name was Campbell, whether Miss or Mrs. I could not tell.  I walked back with Mr. Lord who is a most charming gentleman.  On my return I see�Butlers name registered though I have not seen him.

	I have just read your letter & am surprised you did not hear from me Tuesday evening I wrote you.  I am glad the Beeves are killed & wish you to kill the hog as soon as possible & the weather will permit.  Beattie, Bane & Thurston are all here but I have not seen them yet.  It is now nine oclock in the night.   

	I have no war news.  I think with you that Easley ought to have told John not to come for the corn.  I hope I shall be able to get corn from someone else.  Col. Ware says he told his negroes to carry my Barrel of molasses up as soon as they get through sowing wheat.

	It is now past ten oclock in the night but I will write you a few lines by Beattie who goes up in the morning.  We have just got through examining all the witnesses who have come down & theirs will come hereafter.  It will be some time before the case is decided.  

	Today has been drisling & Fannie did not come to the State House.  We were all invited to Col. Johnsons this evening, but I could not go.  I had to examine witnesses befoere Senates Committee.  He sent his carriage for Dr. LeConte &c.  Fannie went I suppose & no doubt had a pleasant evening.

	Governor Pickens & his wife are here.  They came yesterday.  I saw Mrs. Pickens in the Gallery today.  She saw me looking at her & bowed most graciously to me in the Hall�.  I was engaged all day & did not get to speak to her.  I met Gov. Pickens & had some chat with him.  I sent him Mrs. Haynes letter.  He enquired about Paul & said he drank very hard some time ago.  I told him I had never heard of it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight enclosing two to Fannie.  I also rece[ive]d one from General Easley saying he could not let me have any more corn & explaining.

	I have no further news, & will close my letter & go to bed.  Boyce & Price speak of going up in the morning & but for Col. Wares case I would also.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just come up from supper & will write you a few lines whilst I am waiting for the mail.

	The weather is wet & cold.  The conductor tells me you have ice, sleet & snow in Greenville.  There was some sleet here this morning.  The day has been so bad that I have not seen Fannie for several days.  Hext paid me a visit this evening & said all was well.  They had a pleasant evening at Col. Johnsons last night�a great deal to eat, but very few persons.  He said Mr. � was there.  I was sorry not to be able to go, but was detained by the contested Senatorial election �examining witnesses as I write you this morning by Beattie.  One of the witnesses was Capt. Jno Charles who told me this morning that he was about sending his wheat to the mill & when ground he had instructed Major Alexander to take the very best of the flour & make a Barrel for me.

	Today as I went to dinner I saw Mrs. Pickens seated at one of the tables with her little daughter.  I went up & spoke to her & took a seat by her & we had a very pleasant tete a tete at the dinner table.  Governor Pickens had gone to dine with Governor Bonham.  Mrs. Pickens enquired kindly after you & Fannie.  I told her Fannie would have been to see her today but for the weather.  She said I must call up & see her & the Governor�reminded me that I had once promised to pay them a visit with you in Edgefield.  She seemed very kind, & looks very pretty.

	I have just written a letter to Mrs. Cunningham telling her I would attend to her card�.  We did nothing in the Legislature today, except pass the Bill for Soldiers families.  A great many of the members had gone home.  [James Petigru] Boyce was disappointed in going.  [William Pierce] Price went. 

	The election for Governor comes off next Tuesday & it is thought by some that [Henry William] Garlington may be elected.  This would be very strange indeed.  General [Samuel] McGowan had a long talk with me today about his chances.  There were several telegrams today from Georgia but they contained nothing more than you see in the papers.  I will now stop writing & go for my letters.

	Sunday morning.  I have just returned from breakfast & will write you a few lines whilst I am smoking my pipe.  I recd your letter last night enclosing one about St. Julian & am glad you are getting on so well & exchanging yarn for corn.  I will go & see Fannie this morning.  The day is so unpleasant I do not suppose they will go to Church.  I had a long chat this morning at the breakfast table with Governor Pickens, who said a great many complimentary things to me, in reply I suppose that my expression to him that if he was �gable he could be elected Governor again.  Mrs. Pickens was not at breakfast.  The news of trhe death of General [States Rights] Gist is confirmed by a man just from Coosawhatchie.  It will be a terrible blow to his young wife.   General [Patrick] Cleburne is also killed.  This is a great loss.  He was assigned under Hood.  The news this morning is that Sherman is marching on Savannah in three columns.  Another report is that a portion of his forces are attempting to cross the River.  I will conclude my letter after I see Fannie.

	I have just eaten my dinner and taken a smoke & will now finish this letter.  I went round to see Fannie this morning & found her quite well.  She had sent Hext with your letter for me to read but I did not see him till I returned to the Hotel.  Fannie says she wrote you yesterday I believe & would not write you today.  She is going to stay with with Maggie Tuesday & then two or three days with Ellen Janney.  She will then go to Dr. Croft & spend her Christmas.  So I shall leave her in Columbia when I go up next Friday with Hext.  I have nothing further to write you.  You need not send me any money.  I shall need none till I return home.

	I recd a letter from Col. Perryman last night requesting me to write to the Secretary of War requesting permission to pardon the deserters if they will come in & form a company for police duty in the District.  I have several letters to answer this evening & must therefore close this to you.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I did not write you yesterday but I think I have made you a pretty good correspondent since I have been in Columbia.  You likewise have done your duty in that respect & it always gives me great pleasure to receive a letter from you.  I recd a letter from you last night and sorry the weather is so cold.  You had better make John haul wood home and have a good supply to meet the coming bad weather.  

	I did not see Fannie yesterday.  She & Lula came to see Mrs. Pickens as Hext tells me.  He was here yesterday evening when I came from the State House.  Governor Pickens & his lady dined with Col. Campbell yesterday & I did not see Mrs. Pickens.  I suppose they have gone this morning.  I saw him at the breakfast table yesterday morning.

	  We did very little in the House yesterday.  By a majority of one vote we sent a message to the Senate to grant an election of Judges tomorrow.  But it is supposed that the Senate will not agree to our Resolution.  Today we commence ballotting for Governor.  No election will be made today.

	I have just come up from breakfast & saw Pickens & Mrs. Pickens.  They could not get off today.  Mrs. Pickens told me she was glad to see Fannie looking so well, that she had called to see her yesterday.  I told her Fannie had been unwell with a bad cold.  Mrs. Pickens came to trhe table whilst I was standing up talking to the governor.  She looked very pretty, and seems as good as she is beautiful.

	I have not heard from Willie since his letter to Fannie.  This makes me think that he is trying to come here as a witness in Wares case.  It would be very pleasant to meet him, but the trip will cost considerable.  Col. Wares eldest son came down last night on his way to Charleston to join the cadets.  He seems a fine boy.  I have heard nothing from Vardry.  I suppose Susan hears froom him.  

	There is no news.  The yankees are near Savannah & I suppose fighting�this time.  Though yesterday there was a report that they were going round Savannah.  General L� says they cannot capture Savannah.  I will now close.  If anything happens before night.  I will write you again.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you a letter this morningwhich you will receive by mail.  But since that time Hext has concludedcto go home with Col. Wares son Willie.  He can tell you all the news.  Fannie & Maggie paid me a visit this evening at my room & sat awhile.  She is now at Hol�.  They came in the State House whilst we were voting for Governor.  We had three ballots & Judge Magrath ran ahead.  I dropped Preston on the third ballot & voted for the Judge.  It will probably be a close race between him & Garlington but I think Magrath will be elected.  

	We have just heard that [Gen. William J.] Hardee defeated Sherman at Savannah with great loss, & that Sherman is in want of provisions & ammunition &c.  This information seems pretty correct although you may not see it in the newspaper.

	I have just been with Governor Pickens & Mrs. Pickens & spent a pleasant evening with them.  I�now go down & get the mail & hope to hear from you.  It is now doubtful whether I can return Friday & may be detained here till nexzt weekWares case will not be disposed of before next week & I cannot leave before it is finished.

	I have recd no letter from you tonight & am sorry I did not hear from home.  It alwaysgives me satisfaction to hear & I am uneasy if I do not.

	The enclosed letter from Willie was recd tonight.  I send it to you to read.  I am sorry he could not get a furlough to come to Columbia.

	There are several bundles here.  But hext cannot carry them�one large�one for Lee & Beattie.

	Hext is out somewhere with Willie Ware & if is near nine oclock.  I am glad he is going home.  If he staid at the Hotel he would have too many temptations.  Make him study his Books at home.  I want to go home very much & see my wife & llittlew children.  Good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	We have just elected Judge Magrath Governor, & it is doubtful whewn the Legislature will adjourn.  I have just recd a letter from Col. Martin & we have agreed to have a meeting here on Monday evening next.  If I can get off I will go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin & the case of Col. Ware I would not come back at all.  The Senate have refused to go into the election of Judges.  I am not sorry, for if the election had taken place I should have run for Chancellor.  If elected it would have reduced us to starvation.

	I have just seen a piece of good luck which has befallen me & will enable me to pay my board bill.  Old Mr. Norton enployed me to get the pay for his negro who died on the coast.  The old man would make a bargain with me to give me one third of what I recovered.  I see the auditor has allowed him Three thousand dollars.  So I shall get one thousand dollars.  There are two other simillar cases in which I shall get them two or three hundred dollars.  I expect fine hundred of Col. Ware.  This will enable me to pay my debts although I may not get my fees from the Confederate government.  

	I saw Fannie in the Gallery today with maggie but only got to�to them.  She was looking very well.I hope Hext arrived safely & that you are all well.

	I have further�& I think you may expect me at home Saturday night & I will return Monday.  I have written Col. Elford to come down on Monday to meet the Commissioners.

	I have just succeeded in getting DavisHodges off his contract about the Saluda turnpike.  If the Senate passes the Resolution of the House it will be a great [word obscured] matter to Hodges.

	I must now close my letter before I receive yours tonight as I hope to do.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your letter last night in which you state that my leytter of the 8th by Thurston was not received till Thursday morning.  This is strange.  I wrote you a long letter Sunday which you ought to have received Monday night & yet you had not received it Tuesday morning.  I am afraid my letters are delayed a whole day in Columbia in consequence of not being sent to the Post office in time to be mailed the night sent.  I shall drop this in the Box here & hope it will [be] sent in time to be mailed & you will receive it Friday evening.

	I shall endeavour to go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin I would not return at all.  I am honestly tired of Columbia &, & wish to be with my wife & children.  I wrote you fully last night, & have very little to add this morning.  By staying till the end of the Session I shall be able to get the money for Norton & others for loss of slaves on the coast & out of the money I shall receive large fees.  Last night after writing to you, Sam Jones nephew of Col. [James] O�Hanlon came to see me & got me to write an obituqary notice of his incle, which I have done & which you will see in the Caroolinian tomorrow.  He showed me a copy of O�Hanlons Will.  It was written just before he died so Hext is not mentioned in it or anythiung given to him.  I think this very mean on the part of O�Hanlon after telling me & Hext that he had given him a negro boy..  He gave all of his property to his nephews & nieces except a negro to his Executor Dr. Ray.  It is wrong to expect anything from anyone.  And I�happy to know that I have made�.  I am�& have supported & educated my children so far with credit.  I am now doing well & making something & hope that I may have�[word obscured] for my family.  I could not be placed in any position where I would do better.  I am happy in being always with my wife & children, & working for their support. 

	I have just seen Fannie.  She & Ellen Janney & Ho� came down to the State House to see me.  She came to my room about ten minutes after I left there.  She wanted to arrange about the day she leaves here & goes to Dr. Crofts.  She said that she was going to write you, but finding that I was writing to you she said to tell you  she would not.  Fannie is quite well & looking well.  She saw Mrs. Pickens at the Hotel this morning who said she was going round to see her.  I took breakfast with Mrs. Pickens & the Governor & had a great deal of chat with them & Miss Manning.  

	The Governor will be inaugurated tomorrow.  Fannie said she would not come to the State House today buy will come tomorrow.  Ellen Janney & Mr. Janney insist very much on Fannie staying there some time before she goes up.  

	The weather is warm & pleasant buy cloudy & will rain tomorrow.  I will now close by�myself as ever your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. You may expect me Saturday night & send a horse & saddle to the depot for me or the little carriage. B.F.P.

	I am sorry I disappointed you in saying that I would be at home Saturday night.  Col Ware & Mr. Boyce were to have gone with me & they concluded that the business of the two Houses would not permit them to go.  This induced me to consider that there were important matters which would come up in my absence, & which I wished to discuss.  Moreover I went to Dr. LeContes Friday night & there met Mr. & Mrs. Johnson & Fannie.  We had a fine supper & I ate heartily of some sweet things  which has disagreed with me.  I came so late & Col. Ware came into my room  & sat a long time.  Then I sat down to write a letter to�Mr. Barnwell about the appointment of district Judge.  This made me reflect about the propriety of trhe appointment if tendered to me.  I thought of you & the children & poverty�all of us trying to live on three thousand dollars.  I could not go to sleep till the clock struck three!  I did not wake up in the morning till just before the cars left.  Feeling rather�I woke up.  I thought it best to remain in bed & rest my�system instead of riding three hundred miles & wasting three days to spend one at home.  It was a sore trial to me for I longed to see you once more & be with you & the children again.

       Yesterday morning General [William Edward] Martin came to me in the State House.& said Fannie was going to dine with him & wished me to meet her there.  At four oclock I went up to his House & Fannie was greatly surprised to see me.  She thought I had gone home.  We had a fine dinner & I spent the evening very pleasantly.  I walked home with Fannie Mr. H� & Miss Maggie.  I came back to the Hotel, got a cup of coffee & went down to our night session at seven oclock & remained there till eleven oclock�I came home & went to bed, slept soundly & feel quite well this morning.  Janney had Boyce & myself wake up early to take breakfast with him & I have just returned from the breakfast table to write you a long letter.
 ouses

	I recd a letter from Col. Elford last night stating that he would be here Monday evening to meet the Commissioners.  He informed me Col. [John Durant] Ashmore has employed me & himself to defend him for killing that poor fellow Pinson.  He says he has been down to see Ashmore & that he was suffering terrible both mentally & physically.

	Last night after ten oclock the Exemption Bill came up exempting the members & various officers & persons from conscription.  Told [we] had just received a telegram informing us the Fall of Savannah.  I got up & said it was a remarkable coincidence that we had just received in telegram of the capture of Savannah, & the crossing over of a portion of Shermans forces into South Carolina, whilst we were then, at that late hour of the night trying to exempt ourselves & our friends & various other persons from being called out to meet the invading foe!  It produced a furious sensation in the House & many of the members came ro me & said they had never heard remarks more appropriate.  The Bill was postponed till Monday.  I despair of the country.  Yhere is so much of cowardly selfish feeling pervading all classes that we do not deserve success.  

	It is said Savannah has fallen but I see nothing of it in the papers this morning.  The city was invested some days since by Sherman and the people suffering for the want of food.  I have no doubt it will fall if it has not already fallen.  The enemy will soon be marching on Charleston & extending their raids throughout the lower country.  You may have the consolation of knowing that Greenville is the safest place in the State.  It will hardly ever be reached by the enemy.

	Mrs. Johnson had called at Holbecks to Fannie just before I got there with her.  She will go with Mrs. Johnson to the�tomorrow  & I have promised them our seats on the floor.  There will be a grand display.  I should have missed it all by going home.  Fannie will come to the Hotel Tuesday morning & remain with Ellen Janney till I go up Thursday.  She will then stay with Tilla Croft & spend the Christmas.

	A large majority of the members�my appointment for district Judge�all except those who�Col. �.  Many of them came to me & expressed a regret that they had not sooner heard of my application�Governor Manning among them.  If I secure the appointment I shall be sorry for it & do not know that I will accept it.  I was gratified to know that so large a majority of the Senators as well as members of the House had recommended me for the appointment of district Judge.  Boyce told me there were but four members who declined to sign it who had already signed one for Col. M�.  Two of them said they never signed any petition, & one of the other two was C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan of Laurens.

	Mrs. Martin seems feeble & had to�after dinner.  Miss Salie is not pretty, nor is the younger sister,  Her son has gone to Savannah as captain of the foreigners & was safe yesterday.  I have heard nothing further from Willie.  Your uncle Hayne was in the House the other day looking very well & full of talk as usual.  I see Col. Isaac Hayne every day. but I have not seen or heard from Col. Taylor.  

	I shall not go to Church this morning.  Boyce & myself have promised to dine with Janney at half past twelve.  He says he is going to have a good dinner, turkey &c. &c.  I wish now I was at home to spend the day with you, & talk over all the incidents I have to tell you.  But instead of talking I am writing to you & can imagine you present.  Fannie goes with Mrs. Herbemont from church this morning & takes tea with her.  I suppose however she will write you and tell you everything about her self.

	When I told Mr. Johnson the other night at Dr. LeContes that I was going home, he said I must bring you down with me.  Governor Magrath is to be at Janneys this evening & has taken a suit of rooms.  He occupies my bed room & I have taken one next to it.  Mine was opposite his Parlor & I consented to give it up.  He takes my room, & I may, perhaps, take his seat in the Senate.

	I am glad to hear you are getting on well.  You have plenty of corn & meat & I hope Charles will bring the flour.  Elford writes me that corn is $15.00 per bushel & flour $250  per barrel & pork $2.70 per pound.  Swap off your spun yarn for corn & pork.  I hope to get money enough here to pay my Bill & all my debts at home when I get there.

       Now my dear wife I have written you a long letter like a good husband as you know I am.  I think we were both very fortunate in getting loving & affectionate companions.  Very few persons have been more fortunate than you & I in marrying.  Do not you think so?  I wrote Mrs. Cunningham the other day & sent her the printed note about her card Factory.  I did not succeed [word obscured] her�come very near it & sent her the proceedings on my motion.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I am afraid this long letter will tire out your patience in reading this.  B.F.P.

	I have just got the�& the Inauguration.  Fannie & Maggie came with Mrs. Johnson & I reserved the seats of myself, Boyce & Price for them.  But Miss G�, � Johnston & Fannie occupied the seats.  There never was such a�before.  The Ladies rushed in the House & occupied the whole House.  The gallery was full & the lobby.  It was all new to Fannie, & she seemed to enjoy it.  Mrs. LeConte took Col. Dawkins seat.  Lula did not come.

	I have just applied to the Governor to appoint Willie one of his aid[e]s.  This will take him out of the army & give him the title of colonel.  I hope the governor will appoint him.  I [would] rather have this appointment for Willie than that of Judge for myself.  

	I have just received a most cordial letter from [William Gilnore] Simms.  He says that he will use his influence witrh the President to have me appointed in Magrath�s place.  He says Col. Orr has got a majority of the South Carolina delegation in Congress to sign my application.  Senator Hill of Georgia has been written to by Mr. Boyce to use his influence with the President.  Mr. Simms says his whole family send their love to you & all my family�say Simms has been at the point of death but is well again.

	I shall be at home Thursday night.  Send John with the little carriage to the depot.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Col. Ware�s case comes up at 5 oclock.  So I must now close my letter.

	I have been engaged tonight with Lake & Gray in settling their accounts.  The Legislature is in session but I did not go down to the House.  Hext tells me that Dickson Irvine & his sister are here & going up in the morning.  I will send this letter by them.  Fannie Irvine is sick.  Hext is going in the morning to see H� � & will go down  to Col. [James]  O�Hanlons at twelve oclock.  The Col. will have to come back Friday to court.  I shall go home Thursday if nothing happens to detain me in the Legislature.  Lake paid me $90.00 for fees & says under the late act of Congress there will be due me $800 more.  I suppose about as much�.   Sitton, DeSaussure, Connor & Miles & myself have a consultation in the morning about our fees.  I have got Tuppers interest due your mother $157.50cts.  My pockets are full of money.  I hope to be with you Thursday night & therefore will close my letter.  Col. Ware returned this evening.  But brought no news from Greenville.

	The arrival of Hext last night frustrated all of my plans & perhaps for the better.  I shall now remain in Columbia till Thursday & then go home to remain instead of going up & returning.  I am loth to move about.  This morning I found there was no�at ten oclock as I expected to Col. O�Hanlons, so I wrote him Hext was here to pay him a visit & would remain till he came up.  I wrote the Col. a hurried letter last night & a long one this morning.  Hext is enjoying himself with Charley Janney & slept with him last night.  Yesterday Mr. Janney asked me to dine with his family at one oclock, which I did.  He seems very kind & obliging to me.   Sent his Horse & Buggy to go to the Governors the other evening.

	Today I will spend in writing letters & reading Prentiss� life till dinner.  Then I think of taking a walk to your uncles with Hext for exercise.  There are some important matters coming up in the Legislature tomorrow & and next day�I would have missed if I had gone home.  I hope by Thursday all will be over & I can go home safely & leave Hext with Col. O�Hanlon till I come down in January to bring Fannie to school. 

	I hope the corn will come soon.  I shall see Lake Tuesday evening.  If you get out you must borrow of Pool.  Do have the cows well fed with meal or bean and hay, fodder or shucks & slop.  The Calf you can kill whenever you think best.  Janney bought two cows yesterday for $800.  If I could get S�s for $200 I would take her provided she  is a good milker.  If you can exchange salt for pork do so.  I wish to hear from Glencoe very much.  I hope Alfred & Johnny are done gathering corn & sowing wheat.  I must go up there as soon as I get back.

	I will have a settlement with Lake when he comes down & see more about the corn.  I hope you are getting on well and quietly.  Tell Vardry he must study hard & when he comes here he must be very careful to obey all rules and regulations and not be led astray by other boys.  It is a hard life, but it will make a useful man of him, & he ought not to throw away the opportunity.  He may now regard his life as just commencing so far as his own conduct & exertions are concerned.

       I will now write a long letter to Willie.  I wrote him just a week ago.  You & Fannie ought to write him.
       
       I have just seen Judge Magrath who came up last night to hold court here.  He says the shelling is injuring the Homes very much in Charleston.  I have seen nothing of my friend Simms & his wife yet.  Col. Orr, Simpson Farrow & other members of Congress have passed through on their way to Richmond.
       
       Write me so that I may get letters Wednesday evening before starting Thursday.  I will write you tomorrow if I have time.  My love to all the Children & tell Fannie the�.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Col. O�Hanlon has just left my room.  He came up today without having received my letter.  He is on the Jury of the Federal Court & will be here all the week.  Thursday the Court will not sit, being fast day, & the Col. will go down home & take Hext wtith him.  He will have to return Friday & leave hext there.  He may be on the Jury two weeks.  I believe he has someone of his House.  He spoke of Hext hunting with the boys in his absence.  I will enquire further about it.  

	I shall come home Thursday.  That day is fastr day & the Legislature will not sit.  They adjourn Thursday week.  But I shall not come back.  The business will be pretty well through  by Fast day.  
Wednesday I am invited to dine with The�and I suppose he will give a magnificent feast as he has invited for three days beforehand.  I don�t know who are to meet�.  He came to me & said he had a favor to ask of me.  It was to dine with him Wednesday.   He did not ask Boyce or Croft who were sitting by me & whispered to me.

	The Legisalature has done nothing today worth telling.  Tupper paid me your mother�s Interest this morning.  I�in money at present.  Hext is well pleased here.  He went to church last night with Miss Ellen Janney.  Janney seems very kind to him & says his House is his home & that he is one of the finest boys he ever saw.  Ellen Janney is going to the�College & seems pleased to hear that Fannie will be there.

	Col. [John] Bauskett called to see me this evening & expressed himself very much impressed with my views about the war.  Col. O�Hanlon says he met Alfred Huger today who told him he was utterly opposed to the movement &�was still a union man!  The Secessionists are all�.  A genetlemen from Marlborough tolld me yesterday that he saw Col. [Ellerbe B.] Cash who was a great seseessionist.  The Col. said if he had known as much before as he knows now he would have shot a man who advocated Secession.  �our country isi in an alarming condition  we all see it�But cannot help it.

	I want to get home very much & will leave Thursday if possible.  The Legislature will make provisions for soldiers family.  I am sorry I shall not hear from you tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B,F, Perry

	I am writing you before day.  The clock has just struck four & I am dressed.  I recd your letter last night after my return from committee.  I was glad to hearfrom you & that you were getting on so well.

	The weather is so warm I expect you had better get Watson  to butcher the beeves & sell the meat.  I am afraid it will spoil.  They ought to be killed before they become poor.  If you keep them till the weather changes you must make John feed them well on corn & shucks & take care that they do not get out & go off and the same with the hog.  But as corn is so scarce you had better kill as soon as safe.  I am glad John is haulking the corn.

	I wrote you yesterday & have nothing further to communicate.  No further news from the fight at Grahamville nor nothing further from Sherman.  

	I hope Anne will be satisfied with my sale of her gold & Bond.  The Bonds are falling, but gold is rising.  I do not think her capital is lessened  by the arrangement I have made.  The interest will be so much more valuable than the Bond.

	Nothing was done yesterday in the Legislature.  Col. Wares case will come up today.  Col. Campbell & C.P. Sullivan are employed by Sullivan.  I am alone for Col. Ware.

	Judge W� came into my room just now & untangled my writing.  We then went down to breakfast at five oclock & I have just got back.  I must now close & hunt up some passenger to send this letter by.

Willards Hotel, [Washington]

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening quite well, but very mush fatigued.  I wrote you a long letter at Charlotte, thence to Danville where we spent the night & overtook Dr. Darby & General Prestons daughter, also Mr. Mordecai & all his family who had been waiting there two days, for a passage to Richmond.  The Rail Road had been exclusively employed on transporting Federal troops.  I was vert much pleased with Dr. Darby & have seldom met a more intelligent pleasant younger gentleman.  His wife is a magnificent looking lady.  We did not reach Richmond till next morning.  I slept�on my arrival here.  I addressed a note to the President, & he sent word he would answer in writing, but I have not yet heard from him.  There was a Cabinet meeting today & I suppose he has delayed designating our meeting till after that,.

	General Gue� formerly in command at Charleston sent up his card as soon as he saw my name registered & sat with me two hours.  I was very much pleased with him.  Mr. Taggert a correspondent for newspapers called whilst the General was with me & took my speech to have published in the Washington papers.  Col. Beale called this morning & a dozen others.  The Col. is low spirited.  His wife is at Society Hill.  My arrival was announced this morning in the Washington & New York papers.

	The improvement in Washington is very great.  It seems I have got into a new world.  Everything [is] on a splendid scale.  My room is a large private parlor.  The�is most� & we have everything  that�can desire.  I bought this morning a new hat $6.50 & slacks $..., hat for Willie & one for Hayne & Ben.  I will wait till we go to Baltimore to fill up your list as good are much cheaper there.

	I find Col. Orr has troupes of friends in Washington.  He has been very kind to me.  Says if I wish to be U. States Senator there will be no difficulty about it.  I found my companions on the route all very pleasant & we have enjoyed ourselves very much.  James Gibbs returned this morning from New York & called to see me.  He says Miss Graham was in rapture at my appointment.  He left her in New York.  She is going to return�went on to shop.

	It is said that President Johnson is very kind towards the South.  He has pardoned everybody who makes application.  This morning I signed recommendations for the pardon of Col. Orr, General McGowan, Col. Elford & others.  The Presidents wife is very sick & he has been sick himself.

	Mr. Gibbs will leave here this morning & take the letter to Columbia.  Not having seen the President yet I have not much to write you.  It is probable I may�have three or four days yet and then I shall have to stop in Columbia to see General Gilmore.  But I will be at home the last of July. 

	In the morning I suppose my speech will make its appearance & this evening I will see what the New York papers say of me.  Col. Evans telegraphed Grady that our arrival was announced  & everyone said last night that the Herald would be full of the governors arrival in Washington.

	Tell Fannie I will make her purchases in Baltimore.  We will take a steamer there for Richmond.  Tell Willie his hat is a very pretty one.  Caps are not worn by children & I bought vests�pretty for Hayne & Ben.

	I am now going down to look at the old capitol  & must therefor conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now twelve oclock in the night & Mr. Gibbs goes in the morning.  My room has been full of visitors, who have just gone all wishing to see the provisional Governor of South Carolina.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from the President this morning appointing three oclock for our meeting.  We had a most interesting conversation for two hours & seem mutually pleased with each other.  I cannot repeat all that was said.  He is kind & solicitous about the South & will do everything he can for us.  In reference to my appointment he said we lived only one hundred twenty miles apart & that he knew all about, that when he mentioned my name to the Charleston  Committee, Judge Frost immediately approved the nomination & the others cheerfully assented.  I made such an impression on the President that he insisted I should call on Seward & Stanton & talk to them about South Carolina politics, & [he] gave me letters of introduction to them.  He made me promise to come back & see him again before I left.  There were hundreds waiting to see him when I went & could not.  I carried with me Col. Orr, Elford, Grady, Blad�, Gibbs, General Williams, & Leiter.

	I have just issued my Proclamation & will send it to Columbia by Gibbs,  Elford has copied it for Dr. Buist to read at the depot.  I have made Willie private Secretary & his name appears on the Proclamation.

	I went with my friend this morning to see Governor Denison Post Master General.  He went to the President for me.  I am delighterd with Johnson.  Tomorrow I go to see all the Cabinet officers.  I have rece[ive]d telegrams from Preston, Middleton & Campbell today.  I have the appointment of all Federal officers in South Carolina & have to approve all Pardons.  Never before had a Governor of South Carolina [had] so much patronage & power.

	I have only time to write you a line.  We arrtived here safely, but very much fatigued.  I am very sleepy & am going to bed.  Hundreds have been to see me & bother me all  day.  My message is presented & will be read by Willie tomorrow at 12 oclock to the Convention.

	Col. Aldrich introduced firery resolutions which were put down & refused to be printed�had only five votes.  I have telegraphed the President this evening.  

	Your letters have all been distributed.  I saw Dr. LeConte & young Horlbeck.

	It is now ten oclock & I have just returned from dining with Col. Campbell.  Willie has gone to bed.  Tell Fannie that I have the sitting room as my parlor, & the music room on my right as my bed room.  Willie has the opposite music room for his chamber�the parlor between us & doors opening into it.  I am really situated as a Governor should be on the second floor with a fine chamber.�a parlor which is full of visitors from breakfast till bed time.  All the distinguished men of the city & convention have called to see me.This morning General Huger & Chancellor Dunkin called.  The General told me he was a grandfather.  Mrs. Preston has a son. 

	I have never been so constantly engaged before & have had no time to write you or visit anyone.  I have only been out of the Hotel twice since I have been here.  I met Miss Maggie in the Streets & she spoke of going up with me.  I have not seen Lula nor has Willie.

	They said Willie read my message very well.  He has been appointed Chairman of a committee to investigate an election at Beaufort with Henry Gourdine & Col. Ball.  I have just read his report & it is very good.  He submitted a Bill of Rights this morning to the Convention.  So you see he is doing something. 

	My friend Janney & others tell me that it is unanimous that I go into the Senate.  My message has been well recei[ve]d.  Willie has written a letter for the Enterprize.

	I have had a return of my complaint since I came here, but it is over now.  Had a very pleasant dinner party at Col. Campbells this evening.  Saw Mrs. Richard Stone who enquired after you.  Col. Isaac Hayne looks as if he was in the last stage of Consumption.  General Martin wrote to me to give him some message to carry to Washington.  I have not seen or heard from your uncle Arthur.

	Just as I was going to the Convention today in came Janney with a pack of letters & I was kept busy from one till five oclock in reading them.  
	
	The Convention is getting on slowly, but I think will end this session the ensuing week.

	Tell Fannie I rece[ive]d her letter by Mr. Mills.  You may tell the people that the Post Master General has sent me contracts to all the rail Roads for carrying the mail next week.  You will have mails.

	It is so late I must close.  The Hotel is a first class one & the table fine.  Your affectionate husband & Governor, B.F. Perry

	I recei[ve]d your first letter the other day & thank you for it.  I would write oftener but I have not one moment of spare time.  I have only had time to go to the Convention twice.  Tonight the Board of Trustees meet.  I am all my time receiving visits, & signing applications for pardons & reading letters.  The Charleston Courier has published my message with complimentary notice.  I have recei[ve]d two Camden papers highly complimentary which I will send you.

	The Conventiopn is getting on very well & have agreed to most all of my recommendations or will do so.  I have telegraphed the President several times & he is pleased with our proceedings.  I am generally spoken of for U.S. Senator & there seems now no doubt of my election.  Who will be Governor is unknown.

	Willie made a speech the other day in the Convention.  He was chairman of a committee & made a Report.  Then he was called on for an explanation & he had to get up & explain.  He did very well.  I was present.  The Convention sustained his Report by a very close vote 56 to 50.

	Miss Maggie says she will go up with us.  Lula declines.  Willie has been to see both of them.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow.  Give my love to all the children.  I would write you long letters but I have not time.  M. � is absent & I cannot see him about the wheat.  It is foolish to be allarmed about the negroes & asking for a guard.  Your afectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have not heard from you but once.  You might write oftener.  I have no time to write.  From early morn till late at night I am engaged.  I have not had time to pay a single visit.

	The Convention is going on slowly. I do not know when they will adjourn.  Willie made a little speech last night on the representation of the negro in the Legislature.  But the comp[romise was not adopted & he will now vote against the negro representation again as he has been doing with all of his colleagues except Bolling who voted with the lower country on this subject.

	The weather is now pleasant.  We have had very warm weather.  I have very pleasant rooms & a large parlor where I recei[ve] my company.  

	Mr. Henry Heyward called with his application for a pardon & enquired after all of you as old friends.  You will see I have appointed my aids�W.L. Trenholm, General Stephen Elliott, Wade Hampton, Jr., Lieutenant Governor R[obert] F. McCaw of York & General Harrison of Anderson.

	I have appointed Trescott as agent to represent the State at Washington.  

	I must now close & go to breakfast.  Willie made ten dollars in cash yesterday taking charge of an application for pardon.  The members get five dollars a day.  Board is four dollars.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Instead of going to Church I will write you a letter.  My boots hurt my feet so much that I cannot walk well.  Last evening I went with Willie to Dr. LeContes & found it difficult to walk home.  Mrs. LeConte & Lula seemed very glad to see us & were pleasant.  Lula says she cannot return with us.  Her mother says her health is not good & fears an attack of typhoid fever.  Miss Maggie will go up with us & we shall be at home Thursday or Friday.  

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you since Beatty came down.  I have written long letters by � to the President & Seward giving an account of the proceedings of the Convention.  The Convention are doing pretty much all that I requested them to do.  It is pretty well understood that I am to be U.S. Senator.  W.W. Boyce & Governor Manning are talked of as my colleagues, which will be successful is doubtful.  Col. Orr will be Governor.  Col. Farrow, Reed, J.P. Boyce &c. are talked of as candidates for Congress  from our Congressional district which now includes Anderson, Pickens, Greenville, Spartanburgh, Laurens, York & Chester.

	Col. F.J. Moses has got up a Petition for district Judge which is signed by most of the Court.  He called to see me last night & said he supposed I would desire the office and on learning that I was to be sent to the Senate, he had concluded to make application for the Judgeship.

	Barnwell Rhett through his son, desired to know of me what I would require of him in making application for pardon.  I sent word that if he would pledge himself to become, & forever continue a loyal citizen to the U. States, I would favor his application.  I was introduced to Col. Rhett this morning.  Col. William Butler came to me for a letter to Col. Johnson for a position on the Charlotte R[ail] Road.  I gave him a very warm & earnest recommendation for I feel sorry for him.

	Willie has done well in the Convention & is very much esteemed by the members.,  I wish him to go into the Legislature.  The election will take place on the 18th of October & the Legislature wil meet in two days afterwards.

	I hope you & Fannie & the children are getting on well & that your �freedmen� & women are behaving themselves.

	Yesterday I dined with the yankee Generals here at the Hotel & was very much pleased with them.  Brevet Major General Ames is a young & accomplished gentleman.  He called to see me soon after my arrival & met me most cordially.  He comes frequently to my Parlor to give me newspapers and the other night he came to get me to write the President to keep him here.  Yesterday he brought me a parcel of letters to forward by Beattie & I see amongst several to young ladies.  He is a handsome fellow & a graduate of West Point.  General Richardson in command here is a worthy gentleman.

	I have been interrupted by several visits whilst writing.  Mr. Boyce of Fairfield has just left after a long talk about the senate.  He is very anxious to be associated with me in the Senate.  They all seem to admit that I am to be the first elected.  Governor Mannings friends wish him as second Senator as there will be a contest between Boyce & Manning.  It is also said that General Hamptons friends are wishing to bring him forward.

	They have all come home from church & I must close my letter by signing myself your affectionate husband & requesting you to give my love to Fannie & all the children.  B.F. Perry

	I have just received your letter dated Friday & Saturday enclosing one to Lula which I gave Willie to deliver.

	I wrote you yesterday all the news I had.  In the evening I went to see Mrs. Herbemont who lives close by the Hotel & sent word by Col. Childs that I must call.  I saw her and her mother in law & spent twenty or thirty minutes very pleasantly with them.  She has two exquisitely beautiful mosaic marble tables purchased in Italy.  Col. Childs bought one & I took the other for Fannie $35.00.  It is worth two or three hundred dollars.  Mrs. Herbemont leaves tomorrow for the north & has sold her House to Col. Childs.  The table will remain with the Col. till the Rail Road is completed.  It is round with a chess�top of beautiful mosaic�.  It is really a curiosity & so cheap that I was tempted to buy it as a present for Fannie. 

	I have juist rece[ive]d the New York Herald & Tribune containing my message.  The former is complimentary & the latter abusive on account of excluding negro suffrage.  Governor Pickens, Governor Manning, W.W. Boyce & Col. J.B. Campbell are all spoken of for the Senate but all admit that I am first to be elected & each one wishes to be my colleague.  This is very grattifying .  Col. [Christopher William] Dudley has written an article nominating me for the Senate.

	The Convention will probably adjourn Tuesday night & if so I will get off Wednesday & be at home Thursday if not Friday.

       Mr. Heyward called this morning & sent his ciompliments to all of you.

	I arrived here Tuesday morning with General Easley very much fatigued.  Mr. Janney brought me a half bushel of letters which I opened & read till ten oclock except when interrupted by visitors.  General Hampton called to see & consult with me.  He is much troubled, & sincerely afraid he is elected Governor.  The election is still in great doubt.  I told him if elected he must serve.  Col. Orr is not here.  Mr. Trenholm called to see me this morning & to express his thanks for getting him released.  Governor Bonham & General Butler got me to telegraph the President for their pardons.  General Kershaw & Col. Townes have just called to inform me that the Senate had elected Col. Moses President & General Martin Clerk & were ready to receive my message.  The House have elected Col. Aldrich Speaker & Col. Sloan Clerk & are now voting for other officers.

	Col. Trescot asked me if I had taken a House in Washington!  He said there was no doubt of my election.  I have not yet heard any opposition.  I will send you the New York news in which there is a compliment to me as the U.S. Senator &c.

	After opening about Fifty letters yesterday evening & giving up all hope of receiving my check, it so happened the last letter opened contained it.  It would have been the first if I had known it.  But they deducted $30 for income tax & sent only $720.

	Today I have been very busy in writing letters and approving pardons all day except when visitors were present.  The Dr. LeContes came & paid me a long friendly visit.  Mrs. LeConte & Lula are quite well.  Mr. � gave me a bundle from Miis Buist which I will send by the first opportunity.  Mr. Janney expressed great thanks for our kindness to his daughter & son.  He goes to New York on Monday.

	Willie got here this morning & will have the same rooms.  Hammet[t], Goodwin & Price & Townes came down with him.  Col. Townes lost his new hat on the cars�blown off his head.   

	I rece[ive]d a visit this morning from the Brother of Governor [Francis R.] Lubbock of Texas.  He brought me a beautiful letter from the Governors wife which I will send you asking me to intercede with the President for her husband, who is in prison & paying me a very high compliment.   I have written a long letter to the President. 

	Col. Isaac Hayne is gradually sinking.  His son is running for reading Clerk of the Senate.  My message will be read by Willie in both Houses tomorrow.  General Easley pronounces it the best Governors message he ever read.

	Campbell, Boyce, Pickens & Trescot & perhaps Manning & Bonham are running for Senate.

	I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I am overwhelmed with business & have but a few minutes to write you.  I sent in my message in first was read by Willie & is printed in the Columbia Paper.  The reporters have sent copies to Charleston & elsewhere.  This morning I have sent another message transmitting a�Code of Laws prepared by Judge Wardlaw and Mr. Burt.  The message yesterday is highly approved.  I hear of no opposition to my election.  But great electioneering for Trescott & Campbell for the other Senatorship.

	I have nothing worth writing.  Your letter by � was rece[ive]d this morning & the letters by Porcher were rece[ive]d yesterday.  Willie went to see Miss Horlbeck yesterday but I shall not be able to see her.  I have been nowhere hardly out of the Hotel.  Letters & visitors are coming to me all day & I have to do all my writing as Willie is in the Legislature.  He seems to be doing well & I think enjoys himself here.  I am glad he is here in the way of�.

	Miss Buist sent on the other packet & a letter for you which I will enclose.  The package I will send up by the first opportunity.

	General Hampton called to see me again yesterday & said he should consult & advise with me very often.  He is elected I suppose.  I told him he must accept the office of Governor.  He approved the Presidents policy & will do all that I could wish.

	Mr. Burt is going up this morning & will carry my letter to Belton.  Your letter by Col. Lubbock was read this morning & I was glad to hear from you.  Sell the Beef as soon as you can, it will grow poor.

	The election of Senator takes place Monday at one oclock, so before you receive this it will be over.  I don�t think there is any doubt of my success.  But there is as great deal of manuvering & electioneering.  Some of the Parish members will not vote for me.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula yesterday.  They are so violent that I was displeased.  I read a letter from Mrs. Keith the most violent I ever read towards the yankees.  She says they may take all of her property before she will take the oath of allegiance or bow to Andy Johnson.  She was very kind in her remembrance of you.  I telegraphed the President for a Pardon for Governor Bonham & General M. Butler & yesterday [and] rece[ive]d a reply that they were pardoned.  I then sent a long telegraph to the President for General Hampton.  The General is a strong administration man.  He told me he was always opposed to the secession & was for maintaining our rights in the union.  He says he shall counsel & advise with me in all matters.    

	Tell Mr. Grady the check has come in & if he wishes me I can send it to�for him. Or send it up by the first safe opportunity.  Willie is quite well & was getting on pleasantly.  I have spent my time very pleasantly.  I will send you a paper.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you yesterday & sent the letter by Mr. Raymond enclosing a check for Mr. Grady.  I hope you have received the letter & handed the check to Grady. There will be a balance due me on the check which you can get if you need money.  But be careful in spending for it is a hard matter to get money [in] these times.  I have not spent a cent since I have been in Columbia.

	I am writing you at the hour of one, the hour fixed for voting for Senate.  If the Legislature goes into the election I will keep my letter open to write you the result which may be for me or against.  It is all uncertain in Elections.  Now we are informed that Col. Orr is elected Governor!  Saturday it was positively assumed trhat General Hampton was elected & I telegraphed the President immediately explaining the course of the election & assuring him that politics had nothing to do with it.  I likewise requested him to pardon General Hampton.  He telegraphed me yesterday that he had pardoned him as I requested it.  So General Hampton has got his pardon by my mistake & solicitation.  I am glad of it.  Hampton is a noble gentleman.

	Yesterday morning Mrs. Pickens came down and immediately sent General Butler to me for an interview with her.  She wanted me to telegraph the President for Gov. Pickens which I did, but have not yet heard from the President.  She seened very much pleased and expressed herself under great obligations to me & did not know how to repay my kindness.  Her health is very much improved & She is looking very pretty.  The impression is that she came down to electioneer for her husband for Senator.  She has had a great many of the members to see her.  Tillman the Senator from Edgefield told me yesterday that he was going to tell Mrs. Pickens he should vote for me for the long term.  Campbell & Manning have both said they would not oppose me.  It is said Bonham & Boyce have agreed to unite their forces & run Boyce in opposition to me.  But I don�t know that there is any truth in it.

	I saw Mr. Legare today who enquired after Mrs. Mathews & Mrs. McColl.  He had a petition for me to sign about a man who was convicted of killing a negro.

	I will now conclude & add a postscript about the election if it takes place.  Your affectionate husband.  My love to Fannie & the children.  Willie is well & doing well.  B.F. Perry

P.S. I am elected for the long term U.S. Senator.  I send you the Ballot.  Also the ballot for the short term.  I think Manning will be elected.  B.F. Perry

	I wrote you a letter this morning giving you an account of the election of Governor Manning.  I have nothing to do this evening & will write you again.  The election of Manning & myself seems to have given very general satisfaction.I heard of several persons remarking that South Carolina would have two of the finest looking Senators of any state in the Union.  This however would be a poor compliment for a Senator.  He should have talents, ability�& patriotism.  Personal appearance is a matter of small consideration.  Governor Manning is not much of a debater and I shall have to speak for the State.  He says he can do something by conversation & management.

	General McGowan has just been in to see me.  He will be elected to the House & enquired if I was going to take my family.  He thinks we had better go on first & see if we are admitted to our seats & then come home and get our families.  You will think there are bright visions, living in Washington!  How are we to get money?  But I must continue to practice law when at home &make something additional.

	I am anxious now to return home and will do so as soon as I can.  But at present I am waiting to hear from the President, and attend to other matters.  General Hampton called to see me & thank me for getting his pardon, but he said as I obtained it through a mistake I ought to tell the President not to send it.  I told him I would do no such thing.  The election of Governor was still in some doubts.  Orr is, however, probably elected, but it will remain somewhat uncertain till the fourth Monday in November when the vote will be counted.  It is now past ten oclock & I will go to bed.

	Oct. [Nov.] 2nd�This is a gloomy day raining & I have nothing to do & nothing to read.I feel like going home.  It is said there is strong probability of the Legislature adjourning in a day or two�perhaps tomorrow.  But I hope not.  They ought to stay & do their business.  I have just been to breakfast & read the morning papers.  I cannot go out of the Hotel for the rain.  Visitors are not so numerous.  The election of Judges will come off today & tomorrow.  General Kershaw who nominated me for the Senate when they were going to vote  will be elected Chancellor.  Dawkins, Moses, Fair, Sullivan, Thomson, Arthur, Lesesne, Melton & Aldrich.

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday & I suppose you rece[ive]d mine last night announcing what was to you very good news.  The election of myself to the U. States Senate by such a large majority 109 votes was indeed most grattifying.  The Parish members did not vote for me & thru away their votes on Governor Manning to damage him in the next election with my friends.  Gov. Manning heard of it the over night & sent me word that he did not & would not oppose me.  Still when the election came on the Greenville delegation did not vote for him in consequence.  But as soon as they understood the trick of Col. Campbells friends they went for Manning.  This morning Campbell & Trescot have withdrawn & will run Col. Dawkins.  But I think Manning will beat him.  If I hear the result in time I will write a postscript to this letter.

	You ought now my dear wife to be happy after the honor bestowed on me.  I am Senator for six years & the other Senator will only be for two years.  There was so much intriguing by all, that it is remarkable that I ran so well.  But some have shown very little grattitude in voting against me.  Col. [Charles Henry] Simonton  whom I had released from Prison & who called to see me in the Convention to express his grattitude voted against me.  So did Buist, Frank Porcher, Col. Davant & Townsend.  The latter I had done much for in trying to get back his lands.  But there is very little grattitude in public life.  Some of the Parish members voted for me, Dozier & Shaw &c.

	I have rece[ive]d several telegrams from President Johnson, but nothing about Governor Pickens pardon.  Mrs. Pickens is still here & has a dozen beaux around her.  But influence could not elect her husband.  She has great fascination of Manning & so pretty that I thought she would work wonders in electioneering.

	I will now conclude and write a P. Script if possible.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I am grattified to inform you that Gov. Manning has been elected my associate in the Senate over Col. Dawkins.  The vote was 95 to 50.  I did not think it right to manuver as they did against Manning.  I am very kind towards Dawkins.  
	Ch[ancellor] Dunkin is Chief Justice.  I shall run home some day soon to see you.  B.F.P.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you brace yourself up to hear my defeat in the best way you can.  This is very well on your part & you say further that you will not love me the less if defeated.  I hope now, my dear wife, you will love me the more, for my success, & feel proud that your husband is both Governor & United States Senator at the same time.  I do not know or feel at all changed by my new honors.  My feelings, hopes, manners & expectations are the same, & if I had been defeated it would not have cost me a moments uneasiness except on your account.  But I am elected & you ought to be happy & make everybody about you happy because you felt so much interest in the matter.

	I am glad to have Governor Manning as my Colleague.  He is a cordial warm hearted gentleman of good judgement & good principles.  He was once a Union man & his Father was a Union leader in 1832 & my friend.  Campbells friends offered to vote for me if I would vote for Campbell.  Then they voted for Manning & ran him in opposition to me in order to damage him with my friends & keep them from voting for him in opposition to Campbell for the short Senatorial term.  And they succeeded  in making the entire Greenville delegation & Spartanburgh vote against Manning the first time.  I knew the trick for Manning had informed me of it.  Col. Aldrich voted against me & Siegling, Miss Maggie�s cousin.  There was a great deal of manuvering & trickery, & would have been more if they had not known my strength in the Legislature.  Manning, Campbell, Trescott, Bonham & Dawkins all voted for me & they were all candidates & members of the Legislature.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

	I wrote you two letters yesterday & as the mail goes out this evening I will write you again.

	If possible I will return home Tuesday evening to greet you & the family & receive your congratulations.  I hope you are now happy & I am now anxious to receive your letter tomorrow morning & learn what you have to say about my election.  All sorts of compliments are paid me by letters & the newspapers on my complimentary vote.  Buist paid me a very high compliment yesterday in the Senate for patriotism, honor, talents &c. but he did not vote for me.  It is amazing to hear so many compliments to Gov. Manning & myself on account of our good looks.  You woiuld suppose that we were elected on that account.

	This morning I rece[ive]d one hundred & forty Pardons which has put everybody in a good humor.  My pardon was amongst them�also General Thompsons�, Elford, Grady�s, Stokes, Donaldson &c.  You may tell them.  But poor Mrs. Pickens goes off today without hearing anything about Governor Pickens pardon.

	Willie was invited by Miss Martin to tea.  I think she is in love with him.  He went & found a few persons there�General Kershaw, Wade Hampton, Jr &c.  Her father is a Methodist Preacher.  She is very pretty & smart.  She wrote him a note.

	Give my love to all.  I wrote to T� Tupper for your mother.  He is in Charleston.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to git off this evening & will therefore write you a line.  I may be up Wednesday or Thursday.  I am very anxious to return home & see you all.  And I was�disappointed not hearing from you since my election.  I flattered myself that I would receive one of the prettiest & most affectionate letters you had ever written�that you would be so much grattified & so happy that your letter would make me happy.  But not a line from you!  But for Mr. Elfords letter I should have been uneasy.  He wrote me you said Thursday morning  that you were all well.  If I had been defeated for the Senate, I am sure you would have written me & given me a stern scolding, instead of consoling me in my misfortunes.

	I am waiting on the Legislature & the President.  The Legislature are about passing some Resolutions which I must attend to and I have telegraphed the President & wait his answer.

	`Mr. Buist came down again last evening & congratulated me most cordially on my election�so handsomely made.  Buist & myself have always been congenial spirits.  He spends most of his time in my room.  If the Provisional governorship is continued I will have him my successor.

	I have nothing new to write you & only write to keep you from being uneasy.  Your loving & affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a line although I have nothing to tell you.  Our journey down was fatiguing, but otherwise pleasant.  Met Col. Orr at Belton & Mr. Alex Robertson & his daughter at the Greenville Depot.  All pleasant.  Fannie staid at Nickersons all night & Miss Janney came for her.  Mr. Janney gave me a long account of his visit to the President.  He said the President  immediately asked �How is your friend Gov. Perry.�  

	The votes for Governor are being counted.  Col. Orr read me his Inaugural in case he is elected.  It is a very good one.  I have left him nothing to say in his message.

       General Hampton called to see me last night & sat a long time.  He is somewhat afraid that he may be elected.  The Governor will be Inaugurated tomorrow whoever he may be.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from Gov. Pickens.  He is allarmed about his pardon.  Gov. Manning has gone on the where his wife is in Virginia & requested me to bring his commission.  I shall remain here till I hear from the President.  Gov. Aiken, General McGowan, Col. Farrow & Genl Kennedy are elected to Congress.

	Willie & Easley are boarding at Mrs. Caldwells, & I do not see much of them.  Dunkin called to see me this morning.  There was no quorum in the Legislature till today.

	Mr. Janney called to see me this morning & said Fannie & his daughter were going down to the State House�the old College chapel�that he had a parcel of young friends at his house last night.  Seigling carried a letter to Fannie from Maggie.  

	I will send your mothers money by Holland Friday or Saturday from Charleston.

	Write me whenever you can.  Fannie will write you often I suppose & her letters will be more interesting than mine.  

	Give my love to the children & tell them to be good & study hard.

	The New York Papers are still full of Governor Perry & South Carolina.  I will send you some of them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Your letter of Monday has just been received.  I am glad you are so well pleased with your new Servant.  I hope you will continue pleased & that Laura may find a home elsewhere.  Let Lindys husband take Emma  if he wishes her  He may be able to do a better�by her than Lindy can.  I wish he would take Lindy also. But I suppose he has another wife.

	The Inauguration of Governor Orr took place yesterday  & I send you our speeches.  Fannie was present.  Young Wade Hampton my aid came to me & asked if my daughter was with me & that he would call & see her last night before he left for Louisiana today.  I told Fannie.

	There was a great crowd at the Inauguration.  The President says the South Carolina members had better wait till Congress organized.  His son in law Judge Patterson told Trescott he was very anxious to see me & for me to come on, that he thought the Senate would admit me.

	I am undecided yet about going on or coming home.  Shall hear again soon from the President.  Saw Willie this morning.  He says the members were more pleased with my speech than Gov. Orrs.

	It may be that Orr & myself will go to Charleston tomorrow to see General Grant.

	Write me whenever you can.  I sent by Steen $50 to your mother from Tupper & would have written but have not time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I received your letter this morning & was glad to hear from you.  I hope you will git all the corn you possibly can & let Wiley haul it whilst the roads are good.  

	You need not trouble yourself about legislation or politics for you always see trouble where there is none.  Give yourself no concern about the stay laws, or thousand propositions you will see in the newspapers.  

	I am not able to say when I shall go to Washington or Greenville.  I came very near going to Charleston this morning to see General Grant & Sickles.  Gov. Orr went.  I was afraid dispatches might arrive from trhe President in my absence.

	Last evening I dined with General Hampton & spent a very pleasant evening with the General & his lady, Gov. Orr, Lt. Gov. Porter, Speaker Aldrich,  Col. Haskel[l] & Lowndes.  Tomorrow I dine with General Easley at Mrs. Caldwells where he & Willie are boarding.  They had a party there last night & Fannie was at it.  I have not seen her since.  Col. Harris met me today & said my daughter was unmistakable looking so much like me.  No one could fail to know whose daughter she was.  He said his daughter was going to call on her.

	Mrs. Hampton euquired about you.  In speaking of her father Gen. McDuffie she did not seem to know much about him!  She did not know that he was wounded twice by Col. Cumming.  She asked me if he was wounded in the first or second duel.  She is very much broken & looks old & as thin as a�.  I sent her today a newspaper containing Bill Arps last article which she wished to see.

	General Easley is going to have all my messages published in a pamphlet by order of the Legislature.  My farewell has drawn forth great praise.  Col. Orr is going to appoint Willie one of his aids with the rank of Colonel.  But I have not yet mentioned it to Willie.

	I went down to the State House today, saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula in the Gallery but did not go up to speak to them.  The two Dr. Lecontes came to speak to me & chatted some time.

	The Board of Trustees meet this evening.  Col. Farrow is going on to Washington on Monday next & perhaps General McGowan.  

	Mr. Holland goes up tomorrow & I will send this letter by him.

	I must now close as it is getting dark.

	I wish you would take my safe keys and look in an old pocket book in the money till & get my certificate of being a Rail Road director & enclose to me in your next letter.  If I go to Washington I shall want it to keep from paying rail road fare.  In opening the safe you had better get Mr. Swandale to show you how you take the steel key with the figures to the right & press it in till the handle turns.  Then the brass key opens the till drawer.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter of Sunday morning in which you regret I am no longer Provisional Governor.  How apt you are to make mistakes.  It seems you always construe everything of a public nature wrong.  I am still Provisional Governor & afraid I shall have to remain so for some time yet.  In my address which you read. I state that hereafter I will communicate with Gov. Orr instead of the Legislature�that is all.  I telegraphed the President  to let me turn the government over to Gov. Orr & he will not even answer my request.  He has telegraphed me since, but says nothing about Gov. Orr, or my quitting the office,  I shall have to continue how long I know not.  The President telegraphed me that it was not necessary for the S.C. members to be there at the organization of Congress.  But Col. Farrow has gone on & took my account to git the money due me $1300.  Gov. Manning & Aiken are both going on.  As soon as I hear that I will be allowed to take my seat I will go, but not till then.  If not relieved, I will then resign my Governorship.

	We are all anxiety to see the Presidents Message.  It is the most important paper ever deleivered by a President for woe or weal to the South.  I still have confidence in Johnson & believe that all will come right.  

	I did not go to Charleston.  Gov. Orr went.  General Sickles had prepared a quiet dinner for General Grant, Gov. Perry & Gov. Orr and the citizens wished to give us a dinner but Grant declined.  Orr said General Grant assured him all the negro troops should be removed to the garrisons in the Forts.  General Sickles was very kind & favorable.  His wife is not with him.  Gov. Orr came back yesterday, says he saw my�in Charleston.  Gov. Magrath is to be here.  His recent letter has disgusted his friends in Charleston.  

	Governor  Pickens has written me two long letters.  He is very much allarmed at not being pardoned.  He enclosed me a letter to the President, & I am afraid he will keep reminding the President of his case, till something will be done with him.  He is very much like you.  You are some kin I believe.

	I send you Mrs. Keith�s letter.  She is getting nervous too.  I wrote her a beautiful letter, defending President Johnson & cheering her up as to the condition of the Country.  I advised her to go to Philadelphia for a change.  She wants society.  

	Carter Pool has offered me a fine riding horse whenever I wish it.  I took a long ride Sunday with General Easley.  Met Fannie coming from church.  In the evening Col. Dawkins & myself went up to see her.  Mr. Janney treated us to wine, brandy apples, cheese, crackers &c.  Yesterday I went to the Senate & met Fannie with Mrs. LeConte & Lula.  She dined with them.  I dined with General Easley, Genl Butler, General Kershaw and others at Mrs. Caldwells.  Then went at night to Janneys where there was a party.  This morning I went with Mr. Lord & others  to see General Ames & git him to have the State Archives sent back from Yorkville to Columbia.  He kindly agreed to furnish ten wggons & teams to haul them.  Lord & � were very much impressed with his politeness.  Mrs. LeConte seemed very friendly & kind to Fannie & myself.  She is afraid they will have to go to Louisiana to live.  The College here will not support them.  The Trustees meet tomorrow evening again.

	Tell Mrs. Butler I have not heard anything of her�.  The other day I rece[ive]d from Philadelphia a letter to General Butler�perhaps from his sister.  General Martin told me that his sister Mrs. Bostick had opened a Boarding House in Washington for Southern members & wished me to stay with her. 

	Birnie goes up in the morning & I will send you some papers.  Fannie has one containing a handsome compliment to me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Your long letter of Tuesday was rece[ive]d this morning.  Instead of scolding you I approve of your horse trade & think you have done well.  But now you must make Wiley sell his mare & dispose of Wagner.  Two horses are as many as I can afford to keep.  

	I have written to Mr. Buist in reply to his letter to me that I would take greenbacks if paid this year, & that he might pay the money to Grady who would git his note of you.  It is in my note packet book in my safe.  I owe Grady, & will be glad to pay him.  He can act as my banker & pay off several little notes I have given for corn &c. & furnish you with money as you may need it.

	I went with Fannie & Miss Janney to the State House this morning & there saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula.  We spent the morning pleasantly & several of our friends came to speak to us.  The girls went to visit Miss Gibbes and I returned to the Hotel.  Mrs. Joseph LeConte told me they had a likeness of me in Harpers or Leslies illustrated paper.  But that it was a very poor likeness.  I and the Governor of New Jersey were together.  I have not seen the print.  

	I hope to hear something definite from Washington this week so as to either go on to Washington or return home next week.  The Presidents Message is good, very good, but the first days proceedings in Congress are bad, bad.  I think however Johnson will be able to control a majority of the members.

	I am glad to know that Hext & Ben are willing to work & make money.  But it will be better for them to continue at school for the present.  Let Hayne & Hext both go to Mr. Anderson.

	I have just had a visit from Col. Childs & Mr. Rufus Johnston though it is now after eleven oclock in the night.  They came to git me to give a certificate for General Butler to General Johnston for an appointment in the Express Company which I did with great pleasure.  Col. Childs says my letter to him when he went north gave him credit & entre everywhere�that I was well known.  Rufus Johnston said no one was more talked of in New York.

	I will write you a few lines by mail.  No one went up this morning, as I would have sent you a bundle of papers, which you might have loaned to your friends.

	I received a kind telegram last night, from the President saying he was gratified at the reception of his message un S.C. that he would send me in a few days instructions as to my being retained as Provisional Governor & that Congress would move off all right in twoor three days.

	I have just communicatred this news to Governor Orr who is delighted.  He says he wishes very much that he had brought his daughter down with him�that she & Fannie would have staid at Col. Childs with Mrs. Herbemont & had a delightful time.  He is staying there.

	I have just see Mr. Janney.  Fannie sent for your letters to read.    The package came safe.

	As soon as I receive my instructions I will return home and give up the State to Gov. Orr.  Then I will go on to Washington.  Willie is quite well.  Fannie was invited to a party at Mrs. LeContes last night. But the rain prevented her going.  She is quite well.

	The Legislature has agreed to adjourn this day (Tuesday) week.  The Judges are to be elected tomorrow.  It is thought Dawkins, Moses, & Presley will be elected.

	I have just returned from Col. Childs where I dined with Gov. Orr, Gov. Bonham & others.  After dinner, Fannie & Miss Janney, Mrs. LeConte & Lula, Mrs. Caldwell & her sisters, Mrs. Gibbes & a few gentlemen were invited to meet me.  It is now eleven oclock in the night.  I went with Fannie & Miss Janney to the State House today & saw them vote for Judges�Dawkins, Moses & Aldridge were elected law Judges.  [William Dalrymple] Johnson of Marlborough &[Henry Deas] Lesesne of Charleston were elected Chancellors.  Col. Fair ran well & so did Presley, but Sullivan only got eight votes.  Col. Melton came within three votes of being elected Chancellor.

	I rece[ive]d your letters written Friday and Sunday.  Sorry to hear of your troubles with servants.  Let Wiley do as he pleases.  He will take care of everything & manage well.  I am under obligations to him for his fidelity to Willie & wish him to stay with me & do as he pleases.

	You must not worry about politics.  I think everything is going on well, & Johnson will carry out his policy.  I have entire confidence in him.  We may be kept out of Congress for a while.  But as the President said to me in a telegram Congress will move off all right in a short time.  I care nothing about Summer & Wilson.  

	I will send you a bundle of papers.  Mrs. King is writing for the Courier.  In one of her letters she congratulates me for my course in Charleston Convention.  Tell Mrs. Butler, General Ames has no power to give her transportation.  As soon as I hear from President Johnson again I will return home.  General Martin wishes me to carry his daughter to Washington when I go.  I gave your letters to Fannie to read today.  I wrote Mr. Barnwell a long letter about the college.  The Trustees will now meet & elect Professors.  The affair between Campbell & Warley was settled the next day.  Fannie will probably go with Mr. Cuttino & his wife to Aiken, or with Martin to Charleston.  But she will write as to her movements.  She seems to enjoy herself.  Willie is quite well.  I have written Buist to pay the money.  I sent you Harper & you sent it to me.  The likeness is pretty good.  You must read Mr. Pinckneys Sermon in the Courier.  It is admirable.  The churches in Columbia were not opened on thanksgiving day.  How�like.  Mr. Jordan Pool is here sick, but improving.  

	I must now go to bed.  Do not worry yourself with the servants or about politics.  Take care of the Children & make them read & study.  You ought to be happy & contented with a loving & honored husband, promising children, comfortable situation with friends &c.  Do not let trifles & worthless servants distract you, & politics which you know nothing about, worry you.  Look on the bright side of the pictures of life.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I am waiting for the mails & at twelve oclock I go with Fannie to the State House.  This evening I dine witrh James Gibbes where I shall meet Governor Orr, Col. Childs & others.  Whilst waiting for the mail I will write you a letter.  But I have already been interrupted by visitors & may not be able to write you much.  

	I hope to hear this morning from the President.  I think I shall be at home Tuesday night whether I hear or not.  I wish to hear before the crowd.  The Legislature adjourns Tuesday.  It may be that I shall have to stay to meet the Board of Trustees Monday night.  If so I will be at home Wednesday night.  I hope to hear from you this morning & will write a Post receipt if I do when I return from Gibbes.

	Fannie was at a dancing party at Dr. Fishers last night & also invited to a simillar party at Mrs. Caldwells.  Willie was invited to Dr. Fishers, but had to meet the Legislature & thern be at Mrs. Caldwells.  The weather is extremely cold.  

	Last night Governor Magrath called to see me & sat an hour or trwo.  He looked well & seemed in good spirits�says he was treated with every courtesy & kindness.  Mr. Alfred Huger came to see me yesterday & sat a long time.  He said Mr. Izardrequested him to thank me for all of my kindness in relation to his pardon.

	Yesterday as I was going to the Book store I met Fannie & Miss Janney.  They had been out shopping & Col. Childs & Gov. Orr met them, & carried them to the Senate.

	I have just returned from James Gibbes dinner.  After writing the above, my visitors stopped me altogether.  Then Fannie called for me to go to the State House.  We staid there two hours & saw a great many friends.  I was introduced to two of Chancelor [James Parsons] Carrolls daughters�very interesting ytoung ladies.  They called to see Fannie yesterday.

	On my return from the State H[ouse], Bishop [Patrick Nelson] Lynch  called to see me & stayed till I started to Gibbes.  I was very much pleased with him.  His brother Dr. Lynch came with him.

	The dinner at Gibbes was a magnificent & joyous one.  His wife & three sisters from Mobile were present.  Orr, Childs, Melton, Richardson, Sprimgs, Johnson &c.   The�wines delicious.  The young ladies most agreeable, & they have the reputation of being pretty fast.  Mrs. Gibbes is handsome & very pleasant.  Let me give you a Bill of fare�turtle soup, fish, oysters, wild turkey, mutton, ham, mince pyes, puddings,�pine apples, oranges, raisins, almonds &c. &c.

	This is a dreadful day, & I have just been to see Fannie.  Willie came this morning & relieved me.  I thought Fannie went to Mrs. Caldwells last night & would have to walk home through the sleet & mud.    But she had good sense enough not to venture out.  Today she was to have dined with Mrs. LeConte, but the weather was too bad.  I met her however coming down to see me, as I went up to see her.    She has not heard yet from the Crofts, & it will cost thirty or forty dollars to get there with Cuttino & his wife.  I told her she had better go to Charleston & see the Crofts as she returns.  Mr. Porter is expecting his daughter here from Chester, to go down with him & offered this evening to take charge of Fannie & likewise return her hospitality to his family whilst she remained in Town.  I will see Fannie tomorrow & arrange.  Mr. Porter called this evening to get me to nominate George Bryant for district Judge.   Moses having been elected Judge now declines the appointment.  I made the nomination.  The members of the Legislature had already signed Bryants recommendation.

	I shall leave here Friday morning & reach home Wednesday night.  Gordon Pool  goes up in the morning & will carry this letter.  I have not been relieved yet by the President as Provisional Governor, so you will have the pleasure of meeting me still as Governor.  I begin to think that he does not intend to relieve me till Congress admits me as Senator.  I am still hopeful of getting my seat in a few weeks. 

	I am glad Wiley has parted with his mare & hope that Morgan will learn to draw well.  I will take a bowl of Wards whiskey.  The other matters in your letter we will talk about on my return home.  I am delighted at the idea of going home instead of going to Washington.  The truth is I had rather be with you & the children than to be in Washington with all the great men of the country.  I am sure I shall have to return home often unless you go on with me.

       I saw � Butler here this evening & he says he is going to Greenville in a day or two.
       
       In regard to the yankee troops General Ames has no power to remove them, but I think they will all be removed pretty soon.  Whilst they remain in Greenville it is best to have no difficulty with them.  They had a serious difficulty at Union & one yankee was killed & two wounded.  These unfortunate occurences will prevent their speedy removal.  
       
       Willie & [Henry Pinckney] Hammett made speeches last night, so Hammett tells me, against the tax of $250  on each Still, but the tax passed.  This will make whiskey very dear.  I suppose they thought their constituents were interested in defeating so extravagant a tax.  

	Now my dear wife goodnight.  Fannie rece[ive]d your letter, your mothers and one from Mattie Orr today.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	We arrived here safely in three days after a most fatiguing trip travelling night & day.  But we had a great deal of pleasant enjoyment in talking & eating & drinking.  In Richmond I purchased a very fine sack Coat $39�beaver cloth &�$18, cravat $1.50 & gloves $2.00.  Immediately on my arrival here I went to see the Secretary of War.  He rece[ive]d me very kindly and paid me in money my account $1520.  The gold note $285, another note of $200 lost.  �of $200 borrowed of Ferguson when I went to Columbia--$25 for the horse & $20�you have received.  I was delighted to git the money but grieved to have to part with the greater part of it immediately.

	My arrival was announced in the National Intelligencer & Trescott & Buist came immediately to see me & said I had arrived just in time to be�.  They state most�in reference tp the s[e]izure of lands &c.  They insisted on my going with them forthwith to see the President.  When we got there, a large crowd had assembled in the East Room.  It was the Christian Society for the relief of Soldiers.  The President came down to meet them & made a speech.  In it he said his policy embraced all the states & he knew no section.  On retiring he came up to me  & said he was much grattified to see me.  I said I wished to have some conversation with him & he told me to call tomorrow Sunday morning when he would be at leisure.  He told me about the Black republicans sending Fred[erick] Douglass & a force of negroes to make a speech to him.  He said it was the most trying scene he had ever passed through, but that he kept his temper.  His reply was most admirable.  He looks very well & is a most wonderful man.  I shall have a long chat with him tomorrow in company with Trescot & Buist.  

	Tonight I have just learned that he will veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill.  This will be a great & unexpected boon to the South & requires more nerve than I thought he possessed.  But he is a wonderful man, & looks only to the interest of the whole country.  Black republicans will be furious & the lands will now have to be restored in the lower country.  The state works at Greenville will be given up by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Trescot told him I was here & that I had transferred the works to Gov. Orr instread of selling them to defray the expenses of the Convention.  The Secretary then said he would abandon them.

	I went to the Senate this morning & gave Reverdy Johnson my commission to present, which seemed to impress him.  He called this evening to see me.  I have just made the acquaintance of the Alabama Senators Parsons & Houston.  The crowd here is immense.  Willards is full to overflowing.  Tell Willie I have purchased a very fine hat for him.  I went into a singular store today where everything was a dollar.  I purchased a beautiful cup as pretty as silver one dollar, a Book full of photographs with a gold clasp for a dollar.  Then I was entitled to two draws in a lottery.  I drew a little silver Bell & a necklace.  The thing is a mystery.  I will have my photograph taken full length for $3 & then $1.50  for all copies afterwards�little ones taken for three cents by the hundred. 

	In visiting the Capitol I was shocked to see ragged, dirty, stinking black negroes mixing in the galleries.  They go into the Senate gallery & sit & sleep &�the whole House!

	I have subscribed for the Nationasl Intelligencer.  You must preserve the papers that come in in my absence.  I think I shall return the week after next.

Elford & myself went & she had procured a carriage was magnificently dressed & said she had not been to any of the President�s Services for want of a suitable escort.  She & I walked all over the rooms.  I introduced her to the President & his daughters.  There were two thousand persons present.  Such a jam you never saw.  We were much noticed, & Col. Elford said he heard the remarks made very often walking behind us �there goes the governor of South Carolina.�  I met Mr. Bancroft & had a long chat with him.  Mr. Washington came up and spoke to me & several others who remembered me in the Charleston Convention.  I saw & conversed with General Butler & Senator [Henry] Wilson of Massachusetts.  They were polite.  I have met Randal Hunt of New Orleans.  He says � is pardoned & living in New Orleans.  Judge Patterson is very kind to me & his wife is pleasant & also Mrs. S�.  I have become acquainted with governor [William Lewis] Sharkey, Gov. Parsons & Gov. M�.  Governor Sharkey told me that W[illiam] H[enry] Foote had just published a book in which he & myself were compared.  A Bookman has presented me with a copy of the work.  This morning The Chronicle announced that governor Perry of S.C. had an interview with the President yesterday.  I have written a long article for the National Intelligencer which will make a noise tomorrow morning, in the political world.  Last night Miss Sallie Martin sent for me to join a pleasant party at her uncles, but it was so cold I declined going.  I will call to see her today.  I have bought you�.  I have got a full length Photograph likeness & smaller ones all fourteen dollars as a present for you of myself.  I got the President yesterday to sign an order for five hundred pardons for South Carolina & today I have sent for another order for two or three hundred more.  Col. Elford is having them executed & will bring them home.  I rerce[ive]d a letter this morning from Miss Simons & I have got her pardon.  There are about one thousand persons at Willards Hotel & the ladies all ugly.  Yesterday, at the White House, I saw an exceedingly beautiful young gentleman step into the room, dressed in cloth pants and sack coat, fair, ruddy & lovely complexion soft beaming eyes with a lovely smile�& a fancy hat  on his head.  I thought to myself your face gracefull person and winning manners will play mischief with these young ladies.  As he came near me I thought of M� in Bulwers �Strange Story.�  There was a perfect�about his air & expression, high bred manners &c.  I fouind out it was Miss Walker a doctor in the United States Army, who had been twice captured by the�!  Col. Elford says he feels sick, & wishes to send for her.  I shall leave here Monday or Tues.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning enclosing Fannies & H�.  I began to think I should not hear from you.  I gave me great pleasure to receive a line from you.

	I shall try & leave here Tuesday morning & reach home Thursday or Friday.  I went to see the President yesterday but there was such a crowd I had very little conversation.  He said he would try & see me before I left.  I met Mrs. Senator Clay of Alabama at the White House and spent an hour with her whilst waiting to see the President.  Her husband is confined a prisoner at Fortreess Monroe.  She is one of the most intellectual women I ever met, a noble lady & devoted wife.  She seemed pleased when I introduced myself to her & told me all her history & troubles & trials.  We took seats in one corner of the room & had quite a tete a tete for an hour.  She is with all very fine looking.  The President gave her a package & she smiled as if her whole soul was radiant with joy.  I hope it was the release of her noble husband.

	I went with Trescott one evening last week to call on Mr. [Lafayette] Foster President of the Senate & spent a delightful evening with him & his wife.  He is from Connecticut & we talked of New Haven and all your friernds there.  Mrs. Foster is a smart good looking yankee lady & very pleasant but very different from a Southern lady.  

	I went to see Sallie Martin & her aunt Mrs. Bostick & was pleased with them.  Sallie says she is homesick & was so glad to see me.

	This Hotel is magnificent & the fare most superior.  But the ladies all ugly.  Elford has written an article for the Columbia Phoenix in which Mrs. King & myself figure at the Presidents Service.

	My article in the Intelligencer is greatly praised & admired.  My Photograph is a failure.  I may try again tomorrow. 

	I think I mentioned my interviews with General Butler, Wilson, Randall Hunt, Governor Sharkey, Parsons & M� in my last letter.

	The President thinks we will git our seats soon.  He is going to veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill & this will be a bombshell in the ranks of the Republicans.

	Hodges called to see me this morning, & Geddes and Trescott & Young.  Elford will not be able to return with me.  I have got all the pardons under way & he will wait & bring them.

	I bought a new wig making.  The Frenchman is working on it today (Sunday).  He said if he did not go to Heaven it would be my fault. 

        I have only been to the Capitol once.  The crowd of negroes, & the speeches are disgusting.  
       
       I have purchased a parcel of garden seeds.  I am glad you have commenced with your garden & getting on well.
       
       The weather has been extremely cold but I don�t feel it at all in the Hotel.  It is now raining.  The Tennessee & Arkansas members of Congress are to be admitted this week.    Genl Lee is here but I have not seen him.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from a visit to Mrs. LeConte & Mr. Barnwell & wil spend a few minutes before starting in writing you a letter.

	Governor Orr & General Harrison met me at Belton on their way to Philadelphia.  At Cokesbury we were joined by Judge Thompson & General McGowan forming a very pleasant party.  They were all provided with very amply lunch baskets filled with good things to eat & drink.  We had a very cordial & social picnic.  The weather was very hot & dry.  We reached Columbia about dusk & after supper I saw Chancellor Carroll, Col. Harris & others.  Col. Harris told me that my letter to Wallace had obtained  his office as Collector.  Wallace said my request had been with him.  The Col. seemed grateful to me.

	I went to bed at nine ocl;ock in my old room, the room I occupied whilst Governor opening into the Parlor & two beaux singing & playing on the Piano till I went to sleep under the sound of their melodies.  

	I slept well & rose this morning very much refreshed.  After reading the papers & taking breakfast with Judge � & General McGowan I went to see Mrs. LeConte & thence to Mr. Barnwell.  They all seemed glad to see me.  Miss Graham gave me the address of Dr. Jackson in Philadelphia & requested me to call & see him.  She said he had talked a great deal about me & expressed a strong wish to see me.  They all enquired after you & Fannie very kindly.

	Mr. Barnwell gave me a great deal of political advice as to the Convention which corresponds with my own views.  He expressed great pleasure at my calling & begged that I would never come to Columbia without giving him the pleasure of seeing me.

	Governor Orr tells me that his convening the Legislature will depend on the President.  If the President will give him assurance that all the negroes will be turned over to the Courts for trial without interference on the part of the military, he will convene the Legislature, otherwise he will not.

	Mr. Barnwell is opposed to a special session of the Legislature & thinks the Legislature will do mischief instead of good.  He prefers that the Yankees should retain jurisdiction on the negroes.  He thinks very highly of Col. Green the yankee commander at this place.

	Dr. LeConte told me that he started up to call on me during the Convention�saw me in the Chair organizing the Convention & did not have time to call again.

	Mrs. LeConte looks worse than I ever saw her.  She has lost all of her good looks & looks thin.  Miss Lula looks very well.  Miss Graham as usual.

       Tell Willie to take care of the office & its business.  Tell Hext & Hayne to study hard & be good boys.  You & Fannie need no advice & will do your whole duty.
       
       I hope to hear from you in Philadelphia & I will write again from Washington.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just got through with the Convention.  It was the greatest assembly of men ever convened on this continent.  Everything was harmonious & complete success.  I made a speech to 1500 persons which was well rece[ive]d & I have sent it to you.

	The South Carolina delegation are going to dine with the Mayor of Philadelphia this evening.  Tomorrow we go on to Mr. Fishers who married Miss Middleton & spend the night with him.  He�owns a magnificent country seat.

	We will leave here Monday morning & reach home Friday.  Tell Mrs. Butler I saw Woodward & his little daughter, a sweet little girl.

	I have just been to have my likeness taken.

	Tell our friends that everything goes well & success is certain.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Willies.  I have heard nothing from Mr. Barnwell yet about your purchases.

	Judge Wardlaw was robbed of $500 whilst getting into the cars here & Col. Campbell lost a fine diamond breast pin in the same way.

	I have lost nothing & am quite well.  I have enjoyed myself well.  It has been a joyous frolic & I have a great deal to tell you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Benson J. Lossing Esq.]

	Whilst in Philadelphia attending the National Union Convention I subscribed for your �Civil War in America� & received the first volume which I am reading.  You state that all the South Carolina delegation left the Charleston Democratic Convention in 1860.  This is a mistake.  Colonel Boozer & myself remained in the Convention & after the other delegates retired cast the vote of the State for Hunter of Virginia.  During all the ballotings and severe hisses in the galleries every time we rose.

	In the morning before the Convention met there was a meeting of the South Carolina delegation to determine to go out with the Alabama delegates.  A Resolution was offered to that effect, where I stated that I would not leave the convention or feel myself bound by the Resolution.  It was then withdrawn. 

	Let me now say to you that I was always in public & private life, a steadfast Union man, and opposed nullification in our State Convention in 1832 & opposed Secession in our State Convention in 1852 & was equally open in my opposition to disunion in 1860.  I take some credit to myself for having defeated Secession in South Carolina in 1852 & when there was no Union Paper in the State I sent to New York & purchased a Press in 1850, & edited it as �The Southern Patriot� for several years.  In 1860 the disunion feeling swept over the State & crushed everyone who opposed it.  I said to Governor Means, who wished to know what course I was going to pursue, �that for thirty yearsI had tried to save the union & that now the State was going to the Devil & I was going with her�.  I wept like a child at her madness & folly & predicted that secession would prove the death knell of slavery!

	My union sentiments excluded me from office & position in South Carolina till the Rebellion was over.  Then I was appointed Provisional governor of the State, & afterwards, almost unanimously elected U. States Senator from South Carolina by those who had previously opposed me all my life.

	Enclosed I send you a likeness of myself, which was taken the other day at the request of Senator Cowan of Pennsylvania for the purpose of having the�Committee of Thirteen on the address & Resolutions, Photographed in one picture.  

	I am with great respect & consideration yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I have rece[ive]d two letters from you�one by Runnion enclosing the stamps�and I have used eighteen of them.

	Norton knows more about the case than I do, but tell him  I recei[ve]d a letter from Thompson requesting what I have done.

	I have been very busy since you left.  Have filed three answers in Equity, issued one Bail Writ against J.H. Arnold & got three appearances from J. Looper besides giving advice in several cases of some importance.

	I am sorry to hear you are likely to have a long session.  � says he has twenty or thirty notes of old�for me to issue on.

	Enclosed I send you a letter & certificate which you will which you will hand Mr. Read & git his written consent to settle the case of Chaplin & send me back immediately as Jake wishes to go to Memphis.

	Hayne & Ben are still sick in bed.  Hayne is getting well.  Ben is still lingering..  Fanny comes home tonight.  The rest of us are all well.  Nothing new.  Willie Beattey sent for your horse this evening.

	Give my respects to Easl[e]y & the Greenville delegation.

	Looper was here the other day & gave a very strong affidavit about Arthur being drunk & furnished the testimony of Allen & others to the same fact.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	The Legislature of this State was convevened some weeks since by his Excellency Governor Orr to organize the District Court for the trial of negroes, & fighting a civil rights Bill placing them upon an equality with white persons in giving testimony & being tried, sueing &c.  I was called to Columbia during the first week of the session as a member of the Greenville Rail Road directors.  I had the pleasure of seeing a great many of the members and talking to them about the prospects of the country.  They were very despondent & I tried to cheer them up by telling them that I felt confident that the Fall Elections throughout the middle & northern & western States would go in favor of the administration.  This they did not seem disposed to believe.  I saw Ex governor Pickens & his lady on their return from Baltimore.  The Governor did not seem hopeful of the results of the northern Elections.  Neither did Judge Dawkins who had just returned from the north with his family.  I may be mistaken, but time will show who is right in his judgement.  I found my belief on the following grounds.  The political parties were nearly equally divided in the Election between Lincoln & McClellan.  The one recei[ve]d something over two millions & the other eighteen hundred thousand votes.  Since that time a large number of the leaders of the Republican party have come over to the administration.  The people are gitting tired of constant political excitement & agitation.  The Capitalists are becoming apprehensive that another civil war may ensue which would endanger all their government securities.  They have been assured that the Southern States do not desire repudiation of the national debt which they greatly apprehended at one time.  The masses of the northern people are not in favour of negro suffrage.  A large number of the Federal Generals have taken sides with the President.   Their convention at Cleveland adopted & endorsed the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Convention.

	It is said that the Presidents speeches in his northern tour have injured his party.  I do not think so.  On the contrary I am satisfied that they will have a telling effect on the Fall elections with the great mass of people.

	I regretted not seeing Governor Manning in Columbia.  He was sick, & has since been dangerously ill.  It is said Col. Campbell & his friends were getting up opposition to Manning & would try & defeat him this winter.  I regret this very much.  I like him, & would be glad to have him as a colleague in the Senate of the U. States.  Not having yet been allowed to take his seat, it would be cruel to turn him out.  J.B. Campbell is spoken of by his friends.  If he cannot succeed in defeating Manning then they are to start General Hampton or General Kershaw.

	Whilst in Columbia I called to see General Sickles in company with Governor Orr.  He is a good looking, light & frivilous man.  It may be, that my opinion of his character formed years since has prejudiced me against him, & that I do not properly appreciate his intellect.  He almost connived at his wifes adultery & then murdered her paramour when it became notorious!  The General informed me that he was going to send a Garrison to Greenville.  They have since arrived.  This is unfortunate.  The negroes will then behave worse, & there may be collissions between the soldiers & citizens.  I wish we could git rid of all Federal teroops.

	It was said in Columbia that Mrs. Pickens was anxious for the Governor to be elected to the U.S. Senate.  I said that she herself would stand a much better chance.  General Easl[e]y replied he thought she could be elected very easily.  She is a very charming lady, beautiful, accomplished & intellectual.

	General Orr received a telegraph dispatch whilst I was in Columbia requesting him or myself to attend the mass meeting in New York on the 17th Sept. & address the meeting .  On my return home I found a letter from the committee making the same request.  In reply I wrote a long letter giving what I would say if there.  I should have liked very much to have been there.  But it was impossible for me to go.

	The Legislature have adjourned after passing several important Bills.  Amongst them one to establish a Penitentiary.  This is the last great measure of mine adopted by the State.  It is very grattifying to me, to find, after thirty years advocacy on my part that all of my measures of reform have been adopted.  The election of Electors of Pres & Vice Pres by the people of South Carolina.  The destruction of the odious & unjust Parish system by which one voter in a Parish had as much influence in the Senate as two or three hundred voting in the upper districts!  The election of Governor by the people.   The equalization of taxation according to the value of property.  The abandonment of the right of secession.  And the perpetuation of the Federal Union.  The con� of the South Carolina College into a University where young men can pursue such studies as they have a taste for & which will be of most service to them in after life.  The establishment of one court of appeals for law & Equity.  And a county or district court for the trial of misdemeanors & larceny & small civil suits.  All these measures I have advocated ever since I entered public life & at last they have been adopted by my state.  How much feeling some of them have cost me no one can conjecture.

	I have likewise been personally successful, at last, in my political aspirations.  In the course of twelve months I was district attorney, commissioner of Assessments & district Judge  under the Confederacy, Provisional Governor of the State under appointment of President Johnson & United States Senator by election of the Legislature of South Carolina.  It was said, by a friend, with great truth, that all of my honors came at once clustering around me.

Dear Madam [Mrs. Eliza R. Laurens]

	I recei[ve]d your letter last night with your circulars respecting your school.  The other circular about the Raffle I did not receive.

	The people of Greenville are so poor & hard pressed for money, that I am not able to give you any encouragement as to the Raffle.  And I may say the same in regard to your school.  No one, not living here, has any idea of the utter destitution of our people.  

	It would give me great pleasure to aid you in both your school & raffle if it were in my power to do so.

	I am with great respect & esteem.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your long letter written on Sunday, yesterday evening & was glad to hear from you at so much length.  

	I have nothing special to write you.  I hope Sh� purchased the mule & am sorry to hear Wagener is lame.  I am quite well pleased also to learn Cobb has brought the pork  & will bring more & that you are supplied with flour by our good friend Green.

	Mr.  Arthur is to be tried 3d January at Greenville & the trial is to be public.  Mr. McCready wished to engage me as judicial adviser of the Court.  But I declined to have anything to do with the trial.  He wants a younger lawyer to assist & I recommended Captain Earle.  McCready told me last night that Col. Trescott came down with Boyce & McBee yesterday & they told him that the Masons had instigated the charges against Arthur & there was no trust in them.

	I saw Col. Alston Hayne last night.  He is going to move to California.  He says his Brother is pursuing his Profession there & urges him to come.  He told me Arthurs wife went off with a gambler & is now married to him�left her three children bad woman.  How blood will show itself.  I always heard that she was illegitimate�born before her mother married �.  But one could hardly expect virtue in an actress & her associations are enough to de� her if she has virtue.  Alston seemed very despondent, had lost almost all of his property.  He left for Charleston this morning with two of the H� daughters.

	The election of U[nited] States Senator will take place in a few minutes & I suppose [James B.] Campbell will be elected.  He has bargained & bought up enough votes  to elect him.  [Henry Pinckney] Hammett  & [Alexander] McBee and perhaps the whole Greenville delegation except Willie  & maybe [George Franklin] Townes will probably vote for Campbell to get his & his friends votes  for the Greenville Rail Road Bill.  Campbell�s friends have bargained with Reid, Easl[e]y and �[word obscured] about the Secretary election &�of them.  I am utterly disgusted with the want of principle�.

	Willie recd a letter from Fannie last night saying that she would do to Florida next week by water.  I do not like Fannie�s separating herself from Mrs. Glover & going [text missing]

	I see Governor Swains letter to me, published in the new York Times.  My letter was crowded out this morning by the Presidents Message.  The President stands firm & insists the South should be represented.  His message is a noble document.

	I have made an arrangement to have a little keg of fresh oysters sent up every Saturday costing $1.25.  They will be about as cheap as any kind of meat & I am so fond of them.  

	I hope to get home Friday or Saturday.  I have just returned from the Court of Appeals & the Charleston cases will take all day today.  General [James] Simmons [Simons]  called to see me last night & talk politics�very well.

	I will now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have but a moment to write you before going to the Court of Appeals.  I am on the Committee to examine students.  There are fifty five applicants for law & twenty five for Equity.  I rece[ive]d your letter last night & if Mrs. Laurens sent any tickets to me they were stolen from the mails.  I see my letter to the Herald published in the paper of 22d.  The comments are moderate.  The Charleston Courier�s New York correspondent says the letter is �magnificent�.  The Phoenix publishes notices of my letter on the Constitution.  The Charlotte News makes extracts from my Herald Letter & compliments.  

	I had a long talk with General Capers & advised him to accept the Greenville Church & run for Secretary of State.  He will resign his office as soon as he is ordained.  He spoke very kindly of you & your efforts to provide for him.  He appears to be a most excellent & pious gentleman.  

	In speaking of Mr. Arthur Chief Justice Dunkin said that you would not let me defend him.  Willie is quite well.  Henry Buist told me he saw Fannie at his Fathers just before leaving Charleston.  Col. Jackson & his Bride came down with us & stopped at Nickersons.  I had to give him my room for the night.  Miss Orr came down to stay with Col. Childs during the Session.  Edward Stokes was very attentive to her, but I think Van Wyck is addressing her.  His first wife was a daughter of Judge Battle of N.C.  I have bought me a new hat like the old one.  Janney invites you to come down & stay with him.  I do not know whether I shall be able to go down Saturday or not.  I will write you again.  I have been nowhere & seen no one except those at the Hotel.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is thanksgiving day & the Legislature & the Courts have all adjourned�till tomorrow.  I am therefore at leisure to write you a long letter.  I wrote you a very short one yesterday before going into Court.  I was appointed to examine the applicants for admission in law on Constitutional Cases.  I suppose the Judges thought from my letter on the Constitutional amendment that this subject was appropriately mine.  The class consisted of fifty one students�Wells, Westmoereland & Dargan amongst them.  They all stood a very good examination & were admitted.

	I then went to pay my respects to the Governor & whilst in his office his daughter Miss Mattie came in for the purpose of getting money to shop.  I went to Radcliffe & bought me a beautiful set of shirt buttons or studs.  In the evening I attended the Board of Trustees & did not return to the Hotel till eleven oclock.  Governor Orr went off to�& a christian & did not attend our meeting.  This morning I went with him to call on Miss Childs & Miss Mattie.  Miss Mattie told me that Dr. Hoke & his Bride were there last night & that Dr. Hoke went up to the Hotel  to see me.  I was at the College & did not see him.   Willie tells me he saw him & his Bride.  I suppose they will reach Greenville tonight.  

	I was greatly shocked yesterday morning to hear that you had had a fire in Greenville since I left there.  I told Susan when she seemed so anxious to have�to her McBees Hall that it might be destroyed by fire & then her childrens whole fortune would be gone.  She ought now to see how correct my judgment was.  It is a most fortunate circumstance that the fire dd not extend over the village.  Alexander McBee went up to Greenville this morning & will not return till Monday.  

	I think I shall go up Saturday & return Tuesday.  Looper has not yet been tried & may not be before the last of next week.  I have several persons complimenting very [word obscured] about my letter which I will carry up with me.  Chief Justine Dunkin  and a dozen orthers have paid me very high compliments for this letter.  It seems to have attracted great commendation everywhere.

	Judge Bryan told me he saw Fannie & that she was looking more beautiful than ever.  She will remain in Charleston till the 11th of December.  Mrs. Glover has gone to Orangeburgh & will meet her at Branchville on the [word faded].  They will go to Florida by Rail Road through Augusta &c.

	Governor Manning is very ill, & his election comes on next Tuesday.  It is thought Col. Campbell will oppose him.  I hope Manning will be elected.  He is a good deal better than he was.  Dr. Geddings came up to see him not long since & changed his treatment.  His friends think he will recover.  I hope so most sincerely.

	I have not yet seen or heard from Mrs. LeConte.  I do not know whether Lula is in Columbia or not.  One of the Trenholms sons is to marry Miss Bryce very soon.  Judge Bryan told me that he courted a very poor lady in Charleston�him not long since.  He thought it a rare instance of dis� on her part.  ,,, Trenholm is good looking but very small, & his intended, a very large lady.

	I have not seen or heard from General Hampton or his family.  I saw General Martin yesterday who enquired after all of you very kindly.  I have not seen Isaac Hayne.  Edward Stokes & John W, Stokes were admitted yesterday in Equity & I suppose will go up tomorrow morning.  Looper tells me he expects money soon from Augusta & will pay me whatever I charge for defending his son.
	
	I am glad that Blassingame sent for the corn & hope that P� is right in his cor�. The weather is very warm & looks as if we should have rain.  I hope it is colder in Greenville on account of the meat salted away.  I trust you & your household are doing well.  Having so small a famiy at present I hope you [have] no troublei in housekeeping.  I shall expect to hear from you this evening.  I [word obscured] the letters you sent me & if any others should come you had better keep them till I return.  If I do not return on Saturday send them to me on Monday or write {word faded] their contents.

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & instead of going to church I will write you a long letter. It is a very cold day & I have a comfortable fire.  I have been to breakfast & the company have just left my room.  How long before someone also comes in I cant tell.

	Yesterday morning I got up & wrote you a line, went down & gave it to Westfield.  I came back & went to bed again.  I was anxious to have returned home yesterday, but was afraid my cases in court might be called up  before I could return.  I promised Looper too to remain & look at his sons case.  He seems very willing to pay me a good fee & I shall charge him a thousand dollars.  It is unpleasant too riding about on the Rail�& getting up before day this cold weather.

	You will be gratified to hear that General Capers has been elected Secretary of State by a large majority.  He will hold the office till his ordination.  I think he ought to continue in the office after ordination till his congregation is able to support him and I told him so.

	Mr McCready & W.A. Pringle are to call to see me this evening after church on special business.  They did not say what, but I suspect it is about the trail of Mr. Arthur.  I sit at the table with all of the Judges & they all seemed curious�know something about the charges against Arthur & I told them all I knew.  Pringle has brought up his brother B�ton to put in the Lunatic Asylum & seems very sad.  They have one hundred & thirty lunatics in the Asylum.

	The election of U[nited] States Senator comes on next Tuesday and fear Governor Manning will be beaten by Col. Campbell.  They are forming combinations to defeat Manning.  He is not here.  The election of Solicitors comes off Tuesday also.  I am not able to say who will be elected.  Reid, Easl[e]y & Evans all seem confident of succcess.  Douglass who read law with me came within two votes of being elected commissioner for Fairfield.  He was beaten by [word obscured].

	There was a discussion in the House the other day on Resolutions about Jeff Davis & General E�.  I made a fine speech.  Willie came in just now�.  He has a bad cold too.  He recd last night the Mountaineer that Hext sent him and��all well at Home.�  This was very good in Hext & thank him for it.  I was glad to see the Mountaineer on account of the fire.  Willie also recd a letter from Willie Beattie giving an account of the fire.

	Judge Bryan and his Court have returned to Charleston.  He had a great deal to say in praise of Fannie.  You have heard from her I suppose.  Someone told me she was to leave for Florida with Mrs. Glover the first day of December.

	I have written another letter to Woodward on impartial suffrage & given it to the Phoenix.  I expect it wil appear Tuesday morning.

 	I hope Hext, Hayne & Ben are going to school & studying well & behaving well.  �hard enquired kindly after Hext the other day and hoped to have seen him in�.

	There is to be [a] grand fair�Tuesday night.  I see Mrs. LeConte is at the head of it.  I have not yet seen her�.  There are only two ladies boarding at Nickersons�Mrs. Fisher who was a Miss � & cousin of Mrs. John Ashe Alston and a yankee officers wife.  

	The political news is unimportant.  We are anxiously looking for the Presidents Message.  The idesa of impeaching Johnson has been abandoned it is said.

	I wish you would get Mr. Gr� to mark two bags of acts of Congress in my office & put them on the floor in another bag & have them all marked To Theodore Stark Esq. Columbia.  Send them over to the depot to be sent down by rail Road.  Stark wil pay the freight in Columbia.  But wish two copies of each act kept out for me.  There are four acts or pamphlets & I want two of each saved for my use.  They are numbered 1860 & 1861�1861 & 1862�1863 & 1864.  I think there may be two copies of each on the floor.  If not, look in the bags�not on the floor.  The court of appeals & the Legislature want them.  Have the bags tied up or sewed up before they are sent to the depot.

	I hope to be at home as soon as Friday & I hope to hear from you Monday night.  I suppose you have seen Dr. Hoke and his bride.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Col. T. Edwin Ware]

	You once said to me many years ago not to sue you on your note & that you would regard it as a debt of honor.  I relied on your promise & still rely on it.  But in times like the present I must ask you to secure the debt in some way.  I do not ask you for the money though I am greatly straintened in my circumstances & hard pressed.  I think you ought to secure the debt as you have that of others not older than mine or of a more sacred character. 

       Please call & see me.  I am with great respect, yours truly, B.F. Perry

	The girls have gone to the � Catholic Church with Mrs. Livingston & I will write you a few lines during their absence.  The Episcopal churches are all closed during this hot weather.  The members are out of the city.  Fannie & Mattie wished to see & hear something of Rom�.

	I wrote you from Columbia & Fannie has written since her arrival here.  The dust & heat were terrible from Columbia to this city.  We stopped in Richmond & spent a pleasant evening in riding over the city.  Moore the friend of our lost Frank called to see us & I was very much pleased with him.  He is now a widower.  His wife died a few months since.

	We staid two nights and one day in Washington & spent the time very pleasantly.  I called to see the President with Governor Aiken, Gov. Bonham & Col. Townes.  His friend Col. Cooper told me he wished to see me.  But there were so many persons waiting to see him that our stay had to be very brief.  We then called to see General Howard who saw us very graciously & we had with him a very interesting conversation.  He is a remarkably fine looking gentleman cordial & rosy in his manners.  He talked about the Presidential Election with great frankness & seemed very willing  to be nominated, & I should not be sorry to see him the nominee of the democratic party.  In the evening we went with Mr. Long of Aiken to see Chief Justice Chase & I was pleased with him too, but not sufficiently  to vote for him unless forced to do so by the convention,  Chase has more brains than all the other candidates, is a states rights man & a democrat.  Whilst he goes for universal suffrage & general amnesty he wishes it left to the states to regulate suffrage.   He says we will soon control the negro votes in South Carolina��Brains & property must control labor.�  I had an hours conversation with Chase & was much gratified.  

	Whilst passing the Ladies parlor in the Metropolitan in Washington Mrs. Simms recognized me & ran out & caughte me by the hand & said �don�t you know me.�  I had to confess I did not!  When she told me her name I almost embraced her to make up for not recognizing her.    She has two lovely little daughters.  I went to see her the next morning to see her children.  Fannie & Mattie spent the day in running over Washington & seeing every thing.  No doubt Fannie has written you all about it.  Col. Childs, Mr. Hough & Mr. H� were escorting them over the city.  I saw Miss Col. Tom T� & her daughter, Mrs. Simms nieces &c.

  	I had the pleasure of making a good many acquaintances in Washington.  We reached here Thursday night & went to Madame F�.  Mr. [John] Livingston had been there that evening enquiring for me & left a message.  In the morning I went to see him & he insisted on our coming to his House.  He has a noble mansion magnificently furnished, & is a most warm hearted, generous, intelligent gentleman.  We have five large�& the whole house.  He has so far insisted on our taking our meals in the House & his�wish on abundance�lemonade & ice water.  His family are all in the country except a son, sixteen years old, who plays beautifully on the Pi� for the young ladies.

	At Madame Figlettes we met the South Carolina delegation & Mrs. Simonton.  General Hampton came after we left the House.  The Convention met yesterday, but did nothing but organize. I am to be one of the vice Presidents of the Convention�General Hampton on the platform, Simpson on organization, [Martin Witherspoon] Gary on credentials, & Campbell Chairman of the delegation.  Aldrich, Gary, Simonton, Mullins, Furman, Farrow are also here.  Chesnut & Manning & Preston are not yet here.

	The girls went to the convention with Mrs. Livingston & staid until they got tired.  The weather is dreadful.  Last night they went to the fire works with the two Vann Wycks fornerly of PendletonMrs. Van Wyck is now living here.

	I have seen Shu� & Donaldson but have not seen McRoy.  I also met Dr. F� & his daughter.

	It is very doubtful who will be nominated for the Presidency.  Pengleton is ahead of all at present.  The nomination is likely to fall on someone else�[W.S.] Hancock, Johnson, [Horatio] Seymour, [Salmon] Chase, [Thomas] Hendricks, though last not least.  There is a good deal of ill feeling between the friends of the rival candidates & they are as busy as bees in electioneering.  The South will be passive & take whoever is given us.  It is possible the nomination may be made Tuesday & the Convention adjourn Wednesday.  I have a great deal more to write but close with love to you & the children.  God bless you, your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	The girls have just gone to the theatre with Mr. H� & Frank Cox.  I will write you a letter & go to bed.  Last night I went to the great Democratic club know as Manhattan.  They had a most sumptuous entertainment &�as six hundred present.  I did not leave there till after twelve oclock, & did not sleep well on my return.  They had all sorts of fishes, game, meats & wine.  The rooms appeared to be filled with bottles.  These New York people don�t know the value of money & do everything in a most expensive style.  Think of their spending $100,000 on the 4th of July in fireworks & crockery!

	I met a great many pleasant gentlemen from all parts of the American Republic & amongst them two from the town in which Mrs. Bullen formerly Miss Ligon lives.  They had a great deal to say about her & made a great many enquiries about the B�s & Mrs. Rutledge & Mrs. Walter.  They said Mrs. Bullen would ask them about the South Carolina delegates & they wished to make their acquaintance on that account.

	Today the girls have been shopping with Mrs. �fern.  I have bought two watch�for Willie & Hext, a pen for my office, five�dozen han[d]kerchiefs, ? dozen socks & vest.  But everything is very high & I will not purchase any more clothes.  I have carried your�to have mended.

	The convention met today & have adopted a platform which insures a Democratic victory.  It is one of the best things I ever saw.  We ballotted six or seven times for President, but made no choice.  I got the South Carolina delegation to vote for Andrew Johnson & General Hancock.  [George H.] Pendleton was ahead every time.  But it is understood that New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey & Indiana will cast their votes in the morning for [Thomas A.] Hendricks.  If so the Southern States will fall in & all the West will follow.  My impression is that Hendricks & [John T.] Hoffman will be nominated.

	I saw Collin Ferguson today, who enquired if you were with me & when he found Fannie was, he insisted very much that we should go home with him & spend two or three weeks in New Haven.

	The girls have had [a] great many calling to see them.  In the morning they are going with young Livingston, �, Donaldson & Cox to Niagara Falls & return Saturday.  They will go up the Hudson in a boat as far as Albany.  By their return I shall be through with the Convention & my business here.  I have not yet had time to see any Publisher or book binder.  

	We are living here in great splendor at no expense.  Mr. Livingston is a most warm hearted hospitable gentleman & is very kind.  For one days board at Madame Fillettes I paid $27.50.  She is a South Carolinian & Mr. Livingston a yankee.  I rece[ive]d your letter last Sunday just after writing mine to you.  I commenced writing you again, but the girls came back from the Central Park & interrupted me.  I hope to be able to leave here next week & reach home in a week afterwards.

	I am anxious to know how Willie comes on this week with his Equity business.  Tell Hext he must read & study as I directed him.

	The weather has been melting & I am not disposed to move about.  We have had a little rain this evening & it is cooler.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to bed.  You will probably hear of the nomination before you receive my letter.

	You have by this time heard of the nomination.  I think it a good one & the nominees will be elected.  Last night there was a rattification meeting here of ten thousand citizens.  General Hampton, Governor Vance & myself addressed them.  I had made a speech the night before by invitation of the Metropolitan Club.  Everything went off well.  This evening [Horatio] Seymour makes a speech & also General [Montgomery] Blair.

	I intended to write you a long letter, but the girls have just got back safe from Niagara & driven me out of my room.  Two letters from you to Fannie have been rece[ive]d in her absence.

	I went to see Appleton & left my writings.  He is to look over them & give me an answer.  I was invited by Brady to have my likeness taken.  He has taken three different sizes but I have not seen them am tomorrow.  

	I have bought a�for Perry Leaphart, & a shirt�for Hext today.  Miss Simmons & Mrs. B� called yesterday whilst I was out & will call tomorrow again.  

	The girls are delighted with their trip but tired.  Miss Pamela wrote me to come to Mt. Vernon.  I wish to leave here Tuesday next, & get home Monday following stopping in Philadelphia & Washington.

	The mail brought nothing for you & no news of any importance.  I am very lonely, but getting on pretty well.  The Servants are doing well.

	George ought to be willing to give ten stalks of corn to keep the freshet from ruining his crop.

	Let Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell get through with his painting.  Don�t make him do too much.  The house is whitewashed outside & it is not in good taste to have much painting inside.

I have no doubt of the result, �not guilty�.  But my clients are terribly scared.  I told them I should charge the $200.00.  Herrick paid me $40 & said he would pay the balance.  I made a great argument & have the Judge & Jury with me.  But all future is uncertain.

	I will ride out this evening if I can get time, but I am very much fatigued & had to leave the Court House as soon as I got through with my argument.  I went back however & heard Corbin out.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I am still very busy in court.  Have had good success with my cases.  Rece[ive]d some money.  Don�t know when court will adjourn.  We shall not get through the docket.  General Easl[e]y dined with me the other day.  I send you a letter of Hexts.  He seems to take seriously your advice about Miss Sallie. 

	    I expect you must be satisfied with your loneliness by this time.  I miss you very much, but we are getting on very well.  Lindy does well.  The cow is famous as a milker.  Easl[e]y said he would rather have her than the gray mare.  J� S� says he would have taken her at fifty dollars but it was Sunday & he could not buy her on that day.  She gives nearly two gallons at a milking.  Bill A� declines taking Petros because I rented part of the land to Paris.  Paris will not move there & rent the whole place.  His father in law Bill Jones will cultivate a portion of it.  I am glad to get rid of free negroes as tenants.  Smith sold his cotton for $30.00 & wanted to avoid paying rent on a part of it which grew on land he cleared up.  I told him he must pay me one third & he said he would bring the money this week.

	I am willing for you to employ Jack as you mention.  But it is too much.  It is not true that anyone in the country will give $11 per month.  We can employ any number at $8 per month.  But if he takes clothes & pays for washing it will all be the same.
	No letters last night.  Fannie came down to see you yesterday morning & sent � at twelve.  Hayne went to Miss Elfords wedding last night.  Church crowded.  We are getting on very well.  But it is lonesome without you.  I send you the Greenville Enterprize with your notice of the Library Society.

	I send you two letters from Hext & his likeness.  Hayne went to the wedding last night at Col. Irvines & did not get back till two oclock.  He went in a wagon with John Marshal, � & other boys.  I am not willing for Ben to go to Trescotts.  The expense & weather preclude his going.  The thermometer this morning was 23.

	I paid Mrs. Smith $2.10 cts for socks & gloves &c.  I bought 7 lbs butter yesterday of a man named Smith & paid 10 cts�him.  Let Tom go on cutting wood this cold weather.  We shall need it for Christmas.  Willie will be at home tonight.  I don�t like being alone at all.  We are getting on very well however.  It will be hard to get Eggs now & chickens also.

	I am glad George is gone & hope he has everything taken off.  Let Tom move into his house.  You must have a bed made for Jack here and one for Henry out there & filled with straw.

My dear Liz

	I have just finished my speech & eaten my dinner & will now write you a few lines.  Everything passed off well.  There was a crowded House & a good many ladies.  I spoke an hour & a half.  Wallace sat & listened very attentively, but did not offer a reply.  Nor do I think the crowd would have listened to him if he had attempted to speak.  I have only seen three or four persons who spoke of my speech & they were greatly pleased.  My friends here tell me that the negroes are taking no interest in the election & will not go out to vote as they did in the last election.  I now begin to think that I may beat Wallace.  But it will be a close race.  I am not at all anxious about it & in fact had rather stay at home than go to Washington.  I do not regret my campaign for it has been quite pleasant.

	A lady has just sent Mr. Duncan a candidate for the Senate to ask me to meet her at five oclock, as she wishes to consult me as a lawyer.  She was the daughter of John Bomar & is now a widow.  Her name I have forgotten.  So I may get a law case by being here.

	Tell Ben to have the watermelon patch sowed in wheat after working it up.  If the rye has not come up I would like to have it sowed over again if he can get seed rye.

	I have just returned from church & will write you a few lines before dinner if some of my Democrat friends do not call to interrupt.  I would have written you from Chester but every moment I was engaged.  Col. Hamilton gave me two letters from you & Mr. Stokes & at Union I wrote you by Ben and also another letter from Spartanburg after I had made up my speech there.  I had a fine meeting at Union.  Judge Munro introduced me to the meeting with highly eulogistic remarks on my past political course.  His daughter who was present invited me to take tea with them.  But I had to decline as I left that evening for Chester.  I called to see Mrs. Dawkins who shed tears at seeing me.  She thought I suppose of my itinerary with the Judge & it recalls his death to her mind.  She expressed great pleasure at meeting me once more & told me how much gratified she was at hearing of my nomination.  I went down from Spartanburg with my old friend Mrs. Herndon and with her a great deal of pleasant chat.  My friends at Union were quite enthusiastic & confident of success.  They were also at Chester & this place.  But the election depends entirely on the turnout of the party.   

	I was very much fatigued in going from Union across the boundary to Chester in a miserable hack.  Major � who nominated me in the Convention called to see me & carried me over the whole terrain & introduced me to every lady.  He is an old bachelor & a great�.  It seemed to do him good to be with me in charge.  I came up here last night & Col. Hamilton will join me tomorrow morning.  Everything is working well here in Wallaces own county.  He is terribly scared.  I have met a great many violent secessionists, who are my most devoted friends.  All, everyone is delighted at my nomination, & say they desired me above all others, & that I am the only man who can beat Wallace.  I shall speak here tomorrow, Chester Thursday & Winnsborough on Friday & home Saturday.

	Your going to Aiken so soon surprised me.  But I am willing for anything to�my dear boy Hayne.  I love him very much & to him I�for one who would distinguish my name more than I have done.  I pray to God he may be improved by his visit to Aiken.  My tears are flowing whilst I speak of him.  If he could only be restored I would make any sacrifice of property, fame, & ambition.  

	The military school marched by this morning going to church & I thought of poor Frank & Hayne.  The sermon was a good one.  I was introduced to the preacher Mr. Dickson & to Col. Coward the Principal of the military school.  Col. Wilson called to see me & said the Episcopal church was closed today as Mr. Johnson preached at Rock Hill.

	I hope to hear from you at Chester on Thursday after your arrival in Aiken.  Don�t write any more politics or say anything about the election.  I hope Willie is engaged but I don�t believe it.  I heard from him last week at Anderson.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just made a speech & eaten my dinner & will take the three oclock train for Winnsboro tonight.

	I had a fine large meeting at Yorkville & my speech is reported fully�&�in the Paper yesterday morning three columns.  Monday evening I went to Col. Rawlinsons with Col. Hamilton & staid all night.  He carried us in his carriage the next morning to Rock Hill where I made a speech.  Mrs. Springs sent me word at Yorkville that her carriage would be at Rock Hill to carry me to her House that evening.  I went with Col. Hamilton & spent the night & next day.  They were very kind & hospitable.  Springs is worth two or three hundred thousand dollars & Mrs. Springs & myself have made a match between her little daughter & only child & Ben.  She is ten years old, very sweet & pretty.  We are to exchange photographs of her & Ben.  I said Ben was to be a farmer & she said that is just what she wishes.  Springs insisted I should send Ben down to see them.
	I rece[ive]d your letter at Rock Hill directed to the care of Col. Cadwallader Jones & was truly glad you & Hayne arrived safely at Aiken, and that Hayne felt better.  This is my only trouble.  As to the election I care nothing about it though I begin to think I may be elected.  I saw Mrs. � Jones who was a daughter of Governor Adams & Emma Waters my�.
	Col. Hamilton invites me to take tea with him tonight.  He made a speech at Rock Hill & exalted me most extravagantly & gave a history of my life.  I feel under great obligations to him.  I refused at first, to take tea, but he said he wished me to make the acquaintance of his wife & I consented.  I have had a most pleasant campaign so far.  Tomorrow I speak at Winnsborough [&] return home Saturday night.  I have a great deal to tell you when we meet.
	I begin to feel [Horace] Greel[e]y will be beaten.  Pennsylvania , Ohio & Indiana have gone against the Democrats!  But I will not despair of the Republic.  I have heard nothing from Home or Hext since you left.  I have made a great many friends here.  I do hope Hayne will get better.  A great many Radicals will vote for me.  Gov. Scott has said he wishes me to beat Wallace.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you from Chester after making my speech there & then went & spent the evening with Col. Hamilton.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Hamilton who is really smart & interesting.  She said she knew me very well although I did not know her.  She had seen me so often in Greenville.  The Col. has been a true friend & done me great service.

	I left Chester at 11 oclock in the night & came to Winnsboro.  They were expecting me the next day & had made arrangements to receive me & escort me to my friend  � where they wished me to stay.  But I preferred being at the Hotel where I could see everyone.  I made a long & good speech in the Court House which was well received.  Judge � a Radical came up & congratulated me.  In the evening they gave me a magnificent dinner.  One hundred of the first gentlemen in the county sat down to the [word faded] all made speeches and if you could have been present & heard all the extravagant compliments paid me by the different speakers you would have been proud of your husband. They complimented my firmness, my pol�, my talents & ability & then commenced on my personal appearance & really made me believe that I was a noble looking gentleman.  They spoke of my wisdom  in differing from them on Secession &c.  I send you a Bill of Fare which Col. [James H.] Rion told me to bring home & let the people see how well they entertained me.

	Everywhere I was well received but Winnsboro beat them all, when in nullification terms I could not have got a dozen votes, for anything even constable.  I met my old friend Major Wardlaw, Col. �inson, Col. Lyles, Mr. Campbell.  The parlor of their church & many�many others, who seemed delighted to see me.  I left about twelve oclock in the night & came to Columbia with [D.T.] Corbin district attorney.  He told me that he wished me elected to Congress & thought I would beat [A.S.] Wallace.  But it is very uncertain & depends on the turnout of the negroes.  If they turn out well I shall be beaten.  Although we have a majority of white voters, there are at least two thousand scalawags in the congressional district.  I do not think the negroes will turn out well.

	I think Willies election pretty sure.  He is in Abbeville & will remain there till after the election.  I hear very favorable accounts of his success there & in Pickens.

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed in not hearing from you last night.  I am anxious about Hayne & wish to hear as often as you can write.  When I do not hear I am afraid he is not so well.  I have not seen Fannie today.  She may have heard from you.  Susan told me she had not.

	In regard to the election I have only to say that Willie was beaten 107 votes by the patriotic people not turning out in Abbeville.  They acted shamefully.  Willie rece[ive]d 717 majority in Oconee, 330 in Pickens, 450 in Anderson & 182 in Greenville.  But Blythe rece[ive]d 1800 majority of negro votes in Abbeville.  Willie thinks of contesting the election.  At one box in Abbeville Blythe rece[ive]d 250 votes where there were no managers.  150 North Carolina rail road negroes voted in Pickens who were not entitled to vote.

	I expect Wallace has beaten me.  I got a majority of 1150 votes in Spartanburg, 650 in Oconee, 400 in Pickens, 461 in Greenville & 250 in Union.  But his vote in York, Chester, Fairfield & Laurens overcomes my majorities by two or three hundred votes.  But great frauds were practiced in Laurens & two hundred fifty Democratic votes were thrown out because they were on two pieces of paper.

	I rece[ive]d a letter this morning congratulating me on my election.  He said all the papers in Philadelphia announced my election.  He wants more money & I have sent him a draft for $100.

	If Hayne is able to do without you, I think you had better return home as I want to see you very much & the expense of staying there is very considerable.  Your aunt Mathews has been here three times to see Willie about money.  She says she is pennyless.  Willie gave her $20 yesterday & she came for $60 today.

	Ben is hoeing well at the Farm.  He bought a coat & pants for $10, went to church & looked very nice.  He has hauled all the corn & will finish shucking today.  Tell Hayne the corn turns out well.  We shall make & git from tenants more than 1000 bushels.  I rece[ive]d $250 yesterday in peas &�which came in good time.  

	We killed a mutton last week & a pig today & I shall have to buy some bacon for the servants.

	I beg you, & pray that you will take the result of the election calmly.  I do not wish to go to Congress.  My health forbids me.  Willie is able to live without the solicitors office.  He has & will receive from his aunts a large property.  To be beaten by negroes is no reflection on him.  He rece[ive]d large majorities in all the white counties.  Indeed he rece[ive]d the entire white vote of all the counties except the infamous scalawags.  I am as well satisfied as if we had both been elected.  I am going to publish an address to the Democratic voters of this Congressional district & tell them the only way to control the negroes is to make them vote with us or not employ them.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your long letter written Sunday.  I have also read 5 pages sent Susan yesterday.

	I am distressed that you worry so much about the Election.  It is nothing to grieve over.  I am better satisfied than if elected.  At one time from accounts rece[ive]d I said to my friends that I was afraid I was elected.  I am not [a] fit man to have a seat in Congress.  My health, age, & inclination all oppose it.  I wish to spend the remainder of my life with you at the farm, writing & reading.  The notices of the Press everywhere have been very flattering & show how much of representation I have made for myself by honesty, firmness, patriotism & talent.

	This is a much better legacy for my children than unprincipled success in holding office.  Willie has gone down to Abbeville this morning to contest the election.  Blythe only beat him [by] 107 votes and at one Box in Abbeville where there was no legal manager, the negroes gave Blythe 250 votes to Willies 8!  If this Box is thrown out Willie will be elected.  Moreover 150 North Carolina negroes voted in Pickens�on the Rail Road.  Thirty young negroes under age voted for Blythe at Calhoun Mills in Abbeville.  But Willie is able to live without the office & his defeat gives him reputation.

	You are in Aiken & have nothing to occupy your mind.  Come home & you will be engaged in your household duties & have me to console you & reason with you.

	If Hayne can only improve in Aiken I will forget all my troubles & be thankful.  This is more so to me than everything else.  When I think of it I care nothing about office &�.

	Fannie sends me word she rece[ive]d two letters from you last night.  We are all well.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. Hamilton last night.  He thinks of quitting the State.  I rece[ive]d a letter from �the Atlantic Publishing Company� in New York this morning wishing a sketch of my life & Photograph to put in a book of Eminent Men they are about publishing.

	I must close as I have business on hand.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I was unwell day before yesterday�an attack of indigestion.  But feel quite well today.  Yesterday I went to Col. Irvines sale, but bought nothing.

	I have nothing from Willie.  The official count reducing Blythes majority to 17 votes!  But let me beg of you to quit thinking, talking & writing about the election.  It is all nonsense to worry about it, & worry your friends.  Don�t speak of it in Charleston.

	The New York World announces my election in glowing terms & with extravagant praise of myself.  I have two congratulatory letters from the North & a Hotel (Willards) in Washington sends me an invitation to stay there.  In haste, your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your mother states in her letter this morning that she will leave Aiken tomorrow for Charleston & that you are much better.  You do not know my dear son how much I am gratified at your improvement in health.  This has cheered me for all the results in the elections.  

	Blythe has beaten Willie only 17 votes, & the election will be contested.  I think Willie has gone to Abbeville for that purpose.

       Your mother says you wish to hear about the Farm crop &c.  Ben has gathered all the corn 450 Bushels.  Johnson & Simmons & Calvin are gathering things.  We have ours�& the shucks put up.  The crib is half full & will be full when we get our rent.  It holds 1000 bushels.  Ben has put up 11 hogs, to fatten & sold one for $5.00.  He went to Col. Ervins sale today to buy me a sou for a breeder.
       
       The rye sown the second time has come up beautifully.  The oats & wheat look well.  The cows are running in the bottom fields.  The sheep are doing well.  I had the weather [wether] killed for mutton.  Ben killed a shoat the other day for meat.
       
       Willie has got a nice�.  Today Jack & Mallory are ditching, cleaning out the long ditch.   Jimmy cleaned out as far as he cultivates.
       
       I will make Ben write you and you must write me a line every day or two & let us know how you are doing.  Your affect[ionate] Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son
	I wish you would write me occasionally & let me know how you are doing.  I wrote you the other day & Ben wrote Sunday.  I hope you have rece[ive]d the Enterprise sent you & it will be sent regularly hereafter.
	I am concerned about your room & board.  Do not let them put you in a damp or disagreeable room.  Change your boarding House first.  Ask George Croft to look you out comfortable lodgings.  When you want money write to me & I will send it to you�no matter what it costs!  You must be comfortable.  It might be well to engage board for the winter & you may get it cheaper.
	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother in Charleston, but she said she had written you.  I am in hopes that you will greatly improve at Aiken.  But you must write me a line or two, a half page every two or three days & tell me exactly how you are doing & feel.   
	Willie is at Abbeville court.  Hext wrote me the other day.  Fanny has been cleaning up the village House after Miss Trescott left.  Perry is quite well.  
	Simmons shucked his corn last night & Johnson shucks tonight.  Jack Jenkins day before yesterday.  Calvin has hauled his up.  Ben & Jack are now hauling corn from Jack Jenkins.  Tomorrow they will haul from Simmons & next day from Johnson.  The corn is turning out well.  The potatoes are half dug & put away�turned out well.
	The cows are now running in the fields & Zion minds them.  One of the sheep died, & we killed the weather [wether] for mutton.  I have had Jack & mule cleaning out ditches.  A pointer puppy came from Carson in Virginia to Willie yesterday by Express.  The charge was $3.90 cts.  It is a tan collor rather poor & almost perished, when it got here.  But Willie has no use for it.
	The elections are over & I suppose your mother worried you no little in talking about them.  I am better satisfied than if I had been elected.  Willie was cheated out of his election.  But it matters not.  He can live without the office & do well.  He is well off.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning & was very much gratified at your improvement.  I hope Aiken will restore you to health again & that you will be able to return in the spring a well man.  But take care of yourself, don�t catch cold or be imprudent in your living.  Take moderate exercise in good weather.  Continue your cod liver oil.  I will send you a jug of whiskey by express this week.

	Your mother came back last night quite well and delighted with her visit to Charleston.  She says she got Mr. Glover to send you a draft for $50.00.  I will send you one whenever you ask for it.  Let me know before you get out of funds.  I will repay Mr. Glover tomorrow.  I know your stay in Aiken will be expensive but I do not mind the expences if you are benefitted by it.  

	Willie came back from Abbeville last night also, & goes down to Columbia Tuesday morning to see about contesting the election & to visit the Lula.  He bears his defeat well.  Your mother asked him about the news of his being engaged, & he said there was no truth in it.    There is none at all.

	Ben has been hauling corn & shucks.  We made 450 bushels & have got 250 from Simmons, only a�from Johnson & none yet from Calvin�only 64 bushels from Jack Jenkins & $27.00 in cotton�.

	There have been two or three corn shuckings every night last week.  Johnson has had two & not done yet.

	Fannie & Perry are quite well. I left them just now at Susans with your mother.  She came in with me this evening to see your grandmother.

	The potato crop has turned out well.  The oats look fine & the wheat pretty well.

	I hope you get the Enterprise.  Give my respects to George Croft.  Write me soon.  We are all well.  Hext wrote me three days since.  He is well & hopes to be appointed to a position in the hospital.  The appointment is made shortly.  Frank McBee has just been in the office & says he is going down to General Hagoods to spend Christmas & that he will have you to go down to Barnwell & meet him.  Your affect[ionate] Father, B.F.

	Enclosed I send you a draft for one Hundred Dollars, as I am not disposed to have you without money in a strange place, & I know you will take care of it & not spend it unnecessarily, or let it be stolen from you.  Have an eye to this.

	Your mother came in with me this morning & Fannie has just been here with Perry.  There was a horrible attempt night before last to burn up your aunt Susans House.  The fire was put in a parcel of lightwood under the house.  Just before day the cows got in the lot & in driving them out Ben discovered the fire �powders�& cotton had been used!

	They have not as yet made any discovery of the incendiary.  Suspicion has fallen on one or two negroes.  One Alexander turned off at the depot, and the other a strange negro from North Carolina, who was cutting wood for Susan.

	Willie is in Columbia attending the Fair & looking about as to contesting the election.  He has to go to Walhalla court Saturday.  Ben staid last night with Lewis Moon�went to look over his place & see his crop.

	Grant is elected.  I give up all hope of our country.  The�people seem almost as bad & foolish as the negroes.

	Hext wrote us this morning that he was elected for two months in the Hospital.  

	Write me how you come on.  I was delighted to hear of your increased weight.  This is very encouraging.  Aiken may bring you out if you take care of yourself.  Let us hear particularly how you are doing in everything.  

	I write in great haste.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you last week which gratified me very much.  I am so anxious about you & it gives me great pleasure to hear you are improving.  I also saw this morning a letter you wrote Fannie which likewise spoke of your improvement.  I had just written you a short letter enclosing a draft for $100.00 before receiving yours & your mother wrote you the day I received your letter.  I did not therefore write you.  I hope you rece[ive]d the draft.  Annie sent the letter you wrote to Mr. Glover to Fannie & I saw it this morning.

	Your mother went with me this morning to the village & we came back to dinner, as the day is very bad raining & cold.

	Willie went to Columbia Tuesday to attend the Fair & see about contesting the election.  He went from there to Walhalla court & will be back the last of this week.  McDaniel, Southern, Shumate, Wells &c. all went down to the Fair & returned Saturday.

	Fannie came to see me at my office this morning.  She & Perry are quite well.  Mine & your mothers likenesses have been sent to Fannie to keep.  Your mother was afraid the House might be burnt & said she cared more for the portraits than all the rest of the furniture.

	Ben is making himself very useful in attending to the farm & superintending the stock.  He & Jack were sowing & ploughing in wheat yesterday & this morning in the sweet potatoe patch.  The rain has stopped them.  Ben has had corn ground to feed the hogs with.  He has eleven in the pen fattening.  They are fattening very fast.  The cows & calves are looking well�also the sheep.  The horses have not yet taken the disease which has broken out in Columbia & Charleston.

	I am going to clear the pine woods where Henry planted corn last year.  It will improve the appearance of the place very much & give us fire wood this winter.

	Willies Virginia pointer is doing well & is a beautiful puppy.  Bull & Alta &�are all well.

	Hext wrote us that he was elected for two months resident Physician in the hospital & hoped to be continued. 

	Ben McDaniel is to be married tomorrow night & Vardry waits on him.  He marries Will Cox�s daughter.  Lida McKay is soon to marry Williams and Alex McBee was invited to be groomsman.

	Your mother asked Willie about being engaged & he assured her there was nothing of it.  I am sure there is not.

	Take care of yourself & take your medicines & consult some doctor about your treatment.  Put yourself under his direction.  I hope to hear of your improvement & see you return in the spring a well man.

	You get the Enterprise & have seen my address to the voters of the Congressional District.  It has excited a good deal [of] criticism all over the state.  I see the Aiken Radical paper has been very severe.  I know [Henry] Sparnick.  He turned radical to get office like all the other scallawags.   Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Hon. J. Izard Middleton]

	I had the pleasure of receiving your very interesting letter this morning.  In regard to the centennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence I concur with you more heartily in sentiment & feeling.  In my address before the Medical College in Charleston last spring I used the following language �What would the Revolutionary heroes  & patriots of South Carolina have said & done if they would have foreseen their descendants in less than a century, living under the government of their former slaves, carpet baggers & scallawags?  Would they not have paused on their rebellion, & said it was better to remain a British Province than become a sovereign State.�

	But, my dear sir, the result of their patriotism & heroism, has been so disastrous to their descendants after the lapse of a hundred years, yet it does not terminate their glory or dim their virtues.  
We should feel as proud of their great actions & cherish their memories as dearly, as if the results had been different.  We must not think less of our glorious ancestry because misfortune has befallen us nor should we less cordially unite, in celebrating their patriotism , their heroism & their virtues.  The South has as much right to honor & boast of that Declaration of Independence as the north has.  The Southern people contributed as much to the success of the American Revolution, as the northern people.  One of them penned the Declaration of Independence and another one of their sons was commander in chief of the army during the whole war; and but for his wisdom, unerring judgement & unselfish ambition our independence would never have been achieved.  The Southern members of the old Continental Congress were the peers of any from the north in ability, eloquence & statesmanship.

	Why then, my dear sir, when it is proposed to do honor to the memories of these illustrious men, Southern men as well as Northern men, should we hesitate to unite in the celebration?  I am sure we love & venerate our patriots & heroes as much as the people of [incomplete]

Tell Willie I have rece[ive]d a pack of letters this morning, which he will have to come home & answer.  I cannot.

	I returned home from Walhalla last night half past eleven.  We had a grand meeting fifteen hundred persons present & three hundred mounted on horses.  General Hampton, Col. Simpson, myself, General McGowan, Col. Aiken, Col. Cothran & Col. Wallace all addressed the meeting in the order of their names as stated.  General Hampton told me that he insisted to the committee of arrangements that I should address the meeting first & they replied that would never do as a great many persons would leave after hearing me.  The General said this was a very high compliment to me but a very poor one to the rest of the speakers.  They all say I made a good speech.  

	We all left after dinner at five oclock & took the Airline road at Seneca city.  Hampton & company stopped at Easleys station to go to Pickens this morning.  I came home.

	At Central Station a company of young men met us dressed in red flannel shirts to represent �the bloody shirt� of Morton & demanded speeches from all of us�a few words were given.

	On reaching the depot Mrs. G� was waiting to receive her beloved husband who had been to Montgomery.  She wished to know of me all about the Bellemont House & whether you & Fannie were staying there.  She goes on in a day or two to Philadelphia.

	I found all well at home.  Snyder had been dismissed & a negro had taken his place which I am pleased at.  I had ordered Henry to meet me this evening at the depot.  Ed Rowland sent me home & charged two dollars.  I have seen no letters or papers but will get them this morning.  I hope to hear from you & Fanny.  I saw a great many of my old friends & acquaintances at Walhalla & they all seemed glad to meet me very much & complimented me very much all very youthful appearance.

	I received two letters from you this morning written before the letter I rece[ive]d from you yesterday.  I have written you almost every day since you left, & some times twice a day, & I am surprised to hear you say, you had only rece[ive]d four letters from me!

	I may go to Honea Path tomorrow to attend their great meeting, but it is uncertain.  I have written a speech for the occasion.  I hope you received my speech delivered at Walhalla.  Your centennial letter has not yet been published.  I will send you a copy when it is.

	You need be under no apprehension about any disturbance in South Carolina.  The Democratic party are gaining strength every day.  Judge Cook has come over.  Corbin will not vote for all the Radical ticket.  Earle says he will vote for Conner for attorney General & for General [Johnson] Hagood as Comptroller General.  He feels hurt at negro [Robert Brown] Elliott beating him.  The negroes in the lower country have fallen out with Chamberlain & say they will vote for Hampton.  I begin to think Hampton will be elected and I am certain of Tildens election.  

	You need not worry about Ben selling brick.  I wish he could.  He is going on burning another kiln & is making an engagement with Williams for 200,000 next summer.  He has brick on the brain.  The stable will not be built till next year.  As to our House we must consider well the expense before we begin.  I am not in a condition to advance any money.  Willie has none & I cant.  Think you have much at your command.

	Miss Fuller has written twice about Perkins money but he has not paid the interest.  Barnwell Rhett is dead.  Died in Louisiana at his son in laws.  Ramon Pearson died here Saturday last.  The yellow fever is raging in Savannah.  Thirty deaths a day.  Dont go to New York or let Fannie or Mr. Beattie go.  The yellow fever is there & scared Donaldson off.

	 No letters from any of you this morning.  I am writing in my office & constantly interrupted.  Miss Powell came in & I paid her five dollars for you.  She said the account might stand till you returned & saw it.  A democratic mulatto from Tennessee came in to be employed as a stump speaker.  I sent him to Col. Haskell chairman in Columbia.  Capt. Hawthorn came in to talk about the negro meeting last night at Terry Edwards.  Willie & Ben and ten or fifteen white men attended the meeting & Hawthorn made a speech.  They got three to join Democratic club.  Whitner came in to talk about my praising Judge Cooks speech at Honea Path.  Nance came to show me his fine stallion.  Col. Spann to talk about his stealing Willies double barrel shotgun.  I told him I knew he took it, he was seen with it & to bring it back.  He denied of course.  Col. Croft called to know if there was any news about the negroes below Aiken.  Nothing further.
	                
	Tomorrow I attend a meeting at Reedy River Church to form a society pledging ourselves not to employ anyone who votes the Radical ticket.  I send you one copy of my Walhalla speech today & tomorrow will send you a number of them just got in the Weekly Enterprise.  If you send one to Governor Tilden, you had better cut it out & enclose it in a letter.  Newspapers are never noticed.  I have just given my Honea Path speech to Bailey, which is entirely different from the Walhalla speech & I think equally good.  I have been invited to deliver a Lecture before the Reform Labor Society at Laurens next March!  I wrote you a long letter yesterday.  Why does not Fannie write me some times & Perry too.  I cannot get a copy of your published letter.  When it comes out in the weekly Enterprise I will send it to you.  We are all well.  Tell Hext I received his note.  Yellow fever in Charleston!

	No northern mail yet.  I wrote you a long letter this morning and as my office is clear of company at present and I am at leisure I will write you again.

	There was a Radical meeting here last night, & Dr. Vance & Isaac Bryan made speeches against Tom Bryer & � Evins Radicals.  Speights was present also.  Bryer gave Judge Cook & Speights some hard threats.  He said the Democrats were always talking about the corrupt scoundrels in the Republican party.  �We are trying to snuff them off as fast as we can.  We have lately got rid of one of the corruptist men in the Republican party, Judge Cook, & he has gone over to the Democrats!  I know Mr. Speights pretends to be a Democrat, but I have heard conversations between him & Judge Cook which showed that he was as much of a Republican as any of us�.  This was pretty hard on Cook & Speights. In the Daily News Speights gives an account of the meeting, but says nothing about Bryer�s onslaught on him & His Honor Judge Cook.

	The office has been full again since I commenced writing.  Trappier, Hayne, Nance, Freeman, Pelham &c. have been in, talking politics & law.  Willie has just gone to attend to a case Freeman vs � Jennings.  He is trying to eject her from his house.  She wont pay rent & defies him.

	I received a very nice letter well written from John Perrys wife thanking me for my likeness & the pamphlet about dear Anna.  She says she will read it with great interest when she gets well, John has been sick but convalescing, & she is a great deal better than when I saw her.  She signs her name �Burt Perry.�  Burt is a singular christian name for a young lady.  I received a card addressed to my care from � Wylie, to Miss Emma Julia Blum.  He is coming to Greenville.  Also are in�to address a public meeting at Fork Shoals signed by�.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I suppose your mother & Fannie will have gone to New York before this letter reaches Philadelphia.  I therefore write you and you may write them.  I do not know their address in New York.

	I received a letter this morning from Mrs. Keith asking me to take charge of her lovely daughter & carry her with me to the Centennial when I go for your mother & then leave her at school in Virginia.  I have written to Mrs. Keith that I should not go for your mother; but that if she went, or her daughter went under the charge of someone else, you would take great pleasure in showing them the Exposition &c.

	I received yesterday a letter from Mrs. Lizzie R. Smith requesting me to write her a letter for publication in the �New Haven Register� explaining the Hamburg riots & the condition of South Carolina &c.  Mrs. Smith is the mother of the young ladies you saw at the Arsenal in Philadelphia.

	You must write me on the receipt of this what your mother & Fannie intend doing�how long they will stay in New York & when they will return home�whether they will stop in Philadelphia.

	Ben has employed a young man from Georgia named Barrett to assist him about the gin &c.  He is a very intelligent well educated fellow & appears to do well.  He said his father died some years since & left him some property & he has spent it.

	The prospect of electing Hampton is growing better every day.  A great many negroes will vote for him.  I have written an Editorial for Bailey in reply to the Philadelphia Press� criticism of my Walhalla speech.  It is pretty severe.  My speech at Honea Path will be published in the Enterprise this week or the first of next.

	I shall not be able again to meet the Board of Trustees.  I am still opposed to the election of Professors.  It would be cheaper for the State to send all the young men who will enter the University for twelve months to come to Princeton or Harvard & defray all their expenses.  Forty thousand dollars would educate eighty students for one year.  The Charleston College, the Wofford College, the Furman University, the Due West College will answer for the present.  

	But in case you do elect Professors I enclose you a letter from Governor Jenkins as to the quallifications of Mr. [Harry] Hammond which you will lay before the Board.

	With great respect, I am truly yours &c., B.F. Perry

Master Perry & Miss Emily
My dear little Grandchildren

	Your present of a fine, large & handsome chair, this morning, was a very agreeable surprise.  I had forgotten that it was the forty second anniversary of mine & your grandmothers marriage.

	I thank you kindly for remembering me, in so pleasant a way, of that important & happy event in our lives & which has resulted in having two such grandchildren.  I said to your grandmother this morning that I thought you Miss Emily the sweetest & prettiest little thing I ever saw; & that you master Perry was the noblest & most remarkable little boy, morally, physically & intellectually that I had ever known.  

	I have an abiding confidence my dear little grandchildren that you will both do honor to your grandparents & to your dear father & mother.  Would to God, that I could hope to see you both grown & settled in life.  It would be the crowning wish of my heart.  Your affectionate loving grandfather, B.F. Perry

Mr. Editor

	I am not surprised that the people of Laurens should be in favor of taxing themselves to extend their Rail Road to Greenville.  This will put them in connection with the Great West, by means of the Air Line Rail; Road, and enable them to get their bacon, lard, flour, corn, molasses, sugar &c. as cheap & as conveniently as the people of Greenville.  It will, likewise, enable the merchants of Laurens to sell all these articles, at as low prices as the merchants of Greenville now do.  Consequently, the whole of this Laurens trade which is a very important one at this time to Greenville, will be taken from Greenville & monopolized  by Laurens.  The cotton of Laurens will be sold at Laurens Court House, & the farmers & planters be supplied there, with their groceries instead of coming to Greenville for them.

	The extension of the rail road from Laurens to Greenville is a matter of vital importance to that county, but it will be a serious injury to the trade & commerce of Greenville.  Let the merchants of our city consider how many thousands, & tens of thousand dollars worth of groceries & dry goods they sell every year to the farmers & planters of Laurens?  How many thousand bales of cotton are now brought here from Laurens County every year?  This will in great measure all be lost to Greenville.  The merchants of Laurens, when not in connection with the West, by means of the proposed Laurens Rail Road, will be able to sell groceries as cheap as the merchants of Greenville & pay as high a price for cotton.

	In the name of common sense I would ask where is the necessity of having two rail roads starting from Greenville & running parallel with each other not more twenty miles apart at any point,  coming together at Newberry, not one hundred miles from Greenville.

	What the people of Greenville want is a road over the mountains.  The building a road from Laurens to Greenville will not in the least facilitate or aid this project.  Let the people of Greenville reserve their funds and taxation to put them in connection with Asheville, by the extension of the Greenville & Columbia rail road over the mountains.  We should not be so public spirited in building a rail road to injure ourselves & the city of Greenville.

	It is said that the amount each taxpayer will have to pay is a mere trifle.  These trifles in the course of twenty years will amount to something considerable; and we are now very heavily taxed for State, County, Rail Roads, public schools &c.

	The agreement in favor of the Laurens road is that it will be the means of putting us in connection with the West.  How building a road thirty six miles in another & opposite direction is going to do this I am at a loss to concur.  We already have a rail road to Newberry, Columbia & Charleston & let us extend that road over the mountains.  If the people of Laurens wish to connect their road with ours we are very willing for them to do so though it will injure Greenville.  But we are not willing to be taxed to assist in injuring ourselves.  B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	Your mother & I thank you most affectionately for your magnificent present on the forty fourth anniversary of our wedding day.  Its value is greatly enhanced by knowing that it is the work of your own hands, a display of your own taste & ingenuity.  It is a beautiful cushion & whilst reposing on it we will ever think of our loving & affectionate daughter, who is endowed with genius, beauty & all the Christian virtues in an eminent degree.  I hope most sincerely that you & your most estimable husband may live to receive a similar present from our dear little Emily, on the forty fourth anniversary of your wedding, and that she may possess all her mothers loving dispositions genius beauty & accomplishments & be then as happily married as she is with a noble promising little son & a sweet beautiful little daughter.  Your affectionate & loving Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Father

	I have nothing special to write you more than what you see in the papers.  I think it probable that the Legislature will take a recess on Monday the 19th to enable those who wish to accept the invitation to visit Atlanta to do so.  I may go to Atlanta, but am not certain about it.

	I think Bess�s plan about the dam instead of the bridge on Ma�s road is exactly right, even if it should overflow the spring, which I hope it will not.  To raise carp properly there ought to be three ponds, and some time we might make another dam lower down.  So let Bess go ahead with the dam, but not cut down any more trees than absolutely necessary.  

	I think Croft or Hawthorne must have that note on Tutwiler which the postal from Yadkins inquired about.

	I think the Senate will pass the Registration law but the passage in the House is doubtful.  The House has passed the general Stock law, and it will probably pass the Senate by a light squeeze.  Last Saturday night and Sunday was spent by Mr. Crayton and me in the country with a Mr. Sims who was in the army with me.

	The weather is cloudy, and there will be rain soon.  I am glad to hear from Ma�s letter that Adaline will remain next year.  She is the best cook we could get and quiet.  Yours &c., W. H. Perry

P.S. Tell Fred to feed the fish.  I ordered another trio of Plymouth Rock chickens which ought to arrive about this time.

Dear Father

	I reached here without any accident or delay on Monday afternoon.  The Fair is going on and I will remain until it is over.  After that I have not yet determined whether I will stay to the Paris Fair which comes on next week or not.  I received a telegram from Hext, saying he hoped I would return via Philadelphia.  I do not think it likely that I will do so.  I have got out of the notion of buying stock.  Mules and horses are higher here than they are at home.  I saw a pair of mules at the Fair which the owner had paid $650 for, and expected to sell at a profit.  They were rather too high for me.  I have not priced any saddle horses, but they say a stylish saddle horse is worth or will sell for $400.00 or $500.00.  If I can find any at fair prices I may buy a saddle horse and two or three mules.  Tolbert a Kentuckian who trades to South Carolina offers to ship any I may buy, with his.  I will write you towards the end of the week, and let you know my probable movements.  I am �well and hearty, happy and w�tented� and hope you are the same.  Yours &c., W.H. Perry
