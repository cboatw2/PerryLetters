My dear Son

	I write you the first time I have ever dated a letter as above.  This is new years day & the earth here is covered with snow which fell all day yesterday. I am not sorry as the day is so disagreeable I should dislike to go out.

	Your letter enclosing ten dollars was rece[ive]d this last week.  You need not send back the money I sent you , but keep it for necessary expences.  I am sorry you did not get to go to Washington for Col. Ashmore would have been glad to see you, and you would have enjoyed yourself.

	I have nothing to write of any interest.  I see from the Secretary of the Navy�s report he speaks in high terms of the naval academy.  I hope you will by your good conduct & hard study be behind no one in adding to the reputation of your school.  

	Pinckney Irvin came up with me from Columbia, but I have seen nothing of him since.  I suppose he is out at his uncle�s Col. Irvin�s.  He did not seem to know what he was going to do.

	Spartan Goodlett is to be married week after next to Miss Lyles of Fairfield.  Mr. Brown who went to school here is to be married to John Reeds daughter the same day.  This is all the news I have to tell you except it is said Mr. Kennedy the Methodist preacher is to be married to Miss D�.

	We are all well.  Willie is reading law very constantly & seldom goes out of the office.  Fannie has holiday now & today is at your aunt Susans.  Hext has been a good deal of his time at General Thompsons.  He & Hayne & Arthur are playing about in the snow.  

	I have nothing more but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you last night & were glad to hear you were well.

	You must have had a dull Christmas & I am sorry you did not get leave to visit Washington.  I suppose your officers thought it best for you all to stay at home.  Some would not have been able to go & this would have mortified them.

	Wee anxious to hear how much you have risen & see your standing for the last month.  I now begin to feel that you are disposed to study & push ahead in the world.  Stick to this determination & carry it out.

	I am afraid you find the weather very cold at Annapolis.  We have had a dreadful spell of weather in Greenville�Snow sleet & rain.  I have scarcely been out of my office & find my Montreal coat very comfortable even in the house.  This week I shall be engaged in examining witnesses in the in the commissioners office.  The election of Sheriff takes place tomorrow.

	The weather has been so bad that none of us have gone to church today.  We received an invitation yesterday to Spartan D. Goodletts wedding on Tuesday to Miss Lyles of Fairfield.  

	Gilreathes  negro was tried here last week for killing a free negro & convicted of murder.  He is to be hung on the second Friday in April.  I defended him & Reed prosecuted.  There was a mistrial before I went to Columbia.

	I have nothing more to write you except that we are all well.  Your grandmother, aunts Anna & Susan & children are all well.

	I am glad you are pleased with Col. Ashmore. He is warm hearted & kind.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry.

	I have barely time to write you a few lines.  

	We are all well & I am engaged in defending a mail Robber.  He was a young many of good character & property.  But unfortunately being Post Master he stole stamps out of the mail at his office.  He is trying to give Bail & I am busy about it.  His name is Mr. Mahon & lives eight miles below the Court House.  

	All last week I was engaged in taking testimony in Barrett & � case.

	I have not recei[ve]d your Report yet.  Your letter was rece[ive]d Friday evening.  I hope you will still improve in your standing.

	The weather is now warm & has been wet.  Today is fair.

	I must conclude as I have written in a great hurry to keep you from being disappointed in hearing at the regular time.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received your Report last week & was much grattified to find you had risen in almost all of your studies.   Your last letter too was grattifying, informing us that you [had] risen to a higher section.  I now feel as if you had commenced improving & was disposed to study harder than you do.  Your pride ought to stimulate you to study.  You have talent enough to make yourself a great man & you have fine looks & a good disposition and good principles.  Nothing wanting but hard study to make you the pride of your family, & the ornament of your country.  How good a boy must feel, to excel his associates, & how mean he must feel, to see others surpassing him in his studies.   

	When I was at school I would not for my life let any boy get ahead of me in my studies.  If a boy turned me down in spelling even I would cry heartily.  I now enjoy the advantages of such a spirit.  But for it I should have been nothing but an humble laborer & cultivator of the Earth.

	I shall now expect in every one of your Reports to see you rising a little higher & higher.  We are all well.  I saw Pinckney Irvine today at church.  He has been sick but is now well again.

	I rece[ive]d a letter last week from Col. Ashmore.  He says he is going to write you a letter as soon as he sees your Report.

	We had an Earthquake here the other night.  I felt it very horribly.  It shook considerably in Charleston & Columbia.

	The weather is fine but has been very wet.

	I have nothing more to write you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I received your letter last week and was glad to hear from you.  Your mother & myself & your sister & brothers all take a deep interest in receiving & reading your letters.  And it gives us inexpressible joy to hear you are doing well in your studies,

	We are all well & your grandmother & aunts & family are all well.  Hext has gone to General Thompsons to stay with Preston for some time. Mrs. Thompson has gone to New York.  The General is at home.  Preston seems a fine boy.  General Thompson is going to teach Hext whilst he is there.

	Warren Perry & Hawthorn paid us a visit last week, and I�the fancy to Warren for his horse & gave $90.00.  His Horse is a fine one, the fastest trotter in the village, & will march Bill.
& dear to your family.
	Edward Stokes returned the other day & took dinner with us.  I like him very much.  He seems a fine young man.  He goes back to Harvard the last of February.

	Willie does not seem inclined to become an Editor as you propose.  Nor do I wish him to.  I wish him to be a lawyer and not a politician.

	The weather has been very warm here but is now cold again.  

	I hope you will write to Col. Ashmore�.  He is a good friend of yours & takes an interest in you.  

	I am my dear Son your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your letter to Willie was received last week & I also rece[ive]d your Report.

	It seems you have fallen back a little in Mathematics & Seamanship.  These are two of the most important branches of study & you must try & recover by the next Report.  I have confidence in your studying hard now.  

	Willie wrote you last Sunday & I did not.  In the morning Willie starts to Memphis Tennessee & perhaps to New Orleans before he returns.  He goes with James Benson to recover three negro men who were carried off by Elias Roberts belonging to my client Miss Clary Benson.  Miss Benson pays their expenses & gives them each fifty dollars for their services.   They will be gone about two weeks only.

	Poor Newton Loveland died last week of dissipation & consumption.

	We are all well.  Hext is up at General Thompsons, but returns in the morning to school.  Hext is a great favorite with the General & Preston.

	I recei[ve]d a letter from Col. Ashmore last week.  He said he had recei[ve]d a letter from you & would write you soon.

	Mr. Mahon is to be tried here in the federal Court in Augusta.  It was a mistake about his being tried in Charleston.

	I have nothing particular to write you except to encourage you to persevere in your studies & rise in your class.  It is a great comfort to me & your mother to know you are doing well.  

	I said we were all well.  Clara has been sick, but is better.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I write you my usual letter today, but I have nothing special to communicate.

	We are all well & your grandmother, family & aunt Susans are well.  Willie has not yet returned from the.  We look for him tomorrow, unless he went to New Orleans.  

	Your letter to your mother was rece[ive]d Friday evening, & [we] were glad to hear you are doing so well in your studies.  Persevere�& make yourself a more useful [servant] to your country & dear to your family.

	Col. Ashmore has written me twice lately.  In his last letter he says he had written to you giving you good advice.  I hope you will appreciate it & profit by it.

	Your mother has taken charge of the garden & is making great improvements in it.  She has made dear Annas grave a lovely spot indeed.  It is visited by hundreds to see its beauty.  But I do not like to allude to sad �.  My eyes run over with tears & my heart seems fit to break whenever I think of your poor departed sister.  My life will be embittered as long as I live by the thought of her loss to our family.

       My dear Son be a good boy & study hard & be a consolation to your Parents.  Make up as far as in your power for the loss they have sustained in your sister.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your letter telling us about your demerits gave us great mortification.  That you should be so regardless of the rules of the academy is very surprising.  Your demerits were owing to your idleness & carelessness.  Why do you have visitors, when you know it is against the rules?  Your idleness is the cause of your low standing in your class.  How much better would it be to study hard & stand as you say Walker & Bacot will.  Have you no friends, no ambition, no love of distinction?  You ought to try & stand at the head of your class.  You can behave well, that is certain, if you will try.

	I hope my dear son you will make up the next month for your deficiency during the past.  Let your next Report be a good one.  Remember the interest we all feel in you.  Remember how all of your acquaintances here enquire after you.  Remember how much interest Col. Orr & Col. Ashmore have taken in you.  You were improving & don�t fall back again.  

	Willie returned last Monday & succeeded in getting the negroes he went after.  He is pleased with his trip.

	I start on the circuit next week & will be constantly employed till summer.

	We are all well.  There was the cry of fire last night.  A shop of Lynn Watsons was burnt.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have time to write you only a few lines.  I have just finished a long article for the Columbia Carolinian nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency.  In the morning I start to Anderson court & will be gone most of the week.

	We are all well.  I bought a Poney for Fannie this week.  He paces finely& when you return he will do for you to ride.

	Your letter was rece[ive]d last week.  Your Report has not been rece[ive]d.  My dear son study hard & be a good boy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

       I went to Pickens court last Sunday & got Willie to write you.
       
       Your Report came some days since & I was sorry to see that you had rece[ive]d so many demerits during the past month.  You know all the rules & regulations of the School & ought to try & observe them all.  Do my son behave well & study hard.  I wish to see an improvement in your standing every month.  Let your standing be higher & higher till you get to the head of your class.  It gives your mother & myself so much pleasure to learn you are doing well and so much pain to hear the reverse.
       
	I have heard that Tom Jones has rece[ive]d an appointment at Annapolis.  He is not a steady boy & I am afraid he may lead you estray.  Be on your guard when he enters your school.  Be kind to him & assist in keeping him right.    But do not let him have any influence over your conduct for evil.

	I saw Col. Elliott Keith at Pickens court who has been living in Georgia & he told me that he saw Hooper last Summer, & asked about you.  He speaks well of Hooper & his Father.  In your letters write about all your acquaintances & friends.

	Our court commences tomorrow.  We shall be very busy.  I go to the State Convention in two weeks.  Col. Orr is spoken of for President in this state & elsewhere.

	We are all well.  Lindy had two babies whilst I was at Pickens court & is doing well.  The twins are fine looking, boy & girl.  So my servants are increasing rapidly.

	Hext is at General Thompsons.  He went up on the Pony by himself.

	Nothing more but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Pinckney Irvine & W� S� called to see us yesterday & asked about you.

	I have just got through with court.  One case Chapman & Cool[e]y occupied three days.  Col. Orr
& Myself for Cooley, & Sullivan & Henderson for Chapman.  The costs of the case had amounted to $3,000.  There was a mistrial last Summer.  I gained it this time.  Oberly was convicted of an assault & Battery & sentenced to six months imprisonment.  He has now been in jail one year &has two more to stay.  

	I am so busy here that I shall not go to Spartanburgh court.  Next week I go to Laurens court & the week after to Columbia & then to Charleston.  

	We are all well.  Your letter to Fannie was rece[ive]d last week.  I have nothing more to write you.

	I arrived here safely yesterday evening & sent right away your bundle to Mrs. Taylor.  The boy told me Mrs. Taylor had something to send me to carry home &c.

	My trip down was pleasant.  Elford, Gaillard & Stewart were on the cars.  At Newberry Dr. � & Col. Fair got on the cars.  I saw Wiley.  He seemed very well.  Dr. Mooney came aboard at Alston.    Col. Orr was detained at Laurens court.  There are only two delegates here yet from Charleston.  There is however a crowd of persons at this Hotel from all parts of the country, New York &c.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seem very kind & enquired much about you & Fannie, Willie & Frank.  Today she showed me a letter from Lula�s teacher as I had shown her Frank�s letter.  The letter gives Lula a lovely character, highest intellect, & fairest loveliness.  Mrs. LeConte said she would very much [like] to see Frank.  

	Mrs. LeConte gave me a most interesting account of Mrs. Charles character & history.  She would make a fine story for a�novel.  I will tell it to you when I see you.  It is most extraordinary.  Best say nothing.

	Dr. Talley dined with us today.  His brother is building a fine House for Miss Thompson.  I was mistaken, she never was married but has tried often.

	I met Dr. Laborde & Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts who enquired after you kindly.  

	I did not go to church today, but read life of Jackson.  Your uncle Arthur is frequently mentioned in the account of the battle of New Orleans and favorably.

	I saw Mrs. Lipscomb on the cars.  Col. Pickens daughter.  She has grown stout & looks well.

  	I bought Lord Elgins mission to China.

       Dr. LeConte says Judge Longstreet is not going to resign.  The college is doing well.
       
       Mrs. LeConte asked me what sort of fellow Willie said Memmingers son was.  Shew had heard he was curious.  She had heard about him in Paris.
       
       I wish you & Fannie were with me.  You she ever saw.  Old Dr. LeContes son is to be married.  The old Dr. is very ill & can[not] live long.

	I have just returned from the Convention & it is 11 oclock in the night.  Col. Orr was elected President.  I made the motion to call the Convention to order & have Col. Wilson Chairman & Col. Buist Secretary.  We had some speaking & I joined in.  It is understood that I am to be one of the State delegates but I may be mistaken.

	I got my boots &c. & your letter by Duncan.  I submitted Resolutions this evening as to Platform &c.  I saw Col O�Hanlon who enquired after you & children.  Governor Adams is getting well!  I was truly sorry to hear of Baylis [Earle�s] death.  He is safe in heaven if anyone ever went there.  He was as good a man as I ever knew & tell Becky so.  I have seen a great many friends today.  Col. Johnson, Hampton, Wilson &c. &c.  Greenville is fully represented by�.

	We meet in the morning at ten & will adjourn.  Col. Orr made a grand speech on taking the chair.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Willies.  Dr. Porcher is very kind.  I expect to leave in the morning for Charleston * will stay with him.

	I was unanimously elected a delegate to the Convention by Union, Spartanburgh, Anderson, Pickens & Greenville.  Reed my colleague got the vote only of the four last named districts.

       By some inferior management Col. Preston & myself were defeated for the State at large by Boyleston & McGowan.  However we are both elected by two Congressional districts which does as well.  There is no difference in the convention.
       
       I have just returned from looking over & around the new State House with Gen. Jones & am very tired.

	I felt so much fatigued with the Convention that I concluded last night to stay here today & go to Charleston in the morning.  Mr. Janney urges me too to stay & take a family dinner with him & his daughters which I have just done.  He treated [me] to champaign & had rather a better dinner than usual.  Most of the members have gone & the House is lonesome.  We have had a fine rain & I hope most sincerely it has extended to Greenville.  I have spent the day in reading Life of Jackson & writing a letter for the Patriot.

	This morning whilst I was talking to Col. Watts & Simpkins a gentleman came up behind me & slapped me on the shoulder.  I looked round & who should it be but Governor Adams!  I felt very much like meeting a dead man & my eyes filled with tears.  He looks very well!  He seems full of life & spirit & says I must go down from the Court of Appeals & stay a while with him.  Dr. Geddings told him last winter to go home & prepare to die�that he could not live six weeks.  Dr. Fair told him he might live two or three months & perhaps not so many weeks!  He attributes his recovery to pills given him by Northrop of Charleston.  Dr. Fair thinks however that he is not cured & cannot be cured.

	  I rece[ived another invitation to stay at a private house in Charleston.  Mr. Pope said B� of     Virginia was to stay with him & some others.  He had still one room left & invited me very kindly to come & occupy it.  I told him I was engaged to Dr. Porcher.

	I sent you a bundle from Mrs. Taylor by Duncan who went up this morning.  Duncan returns Saturday morning.  I suppose I shall not hear from you this evening as you expect I am in Charleston.  The rain will make it more pleasant travelling tomorrow & more pleasant after I get to Charleston.

	I will write to Frank this evening or when I go to Charleston.  Being all day by myself I wish I had gone home & returned Saturday.  But by going down I shall see more of the members.  

	I hope you and the children are all well.  I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  I have just thought of a fix McMeekin of Greenville was in the other day in the Cars.  He & his wife who was a Charleston woman separated some years ago.  He went to Texas & got a divorce.  Then he went to New York & got married again.  He & his last wife got on the cars at Spartanburgh to go to Charleston & who should be aboard but his first wife!  They had to travel all the way to Charleston together.  Was he not in a bad fix travelling in the same car with two wives? and seated close together I understand!  His wives had an opportunity of seeing each other.  He must have thought the journey a very long one!

	I arrived here yesterday evening to look for lodgings at the Mills House till tomorrow evening.  Dr. Porcher called to see me yesterday evening and he will call to take me to his House.  He seemed very kind.  I am glad I stopped here first as it enabled me to see & become acquainted with Many of the delegates as they came in.

	  Last evening Col. Mordecai took Col. Orr & myself to the Catholic Fair, where there was a great crowd of Ladies, but not one pretty one amongst them.  He then carried us to his House where we drank a bottle of champaign smoked some good segars and looked [at] a beautiful collection of paintings curiosities collected by him in Italy last summer twelve month.  He also introduced us to his daughters four or five pretty little�.

	I have rece[ive]d another invitation by Mr. Al� to stay with him.  Hayne passed by the Mills House yesterday &�to me without stopping to speak.  General Butler of Kentucky a brother of General William O[rlando] Butler who ran for Vice President with General [Lewis] Cass, requested me yesterday to go with him to see your uncle Arthur this morning.  He says his brother who was in the battle of New Orleans with your uncle made him promise to go & see Col. Hayne before he left the city.

	Tonight I am going to see T� Hayne act her farewell to Charleston.  The crowd of delegates coming in is immense.  In my room there are three cots besides the bed.  But before they are occupied I shall be at Dr. Porchers & will be glad to get out of the crowd.

	No one can conjecture with any certainty as to who will be the nominee of the Convention.  I rather think Douglas may be.

	In the Mercury is a very full account of all that was done in the convention at Columbia.  My speeches are fully reported.  In the Courier they are not.

	I have nothing more to write you.  I enquired at the Post office for letters, but got none.  You & Willie must both write me as often as you can.

	Dr. Porcher has just called & handed me your letter.  I will therefore write you a line.  Mr. Butler did not call to go to your uncle Arthurs as we [word blotted] last night.  I was therefore at leisure.  Your cousin E� has just sent a little servant boy  to say to me�..I have time I will�.  I have just seen Col. Memminger & Mrs. Yeadon & Mr. Spratt said Mrs. Spratt wished to see me & invited me very kindly to come & see him.

       You say my name does not appear in the Carolinian.  The Editor is my friend.  The Mercury gives very full accounts of my speeches, motions &c.  If you will send to the Enterprise office you can see the papers.  There are three of them.
       
       Mr. Spratt said this morning that I ought to have some prominent position in the convention as I would be the finest looking man in it.  I saw this morning Collin Ingersoll & his father in law.  Mr. Spratt & Ingersoll enquired very much about you & your mother & family.  He seems kind.  I told him you looked as young as you did [page toen] you were going to school in New Haven.
       
       .  I am glad the deer has come back & hope you will get her home.  In regard to living in Charleston I prefer Greenville�.  There is more ease & pleasure there.  I saw Rice here yesterday from Greenville.  I saw � & Wickenburgh yesterday & they showed me your letter.  I told them it was the latest news I had from home.
       
       The Hotel is filling up rapidly.  The mercury & Courier contain announcements of my arrival in the city at the Mills House.  I write you these little matters as you are�to all notoriety respecting myself.
       
       I will now close.  Tell Fannie I am glad she is making progress in French & Music.  She is smart & pretty & will make a great B[word smudged].
       
       Last night Mr. Mordecais son rang a Bell & told his servant   to go into his library & get a book.  He said his servant could not only read but spoke French and�--all of his servants read.

	After writing you my second letter yesterday, Mr. Butler came to me & we went to see your uncle Arthur.  The House seemed uninhabited. The outer�we aroused his little grandson.  Then cam a servant & finally Col. Hayne who rece[ive]d us very kindly & talked over his battles in which he & Gen. Butler had fought.  The old gentleman is looking remarkably well.  Butler is a fine gentleman.

	In the evening Dr. Porcher came to pay me a visit & wished I should bring with me some friend & he wished a northern man.  I suggested Col. Hagood of Connecticut who is a noble fellow.  But the Col. declined as he had engaged rooms at this Hotel for which he was paying twenty five dollars a day.  He said he wished to be comfortable & it was a matter of very little consequence when he died & whether his heirs had four or five hundred dollars more or less of his Estate!  Col. Hagood is a yankey.  But how have wealthy Southern men taken the same view of the matter.

	In the evening I went to the Theatre to see your cousin T� Hayne.  She is very pretty & fine looking.  But when I saw a�actor making love to her & kissing her hand I could but feel scorn & contempt for her husband.  I staid only one hour & returned to the Hotel.  Dr. Porcher says she has three children & that such a life for a woman having children is dreadfully hard.  

	The Hotel is now a perfect hog pen & I am delighted to quit it as I will do in a few hours. 

	Today I have met a great many all pleasantly�Gouverneur Kemble, b�, Rhett, Col. Preston, &c.  I have not yet seen [William L.] Yancey.  John Cunningham told me last night that he would have me at his House next week to meet Yancey.  I saw Judge [Alexander Beaufort] Meek of Alabama, who is a very fine looking gentleman two inches taller than myself!  Mr. Witherspoon one of the South Carolina delegates said today he had proposed to make me & Preston chairman & Vice President for South Carolina as specimens of South Carolina gentlemen.

	There is no telling what the Convention will do as to the nomination.

	I must now close & go to dinner.  Your affect[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I am now at Dr. Porchers & have just returned from dinner.  Judge Jackson of Georgia formerly minister to Austria took dinner with us.  I am very much pleased with Dr. Porcher & Mrs. Porcher.  They are as fine a couple as I have ever seen.  I went to Dr. Philips church today with Gadsden King who married Mrs. Porchers sister & there was introduced to Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  The latter is a most lovely woman.  I saw & spoke to Isaac Hayne and his daughter.  She looks very pretty.  I saw & shook hands with Miss G� B� who looks as well as she did twenty years ago.  Yesterday evening I went with Dr. Porcher to see the first arrival of the cars from Savannah & there was a very handsome entertainment.  I returned took tea with the Dr. & went to meet the South Carolina delegation.  I returned near twelve oclock & found Dr. & Mrs. Porcher still sitting up awaiting my return.  I have rarely seen three finer looking ladies than Mrs. Porcher & her sisters Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  I have been very fortunate in spending money since I left home.  Janney would not charge me anything.  I staid three days at the Mills House & instead of paying five dollars a day.  � only charged me two dollars a day.  I saw general Martin & his son at the rail road celebration & a great many friends.  Mr. Webb enquired after you & said his mother had just rece[ive]d a letter from your mother.  Today I rece[ive]d three letters handed me in [the] presence of Mrs. Porcher & her two sisters & I told them you write me every day & I did the same which seemed to increase their�for both us.  General Thompson�& enclosed a letter for Dudley his wifes cousin from Baltimore.  

	Tell Willie if Mahaffey takes the insolvent�act he will have to remain till court.  But if he takes the�act he can go in ten days if his schedule is not contested.  I will try & come home this week some time.  

	Dr. Porcher & family are going to Greenville next summer & perhaps to purchase.  Mrs. Porcher is a very talented lady & seems very happy in her family.  She has two little daughters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I am very busy in the Convention &�till midnight every night.  Last night I staid on committee about the New York elections till twelve oclock & then left them.  I have been placed on that committee for South Carolina.  Today we elected General [Caleb] Cushing President of the Convention.  It is the most noisy & disgusting assemblage I ever was in & will leave it to be home Friday night I think.  I am very well pleased with Dr. Porcher & his wife.  They are the kindest people I ever saw.  I am very much pleased with the northern members & have made a great many acquaintances.

	Tell your mother I will go & see her aunts if I possibly can.  I will write her tomorrow if I can.  But there is such a hurly burly here that I have no time to write.  I am now writing a letter�at five oclock before the committee meets.

	Give my love to all the family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I will write you a few lines.  I am here attending the Convention as a delegate.  We have a prodigious crowd in the city.  But I am at Dr. Porchers & very comfortable.  The Convention goes on very harmoniously.  I like the northern delegates very much.  They are all in favor of the South & the Constitution.  I have become acquainted with many of them.  Who will be nominated for the Presidency is uncertain.  I do not think Douglass will though the north are united over him.

	I saw Mr. Walker the father of your friend the cadet & he enquired after you.  Your friends here all enquired about you & hope you are doing well.

	There is a chance of nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency or Vice Presidency.  At present the contest is between Douglass & Hunter of Virginia.  But neither will get the nomination.

	You must write me whether you go to sea this summer or not.  I will send you some money when I go home.  How much do you want.

	I have nothing more to write.  Be a good boy & study hard.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The Convention has just adjourned till four oclock & I will write you a line or two.  I have had so little time that I have not been able to write you.  

	Yesterday I dined with Mr. Reynolds & had a large company of northern members & we spent a very pleasant time.  I have formed a great many acquaintances & am much pleased with them.  We are all getting on harmoniously.  I met Col. Ingersoll again this morning& delivered your message.  He seems very kind & amiable.

	The Convention is the most disorderly body I ever saw & there is such a scramble that I have not endeavored to get the floor.  Yesterday I made a few remarks, but they are briefly reported.  I went yesterday to see your aunt Eliza & spent a few moments with her.  She seemed kind & good.  I then went at her request to your aunt Tu�, but she was not at home.  On my way I met Dr. Hayne who stopped and made himself known to me.  He invited me to see him & his mother.  He looked shab[b]iley & thin.  �had not improved him in appearance.  I see your uncle Arthur every day in the convention.

	The committee on platform will report at four oclock & we shall then have discussion.  Yancey
Told me that I would then have my�forth.  He looks very well & says his family are all well.  He is a grandfather.  

	Dr. Porcher & wife are as kind as they can be & I am really under great obligations to them.  Mrs. Porcher knows Mrs. LeConte very well as she was raised in Savannah.  She says Mrs. LeConte�s mother was old Major Porchers housekeeper & the daughters were educated by him�but no kin to him.

	I took a walk on the Battery yesterday & it is a delightful place.  In the evening I met there a great many of my acquaintances.

	I have a great deal to tell you when I see you.  In my letter to Willie I said I would be at home Friday night but I fear this will be impossible.  I will try to be at home Saturday perhaps not till Monday.  It isa all uncertain about the Convention adjourning.  

	I will not close & write to Frank.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have packed up to go home this evening but the South Carolina delegation said I must not.  Col. Orr and General McGowan have urged the matter in such a way that I suppose I must stay. 
 
       The committee have done nothing yet.  The vote is taken Monday morning, & perhaps good faith & honor require me to remain.  I am very much disgusted with the convention, but having a trust confided to me I ought to carry it out.  It is thought I may do something by staying.  But I don�t agree with the South Carolina delegation in their�nor with the majority of the Convention.  If we stay we may defeat Douglass nomination & secure that of Dickinson or Breckinridge.
       
	You & Willie & Fanny must come down to Columbia Tuesday or Wednesday & I will meet you there.  I wish you to be sure to come.  You can all come free.  Say I am in Charleston & will be in the rail road convention.  If you�any money, borrow of Mrs. Beattie & I will return it.  If I went home I should have to start back the next morning.  So it will be as well for me to remain till the convention adjourns & then meet you in Columbia.  I think you had better come down Tuesday.  I will not be able to go up till Wednesday.  The Convention will not adjourn before Wednesday.  

	You can get Susan to take charge of the children & you bring Susan with you.  Hext may go to General Thompsons & stay.  I am in great perplexity about staying here & going home.  I never before hesitated so much about my course.  But you wrote me to stay, & everyone here says I would not be discharging my duty if I went off.  It will only postpone my seeing you a day or two which I desire above all things and you must meet me in Columbia.

	Tell Willie to come with you & bring Fannie & Susan.  I have not time to write you any more.  I was invited today to dine with Col. Drayton but I do not think I shall.  It is a very bad day.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have bought you a sewing machine, the best, & simplist, for $20 & have packed it in my trunk.

	We all returned home last night & are all well.  I wrote you from Charleston.  Afterwards the Convention broke up without doing anything & will meet in Baltimore the 18th June.  I may possibly attend their meeting, & if so will call & see you.  If you do not go to sea this summer you can come home with me.

	I am distressed about your cough & you must write me how it is.  It was in that way that dear Ann was first taken.

	You must write me how much money you want & what you want it for & I will send it to you.  

	I have been absent three weeks & am now tired & fatigued.  Your Report came & seems about as usual.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Papa

	I am now here with Frank, who is about as I first found him at Annapolis.  He is weak, but I trust will stand the trip very well.  I will leave here Wednesday and stay that night in Richmond, the next night in Raleigh, the next in Columbia, and then home, which we will reach according to this by�Saturday evening.  We were delayed in Annapolis Saturday & Sunday by�rain. But I hope we will now have good weather the rest of the way. 

	I don�t like to say much about Franks health for fear that I may either raise your hopes too high, or make you unnecessarily uneasy.

	I think you will find him better than you expected, though greatly changed from what he was when you last saw him.

	I saw Col. Ashmore this morning, who said he had just written to you.  Don�t expect Frank home before Saturday.  Your aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

I have got such a pen that I can hardly write.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter and�.  I was glad to hear you were all well & that Hext is better.

	Willie has got his commission as a Lawyer & has gone to purchase a shotgun.  He speaks of going home in the morning.  He stood a very good examination.  Twenty four admitted & none rejected.

	Edmund Rhett said Willie & Albert Rhetts son who was admitted ought to become acquainted.

	I have been engaged all day & seen very few persons.  Last evening I had a very long talk with Governor Means & Mrs. LeConte.  The Governor complimented me very much & so did General McGowan this morning.  The latter says my ceasing my opposition to the State is spoken of in high terms by all.

	We are a good deal alarmed here by the smallpox.  But I presume there is no danger at present.  

	Mrs. LeConte said that Willie was to stay�ladies, that she had not been able to see him.  Lula looked better at night & seemed complimented by my saying she had grown.  Old Major LeConte is dead & Miss Graham is here in bad health & very sad.  I have not seen her.

       I have nothing more to write & am very busy drawing up Barnetts paper.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d both your letters written yesterday.  I do not think there is any danger of smallpox.  I shall appear before the committee tonight on Barretts case & may return home tomorrow.  But I write for fear I shall not.

	I went down to the House today & all met me with great cordiality.  General McGowan says no man in the States stands higher in the estimation of all gentlemen than I do now.  Simpson told me that he had heard several say that if [I] was a secessionist I would be their candidate for governor.  Senator McCain [McKewn?] told me he heard five senators express the same idea   & that he was willing to vote for me anyhow. 

	I saw General Martin & Col. Isaac Hayne.  They came up & spoke to me most cordially.

	I was invited by Col. Allen to dine with him today but declined.

       I have nothing more to write as I hope to get off in the morning.  But if I do not come you need not be uneasy about the smallpox.
       
       I sent up your packet from Cook by Willie.  Yeadon is gloomy & fears secession will do mischief.
       
       There is great division about Governor�ten or fifteen candidates.  I suggested Robert Barnwell & also that they should have a caucus & nominate him.  It took well & I believe they will do it.
       
       Col. O�Hanlon has just left me z& desired to be remembered to you and children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear that Hext was better & Mary had a son.

	I shall try & be at home Saturday evening.  I went before the House committee last night.  But Hodges is going to lead for the Road & I must wait till his papers come.

	I had quite a cordial meeting last night with Mr. Petigru.  He enquired for me as soon as he arrived.  John Cunningham was lavish of his praise of me last in the presence of several gentlemen.  Said he would rather have me as ally in difficulty than any man in the State.  Said he always had the highest regard for my wisdom firmness &honor.  �that he had been brought up at my feet & admired & respected me. 

	Mr. Petigru concurs with me entirely.  I saw Governor Allston & Mr. Barnwell.  They seemed very cordial & I have written an article nominating Barnwell for Governor.

	I have not been to the House today & have not seen many persons.  I met Governor Adams who was very kind & not so firery as he was.  He looks old.  His daughters were afraid to come to Columbia on account of smallpox but I believe it is all a mistake.  There is no smallpox here.  Dr. Goodwin says a man who has seen a great deal of says it is a mistake.

	I bought two or three Books & have been sending them today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a few lines.  I have been very busy since I arrived here in reference to the Saluda Road & my cases in court.

	We had a great concourse of persons on the Rail Road today�Methodist preachers going to Conference.  Alston Haynes family were on the cars but I did not know it & did not speak to Mrs. Haynes.  Perroneau came & spoke to me.  Col. Orr went down with us.  Says Mrs. Orr is very low yet & his youngest child not likely to live.  All are for secession.    
	
	I have just had a long talk with Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham & Lula & the Doctor.

	I shall probably be at home Friday.  It is late at night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I read a paper from Col. Tom Janes containing strong union Resolutions & speech of his.

	Toomes & Gantt write me about your trees & say there are no others.

	Judge Oswald says he wrote me last week & put the letter in the Post office.  He was surprised I did not receive it.

	I have nothing to write except what you will see in the papers.  The election for Governor was to have been today.  Pickens, Johnson, Rhett & T� are running.  It is likely Pickens will be elected.

	I attended to Mr. Y�s business last night.  But Fuller is here on the same business & I don�t know which will get the road.  They are bidding against each other �.  They are bidding $1800 per on�.

	I am sorry Paul was not arrested Saturday.  I hope Willie can assist him in preparing the papers.  I will attend to the case down here.

[ca. 1860]

A Trinute of Respect
       The Acting Midshipmen of the United States Military Academy at Annapolis, hearing last summer of the heath of their Friend & Classmate, Benjamin F. Perry, Jr., immediately wrote his Parents & obtained permission to erect over his grave a Monument in testimony of their love and friendship.  This rare & exquisitely piece of monumental sculpture reached our village the other day & now covers the remains of the �pure, gallant, generous� youth.  It is indeed a noble tribute of youthful friendship.  There is nothing more beautiful & classic in design, or execution, in any cemetery I have ever seen.  It does equal honor to those who designed and the artist, John Baird of Philadelphia, who executed.  The Pedestal is four feet high, the Shaft six, all of the�white marble.  On the front of the Pillar are inscribed in raised letters, �Benjamin Franklin Perry, acting midshipman in the United States Nacy.  Born July 19th 1843, died July 3d 1860.  Aged 17 years.�  On the reverse side are the words �Erected by the Acting Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy, in testimony of their love & esteem fir their deceased friend and classmate.�  On one side of the Pillar, enclosed in a wreath of Laurel oak leaves branch partly covered, are the words, ��Pure, generous, gallant,�  On the other side the familiar name of the decreased, �Frank,� surrounded with a wreath of Ivy leaves & flowers skillfully intertwined.  The shaft is exquisitely fluted, & ending in a bundle of spears.  Around the Shaft is gracefully folded the United States Flad with the stars & stripes.  At the lower end of the marble column, where it rests on the Pillar is a shield covered with stars & stripes & on the shield in raised lettering are the words, �Given to his country, Taken to his God�s.  A large Anchor, with a coil of rope, and a cannon ball, the emblem of the Navy are resting by the side of the shield.  The American Eagle�to life & nature is perched on the top 
of the shaft holding in his beak a wreath of Laurels, one�a cannon ball and the other resting on the flag of the United States.

	Such a tribute of respect to the memory of their deceased son, by the gallant, generous & noble hearted classmates, has deeply touched the grieving hearts of his parents.  If the enduring qualities of one so young, could have drawn from his associates, such a beautiful & costly tribute of friendship to his memory, what a bright future may they not have hoped for in his manhood.

His Excellency Governor Pickens
My dear Sir

	I take the liberty of enclosing to you the letter of Dexter W. Wells.  He was a young man of good character & killed a man by the name of Head[d]en for seducing his sister.  He was convicted of murder & pardoned by Governor Aiken on the condition of leaving the State & never returning.  He is now in Kentucky and wishes to return and enlist under the Palmetto banner.  I have no doubt he will make a gallant soldier.  He is a young man of sober & good moral character.  If you will pardon him on the condition he enlists in your army, you will receive the services of a gallant fellow.

	He shot Head[d]en in broad daylight in the presence of witnesses & went immediately & gave himself up to the sheriff.  

	I am with great respect, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Governor Pickens]

	I received your letter last evening & herewith enclose the paper you were so kind as to send me from St. Petersburgh.

	It would have given me great pleasure to have answered your letter but really I had nothing to write & did not know exactly how too forward my letters.  Had anything transpired in the Legislature relative to anointing the new State House with busts of Revolutionary characters I should have attended to your wishes & the interests & honor of the upper country.

	I wrote on the eve of your Inauguration suggesting the name of my son William H. Perry as one of your aids in the upper country but I see others were appointed and it is perhaps very well.  He is a volunteer in a troop of cavalry which may be called on for service.

	It is known to you that I have always been opposed to breaking yup our Federal Union.  But after the State had seceded I felt bound to sustain her action, & will do so.

	I am with great respect, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I received your letter last night & Fanny also rece[ive]d a letter from you.  We were all glad to hear you had arrived & were well & well pleased with your visit.  You must have had a bad ride from the Rail Road for the roads are really very bad at this season of the year.  We are all well & as quiet as a mouse & very lonely.  All wish you & the children back again.  The servants enquired if any letters had come from mistress, & ever Laura enquired when you were coming back, & expressed a wish for your return.  Alice Roberts staid all night with Fannie Friday night.  Last night no one was here.  Willie & myself have been pretty busy issuing writes.  In the morning I go to Anderson Court& shall expect to meet you at Belton Wednesday evening.  

	Nothing has occur[r]ed.  Bill is well again.  John is spading the garden & Mary has been cleaning the walks.  The weather is fine. & the seeds are coming up beautifully.    We had a rain Friday night.  

	Fannie seems very well pleased with her teacher& is going to school regularly.  Her cold is almost gone.  I have not seen any of your mothers family since you left nor Susans.

	Captain Adams is to be married Thursday evening to Miss Holloway & Willie is one of his groomsmen.  

	No war news yet.  Fort Moultrie fired a gun accidentally at Fort Sumter & Captain Anderson threw out his canon to return the fire when an apology was sent him

	I suppose you & Mrs. Cunningham do not talk politics much.  As you cannot�.  Tell her she will live to see the folly of disunion.  I have always admired Mrs. Cunningham very much.  I think she is one of the finest ladies I ever met and I likewise have a very high opinion of Miss Pamela & would be delighted to see them once more.  I hope they will come to Greenville next summer.  Rosemont must look very pretty.  But it is almost like Glencoe, out of the world.

	Judge Magrath wrote me the other day apologizing for not having answered my letter & says Governor Pickens will pardon McMahon.

	Mrs. Levy & Mrs. Barnett came to my office last week & we had quite a quarrel.  They are most audacious women.  Tell Ben I want to see him very much�also Hext & Hayne.  I miss you all very much. If I was a widower I should have to get married again.  I cannot do without a wife although she scolds me & teases me.  All pleasures have their evils.  But you cannot imagine how quiet we all are.  Servants quiet & doing well.  But they are like me.  They want you at home again to scold & fret & to keep life up & the children to cry & make a fuss.  Life needs society.

	I have written you a long letter, but I am afraid you will not see it before leaving Mrs. Cunninghams.

	Kiss the children for me & give my love to Mrs. Cunningham & Miss Pamela & tell them to come to Greenville.  Your affectionate husband, B.T. Perry

	As I promised to write to you today I will do so, though my pen is so bad that I can hardly write with it.  I reached here safely, but am sorry to say I had to pay for my passage down as my stock would not carry me.

	There is nothing new here that I have learned.  The Butler Guards leave here tomorrow afternoon.  The 4th Regiment will probably be stationed at Aiken very soon, & perhaps Williams� Regiment also.  Av good many of the volunteers are sick.  

	I hope you will come down on Tuesday in order to examine me.  I have not met with any applicants for Equity yet, though I have heard of two who are going to apply.

	I returned yesterday from Spartanburgh court by way of Glencoe.

	I saw Mr. Le�, Friday evening at Spartanburgh who told me you all arrived safely in Columbia.  He went down with you & returned to Spartanburgh the next day.  He said you were all doing well.

	On my return home yesterday, I rece[ive]d your letter which would indicate you were not doing so well in the way of food for horse & man.  I hope however this will soon be remedied.  You must allow for Hamptons indisposition & the confusion of assembling troops.

	Your mother sent by Col. Randal a large box of provisions which I hope you will receive in due time.

	Larkin says he will have your bowie knife done this evening & I will send it down to the care of Janney.  The bridle bits he sent down by Col. Randal.  

	Col. Hoke tells me that the Butler Guards write they do not expect any fighting for the present in Virginia unless the Southern troops attack Alexandria.  Lincolns army will not attack them.  They are well�& doing well.

	You must write me very often & let me know when it is likely you will leave Columbia.  I will try & go down before you leave.

	The Village is desolate�not a loafer or idler to be seen in the streets.  The village every day looks like Sunday.  There is no business doing of any kind.

	Write me when you are in your Mess? How your horses are doing &c.

	I do not think Willie Beattie will hurry down from the accounts recei[ve]d.

	The House at Glencoe looks very well & all things there are going on very well.  Crops are promising.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	You have no doubt been surprised at not hearing from me oftener than I have been writing.  But the truth is that the difficulty of writing is so great that I can hardly bring myself to do it.  The box you sent down was duly received yesterday.  I have not opened it yet as John Hughson came from home yesterday where he had been on furlough and brought some eatables.  The mess arrangements and the tent arrangements of the Captain were broken up.  We now mess together, the whole company at one table.  As to tenting we tent as we choose and not according to size as the Captain wanted.  There are six of us in a tent.  In my tent there is Tom Adams, Bill Thompson, Ferguson & his brother, Hughson & myself making six, and I think a very good mess.  The feeding both of men & horses has improved to what it was formerly but it is still very poor.  Coffee, bread & bacon are the principal things we have.  Sometimes we have Irish potatoes.  I will send one of the boxes I have here tomorrow or next day.  And by the time you are ready to send it back we will have eat up what you sent yesterday.  Perhaps you had better add to the direction to the care of J.N. Feaster, as he has a good deal of sending to the company from Columbia.  If it is directed to me in the Brooks Troop, Hamptons Legion it will come right, and there would be no use in directing it to Janney.  There is no telling what time we will leave here, some say in a few days, some say not before a month.  We get on pretty well.  We have to drill three or four hours a day.  It is very warm here, and we have no dressing or undressing to do, as we go to bed in our clothes, and all we have to do towards dressing is to wash our faces, not even brushing our hair.  But I like it pretty well as it is no trouble.  They make each sargent or corporal  officer of the guard to take charge of it for 24 hours, and last Sunday I was officer of the guard, and had to attend to relieving the sentinels every two hours.  Consequently though our Captain preached I didn�t hear him.  I had to be awake all night Sunday night.

	Butlers Company came in the other day, and the Williamston Company came in yesterday.  The Artillery was expected very soon.  So the Legion is being made up pretty rapidly.  I hear that Bozemans Company has been received.

	My health so far has been�is sick.  He was quite sick yesterday, but is better today.  It was an attack of dysentery he had.  Bill Beattie wrote me yesterday saying he would be down about the middle of the week.  Give my love to all, and to Grandma, Aunt Ann & to Aunt Susan for the provisions she sent.  They are very acceptable.

	I will now close.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	 This is humiliation & fast day.  Your mother & the children have all gone to church.  The servants are out.  The stores all shut & the streets desolate.  Nothing doing & nothing to be done.  I will therefore write you a letter.  

	I sent you by Willie Butler this morning your bundle�& bowie knife.   Your mother wrote you last night.  We recd your letter yesterday evening which gives a better account of your fare & living�except your mother & aunts are horrified at the idea of your sleeping in your pantaloons & boots!  In your letter you stated someone was sick but left out the name.  I fear it is Wiley 

	I understand Jim Moore came up last evening sick.  I will go over & see him this evening & hear all the news from your Camp.  I�Mr. Moseley last evening who told me he spent a night at your camp
 & saw you all, but could give no particular information in regard to you.  He says you are all doing well & have plenty for horse & man.

	I will try & go down & see you next week, perhaps Tuesday.  General Easley speaks of going with me.

	Some of the disbanded Volunteers speak of being hissed & insulted as they came up yesterday.  Dickey told me their families were much better off without them than with them.  So they better have staid.   

	In your letters let us know how your horse & Wiley come on & all the news of the camp.  W.M. Thomas told me that on Sunday there was some difficulty between Cline & Smith & you as sergeant & officer of the day was called on to settle it.  Like a prudent officer you called in your Captain.  But Cline was not satisfied in his decision.

	I had quite an incident to happen to me last night.  Whilst reading the papers a large black bug got into my right ear, & I could not get it out.  It was horrible & very painful.  I sent for Dr. Croft & he filled my ear piece full of water & out came the�insect!  I never had anything to happen which frightened me more or gave me greater pain.

	There was a meeting of the various members of the different committees to raise funds in favor of the Volunteers yesterday  & they reported most favorably.  Large sums have been subscribed.  They will make you all rich I expect.  I hope however your money will be judiciously spent.

	In regard to the war we have all sorts of rumors.  But I have been deceived so often that I now believe nothing I see in the newspapers, until it is confirmed by a week�s repetition..

	Nine� was in my office the other day and said he was going down to join you.  Turner one of the disbanded Volunteers told me he intended doing so.

	I hope your officers are now all with you & that {Wade] Hampton is well.

	I will send you a Patriot with my speech to the Davis Guards.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Papa

	Today is Sunday, and I will write you a few lines, which I will probably send up by Tom Adams who goes up in the morning, on a short visit.  We are getting on pretty well, as far as we have boxes from home.  Our horses are very much stunted in their feed, so much so that I thought of asking you to send down a bushel or two of corn, to help along with.  I wish you would see if you could send me down some corn.  I don�t expect they will charge you anything on the Rail-Road, & so it would not cost much.  I look for you down on Tuesday, you and Hext.  I cant give you much accommodation.  Our tents are so hot during the middle of the day that it is impossible for us to stay in them.  I don�t know when we will leave here for Virginia.  The impression is that we will leave here the latter part of this week.

	[page torn] Griffin who commands the Cavalry portion of the Legion is here now and says that the Cavalry will be sent on before the infantry.  If so we will leave here soon.  Another company of Cavalry is expected here soon.

	Tell Ma she can send down anything she wants to by Tom Adams who came down again on Wednesday.  Mr. Stairley, Col. Randal and several others have gone or are going up on furlough.  What do you think of my trying to get a furlough.

	In my letter a few days ago, I left out that Wiley was sick.  He is quite well now except a cold.  The health of the company is very good.  

	There is nothing of interest to write about.  I will close.  Give my love to Ma, and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & I have just seen Alexander McBee .  I saw Gibbs & Dr. Ferguson yesterday.  So I am pretty well posted to all your doings at Hampton.  I am glad to hear you are all getting on so well & pleased to hear of your promotion but would have been much more gratified to hear you were a commissioned officer.  This you will be after a time no doubt.  In the meantime get books & study hard your profession.  Devote yourself to it & make yourself proficient in the science of War.  Do not depend simply on the�of your officers but study & read military books.

	Next to this & before it take care of your health.  Avoid fruits & drinking too much water.  Change your clothes when wet.  Do not eat anything but wholesome food & not too much of that.

	I wish to go down & see you this week.  If you are to stay long I would prefer going next week.  We should all be glad to see you at home before you leave for Virginia if you can conveniently do so.  McBee thinks you will be there a month before you start.  Jim Moore thinks so too.  I went to see himself. He came to see me yesterday.  He is pretty well except his face.

	 Tell Dr. Long that I have written a strong letter to Col. Hampton  for his appointment as Steward of the Hospital.

	Dr. Ferguspn thinks your horses well.  What about Wiley &�.Will you have to pay their expenses or do you need Manorah?  All these�we will arrange when I come down.  If you can get the naval pistol buy one.  I wish you well�.

	McBee & Ferguson say your horses look well.  Give my best respects to all your messmates & friends, S�, Ferguson, Thompson, Houston�and others.  In haste, yours affectionately, my dear Son, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	Your box of Butter came safely to hand yesterday, and we all think that the Butter is as fine as any we ever saw.  In fact butter was a thing I missed as much as anything.  I think it would be as well to direct simply to me without saying to the care of anyone, as it might delay and not hasten the arrival of the box.  Don�t send me any Coffee-pot as we have one already.  

	As to Papa�s coming down to see me I would prefer his coming later as there is great probability of our staying here some time longer.  Austins company has received arms but they are not very well pleased with them.  They are the old-fashioned muskets rifled out.  Smiths company at first refused to receive them but finally consented.  Mr. Westfield was no doubt joking when he said we would probably be ordered to the Va. Springs.

	Mr. Thomas� account was rather flattering, but still we do pretty well having as we do our boxes from home.  I was up all last night again being sargent of the Guard and consequently feel pretty tired & sleepy, and don�t feel like writing, so you must excuse the shortness of this letter.  This day is fast day and the Company has gone into town to attend church and drill, but I am here, as I was up last night, and so am excused.

	I wrote the above yesterday since which time Bill Beattie has arrived bringing my bit. and bowie knife.  The bit was not made according to my directions but it will do.  We were mustered into the Confederate service this morning by Captain Calhoun, and our horses will be valued this evening.  The bundle of ham & biscuits also came down yesterday.  If possible I want to go up home myself, before leaving for Virginia, but it is very doubtful whether I can get off.  Mr. McBee has resigned, and been excused from the company.  The rest of the non-commissioned officers rose by promotion, so Moore is 3rd Lieutenant Williams 1st Sargent & myself 2nd Sargent.

	I think Grandma sold her place cheap, but no doubt it was better than to keep it on her hands.  Give my love to her and Aunt Susan & Aunt Annie.  I have been to Columbia twice since I have been here.  Our Captain is very strict about granting leave.  I will write you about what time we leave so that Pa can come down just before leaving.  The impression is that we will leave soon.  Hampton says that he is under orders now to go to Virginia.  He is getting better, and was out to our parade.  Mr. Gibbs also has been excused, his brother taking his place.

	I have nothing to write of interest to you, and so will close.  Your Affectionate Son. W.H. Perry

P.S. Give my love to Fannie, Hext, Hayne, Ben and his servants.

	I write you today merely to let you know that I arrived here safely yesterday.  The talk now is that we will certainly leave here this week.  Col. Johnson said there would not be a man here by Sunday.  The four companies will leave here tomorrow I expect, and we will leave here by Saturday next.

	There is nothing new to write you.  They had a little fuss in Camp during my absence about going to Church on Sunday in Columbia which the Captain wanted done.  A good many would not go, and did not go, and the captain had finally to apologise and back down.  The horses are doing tolerably well.   The feed is still scanty.  We are now formed into messes of ten.  I will write you again before leaving.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

	This is the last letter which I expect to write you from this place.  We leave here in the morning for Richmond tomorrow at 12 o�clock.  We will go to Petersburg by Rail-Road and then we will go by horseback the rest of the way to Richmond.  We will make a stop of 4 or 5 hours in Charlotte to rest our horses before putting them on the other train, and we will stop at least a night, perhaps longer in Petersburg.  So I will have a chance to deliver the letter to Miss Orr.  I sent up Monarch by todays train.  I found out that I would not only have to pay transportation for him, but would have to find food for him outside of the company corn, which would put me to a good deal of trouble and sometimes be impossible.  So I concluded to send him home.  Some of the other men who have servants have any horses for them except the Captain, who can draw three rations, and in that way can get on very well.

	If there is any actual necessity, I might buy a cheap horse in Va., though I think we can do very well without horses for the servants.  You ought to pay only half price to the R. Road for carrying Monarch up, as I am a soldier, and the transportation of their horses is only half price.  I expect we will be in Richmond some time to drill.  The whole legion will be there together.  We will be camped about 3 miles from Richmond.

	I am writing in great haste, and so must close.  I will send home some clothes.  I like the pistol very well.  The shirts were received.

       Give my love to Ma, the children, Grandma and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

	You have no doubt heard before this how Ed Stokes and myself got left by the Company in Columbia.  They started three quarters of an hour at least before the time they had appointed for starting and the consequence was that although we got back to the Depot long before the right time, we found that we were left.  The Captain did not call the roll before starting, as he should have done: had he done so he would have discovered our absence.  Finding that we were left, we determined to get ahead of the company, so we saw Col. Hampton who gave us a passport, and we took the 2 o�clock train on the S.C. R. Road and came by Wilmington to this place which we reached at 4 o�clock this morning and found ourselves ahead of the Company, which has not yet come on.  It is expected some time during the course of today.  In the meantime we are doing very well; and are willing to wait.  Wiley went on with the train and will take care of my horse.  Stokes had intended waiting for the Company at Weldon and did wait there several, but it was such an unpleasant place that we concluded to come on to this place�Petersburg.  We are to take it by horseback from here to Richmond.  Dick Jacobs overtook us at Weldon on his way to Richmond.  He was at Charlotte on Friday night, and was delayed by some engine running off the track, all night.  The Company were also delayed and were not ready for starting when he left Charlotte Saturday morning.  Ed Stokes and myself called on Miss Nellie Orr this morning to deliver Ma�s letter.  We found her a very pretty and interesting young lady.

	It is raining here now very hard, and has been since morning.  It is now 3 o�clock and the Company has not yet arrived.  If it comes this evening, I don�t think it will start for Richmond until tomorrow morning.

	There is no news of much consequence that I have heard.  There is some report of fighting near Alexandria, but not reliable as usual.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Ed Stokes desires to you all.  Give my love to all.

	You will see by the heading of this letter that we have changed our quarters from Richmond to this place which is 18 miles from Richmond on the Rail-Road to Acquia Creek. You may probably recollect the place.  It is a breakfast house going North; you have eat[en] here several times.  We came here yesterday on horseback from Richmond.  The Cavalry portion came, the Infantry are still in Richmond.  This place was chosen because it is a good place for Cavalry to drill.  We quartered at what used to be a Racetrack.  We are all in one large room.  I would prefer tenting to rooming altogether, and perhaps we will be allowed to do so.  Besides the three companies of Hamptons Legion there are four Virginia Cavalry Companies.  There are no other troops besides those.  This is a sort of school of instruction for Cavalry.  I don�t know how long we will be here, probably some time.

	Tom Adams has been elected and appointed First Lieutenant in Bozemans Company.  Each of the Lieutenants retrog[r]added one step in order to make the vacancy for him.  Tom Adams was drilling the Company for Bozeman, and Bozeman wanted to have him as Lieutenant, and made the arrangement to have him appointed.  I have had some legal business to do since I have been in Camp.  Capt. Bozeman got me to write his Will, which I did.  Bozeman has been rather sick since he has been in Camp.  

	I don�t know yet whether to say that I like our present encampment or not.  They have just concluded to let us pitch our tents and stay in them, which I think will be better than staying altogether in one room.  I like our present Campground better than I did the one at Richmond, which was in a very low and hot place.  It is very warm here, a great deal warmer than I expected to find it in Virginia.  My horse is coming on very well.  Considering the feed which has been and still is very scanty, I have been obliged to buy a little horse feed, all along ever since we left Columbia.  I would not give my horse for any in the Legion, not excepting the Col�s or Lieut Col�s.  Wiley I am sorry to say was taken sick yesterday and is not able to do anything at present, but I hope he will soon be well.  He has a pain in his back, and a headache.  Mr. McKay arrived here yesterday evening and brought Ma�s letter, and I got your letter this morning.  You all must write very seldom, for I did not get a letter from you during the whole week that we were in Richmond.

	Mr. Westfield asked me to tell you to tell Mrs. Westfield to direct her letters to this place now instead of Richmond.  Ed Stokes was very sick for a few days but is now quite well.  All the rest of the Company are in great health at present.    I saw Gregg�s Regiment in Richmond on their way home.  

	I have no news to write you of any interest.  You hear more reliable news than we do here, for we hear so many verbal reports that we don�t know what to believe.  I will close.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Susan, Aunt Annie, Ma and all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I write to [you] a few days since, and sit down now to write you at the request of Dr. Ferguson.  He wants you to bring on with you, when you come, a negro boy for him.  Write to me to let me know if you will do it.  I don�t know whether the Rail-Roads will charge anything for transporting the boy or not.  He wants him brought at any rate.  Blythe wants a boy brought on for his mess, not his own but one belonging to Dr. Harrison.  He said he would let me know certainly whether he wants him and then I will write you again.  When do you expect to come on.  Court, I sup[p]ose begins in Greenville tomorrow, and will last 2 or 3 weeks I suppose.  So you will not be able to come on before the end of 3 weeks at least.

	A report reached here this evening that there had been a fight in Western Va. between one thousand of Wise�s Command & 8 thousand federals in which the Virginians were surrounded and all of them either killed or taken prisoners.  This report is believed to be reliable.  I suppose you will have heard of this engagement before this letter reaches you.  We are getting on pretty well here.  Wiley has got well.  All the men in the company are well, except Westmoreland who is sick in the Hospital but will be out in a day or two.  

	I like this camp better than the Camp at Richmond.  The Bugle is sounding now for Roll Call so I must close.  Your Son, William H. Perry

P.S. I forgot to mention in my last that we were furnished with one horse-pistol apiece before we left Richmond.

Dear Mamma

	I now sit down or rather lie down to write you a letter in reply to your last one.  I received one from Pa since yours came.  I don�t know but what it would be as well to continue directing your letters to Richmond, for in that case when we move from here they would be more likely to be forwarded on to us than if they were in this place which is quite a small place.  All the letters from you have been forwarded on here without delay from Richmond.  As to when we leave this place I cannot say definitely.  The report is that we are to leave for Manassas Junction in a day or two.  It is said that Butler�s Company will leave tomorrow, but I don�t think they will leave that soon.  I think we will leave in a few days.  You have no doubt heard of the big fight which occurred yesterday at Manassas Junction.  The account of it in this morning�s paper was very meagre; we look for fuller accounts tomorrow.

	We are getting on very well here.  It is the place that we have been camped at.  The water is as good as any I ever tasted, and very convenient.  Butter is 25 & 30 cts a pound, not 9 cts as McClain wrote.  There is not much of it for sale at any price, nor much Butter-milk.  We buy both whenever we get a chance.  Butter-milk sells for 5 cts a quart.  We have very good fare.  Beef, Bacon, rice, Coffee, meal, sugar, are about all we have.  They do very well.  My Mess is now composed of Thompson, Hughson, 2 Stairlings, Bolling, Westmoreland, 2 Fergusons, Davenport, & Mr. Westfield is also in it.  Thompson, Hughson, the 2 Fergusons and myself sleep in the same tent.  We drill twice a day, at 7 in the morning and at 4 in the evening, for 2 hours at each time.  While we are not on drill we can spend our time as we please.    We can go out into the town or anywhere not over a mile from Camp.  We get up and attend roll call at half-past 4 in the morning: from then until 7 we have to get breakfast, feed, water, and curry our horses though Wiley has done all the currying of my horse.  At 7, as I said before, we go on drill for two hours.    Yesterday we began taking lessons in the sword exercise instead of drilling on horseback, which lessons I suppose will continue for some time.  Mr. Johnson the Chaplain of the Legion teaches us the sword exercise; he is a graduate of West Point.  We have to attend roll-call at 7 in the evening, and also at 9.  At a quarter past lights have to be put out and we have to go to sleep.  Such is our daily life in Camp.  I found my cap just before we were leaving Columbia, and as the Company had by that time adopted black hats instead of caps, I gave it to Wiley and have since been wearing my hat.  The Company a day or two since determined to have a new uniform made, to be paid for out of our wages, and arrangements are being made to have it done.  I have clothes enough.  Wiley works for my Mess and curries my house, which is still doing very well.  Several of the horses were foundered by the trip from Richmond here, and one of them belonging to Austin died.  Austin has gone to Richmond to see Hampton about getting another horse.  Wiley is getting on very well, and says he wants you to write to his wife for him.  I find him a great convenience.  Captain Lanneau is not at all popular in the company.  I cant say he is unkind to his men, for he does not seem to care much how his men get on, so that he gets on well himself.  Willie Beattie�s hand is improving slowly.  He can manage his horse with his right hand, but when we get to using sabres on horseback, I don�t know how he will do.  I cant say that I am very anxious for a fight, though I would just as soon go to fighting at once as I will have it to do sooner or later.

	It will not be at all dangerous for Pa to be in Richmond.  There is no danger of that place being attacked until they whip us everywhere else.  He will have to get a passport to go from Richmond to where we are or where we will be at, or to any portion of the army, but I don�t suppose he will find any difficulty in procuring one.  Ferguson wants him to bring on his boy and I hope he will do it.  Carson & Pearson spoke of getting him to bring on some money for them & John Hughson wants him to get a Bowie Knife for him & bring it on to him.  Mr. McKay has not yet been here on his way home from Manassas Junction.  He said he would be here by last Wednesday.  Mr. Gaillard & Moore I am happy to say have� & are in excellent health.  It is time for me to close.  Give my love to Grandma, & my Aunts & all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Tom Adams is now Captain of Bozeman�s Company, Bozeman having resigned on account of his  health.

	I write now merely to acknowledge the receipt of your letter yesterday containing the Four Dollars, and also to say that we will leave this place some time today or soon tomorrow morning.  We will go to Manassas Junction.  It is something over a hundred miles from here, and we will have to go it on horseback, so we have a long ride before us.  The Infantry Companies belonging to the Legion left Richmond yesterday evening for Manassas.  We will be under charge of Major Griffin.  There is nothing to write you that would be news by the time this letter reaches you.  The fight at Manassas seems to have been a pretty considerable one.  Give my thanks to Grandma and Aunt Annie for their portion of the 4 dollars.  All the letters you all have written I think have come safe to hand.  I don�t know but what it would be better for you to continue directing to Richmond from which place they will be forwarded.  I got a letter from Pa also yesterday evening.  I would like to see him on here very much.

	I wrote you a long letter yesterday answering all your questions, so I have nothing left to write about.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	It has been some time I wrote to you.  I have not written since I left Ashland.  Since that a great battle has been fought, and we have moved from Ashland to this place (Manassas).  The fight was on Sunday and we started on Monday from Ashland and reached this place on Thursday, too late for the fight by several days.  The rest of the Legion, that is the Infantry came just in time to get into the thickest of the fight, and fought well too, for it is generally said that they had an activce part in gaining the battle.  The Fourth Regiment also (Sloans) covered themselves with glory having�sustained the brunt for two hours unaided, and fought through the thickest of the fight all day.  Hawthorn says that his company had the honor of opening the battle doing the very first firing that was done.  Something seems to be brewing now for yesterday 12 Regiments were set in motion to go somewhere.  I don�t know where, and this morning a messenger came in hot haste for Col. Hampton but what was the purport of the message I don�t know.  We are all expecting marching orders.  The next fight that comes off, you may rest assured, the Cavalry will have a showing in.  I saw Col. Hampton Thursday evening.  His wound is not at all serious, but came very near being so.  It struck him on the left temple and has given him a black.  He does not know yet whether the bullet came out or is still in his face.  Col. Johnson and poor Yeargin were both killed.  Yeargin was the first man killed in the Legion.  He was cut in two by a cannon as he was rallying his men to lead them on.  The killed of the Legion amount to about 25, the wounded to about a hundred.  They became very much scattered.  In fact the whole fight on our side seems to have been fought on the guerilla principle every man for himself, and every man to his tree or his gulley when he could get one.  The men got very much mixed up.  South Carolinians, Georgians, Alabamians and all others fought together without regard to company or Regiment.  Lieut. William Fuller of Pools company has died from his wound.  Capt. Pool is expected to recover but will lose one leg.  Lieut. Hawkins of the same Company will lose a leg, & old Col. Fuller will lose a foot by a wound received from an accidental discharge of a bomb after the battle.  Dr. Hillhouse�s brother was killed by the same explosion.  Adjutant Wilkes was killed when the fight was nearly over, having gone to get water from a spring.  I went to visit the battlefield Saturday and saw the Fourth Regiment which was camped near the battleground.  Hawthorn carried us over the battleground, and described the battle to us.  He had a narrow escape a cannon ball striking him under the feet, & knocking him over.  I think the 4th Regiment & the Legion did the hardest fighting of any of the troops.  Wiley went to the battleground yesterday and picked up a musket barrel, which he says he is going to send to Hext.  I got several bullets & buttons as relics.  Major Griffin says that any of us who have double-barrel shot-guns may arm themselves with them, so I want you to send me my gun by the first opportunity.  Are you coming on.  Several Greenville men are here, Col. Ware, Dr. Hillhouse, Alex McBee, Mr. Moore, Col. Townes,Major Hampton.  I got a letter from Miss Orr inquiring if Stokes Beattie or myself or�were safe, and asking us if we were wounded to come to Petersburg.  I received Ma�s bundle of clothes by Mr. McBee.  I don�t need them.  Dr. Gantt is also here.  

	The Infantry of the Legion are camped about 3 miles from this place, where we the Cavalry are camped.  I have nothing much to write you.  I could write a good deal about the battle, but you no doubt heard the principle facts already.  Kershaw�s Regiment did not have much share in the fight until the retreat began.  Gus Hoke was wounded in the arm.  He is at Culpepper (where the hospital is).  He is doing well.  Give my love to Ma, Grandma, Aunts Susan & Annie, and all the children.  I will need a pair of boots after awhile such as Burt� made for me before leaving.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	I wrote you a letter yesterday by Mr. Burgess, but as some of the Greenville men are going home tomorrow I concluded to write again, as it don�t cost anything to send them by Hand.

	I received your letter this morning.  I mentioned to Dr. Austin about Day.  He had already seen him, and will provide for his coming on.  He said he could get any amount of men from Greenville, and he is going to send for ten men to supply vacancies in his company, occasioned by some of his men being wounded and some broken down.  Charles Hill is broken down, and will have to go home.

	I write to you today more particularly to describe the boots I want Burt� to make for me.  I want them with very thick upper leathers, as well as heavy tacked soles, and I want the legs made very stiff, and in Cavalry style, coming above the knees.  If you come on, I wish you would, in Richmond, buy an India Rubber or oil-cloth over-coat., or something to throw over the body.  I find the need of it in wet weather.  The first day we started from Ashland it rained hard all day through and through not withstanding an over-coat and shawl.  I saw William Martin from Charleston who came on to see about the wounded of the Washington Light Infantry.  It seems that he belongs to the detachment of the Washington Light Infantry which staid at home.  He has gone home again.  I think so hot a secessionist as Gen. [William Edward] Martin might give a son to fight for the cause he advocated so strongly.

	We are getting on pretty well here, with the exception of water.  Our well is not yet dug deep enough to get water, and I doubt whether it ever will be.  Col. Ware is here & speaks of going home in the morning.  You will find some difficulty in getting a passport in Richmond.  There are a great many there who cannot obtain them.  Good is going home in the morning.  Young Austin of our Company is sick.  Bill Beattie is sick but not dangerously.  Dr. Ferguson is also sick.  I think he is taking the measles.  We left four men down with the measles at Ashland�Cooley, Cothran, Arnold and Ashmore.  They are still there.  Bolling is a little sick.    Most of the rest of the Company are in pretty good health.

	I now understand that neither Col. Pool. nor Hawkins, nor old Fuller are dead�3rd Lieut. Fuller is dead though.  

	I have not much to write [you] in the way of news.  Yesterday a report came that 50,000 yankees had crossed the Potomac.  Today it is contradicted.  I have received two letters from Fannie, and will write to her as soon as possible and would be glad to hear from her frequently.  Give my love to Grandma and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Bring or send on my shotgun as soon as possible.

Dear Mamma

	We are about leaving our present Camp Ground, and I will write you a few lines before leaving.  
We will leave tomorrow morning.  I don�t know exactly where we go, but it is somewhere nearer to the Potomac, near a place called Ocaquan.  We have been changing our encampments about every week or two.  There are a great many of the Legion still sick who will be left where we now are until they get well, and are able to join us.  Waverly Stairly and Ligon are two more who have broken out with the measles.  They have gone over to the Hospital in Brentsville a small town about a mile from Camp.  All the sick are doing very well.  Ed Stokes is better, and will go along with us tomorrow when we move.  Tom Adams is pretty sick, but with attention will recover.  His wife I suppose will be here in a day or two, as he has telegraphed to her.  John Ferguson is nearly well, as are all the rest of those who have had measles.  I received Pa�s letter last night dated 6th.  He will find a good deal of difficulty I am afraid if he comes on, in getting to where the Legion will be encamped, as it will be some 10 or 15 miles from the Rail-Road the nearest point, I expect, being Manassas junction.  There is hardly any way for a civillian to travel about this country amongst the army except by taking it afoot.  I don�t know how far our Camp, which we go to tomorrow, and where I expect we will be at some time, is from Manassas junction.  I suppose about ten miles.  I will write when we reach there.  I have got me an oil-cloth over-coat, so you need not trouble yourself any more about it.  I got it from Richmond by Lieut. Gaillard.  He went down there to see about getting our new uniforms and at the same time he purchased whatever things the Company needed, and I got him to get me an overcoat, and I think I am very near water-proof now.  The uniforms will be done in a week or two.  It is being made by the Ladies of Petersburg.  We have had some very cold weather for the season lately, and we have had some hard rains.  By the time the winter comes on I will need some thick undershirts.  I hear that Col. Hampton is providing winter under-clothes for the Legion but I don�t know that it is so.  My drawers hold out pretty well.  I want some thick red flannel ones for winter, but I don�t need them yet awhile, nor the undershirts.

	I got a letter from Bill Beattie.  He expects to come back from Charlottesville in about a week.  He has had jaundice and has been confined to his room since he has been at Charlottesville.  Bill Thompson is getting on very well.  Jim McDaniel has reached here.  He says he is going to join the Davis Guards.  I suspected that he had run away as soon as I saw him & asked him if he had not, but he denied it.  I have not seen Smith.  I don�t think he came this far.

	Wiley has got well.  Mr. McDaniel did not carry the gun barrel for Hext, as I expected he would.  Perhaps we can send it by some other opportunity.  Thomas & Dr. Gantt are here, staying at the house.  Bill Thompson is sick at.  Dr. Jesse Westmoreland is at Orange.  He has been here, and will be back here again before he goes home.  I hope to get my shotgun soon.  I believe Mr. Elford & Alex McBee are to attend to sending the guns on to us.  Give it to them, and maybe you can send my boots on by the same op[p]ortunity.  My trunk is rather in the way as I expected it would be, and I think I will send it home if I can.  You mentioned once about sending some things to Miss Sally Thompson to put up some things she was sending to us.  Well it seems they were in Mr. McClanahan�s charge, and he got them checked to Richmond but brought them no further.  We have tried to get them by means of the Express Co. but have not succeeded yet.  What was there in them for me.  I am glad that Pa has had straps put to my gun for carrying it.  I forgot to tell him to have it done.

	I must close.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Susan, Aunt Annie, Cousins Annie, Vardry and all.  I should be glad to hear from all of them.  I hope we will soon receive the proceeds of the young ladies Concert.  We will probably be paid our wages before long as they are now due.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Near Manassas

Dear Mamma

	Since I wrote you my last letter we have moved our camping ground  as I told you we expected to do.  We are now about eight miles or more from Manassas Junction and about 12 or 15 from our last Camp.  We are about 3 miles from a Creek called Ocquoquan or something like that.  I don�t know how far it is from the Potomac.  I believe it is only some 15 miles from here to Mount Vernon.  I don�t know much about the locality, but it is pretty certain we are a good deal nearer the enemy than we have been. We send out 4 men to stand as Picket guard about 3 or 4 miles from Camp.  Some say that the enemys pickets are just on the other side but I don�t think they are that close.  

	I expect we will stay here some time.  Col. Hampton says we may move from here at any time or we may be here six months. And he also says he thinks we will until we have a fight which will probably be some time I think.  There are so many reports out that it is hard for us in camp, who never see the papers, to tell what is going on or where the enemy are.  They have been at Mount Vernon lately, and committed some depredations.  They have been in possession of this section of the country.  We are camped near Bacon Run Church from which point our troops have been driven several times by the enemy, before the Battle.  We started from our last Camp Monday during a rain, and it has been raining  ever since we got here and is cloudy yet.  I suppose it will clear off some time sooner or later.  We have a tolerably pleasant location, as far as we can judge considering the weather.  The water is pretty good, but not too abundant.  It is a very poor country for horse food.  Corn has to be hauled 15 miles.  We still get our mail from Manassas junction so you can either direct there as you have been doing to Richmond.

	Wiley washes very well and cooks very well, and does very well though he has been sick several times.  I don�t need any new shirts now.  I enjoy myself tolerably well only.  Camp life is so monotonous that there cant be much enjoyment in it.  

	I have never seen Beauregard. I passed him once but did not know it was him until afterwards, so did not see him.  I have not spoken to Col. Hampton.  Capt. Lanman does only tolerably well.  I wish he would get some higher office, so we could get rid of him.  

	Our sick men were left at Brentsville.  They are getting on very well.  Both the Fergusons are there.  We have not heard from them since [we] got here.  Tom Adams was the sickest one we left of my acquaintance.  I think he will get over it.  He is in a private House in Brentsville.  The Fergusons and Waverly Stairly are at the same House.  Several of the Company were detailed to stay and wait on them.  Old Mr. Stairly, Bramlett, Bates were the ones.

	I hope you will have sent on that India Rubber blanket, and the boots by Mr. Burgess.  The oil-cloth coat that Mr. Gaillard bought for me is not a very good one.  It is not as water-proof as it ought to be.  A Tailor from Richmond the other day took the measures of the whole Legion for a new uniform to be made for us by the ladies of South Carolina.  I suppose it is to be made by the Society, or whatever it is.  Miss Hampton was writing to you about our new uniforms [that] will be made in a few days.  We will have more uniforms than we will be able to carry.  These latter as I wrote you before are to be made by the Ladies of Petersburg, so Miss Nellie Orr can have a chance at them.

	Ed Stokes is about well and desires to be remembered to you.  Bill Thompson is still at the house he has been at.  I saw a letter from Bill Beattie yesterday.  He is getting on very well, and will be back at Camp in about ten days he says.  Bolling staid�sick at Brentsville, but not much sick.  He is probably taking measles.  

	I have not much more to write you, so I will close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I had the pleasure of traveling to Belton this morning with Governor Pickens, Mrs. Pickens & his daughters.  And although I had a good deal of chat with the with the Governor & ate breakfast at Belton with him it did not�to be introduced to his wife.  I think her very pretty & she seemed pleasant & affectionate towards her husband, reclining on his breast & sleeping in his arms in the car.  

	At Belton I fell in company with Judge Whitner & his lady going on to Virginia to see their sick son Major Whitner of Sloans Regiment.  They made the ride here quite pleasant.  Mrs. Whitner is a very fine lady plain & affectionate.  We were acquainted in our younger days & waited on Dr. Robinson when he was married.  She is now very much distressed at the sickness of her son.  We spoke of the dreadful consequences of the war.  She said she did not believe, when she was for secession that we would have war.  I told her I knew it & gave her a long talk.

	Poor Joab Mauldins corpse is now here.  His mother went on to see him [page torn] his corpse although both were in Richmond last Sunday night.  She went on to Manassas it is supposed & [brought] the corpse to this place the next morning.  Thos Crayton is here in search of her.  Mrs. Whitner remarked that Mrs. Mauldin was one of the best women she ever knew & her fate in this life had been a very hard one.

	I heard nothing of Augustus Hoke & Dr. Crook.  Fifteen Volunteers got in the cars at Williamston for Manassas�four at Greenville.

	I have been asleep this evening & have seen no one.  It is now raining at six oclock.  We stay here till eight in the morning.  I have Ed Stokes boy &�under my charge &�.  I have not been able to see Miss Hampton or Mrs. LeConte or hear of them.

	My friend Janney complains of the rudeness of the Volunteers.  All along the road today they were gathered in crowds to ss a troop of Cavalry pass down from Abbeville to camp near this place.  

	I have no news to write you.  Jennings Goodlett &c. are here on their way back to Manassas.  The papers state it was a mistake about General Evans capturing the 1700 yankees.

	I hope to have something of more interest to write you from Petersburg Thursday evening.  Take care of yourself, children & household.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Since writing you at six oclock this evening I have seen Major Cely, Blassingame & Peadon & young Cely all just from the army.  Peden saw Willie Thursday morning & he was quite well.  William Thompson is getting well.  John Jones is almost well.  Robert Pool is doing well & in no danger.  Scruggs is not much sick.

	I saw poor Cely at Hunts Hotel on his way to Greenville with a ball in his forehead.  He will recover.  The wound is healing up & looks curious.  Dr. Goodwin heard my voice in Celys room & stopped in.  He told me he has six sons in the army.  One was wounded & his wife went on to nurse him.  She is still there waiting for another battle & to attend the sick.

	Blassingame says the sick are very much neglected in the army.  He came back with the corpse of Joab Mauldin.  Mrs. Mauldin telegraphed this evening from Culpepper to keep the corpse at Anderson till her return.  She missed it in Richmond.  Blassingame says they live very well in the army�good provisions but badly cooked.  He gives some amusing accounts of the soldiers running.  He says Henry Cauble�.  Judge Whitner told me two of the Holl� from Tugaloo threw down their muskets & said they would not fight.  They were expelled [from] the company.  Peden of Boz[e]mans Guards is here wounded.  He looks well & will recover.  He says Captain Adams is getting better, but his wife had not arrived when he left.  He says the captain very sick with measles but in no danger & is now well & getting well.

	I have heard nothing of Hoke or Crook.  They are in North Carolina.

	I saw�Legare at the supper table.  Judge Whitner introduced us & I told that I had known him years ago.  Yes he said in 1830, he spent a summer at Greenville.  We spoke of your aunt his wifes stepmother & he enquired after your Mother.

	The weather is excessively hot & I must stop writing.   I think you must admit I have complied with your request in writing for I have now written ten long letters.

	I will send this letter by Blassingame.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just been to see Miss Nelly Orr & spent an hour very pleasantly with her & her mother.  They seem good & affectionate & I like them very much.  Miss Nelly is good looking but not a beauty.  She is very intelligent & pleasant in her manners & expressed great interest in you & Fannie & Willie.  She was spared of another battle where some of her Greenville friends might be killed or wounded.  She & her mother both requested me to say to Willie and his friends that they must come to Petersburgh in case any casualty happened to them whilst in the army.  She says that a merchant here promised to procure an India Rubber coat & would send it to me this evening.

	We reached here last night about nine oclock.  We were detained at Charlotte five or six hours.  I saw Dr. Gibbon and he was very kind.  Judge Whitner rece[ive]d a telegram that his son was much better & not to come on.  But he & Mrs. Whitner left this morning for Culpepper.  I was sorry to part with them.  Mrs. Izard was in company all the way from Columbia & Co, McFarland & young Haskell.

	At Raleigh I saw Vardry McBee & Col. Burton who told me Captain Hoke was sick at Greensboro & Dr. Crook was sick at Chapel Hill.  But I presume they are at home by this time.

	This morning a number of soldiers in Sloans Regiment passed through Petersburgh before I got up.  Judge Whitner saw them.  Young Sloan brother of Mrs. Easly shot through the�was one of them.

       The cars were filled with troops from Georgia & Alabama.  And all along the road the ladies would�nose gays &c.
       
       I shall go to Richmond this evening, stay there tomorrow & go to Manassas next day.
       
	So for the conductors have all passed me for half fare.  I have met a great many acquaintances going on to the army & also� young Knotts who went to school at Greenville came up & introduced himself  & said he was going on to join the Brooks Cavalry.

	I told Miss Nelly when I took leave of her that I hoped some of the Greenville troops would capture her & bring her to Greenville as a trophy of the war.  She smiled as if it would not be an impossible thing.   Like some of the yankees, she might prefer being captured by a good looking cavalier.  She says Willie does not look at all like me & supposes he looks like you.  Her father lives in very handsome style.  

	My love to all.  I hope I hear from you in Richmond.  I gave your letter to Nelly.  B.F. Perry

	I arrived here last night about nine oclock & there was the greatest difficulty in getting lodging.  I walked from the depot to the Spotswood Hotel& succeeded in securing a room.  This morning I met Barnwell Rhett who kindly went with me to the Secretary of War.  His subordinate refused a passport notwithstanding Governor Pickens certificate on my saying that my son was not sick.  Rhett then presented Pickens certificate to Walker & he immediately gave me a passport for myself & two servants.  I then called on Col. Memminger who invited me to his house this evening.  Then I went to the�looked at the Equestrian Statue of Washington superior to Jacksons at Washington.  I then walked into the Representative Hall & had a long chat with Mr. Barnwell.  Rhett came up & said who would have thought twelve months ago that Mr. Perry would be on his way to the army to see his son?  Mr. Barnwell replied who thought then that there would be an army at all!  I had a long talk with Rhett this morning before breakfast.  He & Barnwell differ on almost every subject before Congress. 

        I have just purchased a fine india Rubber overcoat for Willie, ten dollars.  I met Mr. Boyce in the War Department.  On my way back I met Col. Chesnut who asked me to carry a letter & package to General Beauregard.  Dr. [page torn], who is very feeble from typhoid fever tells me Mrs. Hampton has returned to Columbia.  He says the Legion is now at Oc[c]oquan near the Potomac fifteen or twenty miles from Washington & that a forward movement is contemplated, crossing over into Maryland.  It is said Lee will fight a battle shortly in Western Virginia.
       
       I have seen a great many young men from the army & going to the army.  Cox has been discharged from the Butler Guards & tells me he is going to Pennsylvania to look after his property.  He is very much alarmed about it & says that if confiscated he will be pennyless.  He says John Jones, Pu� Pool, Scruggs, Carson are well or improving.  Two of Duncans sons, Wiles & T� are to be discharged on account of their health.  Duncan & wife are still at FairFax.  He did not know much about the Legion.  I met young Dr. � now engaged in the Hospital.  He told me a great deal about the prisoners.  
       
       Ed Stokes boy John lost four trappings of the�at Petersburgh & they could not be found.  
       
       I shall not be able to see the President I expect till my return.  I sent to the Post office but rece[ive]d no letter from you.  Cox tells me Thomas has returned home & he may tell you about the Legion.  Love to all.  I may write again tonight.  B.F. Perry

	It is now five oclock Saturday evening, and I have just seen Mr. Bartell of Anderson who belongs to the Brooks Cavalry.  He left Hamptons camp this morning & saw Willie yesterday.  He says Willie is quite well & stands the camp life better than any of them�that he has not been sick at all.  The Legion is now at O[c]coquan & will remain there till they march over into Maryland about the first of October.  But Bartell knows nothing about their movements.  I shall start in the morning, but will no doubt have some difficulty in getting a conveyance from Manassas to the Legion.  

	I see every hour some of my acquaintances.  A great many come up & make themselves known to me from the middle & lower country.  Heise came up just now & has a long chat.  Barnett of Spartanburg has a son sick in the camp but could not get a passport.  He has gone to see Col. Chesnut.

	There is such a crowd here & such confusion that I am anxious to get off.  Indeed I am anxious to be quietly at home again.  A crowd has no pleasures for me like home.  Bartell says Willie has bought a pair of shoes with soles three inches thick to wear in camp.  When I get there with his boots, india rubber coat & bed covering & woolen socks, he will be well prepared for the winter & bad weather.  Gill� was here the other day on his return from Petersburgh with their new company as I was informed by Doctor Austin.

	I have nothing more to write & simply write you again to tell about Willie.  

	The boys John & Prince seem lonely in the crowd & came to enquire when I was going on.

	I have rece[ive]d no letter from you.  But Sharpe told me he left Greenville Wednesday morning & nothing new had occurred.  He is going on to join the legion.  He is from Georgia.

	I hope you & your mother, Annie, Susan & the children are all well & doing well.  I am anxious to be with you again.  When in Petersburg I told Nelly Orr that I would stop & tell her the news from the army, but I do not think now that I shall stop when my face is once turned homeward.

Camp Griffin, Va.

Dear Mamma

	I have received several letters from home lately and will now write you a few lines.

	Since I last wrote you Pa has been here and has by this time returned home and given you some account of how we are getting on here in Camp.  He visited our Camp and saw us under very disadvantageous circumstances.  It was raining all the time he was here and our encampment was very muddy.  Pa bought me a tent in Richmond, but I have not received it yet.  I suppose it is at the junction by this time, and I will probably go up tomorrow and get it.  It will be very acceptable, for the tents we have leak very badly, while wall tents such as he has bought me keep perfectly dry.  Mr. Westfield has one, and he has room a plenty I have been staying in a tent with him and Ed Stokes.  You said in one of your letters that you had two good blankets which you would send to me if I needed them.  I think if you have a good opportunity you had better send them on, as I will no doubt need them when the weather gets cooler.  I hope they are colored ones.  The Blackberry wine and jam that you sent on has not come to hand.  It I suppose was in the box of Mrs. Williams which has not come to hand.

	Since Pa left our Cavalry has had a slight touch of something bordering on war.  Maj. Butler took 25 men from each company making 100 men, in which number I was, and we went to within about 8 miles of Alexandria and surprised two posts where the enemy had pickets.  We took one prisoner at the first post and two at the second.  I was among the first in the charge, and though there was not much danger in reality, we expected some.  The enemy�s pickets ran into the woods.  I took a gun, an overcoat, and a haversack, but we were obliged to give up the articles we took.  The guns have been retained by the government, the other things were given back to us, but somebody got possession of my overcoat, and I have not succeeded in finding it yet.  The Haversack I still have.  A good many guns, some 8 or 10 were taken by us.  Besides the 3 soldiers we took a free negro and a white man and two ambulances and horses.  The white man was driving the ambulance, and when he saw us coming he jumped out, and took to the woods, but we caught him, and have sen[t] him and the negro, and the 3 pickets to Headquarters at Manassas, and I suppose have now been sent on to Richmond.  The negro was a suspected character, which was the reason of our taking him.  He lived a little this side of the pickets.  The second ambulance was taken at the first picket.  I�ve returned and camped all night at Pohick church about 12 miles from Alexandria and 15 miles from our Camp.  The church was built by Washington and was the one he worshiped in.  It is about 6 miles from Mount Vernon.    We slept in it all night and came back to Camp next day.  We took nothing with us on the trip except a blanket, 2 days horse feed, and some provisions for ourselves in our haversacks.  It was raining when we started and rained all day.  We seem always to make our marches in wet weather.  When we galloped down to the camp-fire where the pickets were posted I had my pistol cocked and just as I got there it went of[f].  I thought at the moment that some of the enemy had shot at from the woods on the opposite side of the road, and turned to shoot in return.  Fortunately it did not hurt me, only the powder burnt my finger very slightly.  We will probably have another expedition very soon.  We went within 2 miles of Mt. Vernon and in sight of the Potomac.

	The red flannel drawers and undershirts will be very acceptable.   I think Mr. � has sent on the money raised for�by the concert.  And a vote of thanks has been voted to your society and the young ladies Concert by the Troop.

	I have I believe all the papers you sent me, and am very glad to see them.  When I say I see no papers I mean Richmond papers by which we get the latest news.

	I will now close.  I hope Pa has got home safe and in good health.  He was rather unwell when he left me, but he said nothing about it in the letter he wrote me from Richmond, so I suppose he had got over it.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunts Susan & Anne and to Fannie, Annie, Hext, Vardry, Aleck and all.  I was very glad to hear from Vardry.  Tell Hext I am very sorry I could not send him the gun I took the other day.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Mr. Boggs went up to the 4th Regiment the other day and so I got the paper signed that Pa left here.

Dear Papa

	I wrote a letter home a day or two since by Mr. West but as an opportunity offers to send another letter by hand I avail myself of it.  Jim Moore is going home tomorrow on account of his wife�s sickness, and will carry this letter.  He will stay several weeks, and Ma can send those two blankets she spoke of, by him.  I am in need of a hat if you can find a broad rimmed black felt Hat�size 7 ?.  You had better get it for me.

	I went to the junction yesterday and succeeded in finding my tent, and I expect to have it brought down today or tomorrow.  I had sent by several persons to get it, but none of them succeeded.  The Tent came there on Monday, but it was not unloaded until yesterday over a week after its arrival.  I had the misfortune yesterday at the Junction to loose or have my pistol stolen.  I think it was stolen.  I went by myself and had to hitch my horse, and while I was gone someone took one of my pistols from  out of my Holsters.

	We have been expecting to be paid off for some time, and I think we will be paid off in a day or two.

	Bill Thompson forgot to put in his letter to [his] mother that he wants her to send him a hat size 7 ? & a pair of gloves.  I wish Ma to send word to her about this. 

	I have nothing to write about, and merely write this because Moore is going home and you may expect one.  I hope you are safe home by this time though I have not yet heard of your arrival.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I got the paper signed by Fuller that you left, and sent it this morning by Mr. West.

Dear Papa

	I have received several letters from you and Ma since I have last written to you.  My delay in writing has been owing to the absolute impossibility of getting anything to write with.  The greater portion of our company, and the other cavalry Companies together with all the infantry and artillery were ordered to move last Friday.  We came down to this point, about 3 miles from the river, and about ten miles from the Camp, expecting to go immediately into a fight, but it seems that we came down to protect a battery on the river which the Artillery have erected.  The Battery was completed and opened [fire] on several steamers lying in the river.  On Wednesday the Cavalry immediately saddled and went to the scene of action to support the Artillery in case the enemy attempted a landing, but they did not attempt it and after the cannonading between the battery and the vessels had continued off & on for 4 or 5 hours, it stopped and we came back.  One of the enemy�s steamers was struck 3 times and one was crippled.  No damage was done to our side.  The Battery consisted of two [of] our rifled cannon & the big guns taken at Manassas called �Long Tom�.  This Battery has been removed�in fact it was a feint in order to draw the attention of the enemy from a larger battery which is now nearly completed some few miles lower down the river at Evansport.  This latter battery is almost ready to open.  

	We came down here expecting to stay only a week, and only brought about half our tents, but it seems likely that the whole camp will be moved down here.  My new tent & things are at the old camp & I will not move them until I find out whether we are going back there or not.    There are some 15 or 20 of the company at the old camp & the rest down here.  Wiley is here. I want you to send by Ferguson a pen & some ink.  I find that I need these occasionally.  While Williams is sick I have been acting as orderly Sergeant and it requires some writing.  Our Company is almost without Officers.  Gaillard & Moore at home & Prince sick.  I got a letter from you & ma by Oscar Mauldin who has arrived here safe after being 10 days on the way.    Greenfield came a few days before & brought me the shirts & drawers & Wiley�s pants.  There were two pairs of drawers.  I would like Ma to send me one more pair of red flannel drawers.  There is no news of any consequence to write you.  I will now close.  Give my love to all.  Tell Grandma I am much obliged to her for the buggy she is going to give me and hope it wont be long before I get to ride in it.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I don�t expect you to get the bill I sent by Ferguson changed into Silver.  All I want is smaller bills if you cant do better.  Since writing the above Mr. Stairley expects to go home, having received news of his wife�s sickness, so I will send this letter by him.  Bill Beattie says tell his family that he is well.  Ed Stokes is well.  So is everybody except Westmoreland who has been pretty sick, but doing very well now.

Dear Papa

	It has been some time since I wrote to you but I don�t think we�for not writing, as I have received very few letters from home lately.  I have not received one for some time now�that is in several days.

	  There is very little news to write you, though there are any quantity of rumors afloat as to what has been and is going to be done by the army.  We are going to move our camp tomorrow or next day.  We are going to a place called Blands Ford on Cedar Run about 5 miles from Manassas.  They say that our army is falling back to Centreville or Manassas, and it is said that McClellan is advancing and a big battle is expected in a few days, at about the same place the last one was fought.  Such is the camp belief.  But there is no telling when the fight will come off.  Though there is no doubt our army is falling back�whether McClellan is advancing I am not so certain of.   The Evansport battery opened last Tuesday, and has been firing off and on ever since, with what result, I am not able to say.  We were ordered to hold ourselves in readiness with one days rations to go and support it, but were not ordered down as the enemy made no attempt to land.  They fired on our battery from their vessels, but did no damage.  I am sorry to write that one of our company died this morning, his name was Knotts.  He had only come on about two weeks ago to join our Company, and was taken sick with Dysentary a few days after he got here.  He is a cousin of Elvin Knotts.  He has another brother still in the Company, the one who came on when you did.  His father got here a short time before his death.  Cooley is sick with Typhoid Fever, but not seriously.  His brother Dr. Cooley came on to see him the other day.  He moved him into the country to a house.  Bill Thompson is a little sick, but I don�t expect he wants his mother to know it, as he says she is very easily frightened and might come on to see him which is unnecessary.  Bill Beattie, Ed Stokes and all the rest of the company are well

	Jno Ferguson has not yet got here though his Furlough is out.  I suppose he will be here in a day or two.  I understand he was to leave Greenville last Monday.  I got the box Moore brought on with all the things in it.  I will now close.  Give my love to all, and to Annie for the Palmetto.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Camp Butler, Va.

Dear Mamma

	I started to write you a letter several days ago, but was interrupted and did not finish it.  It has been some time since I last wrote you all, and it has also been some time since I received a letter from you all.  The last time I heard was by John Ferguson.  It was dated the 13th, and I have not received a letter since up to this date.  Ferguson reached here safe with all the baggage in his charge, including my box, and the change you sent me.  He seems to be pretty well but not quite as strong as before.  He is now at a Mr. Jones about 8 miles from our present Camp, waiting on Bill Thompson who is sick there.  Bill has the Typhoid Fever and is pretty sick but not very dangerously.  I don�t know whether he has written to his mother about it or not.  He spoke of telegraphing to his mother to come on, but I don�t believe he has done it.  Perhaps you had better not mention his sickness if his family don�t know it yet.    Cooley is also sick at the same place, and with the same disease, but not at all dangerously.  Jim Mays and Tully Bolling are sick.  With these exceptions I believe all the rest of the Company are well.
	
	We are now encamped about 6 miles from the place where we were camped when Pa was on here.  We moved up from our camp near Freestone Point last Friday week to our old Camp near Bacon Race Church.  We staid there only a few days and then moved to this place.  How long we will stay here, or where we will go to next I cant tell.  There is a Report that a big battle is expected at Centreville and that we will be moved up there soon, but there is no telling what is the truth in Camp.  I don�t think there are any more indications of a big battle than there has been for the last two months.  Our troops are beyond Fairfax and the enemy are not outside of their entrenchments so there does not seem to be any sign of a fight.  Or at least it seems so to me.  The weather we are having now is the coldest we have had yet, and I think we will soon have to go into winter or settle the war by a big fight or a peace, for I don�t think either side can do much in the way of fighting after winter sets in.  The roads will be too bad for transportation, and the weather too cold for troops to be exposed.

	Wiley is a little sick at present.  He is in a house near here and is getting better.  Pain in the head and stomach is what he has been complaining of.  I believe there is nothing that I stand in need of from home.  Everything that you sent by Moore and by Ferguson I have received and am now pretty well loaded.  There is some talk of their reducing our baggage to what the army regulations require.  That is just what we can carry on horse-back, which will curtail our baggage a great deal.  When we get into winter quarters, if we do get into them, we will be permanently settled and can have as much as we want.  There are various reports about winter-quartering.  Some are that we wont go into winter quarters at all�others that we will quarter at Manassas Junction, some at Fredericksburg or Richmond.

	Since writing the above I have received your letter by Mr. Stairley.  He himself has not yet come to Camp.  He is at the Junction.  If you could make me a pair of pantaloons out [of] strong Country blue jeans, of some sort of coarse negro cloth, I would like it very�have them plenty large enough.  I don�t like to be asking for so many things now, for I know they cost a good deal, but you can take pay for them out of the 20 dollar bill I sent by Ferguson, for you know you did not send me back all of the bill, only some silver.  Since writing the first part of my letter we have received orders to prepare 3 days rations and be ready to march at a moments warning.  It is thought we may be ordered to support the right wing of the army under Johnson in case the enemy advances, but I don�t think there is much danger of a fight yet, or perhaps I ought to say hopes of it.  It is time for me to close.  Give my love to all.  I gave a letter to Dr. Reed several days ago to carry home thinking he would leave next day but he has not gone yet.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	I wrote to you a few days ago, but as I have an opportunity of sending a letter by hand I will write you a few lines to let you know that I am well.  Jeff Arnold is going home in the morning having received a Discharge on account of his health and I will send this letter by him.  I wrote you that he had a fit and succeeded in getting a discharge in consequence.  Tully Bolling, son of Major Bolling has also received a discharge and is going in a few days.  He has had dysentery for a long time.  Bill Thompson has also got a discharge and will start home next Thursday.  I went down to see him and his mother yesterday.  He is getting well, but looks very badly.  Mr. Stairley has not received his discharge yet, his having to go to Richmond to be signed.  Mr. Bramlett has also applied for a discharge on account of his age and infirmities, but has not got it yet.

	I wrote Ma word to make me a pair of pants but she need not make them now, as I have bought a pair here.

	Last night news came that the yankees had succeeded in landing at Port Royal.  I hope it is not true.  Col. Hampton has gone up to see Gen. Beauregard�some say to get him to send the whole Legion back to South Carolina in consequence of this news�others say it is only to get permission to send the Beaufort Troop of cavalry back, as they are more directly concerned.  I hope they will send us all back.  I am sorry the yankees have attacked us at home, but as they have done so, I would rather fight there than here.  There is no news here.  There still seems to be no prospect of a fight.  Our Headquarters are at Centreville and the yankees are inside their entrenchments.

	I see there must have been considerable excitement about the election of officers for the Greenville Regiment.  Who were the anonymous writers for the papers signing themselves �I Volunteer� and �Probono Mil�oner.�  The Regiment seems now to stand some chance of getting into a fight, no doubt contrary to the expectations of a great many of those who compose it.

	There is nothing new in Camp.  I am getting on very well.  My health is good.  Wiley is well.  Give my love to all.  Jeff Arnold is a son of Preacher Arnold who married Mrs. Briggs.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Mamma

	As Mr. Stairley is going home in the morning, I will write you a few lines by him.  He has succeeded at last in getting his Discharge.  A great many or rather several have got discharges, while Jim Mays, Stroud, Maj. Borstell have got Furloughs.  Mr. Bramlett has also got a discharge and gone home.  I have been rather unwell for a few days past, but am getting well now.

	South Carolina seems to be in a very bad situation at present, on account of the yankee invasion.  We look with anxiety for news from Port-Royal.  The yankees according to last accounts do not seem to have begun any active measures against Charleston or the interior of the country, though I suppose it will not be long before they do.  I heard this morning that Pa had written a letter to Col. Hampton urging him to bring his Legion to So. Ca.  I wish he would carry us back, but I don�t think there is [any prospect] of our returning for the Beaufort which has made application to Beauregard and has tried very hard to get off, has not been able to do so.  I think they had better send us (the cavalry) to South Carolina, for I don�t think our horses can stand the winter here, particularly with the short allowance of corn we frequently get.  Every now and then we have to go a day without any corn, and we have not had a particle of Hay in several weeks.  We have eat out this whole country around and all our supplies have to be hauled from Manassas.  We are to move our present camp in a few days.  It is not much of a move as it will be only about a mile.  We will be a good deal nearer the old Bacon Race church than we are now so you can guess about where it will be.

	Dr. Jones arrived in our camp yesterday evening.  He intends staying in Va. until all prospect of a fight is over.  As to where a fight will come off there is no telling.  The Report has been for I don�t know how long, that a fight would come off in a day or two, but it has not come off yet.  Yesterday it was reported that Gen. Beauregard had said there would be a fight in two days.

	Mr. Stairley is about to leave so I will have to close.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I wrote you last by Mr. Stairley.  At that time I was not well, and I am sorry to say that I am not quite well yet.  Dr. Long says my Liver is out of order.  I concluded that I would not stay in Camp, so the other day I came out to a house in the country, about 6 miles from Camp where I am now.  It is a very good place.  Dr. Long has given me 3 Blue pill[s] to take one every night for 3 nights which he says will bring me right again.  He says I will be well in 3 or 4 days.  There is nothing particular new in camp.  The report is that the enemy are advancing or are going to advance in 3 columns upon the Evansport Battery.  If this were true you might look out for a fight, but this same report has fooled us so often before that I wont believe in it till I see it.  Though Gen. [William H.C.] Whiting who commands the forces which protect the Battery says he has no doubt at all but that we will have a fight soon.  He seems to expect the enemy to advance on the Battery at any moment.  Whenever the fight does come off the Hampton Legion will be certain to be in it.  I only hope it wont come on for a few days until I get well.  As it is probably the only fight we will get into I would not miss it on any account.  I am very glad to hear about that vessel�s bringing a load of arms into Savannah.  I heard it several days ago but did not hardly believe it, as I had seen nothing of it in the newspapers.  The arms certainly came just in the nick of time.  Col. Elford I suppose will have a chance of doing some service after all.  I have not heard yet who Elford has appointed on his staff.  Dr. Jones I believe says he was offered the position of Surgeon.  I have heard that Dr. Crook was to be surgeon, and that Charley O�Neal was to be Adjutant.

	 The scare in Charleston must be a great thing for the Hotels in Greenville, as so many persons are coming up.  It will be the same as if the summer travel and custom was kept up the whole year round.  I received the pants you sent by Dr. Austin.  Iva Williams has taken the measures of the company for a new uniform, and he is going home in a few days to cut them out.  The cloth I believe is to be made by Mr. Grady and is just like what he made for the Butler Guards.  Mr. Williams will cut it out and have the uniforms, and Ma can either get Mr. Dyer to make it or make it herself.  I must close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I received a letter from Pa day before yesterday inquiring about young Day, and asking me to telegraph him immediately as to how he was if I could possibly do so.  I immediately went to the telegraph office which they have recently established at Bacon Race Church, and they told me I could telegraph which I did, and which I hope has been received long �ere this letter reaches you.  Day is recovering rapidly and I telegraphed to that effect.  I directed the Dispatch to Mr. Janney in Columbia, and if Pa was not in Columbia at the time I suppose Mr. Janney sent it up next day.  If Pa went to Columbia on Tuesday as he said he might do, he no doubt got it there himself.  Day was very sick at one time but is getting well now.  I had to pay $2 for the Dispatch.  I am doing very well myself, am almost as well as ever.  My appetite has not quite come to me yet.

	I wrote you in my last that Col. Hampton had taken all his Legion except the Cavalry down to Occoquan, some 8 or 10 miles from here, expecting an advance of the enemy on the Evansport Battery.  Yesterday he sent up orders for the Cavalry also to come down today, and orders were given us to be ready to march, but for some reason or other we have not gone, and I think it likely we will not go.  Major Butler came back to Camp yesterday, and has taken command of the Cavalry, which Capt. Lanneau had during his absence.  I believe it is owing to him that we have not gone down to Occoquan.  I am glad of it, for we can hardly manage to get horse-feed enough where we are, and if we were to go there I dont think we could get any at all.  I still don�t think there is much chance of any fight, though Pa�s last letter seemed to be so certain of it that he even thought we might have had a fight before I got his letter.  I have burnt up all your letters.  When you first wrote me to burn your letters I burnt up all that I had received, and have burnt up all of [them] after reading them, which I think is much the best plan, for besides the danger of the yankee�s reading them there is danger of their being lost about camp, so all things considered I believe I shall continue to destroy them as soon as received.  I want you all to write me as often as possible.  It does me a great deal of good to receive a letter from home.

	I am glad to hear from Pa�s letter that you were pleased with your trip to Glencoe.  You must give me a description of your trip.  My horse is still sick, but I hope is getting better.  No one in Camp is dangerously sick.  John Ligon is the sickest one.  He has fever or pneumonia.  

	I must close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	Hext & myself arrived here this evening safely & had a very pleasant journey down.  Mrs. Perry Duncan & Mrs. Sloan Duncan came with un on their way to the army.  The former to see her sick son Robert, & the latter to see her loving husband.  At the Abbeville road we fell in company with Judge Wardlaw & Mrs. Golding who asked about you very kindly.  Mrs. Cunningham is very dis� says Mrs. Golding.  Pamela is quite well.  John is broke and dependent on his mother & Pamela.

	At Newberry Judge O�Neall joined us.  The Board of Trustees met tonight but did not form a corum & made no election of President.

	The people of Charleston are in great apprehension of the capture of their City.  They are fleeing with their plate & valuables.

	I met this evening Mr. Petigru, Col. Preston, Judge Glover, Col. Dawkins and many other friends.

	Captain Hawthorn goes up in the morning & is just from the army.

	Everyone says the Legislature is very weak and they all regret my absence.

	I will go down in the morning to see the Legislature, the Greenville Regiment, Col. Hayne & Mrs. LeConte who has enquired of all my friends about me.

	Hext wishes to see the yankee Prisoners.  He sat up till I returned from the Board of Trustees & is now sleeping soundly.

	I saw Col. Ware, Col. Hoke, Dr. Hall�& Dr. Sullivan who are all quite well with Mr. Stokes.  I saw Alston Hayne who enquired kindly after al of you.

	There is no war news.  I shall be at home Friday evening.  The weather is very warm.

	I hope John & Harry will go on hauling wood so that when I return we may carry the wagon to Glencoe.

	Columbia is looking dull.  I have not yet seen Yeadon.

	It is now about eleven oclock and I will close.

	I hope your aunts are better & that all the rest of you are well.

	Judge Wardlaw said he knew Hext was a Perry.  He says when a Boy he the Judge & other school boys used to speak or extract from an oration of Hext McCall whilst they were at school.  Your affectionate [husband], B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I will write you a few lines today as I have not much to do, and as you complain of my not writing enough.  Mr. Day came on the other day and gave me the latest news from home.  He said that Pa went down to Columbia the day he came on.  He will probably get a furlough for his son and will go home with him as soon as he succeeds in getting it.  It has been signed by the surgeon, and has gone up to head-quarters to be signed there.  He will probably get it in a few days.  Lieut[enant] Prince will also get a furlough at the same time and go home with him.  He is still pretty sick, but I believe it is as much home-sickness as any other sort of sickness.  Mr. Westfield and Richardson have been sent to the Hospital at Charlottesville.  Mr. Westfield has Rheumatism, and I think ought to have a furlough or discharge as he is unfit for service.  Charley Ketchum and Good are also at the Charlottesville Hospital.

	The Cavalry yesterday returned from a scouting expedition.  They had a little sort of skirmish with the yankees.  I was not in the party, being kept in camp on guard, because I was just getting well from sickness.  They came up with a party of yankee Cavalry, who fired on our men and then retreated.  One of our men (Griffin of the Edgefield Company) was wounded on the chin, which was all of our loss.  Our men pursued them some distance, but did not come up with them, and were afraid to follow for fear of an ambuscade.

	Ten men from each company of Cavalry have been armed with Enfield Rifles to act as mounted Riflemen.  This party the night previous came up on a party of two yankee pickets, and fired on them but missed.  The most of our Company were not in the engagement with the yankee Cavalry, having been taken around another way to intercept their retreat; but they arrived too late to do so, owing to Col. Hampton�s delaying them on the way.  As I was not on the scout I am rather glad that our company was not in it, for I would hate for them to get into a fight of any size and me not to be there.  As I wrote in my last letter I am now entirely well.  

	Pa wrote to ask me if I wanted a horse cover.  I have made one already out of a blanket and oil-cloth, so I think my horse can get along without a regular cover.  Mr. Gaillard will be here in a day or two.  I understand he has 27 b[page torn] along with him.  We will probably be paid off in a few days.  I am extremely sorry to hear of the burning of Charleston.  It must be a terrible loss to a great many.  I don�t know whether my old over-coat will last me during the war, so if you want to you can have a new Military over-coat made for me, if you can get the cloth.  Bill Beattie has the right sort of one.  But you need not put yourself to much trouble as I may be able to make out.

	I have nothing more to write.  There don�t seem to be much prospect of a general fight.  

        Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Pa

	I think if all my letters reach you that I will redeem my reputation for writing, for I have written several letters to you lately.  I write now as Mr. Iva Williams is going home and I will send it by him.  He is going to attend to the cutting out of the new uniforms for our Troop.  I have instructed him to leave my uniform at home when cut out and Ma can either have it made at home or by Mr. Dyer as best suits her.  We dont stand much in need of a uniform at present, but we may do so before the contemplated one is finished.

	I am very well.  I wrote you some time ago that my horse had a Distemper.  I am glad to say that he is getting a good deal better and I think will soon be well.  A great many of our horses have the same complaint which a great many call Lung Fever.

	Mr. Gower is about to get a Furlough and will probably start for home in a few days.  He goes to attend to his business there. Lieut[enant] Prince has got a Furlough but I believe is too sick at present to go home.  Day has not yet got his Furlough.  It has gone to headquarters and I expect he will get it in a few days.  

	We were paid off yesterday.  I received $81.60 cts.  I have a notion of sending $20 home to get me an overcoat.  If I do I will send it by Gower, Prince or Day.  The sort of overcoat I want is a military one, that is, it ought to be plenty large, and made out of thick cloth and as warm as possible.

	There is not much, if any news in Camp.  The talk is that our application to be sent home has not been granted and that we will go into winter quarters in a few days, where I don�t know.  

	Next Wednesday is Christmas, and a pretty dull one it probably will be from present appearances.  We have had a fine spell of weather for the last two or three weeks.  Today though is cloudy and looks as if [we] might have snow before Christmas.  Wiley wants some�and is unable to get any here to give my horse.  Probably you might get some at home and send it on here by letter.    I am afraid this letter will be some time in reaching you, for Mr. Williams is going by Charleston to buy trimmings for our uniforms, and may be delayed some time.  

	I will close now.  Give my love to all, and write often.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I would like some paper and a few Envelopes, by any opportunity you get to send them.  They have given us what they call Sibley tents (circular ones) instead of the old ones.  We have chimneys to them and are pretty comfortable.  My wall tent is at a house near Bacon Race for safe keeping, until we want it.

	We reached here safely yesterday & had a pleasant time on the road.  All the members seem to be for me for Speaker.  Dr. Croft was out last night & reported very favorably.  

	I met Greenfield & Stairly from the Brooks Troop & they report favorably &�.  I send you Willies letter.  Make Greenfield come & see you.  He has a great deal to tell about the Troop & Willie &c.

	As to the election of Governor not much is said about it.  I requested Dr. Croft not to speak of it till the election of speaker was over.  [Aldred Proctor] Aldrich is a candidate for speaker.  He is the only one I have heard of in opposition.

	The news from the army makes it pretty certain that there will be a battle at Fredericksburg.  I heard last night of some very high eulogizing�on me by General Martin.

	The weather is changing & I hope Hext &�get home.

	I have a very�in one of Mrs. Mrs. LeContes rooms, opposite her drawing room.  Boyce & Croft are next me & I am much pleased with them.

	I shall go down to see Elfords Regiment today.  Fainny sends me down with Dr. Fair to try & get his son in law Leap� off from the service.

	There are no members here yet from Charleston & not many from the�County. Janneys Hotel is about equal to our table every day & yet we pay five dollars per day.

	Greenfield says Willies Greenville uniform is the admiration of everyone in camp & the nicest in the Troop.  

	There are very few members in favor of the Council.  It will certainly be abolished.  I hope you & the children will get on well in my absence.  If any of you are sick or unwell you must make�..  I am very uneasy about the Throat disease in Greenville.

	I have had so much company in my room this evening that I coul;d not write you by mail but have met Mr. Sass who offers to take this letter.

	Col. [Thomas Nuckolls] Dawkins [has] become a candidate for Speaker. & defeated both of us.  Aldrich was elected on the third ballot.  If Dawkins had not been a candidate  I would have been elected the first ballot.  But de divided the upper country & in order to make an election votes went over to Aldrich.  The first ballot I got 31, Aldrich 36 & Dawkins 27.  But thirty members wre absent & mostly from the upper country.  The most prominent of the Charleston delegation voted for me.  Trenholm, Trescot, Yeadon, Campbell, Whaley, Seymour &c.  But R. C� electionered as if he had been before the people.

	I am not at all mortified at my defeat.  It is all for the best.  But I will remember Col. Dawkins.

	Mr. Petigru was in my room this evening and says it would not do for any union man to be governor.  He would be charged with Treachery.  Yeadon says he intends to run me for Chancellor & Whaley said the same.  Dr. Croft said Mrs. Pickens expressed great regret at my not being elected.

	I have not been able to get the mail this evening.  I therefore have not heard from you.

	Three hundred came down on the cars this evening.  All Greenville seems to be here.


	I have no news.  I am anxious to hear from you.    Give my love to the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I recei[ve]d your letter of Sunday this morning & I�anxiously expect one this evening.

	With all the gentlemen I have met they expressed the depest regret at my not being elected Speaker.  Governor Manning�at the election.  They speak of running me for Governor or Chancellor.  If the election was held today, since the upper country members have come down,  I should be elected.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte & her daughter & sister today.  They were deeply concerned in the election.  Miss Lula told me so, her mother also�.  They made a great many inquiries about you & Fannie & wished you had both come down with me &�up in the gallery to see them which seemed to attract the attention of the whole House.

	Mr. Yeadon seems determined to honor me in some way for my defeat & a great many other members have expressed the same determinatioin.

	The Governors message was read today & was very strong against the Council.  The questions came up to�on Whaleys Resolutions.

	I have seen no one�[James Petigru] Boyce.  He seems�to me & is really one of the sincerest friends I have.  He is a noble gentleman.  Dr. Croft is equally�in his friendship.  Boyce & myself agree on everything & I like Col. [James] McCullough very much.  We all get on finely.  

	There was nothing done in the House today.  Tomorrow there may be some discussion.  It is said the session will continue twice�.  But I do not think so.  

	I wrote you last night by Mr. Sass.  Duncan will carry this letter up in the morning.

	I am afraid the weather has turned too warm for your peoople.  It is said we shall have plenty of salt from Alabama.    You see an account of it in the papers.

	I hope Hext & Ben returned safely Monday morning.

	The troops here are turning home from several of the regiments.  But Elfords men are remaining.

	I have nothing to write except what you�in the newspapers.  

	I have not seen or heard from your uncle Arthur.  Col. Isaac Hayne seems very friendly & so does Gen. Martin.  He called up his little daughter E� to me�the other day.  She is very good looking.

	I saw Miss B�.  She told me to ask you whether�.  That is the price in Columbia.  

	Tell Fannie I will write her as soon as I get anything to write about & for her to�me all the news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have nothing special to write you.  You will see all that we have done in the Legislature in the papers.  I have seen a good many of our friends who all enquired after you.  Judge O�Neall, Judhe W�, Judge Duncan, Col. Isaac Hayne, Col. Aldrich &c.

	Hext is enjoying himself.  Mr. Janney told him he was glad he had come down & should charge him nothing.  I have not see Col. O�Hanlon or Col. A[rthur] Hayne.

	I have a good room with gas lights & shall not need the candles.  I have been busy all day attending to business for others.  I will go & see Hattie C� tomorrow.  I saw Governor Pickens on his return from Richmond who told me he had written for Mrs. Pickens to come down & meet him.  He is staying at Janneys Hotel so I shall have the pleasure of seeing Madame.  I met Dr. LeConte this morning.  They are all well.  Col. Isaac Hayne said he saw a family likeness in Hext.

	I will write to General Easl[e]y to send fodder & shucks & about ex� salt.  Tell your Mother Tupper said to me he would send her interest by me.

	I think it likely we shall have a short session & perhaps I may return home before it is over.  My Bill about impressing food & c�for food &�for soldiers wives will come up tomorrow.  

	I will enquire about your Mothers Bank Certificate & send Hayne to see Mrs. Taylor.

	The Hotel is very much crowded & Board $12 per day!

	The election for Commissioner is exciting some interest.  The letters of Th� to the Post Master General & all the c�dictions have been published in�& distributed by Ashmore I suppose.  Mistress Moore is electioneering strongly for her husband.

	We had a robbery in this Hotel last night and one man lost $1,000.00 stolen out of his room.

	Take care of yourself & household & I will try & take care of myself & Hext.   I carried the watch to have mended this morning.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received a letter from Fannie this evening & one yesterday.  I will write her tomorrow.  I thought you had gone to Glencoe & therefore did not write you as often as I would have done.  I will be more regular hereafter.  But my time is very much engaged here.

	Yesterday evening I took tea with � & Mrs. LeConte & spent one hour or two with her & Lula & Miss Graham very pleasantly.  Yeadon went with me.  The Dr. is absent.  The ladies are very�.  I left them at eight oclock & went to attend my committee where I was detained till late in the night.  On my return to my room I found Wallace Thompson who sat to a very late hour.  

	On yesterday I got the�for a speech today at one oclock.  The galleries were crowded & the House full & was listened to with great attention.  I think I made one of my best speeches.  Your uncle Arthur was present & Col. Campbell was to reply to me but he so fully agreed with me that he declined speaking.  You will probably see some brief sketch of my speech in Sundays Carolinian.  Col. Dawkins & Dr. Croft followed me.

	In the Courier of yesterday you will see a compliment paid me in connection with the office of Governor.

	This evening I dined with Governor Pickens & a large company.  Porter Pres[ident] of the Senate, �, �, Dawkins, Whaley, �, Garlington, �, Campbell of Charleston &c., &c.  The dinner was magnificent.  Seldom have I sat down to see it or one anywhere.  His�was splendid & is throughout.  After dinner we met in the drawing room.  Mrs. Pickens enquired kindly after you & spoke in�of our library.  She was dressed in homespun & it was very pretty.  She & her stepdaughter played & sang for us.  She is very pleasant.  Miss Pickens is not pretty & Miss Cunningham is homely.  I could not help thinking how much prettier Fannie is than either of them.

	Tomorrow I drive out with your uncle Arthur & go home with him from church.  Tell your mother Mrs. Pickens asked of her�Col. Ball.

	In my speech today I spoke kindly of the convention & council.  As I left the House Col. Isaac Hayne pulled his hat off & gave me a most gracious salutation as if he was grateful for my remarks.

	Judge Magrath came to my room & took a glass of whiskey with me after my speech.  I think my speech was highly appreciated by all who heard it and yet I had very little time to prepare.

	I am glad you did not go to Glencoe.  I am pleased to hear Hext is hauling wood.  I hope he will make a great deal of money for himself.  He ought to have all he receives.

	It is very late & I must go to bed.  Mr. Boyce is a noble gentleman.  I am�of Judiciary the first or highest committee of the House.  I am glad I was not elected Speaker.  If elected I would face no opportunity of speaking.  �fact is on the floor.  Croft is very kind so are all the members.

	Goodnight my dear wife.  Give my love to all the household. After I return from your uncles I will write Fannie.  B.F. Perry

P.S. Governor Pickens will have spent $50,000 whilst Governor!  What think you of my being Governor.  Consider such expenditues.  It would utterly grieve me.  One of his Bills in Charleston was $8,000! At the Hotel!

My dear Liz

	I have stolen off from the State House whilst my friend Yeadon is speaking to write you a letter.  It is now half after three & we dine at four if the House adjourns.

	I received no letter from you or Fannie last evening which was a great disappointment as I saw no one from Greenville.  But I hope you are all well.

	Last night I was told that there was a Lady in the Parlor who wished to see me.  She said she had come to git me to take her son & his estate worth $50,000 & become his Guardian.  She told me by way of inducement that he was a very smart boy of fifteen.  I asked why she did not become his guardian herself.    She said it was as much as she could do to manage her own Estate & she wished me to take her sons.  I told her she could invest her sons estate which was all in money in Bank Stocks & it would not give her much trouble.  She replied she did not like the responsibility.  I thought if she did not like the responsibility for her own child, I did not know [how] she could expect me to like it.  With great kindness I declined the gift of her son & his fortune having four sons of my own to look after & knowing  you were unwilling to increase our family.  The Lady was Mrs. Col. James H. Irby of Laurens.  She wished also to consult about various matters concerning her husbands estate & came down for that purpose & returned this morning.  It has been about twenty five years since I last saw her.  She was then a young girl.  She is now an old woman! In appearance.  Her whole soul seems devoted to money.  She had a son wounded in Virginia five or six months since & has not heard of him since.  She supposes him dead!  But she spoke more calmly of his death than she did about her property!  How avarice dries up the affections of nature!

	I sent my speech twenty pages for publication in the Charleston Courier.

	We are doing very little in the Legislature.  I am chairman of the Judisiary commmittee, the position above all others which I desire & Col. Dawkins is on my committee.  It is a committee of Lawyers & we have a great deal of business to do.

	I recei[ve]d a letter from Col. Spartan D. Goodlett last night.  He says his regiment is near Weldon, N.C.& is doing well & all well clothed.

	The election of Governor comes off next week but it is very uncertain who will be elected.  I shall not desire the office.  If a Chancellor is elected I shall run for the office & with good prospects of success. There are two Judges to be elected but it is doubtful whether they will be elected this session.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to dinner.  I feel pretty well today.  It is raining.

	You will see a list of the boys selected for the military school in the Carolinian.

	Dr. Croft has published his speech in the Carolinian Guardian & Yeadon says it is an emasculated edition of mine.  Boyce says Croft listened to me & imbibed my ideas & reiterated them as his own.  

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter of Monday night & was glad to hear from you & about Hayne.  My views on the Convention & Council are the same as they always were, utterly opposed to them as you will see in my speech.  But I oppose the wild notions of some who desire the powers of the convention to alter the Constitution.  You know I never change & am always just & right�never lead away by passion or party.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tell Col. Hoke to get from Martin Edwards his receipt for his war tax & send me or give it to you in order to get back Edwards tax improperly paid.

My dear Liz

	I have stolen off from the House whilst speeches are being made on the Executive council  to write you a letter & get an early dinner.  We dine at four oclock.  The common dinner is two oclock.

	Col. Chesnut requested me yesterday to write out my speech for publication.  He said he was not here when I made it.  But he had heard it was the speech of the debate.  Yesterday evening I commenced writing & continued till eleven oclock in the night.  This morning I commenced again at five oclock &�breakfast.  I wrote twenty pages of foolscap & gave the manuscript to Yeadon to publish in the Courier.  In consequence of my continuing so long in my writing I do not feel so well today.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & Fannies last night & was glad to hear from you.  But you are foolish about my not being elected Speaker.  And do my dear wife never mention to me again about any office.  I would not have foregone the pleasure of making my speech for the Speakers chair.    But do not allude to the subject again.  

	Col. O�Hanlon paid me a visit yesterday evening & was very complimentary.  He enquired after all of you & Hext especially.  But he did not say anything about coming down.  Gilmore Simms spent Sunday evening with me & almost talked me to death.  He said his wife had just presented him with another child.  He has had fifteen children & has lost nine!  His beard is as white as snow & yet he is about my age!

	Your uncle Arthur comes into the House every day & spends some trime with me.  He complimented my speech the other day very highly.

	I can get rice here at six dollars a hundred.  But Mr. Boyce is going to write to Charleston for me.  He thinks he can get it cheaper.  He bought sugar here at�.

	I rece[ive]d Willies letter enclosed in Fannies last night & was glad to hear from him.  You wrote nothing about Hayne.  Is he still at General Thompsons.

	I saw�Crittenden today just from�.  He says there will be no fighting at�& John Cunningham is here &�as ever.  Pamela sent an old�to Yeadon  the other day which he presented to the House.

	I will soon go & look at a silver cup for you & finish my letter when I return.

	I have returned from looking at silver cups & will not think of giving such prices.  I was perfectly amazed�for a cup the price of which he told me was $15 formerly he now asked $70.00 & would take nothing less.    He said he was not disposed to sell.  That he would rather have the silver cup than the confederate money.  You may give up all idea of making a present of a silver cup.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The weather has been very cold & I have been able to wear my overcoat in comfort.  It is now turning warm.  

	Give my love to all the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just written & put into the Post offce for you a long letter.  Since doing so I have rece[ive]d Fannies letter of Sunday & saw Mr. Crittenden who goes up in the morning.

	Tell Fannie I will write when I have leisure.  I have just written�about Martin Edwards�& other matters.

	As to Governor it is all uncertain.  Gov. Manning is spoken of & Pickens friends are very anxious to elect Col. Orr so that he may take his place in the Senate.  My name is spoken of but I am not disposed to run.  If the election of Chancellor comes on I stand a good chance of being elected & will run for that office.

	My friends are very kind to me and I [am] pleased with my position.  

	We shall adjourn before Christmas,  I may not be able to write you for a day or two.    I want to see you all very much & had rather be at home than anywhere else.  

	I saw Capt. Hawthorn again tonight. He goes on to Virginia in the morning.  He is under arrest & has to have his trial for disobedience of orders when he gets back.

	Your uncle Arthur came in the House today & sat with me some time.

	In haste your affectionate husband.  If you see General Thompson say to him I will write him soon.  B.F. Perry

	Col. Ware is going up in the morning & also Dr. Croft.  I am almost induced to go myself.  I will probably go home tomorrow week if the legislature sit till Christmas.  There was a Resolution introduced this morning for the Legislature to adjourn on the 17th & meet again in January.  	But I hardly think such a Resolution will pass.  It will be very inconvenient for us to return here again after Christmas.

	We elect an appeal Judge Tuesday next.  Judge Withers will be elected.  There will be two vacancies to fill�one Law Judge & one Chancellor.  My friends will run me for Chancellor if the election comes on this session.  Col Keitt told Col. Lyde the other day that the Legislature ought to elect me or Hon. William Boyce Governor.  But I have no disposition to be Governor.  Trescot of Charleston came to me today & asked if I would run for Chancellor & I told him I would & I think I could be elected.  But there is a disposition to postpone the election till after the war as there is no business doing now in our courts.

	Nothing of importance today in the House.  General Garlington beat General DeSaussure for Adjutant General.

	This has been a very wet & cold day & I have turned my overcoat fur side out�which has caused the coat to be much admired.  Your taste & theirs seem to be much the same.

�.

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Fannie & several others but none from you.  Fannie says no letters came from me for two days.  I have written every day but have generally sent my letters by private conveyance.

	Fannie says you have bad weather & likely to continue so from present appearances.

	The streets are full of soldiers & a very rough set.  There has been less gaiety in Columbia this session than I have ever known.  The country is gloomy & in mourning for the friends lost in the army.		
	This dreadful war will ruin the country.  Already our national debt is over five hundred millions & South Carolinas share is over fifty millions.

	I will write Fannie a long letter Sunday.  I have heard nothing lately from Willie.

	The news came tonight that Burnside had been removed & that the yankee nation was in great commotion.

	I have seen nothing of your uncle Arthur for several days.  The weather is so bad no one can go out.

	My constituents are writing me about salt but I can do nothing.  The Governor has been ordered to distribute all he has on hand which is not much.

	I will now close my letter & hunt up Col. Ware.

	Give my love to all the children & write me how you are getting on.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	One of my chief pleasures when absent from you is writing to you & receiving letters from you.  How different from some of the members, who seldom write to their wives or receive letters from them.  How can they love their wives as I do you? Or do their wives love them?  I suppose the truth is that most people being married a long time forget all about love.  They think of each other just as they do of their houses or their horses or cattle or fields.  Most persons too regard their children in the same light.  And sometimes they actually think more of their property than they do of wife or children.  It seemed to me the other night that Mrs. Irby was a great deal more concerned about her money than she was about her son whose life or death was uncertain.  If Willie had been in that situation I should have been distressed to madness.

	I have just written a long letter to Fannie & told her of a visit Boyce & myself paid Mrs. LeConte.  I am very much pleased with Boyce.  He is one of the most sensible men & one of the best men & one of the most pleasant men I have ever known.  We have a great desal of amusement out of our friend Dr. Croft.  I have some good jokes on him.  Boyce has a great deal of humour & a nice sense of the ridiculous.

	We told Mrs. LeConte that she must be sure to come & hear Dr. Crofts speech on the Bill to stop distilling Tuesday at two oclock.  We told her about the Drs speech when he presented the�to me.  She was consumed with laughter.  Mrs. LeConte asked me if I knew Mitchell, that she had received a letter from a friend in Savannah requesting her to take him under charge.  I told her about your enquiring very innocently of him if he was related to the Mr. Mitchell who was once engaged to a cousin of yours.  The story amused Lula & Miss Graham very much.

	Mrs. LeConte said she did not know how gentlemen who were so fiendly as Yeadon & myself could be so tart to each other in debate.  She said she saw me shake my finger at him & seemed in a passion.  As soon as the debate was over she saw Yeadon come up to me & I put my hand on him & pulled him to me most affectionately.

	In regard to General Thompsons letter you may rest assured I shall be influenced by my own good sense & Judgement.  If the election of Chancellor comes on I expect to be a candidate & think my chance of election pretty good.  But I have no idea of running for Governor.  If the Legislature were to press it on me I might consent to serve.  But there is no probability of this and it is a position not to be desired at this time.

	Write to me about purchasing sugar & rice.  At present rice is higher in Charleston & perhaps I had as well purchase here.  Salt is so very high that I shall wait till later to purchase.  They are making a great deal on the coast now & it must be cheaper.

	Let me know all about the children & your household.  I think I shall come home next Saturday & return Monday.  But I will write you again.  I have heard nothing from Willie.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just taken dinner & as I expect to send letters by Col. Goodlett I wil write you again.

	I forgot to mention in my letter this morning I have made arrangements with Mr. Boyce to get as much sheeting & drills as I might wish of the Graniteville Factory at very low rates.  I think I will take several hundred yards.  The drills will do for pantaloons &�for the negroes & the sheeting for shirts &c.  The price I think is about 33 cents per yard.  This is cheaper than buying the spun yarn & having it woven.  You need not therefore trouble yourself about getting any more spun yarn.

	I saw Col. Connor just now.  He is still on crutches & mending slowly.  He says he heard from B�, the adjutant of Hamptons cavalry only four days since.  They were then at Culpepper C[ourt] House & no expectation of moving down to Fredericksburg.  I will write to Willie this evening.  Col. Connor enquired about him.  He says he has noticed that those who were loudest for secession have done less than those who opposed the movement.

	You do not say anything about how you are living.  Have you still a supply of beef? or do you live on pork?  Did the hog killed spoil or have you eaten the meat.  Have you got corn & fodder for the horses.  Have you heard anything from Glencoe since John went back?

	Sunday is a very lonesome day in Columbia & I shall not spend another Sunday here if I can get off.  I will try to return home next Saturday.  I think I can do so without any loss of important business.

	I will now go & hunt up Col. Goodlett.  I suppose he is at his son in laws Capt. Patrick.

	This is a beautiful fair & cold day.

	Your affectionate husband.  Give my love to the children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & you have forgotten my�request�.

	I bought a tierce of Rice�635 pounds for $50.80 cts & a barrel of good brown sugar 250 pounds for $137.50 cts.  It will be sent up by rail road.  Rice & sugar were both on the�.  I think this will do us for a long time.  You must take care of it & use it very sparingly.  We must use rye coffee.  It is impossible to purchase coffee in this or the Charleston market.  Everybody now is using barley & cotton seed for coffee.  Mr. Freeman bought up some cotton seed parched & ground.  Yeadon told me they used it several days at his mess & thought it genuine coffee.

	General Thompson came down this evening but went on to Florida.  I did not see him.  He sent me word that all of my boys were at his House.  I hope they are now at home.  If Hayne has no shoes do try [to] buy him a pair.  It will not do for him to go barefoot [in] this weather.  He will catch his death.  Ben can stay in rhe House.  But the two had better have shoes.  These are small expenses compared to the danger of their going barefoot.

	I will not purchase salt at the present prices.  We must do with what we have.  A sack is worth $200!  We can buy a half bushel in Greenville.  That will do us for a long time.  I have only a few hogs to kill & I shall purchase hams & bacon next summer.

	There was some discussion today in the House exempting persons who own tanning stores from going to the war, & I spoke warmly against it & defeated the proposition.  My friend Col. Dawkins advocated it.  The galleries were filled with ladies.  Mrs. LeConte sent me a� from the gallery by Yeadon which I ate before speaking.

	Dr. Croft & Ware & McCullough returned this evening.  I told Croft that I had made his whiskey Bill a special order for tomorrow at one oclock & had invited the ladies to come & hear him speak!  I told him he must speak himself & I think he will endeavour to do his best.  Mrs. LeConte was very amused at my description of Croft the other night & disclosed that she would not miss hearing his speech on my account.

	Dr. Reynolds of the college came up to me today & said he hoped he would have the grattification of living under my administration of the State for the next�and that he would rather see me governor than any one else!  But this compliment will set you to writing again about honors &c.

	When my speech is published you must send it.  I have no fears of its being either �to me� or �to one�.  Yeadon was sorely mortified at my argument.  But he is still determined he says to make me either governor or chancellor.

	I am very tired of this place & want to be at home.  If I can leave here I will go home Saturday.  There is no place like home although my wife�& worries so much.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the State House & taken dinner, after one of the hardest days work of the Session.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee I had reported a Bill on the subject of the Stay Law  & collection of debts.  The Bill was assailed on all sides & hundreds of amendments offered by various members.  I had to fight the Bill through. & I suppoise I was on my feet one hundred times or more & made as many short speeches.  We were at the Bill from eleven in the morning till half after four in the evening.  Finally I succeeded in sending the Bill to the Senate.
