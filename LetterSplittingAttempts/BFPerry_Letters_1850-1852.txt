Anderson C,H,

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Tugaloo & will write you a few lines this evening as you requested.  The court has just adjourned & very little business done or to be done.  Judge Withers has gone to his room to sleep, the lawyers here are all gone home & I am left alone in my glory.  A young lady came into the sitting room to practice on the Piano & I have retired to write you.  By the y a Miss Smith enquired of me about you as an acquaintance.  She is going to school here & I believe from old Pendleton.  There is a house full of girls here, & most of them look like ought to be courted & married instead of going to school.  At least they are large enough to think of a beaux.  Judge Withers has been amusing himself & them by all sorts of �sexist talk.

	I had a pleasant day to come here, but the weather has been very bad ever since. I found here Walker, Campbell & Long from Greenville.  They have all returned & a gentleman came to me in court this morning to carry some books to Greenville.  I told him Long was going over & would carry them.  He replied, yes, Mr. Crayton�s brother in law, I know him. I made no reply & thought it might someday be true.  

	My face is still swollen & not entirely�, but I have slept gloriously for two nights past, going to bed at eight oclock, & waking at seven.  

	The papers bring us no news this morning that Mr. Calhouns health is better.  Very great interest is manifested here in his recovery.  They had a political meeting on Tuesday & appointed four delegates to meet at Greenville during court & elect delegates to the Nashville convention.  Col. Tom [Thomas Jones] Pickens is an anti Bank candidate for the Senate in opposition to Dr. [Alexander] Evins.

	Mr. Harrison tells me the Cotton was sent off last Monday, & you will probably receive a check for the amount before I return home.  I am sorry to see the last foreign news is unfavourable for cotton.    The corn will sell well.  Mr. Simpson spoke of going up to the sale, & invited me to go home with him.  

	As I passed by my farm last Tuesday morning, someone had thrown down the fence & pulled down the Barn to the ground.  Tell Reuben he must [page torn] to the fence or the stacks will get [page torn] & destroy the wheat.  Let Charles fill up the stable.  Jim might with the old plank of the fence build a new pig pen like the old one and some corn sheds against the fence.  

	You must attend to your garden & plant your seeds.  Major Seaborn�s agricultural paper comes out this week with my article on the profits of the farm.

	Write me a long letter to Pickens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter and the papers by Mr. Elford & for which I thank you kindly.  I was very anxious to hear from home.  It seems to me that I have been a long tome from home.  The weather has been bad, business dull, accommodations horrible, & labour considerable.

	The property sold well at the sale & amounted to $639.00!  The cotton will certainly bring $900.00.  This will make the crop raised by ten hands worth $1500.  I have collected a great deal of money for the Estate, but none for myself.  I may, however, receive some yet.

	My horse became quite lame again, & I have swapped her to Wellborn Perry for a blooded horse, which drives finely in a Buggy.  I gave him ten dollars to boot, & I am very much pleased with my trade.    He is a fine horse & well disposed.

	I passed by Mrs. Dubose�s & she was at church.  I did not see her, nor Lees family.  I did not go by my Brothers, but I saw him and most of his sons at the sale.  They are all well. 

	I will send your letters & packages.  I heard a scandalous report on Mrs. Dudaes oldest son & Miss Lee, which has excited a good deal of neighborhood talk, and which may be all scandal & noting more.

	The Judge is working very hard to get off from Pickens, & it is likely I may reach home Wednesday night.  The court sat tonight till after nine oclock.

	The convention excites a good deal of talk, & my name is spoken of amongst those from whom a selection is to be made.

	It is now late in the night and I must bid you good night.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter yesterday in court, whilst in the midst of Dr. Andersons case, and I was truly glad to hear you were all well.

	I have no paper & must therefore beg you to excuse me for not answering your letter more fully.  I have no time to write.  We commenced Dr. Andersons case Monday & are not half through it yet.  The result is very doubtful.  The Judge is as ill-natured as ever & behaves rudely to every one.  My only comfort is that he worry�s himself more than anyone else.

	The governor is as vain say very cunning in selecting Col. Elmore, but he will not be successful in his cunning.  Col. Elmore will continue in the Senate.

	I am sorry Edward misbehaved when asked about the flowers. Col. Irby would give me $800 for Jim but it is not enough.  Negroes will increase in value before next fall if cotton keeps up.

	I hope Reuben & Jim are going on well with their respective work.

	I may be at home Saturday.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

P.S. Don�t forget to look for the Bonnett for Harriott Perry as I know she will be expecting it.

Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have hardly time to write you a line.  Last night I sat up till twelve oclock writing.  We are in the midst of three or four slander cases & full of business & possible business.

	I recd your letter by Mr. Elford & was pleased to have so good a report from home.  In regard to our Paper I have to inform you that it is doing well.  Mr. Elford will return with some forty or fifty new subscribers & a good many of them have paid.  All seemed pleased with the Southern Patriot.  Mrs. Dubac was delighted.  I did not see her.  But I stopped at my mothers.  They were all well.

	Mr. Sharp informs me that his wife is pretty well & expects Miss Ramsay up in two or three weeks.  She will return again to Charleston after a short visit.

	I have written a long Editorial for next week giving an account of my tour to Tugaloo &c.  It is altogether uncertain how long I will be detained here, perhaps all the week & perhaps not longer than Wednesday.  Everything sold well at the Farm.  But I had a bad time last Sunday in coming to this place.

	I am truly glad to hear that the draft has arrived from Alabama.  It will come in good time.

	I think Mr. Elford is in better sprits than when I posted with him.  But I doubt whether you have hope so strongly developed as to supply & sustain the drooping spirits of anyone else.

	At Pendleton I met a young kinsman Robert Harris just from California with his pockets full of gold.  He gave me an interesting account of that country, & will be at Greenville next week.

	The mud is knee deep all over Pickens valley.  The Hill has been cut down.  And they talk of dividing the district & moving the Court House.

	I hope the children are all well & going to school.   Fosters wife & Harriett enquired affectionately after you & the children.  The first seemed surprised that my family had not increased since you were there.

	My reply to Col. Hayne has pleased a goods many persons about here.  I am glad your mother is pleased with it.

	In haste your affectionate husband. Remembrance to the children, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening & found the roads worse than I ever saw them.  It is well that you did not come with me in the buggy as we once spoke of doing.  Had you started with me, we should have been fastened in some mud hole.  It is enough to kill horses & break carriages all to pieces to pass over such roads.  Thirty miles above Columbia we had to turn off the road & than a neighborhood path.

	Mr. Elford & myself traveled down alone except a short time in company with Henderson of Laurens.  We had a very pleasant trip & I found Elford a fine travelling companion.  Believe there is nothing that attaches gentlemen to each other more than travelling together.  We stopped on the roadside & ate our dinners in the woods & had provisions enough to last all the way.  

	Saturday night we stopped at Faulks.  He complained bitterly of his daughters extravagance at Greenville.  He said she had spent thirty five dollars in two months.  We told him that was very moderate indeed.  That young ladies spent there that much at school in dressing.  He opened his his Dutch eyes in amazement, & said that Robert had�to him it was not at all , that he would be very far from encouraging a young lady in any extravagance.  

       Tell Willie I am sitting in the same room we had last winter, and the first thought which I had on entering the room was about him.  I looked at the bed & thought of his being in it.  I looked at the window where he used to stand & look at the poor turkies cooped up for slaughter, and thought of him.  I wish he was with me again.  It is pleasant to have some member of the family with me to talk to & love, either wife or child.

	You may say to Willie that the turkey pen has been connected with a handsome little garden with a summer house in it & the walls most fantastically laid off & looking as if they were�with marble.  A great metamorphis indeed for a turkey pen.

       As soon as I went into the barroom on arriving at the Hotel a tall fellow, rather good looking, who was standing there as keeper enquired of me how Mr. McBees family were.  Said his name was Alexander & that & that Mrs. McBee was his cousin.  He looked a good deal like Vardry McBee of�.
	
	Tell Wilie that our friend Jim enquired after him very kindly.  I am now writing to you before breakfast, & have seen very few persons & can tell you very little news.  May not have time to write you again this morning.  I hope you will give me a diary on Wednesday of yourself & household since I left home.  Col.  Herndon, Col. Thompson, A.W. Hanger, Mr. Dean, Sullivan, Reed, Henderson are here.  Mr. Bobo was thrown from his horse on his way here & very seriously injured, so much so that Col. Herndon told me he did not think he would live.  His injury was internal.  He was throwing up blood.  It will be a great loss to Spartanburgh for Bobo & Henry both to be taken off.  They were for many years partners in law.

	The weather is delightfully cool & pleasant.  I hope you have had rain in Greenville.  Let me hear how the farm comes on, the children, the Servants, the horses, house & your plastering, & whitewashing and though last, far, very far from home, being least in my love and memory, how comes on your ladyship.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am truly sorry I was disappointed in writing to you by the last mail.
	The Judges & lawyers were all invited to ride on the Greenville Rail Road, & supposed we should return in time to get your letter & answer it.  But we scarcely got back in time to go to the meeting of the Board of Trustees.  And the Board of Trustees sat until twelve oclock last night regulating the affairs of the college.

	I am now writing you before breakfast in order to send my letter by Mr. Elford who says he will reach home Saturday night.  I will write you again by the mail if I have time.

	My cases are all disposed of in the Court of Appeals except Dr. Anderson & the Gilreaths.  We have been three days trying Gilreaths case.  Yesterday we heard of the death of Judge Richardson & the court adjourned whilst I was speaking.  This morning we have to conclude the argument & consequently have very little time to write you.  

	The Bar also have a meeting this morning on the subject of Judge Richardsons death & I may have to say a few words in praise of the deceased.

	I have not had time yet to purchase my clothes & shall not purchase many.  I see no fine clothing to suit me.  I have heard nothing of the Bonnet yet.  I saw yesterday a consignment at the Rail Road to B. Perry.  But the agent said it was for Perry & Matthews merchants of Edgefield.  I am assured it was the bonnet.  The package had been sent off before I went to the depot.

	I recd your long letter last night after my return from the college & read it after twelve oclock.  I was glad to hear you were all well & getting on well.  I am truly sorry to hear of the awful accident on Mr. Arthurs Rail Road contract.  Mr. Croft is very cunning & penurious & would resort to any scheme to cheat anyone & I hope Maj. Blake [will] not accept his proposal.

	I saw Dr. Thomas here yesterday.  He has not heard of Mrs. Thomas[�] fall & injury,  He said he would average one dollar per day notwithstanding the rains on the rail riad.

	I had a long political talk with Mr. Robert Barnwell yesterday on the rail road.  He is a most agreeable & pleasant gentleman.  The ride was a pleasant one.  We [were] caught in a very hard rain, rode sixteen miles, the road is finished twenty miles.

	I have not had time to look at carriages yet.  After today I shall be at leisure till Saturday, when Dr. Andersons case is taken up before Chancellor Dargan.  Chancellor Dargan & Dunkin enquired after you.  So did Judge Withers & Frost.  In my agreement I have been paying Judge Withers for his�sarcasm in Gilreaths case.  

	When I shall return is doubtful.  I shall not go to Charleston.  Tell Frank I am glad to hear he is still head.   Give my love to the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I am invited to dine with Col. W.C. Preston today at 4 oclock & unless I write you now I shall; not be able to do so by this mail.  I always like to wait till the mail comes in before I write so that I may answer your letter.  In this way I was disappointed in writing to you by the last mail.

	Yesterday evening  at five oclock, a committee of the Board of Trustees consisting of DeSaussure, Petigru, Adams, Witherspoon & myself met at Mr. DeSaussure�s & spent a very pleasant evening in drinking wine, cracking nuts, eating fruits and conversing.  Today the same committee dine with the President of the College.

	This morning at nine oclock, the Bad had a meeting on the death of Judge Richardson & Chancellor Caldwell.  Mr. Pettigru was called to the chair.  Col. Dunkins offered the resolutions about Judge Richardson, & I made a speech which you will see in the Columbia papers.  Col. McCord & DeSaussure prepared speeches & Resolutions for Chancellor Caldwell.  Mr. Petigru presented both sets of Resolutions to the court of Errors & Judge Evans & Chancellor Johnstone replied.

	I shall lose my Will case for Gilreath.  Mr. Petigru heard a portion of my argument & said he thought I had made an impression on the court.  But the Judges refused to hear argument on the other side.  They are all prejudiced against breaking Miles. 

	I shall tomorrow argue Dr. Andersons case before Chancellor Dargan, hear opinions on Monday & probably start home Tuesday morning.  

	I saw General Martin yesterday.  He brought up with him the bonnet but has not yet sent it to me.  He said they were all well in town.

	I have bought a�sack coat at $7.00, pantaloons $5.00, vest 75 cts, straw hat $2.00, boots $7.00, six pair of socks $1.50, gloves $1.00�two silk handkerchiefs $2.25, two shirts $4.25.  This is very moderate in the way of clothes.  But I think is a good supply till fall, where I will purchase a suit of cloth.  

	I have bought some books as usual.  This you know is my weak point.  I have firmness to withstand all other temptations�all but the temptation of books.  But my purchases do not amount to any great deal.  I thought I would save in the way of clothes enough.   To purchase the books--�first & Louis 14th, The Queens of Spain, Women in France, The House of Orleans, Georgian Era, Cosmos, Utopia�The Mexican War by a company of Mexican officers.  I have not been able to purchase the apple for Anne.  Some of my books will be for Anna & Willie. 

	In regard to the election of Judges I have very little information.  It is altogether doubtful who will be candidates.  A great many lawyers have spoken of, but all are uncertain.  
  
	In regard to the college everything is going on very well.  I will write you a longer letter on Sunday & Monday.

	I must now conclude by requesting you to remember me to the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening & was very glad to hear from you & that you were getting through with your house cleaning.  You think I ought to be very kind to you on my return from the labour you have bestowed on the house in my absence.  I am always kind & ever affectionate.  You misconstrue my words & actions when you think otherwise.  And as to giving you money you know that is always done when I have it to give. 

	I shall start home Tuesday morning & reach you Thursday evening, & I assure you I shall be most happy to be with you & the children once more.  I see someone has spoken of me for Chancellor in the Charleston Mercury.  Col. Herndon wishes me to run for law Judge.  But I am not inclined to run for either.  I agree with Mr. Barnwell that it is a wretched life spent in taverns & from home. 

	I spent a very pleasant evening at Col. Prestons.  There was a large dinner party & several young ladies.  I had the pleasure of carrying one to the table & sitting by her all the evening without finding out who she was.  After dinner Mrs. Preston introduced me to another one whose name I did not understand.  We walked in the garden & she enquired about you & your mother & said you had paid her a visit when Miss McCall.  I think she said you staid with her.  Mrs. Preston seemed very kind & enquired why I did not bring you with me.  She is coming to Greenville this summer. 

	I have bought you a pretty present�a trunk for bonnet & handkerchiefs two dollars & twenty five cents.  I have bought some candy for the children�a few oranges & have closed my purchases.

	Yesterday I looked at carriages�some very fine ones�one like Mr. Coxs	 for $400�but I think a finer finished one $650 a magnificent affair�others at various prices.  The carriage maker said he would swap carriages with me.

	I saw Markley�s son yesterday.  He seems a clever boy & was glad to meet me.  Tell John I saw his son [who] enquired after him.  He seems a good fellow.

	I had an amusing conversation with Col. Goodwyn today about Col McCord & his wife.  She is a tyrant over her husband & pays him handsomely for his mistreatment of his former wife.  She will not let any of his children come to see him & has made the Col.  Settle all of his property on her & her children.

	I was not able to attend the speaking in college & today I felt disinclined to go to church.  I shall hear the opinions in my cases tomorrow.  But the most of them will be against me.

	Tell the children I wish to see them all very much.

	Yours truly & affectionately.  Mr. Sullivan returns with me to Laurens.  It is something to Have company.  B.F. Perry

	I have but a scrap of paper to write on nor have I anything to write of interest.  I shall certainly be at home Sunday evening & perhaps tomorrow evening.  We shall not reach Dr. Andersons case at all & if we get through with � & Simpson today I can leave tomorrow.  The court will adjourn Saturday evening.  Chancellor Johnston[e] did not send for Mrs. Johnston[e] as he spoke of doing.

	Col. Irby does not wish to purchase any more negroes.  He has said nothing about paying his note or interest.  Capt. Cunningham & family are all at the North.  Burt expects to return shortly.  You will see in the Laurens Paper a sharp controversy between General Thompson & the Editor. 

	I hope you & your household are doing well.  Your Pianno paid for must sound sweeter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	We arrived here this morning to breakfast.  There was a great crowd last night Fulks last night.  Judge O�Neall, Col. Brockman, Col. Ware & many others were there.  I had a long political talk with Col. Brockman this morning, and he is all right in politics.

	I am sorry to inform you that Mr. [John Izard] Middleton has been beaten for Speaker by Simmons [James Simons] of Charleston.  The Bank men all voted against him, in order to have a Bank Speaker, so that they might control the appointment of all the committees.  To my great surprise Col. Jones voted with the Bank men�no doubt to curry favor with the majority.  It ought to be known in Greenville that a man who was elected as anti Bank man, came down to Columbia & the first vote he gives is for a Bank Speaker to give the Bank the entire control of all the committees & a powerful bearing in strengthening the Bank.

	Willie & Frank behaved quite well.  They are both now sitting at my table reading books purchased for them by Mr. Duncan.  They both behaved well coming down.  They went with me to the State House & remained in the gallery till near four oclock.  General martin saw them, & said his whole family was here.  They are greatly admired by all who notice them.  Col. Herndon remarked that I was increasing my company.  He said he should soon have one large enough to bring.  Col Dawkins came down on the cars this morning with us & says Mrs. Dawkins will be here tomorrow.  

	We had a pleasant trip down, & enjoyed your good dinner very much. On the roadside.  Col. Hampton came to my seat in the House of Representatives this morning & had with me a long political talk.  He thinks with me & I find the whole state is turning that way.  My old friends here have met me very cordially.  This morning I stepped into a hot store to purchase ho & the owner subscribed for The Southern Patriot.  Burt makes a great many apologies for not publishing my piece, & says he ordered it to be done.  He proposed taking Willie & Frank to see the town.  Judge O�Neall is with me in politics.

	It is said Judge Cheves is to be made Governor.  But I do not believe he will accept.  Col. Hampton told me that Col. Pickens had declined.  Hampton is spoken of for Governor.  But he told me that he would disgrace himself if elected.  He said Col. Hammond was a corrupt & bad man & ought not to be elected to the Senate & that he had letters in his possession that ought to damn him in public estimation.

	Petigru says that Memminger thinks the chancery will come to him by his course on the Southern question.  I am unable to say who will be judge & chancellor.  The elections will occupy the greater part of the Session.

	I have not yet made any purchase of clothing except a pair of boots & hat nor have I been able to � your mothers present for Fanny & little Susan.  But I will do so in due time.

	Since I have been writing I have received a long letter from General Thompson in Washington.  But strange to say he does not mention his marriage.  It was however advertised in one of the Charleston papers.  He writes encouragingly about our paper & I have just recd a letter from someone who neglected to sign his name but I think it is from Dr. F. Croft.  He says my Paper is favorably spoken of in Charleston & if I were to send an agent there would get a great many subscribers.  He directs me to send my paper to him in Aiken.  Henry L. Pinckney has written me a long letter about his office.  Dr. Gantt has also written me a letter electioneering for a half dozen candidates.

	I have not yet seen Mr. McBee.  Remember me kindly to your mother, Susan & Anne & in this message Willie & Frank have just requested to unite with me.  They also join with me in love to you, Anna & Fanny.  I hope you are getting on well with you household. & shall anxiously expect to hear from you by the next mail.  I wish very much you & the little girls were with me.  Frank is not altogether so pleasant a companion as Willie.  I really think Will is the most remarkable Boy for intelligence & observation that I ever saw.  

	I have written you a miserable scrawl & will try & do better the next time.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Willie brought me your letter from the Bar room last night about eight oclock & said he is a letter from mother.  Frank immediately professed that I should read it aloud, so that he & Will might hear what you had written.  I did so & they listened with great interest.  They were both reading books which Mr. Duncan had purchased for them.  Frank does not make such rapid progress in his, as Willie has done.  I had to purchase another for Will, & told Frank I would do the same for him, when he had read his through.

	I am not writing to you by candle light in my night gown & cap & day is breaking.  Willie & Frank are still asleep.  I make my own fire every morning.  Jim furnishes wood over night.  There is no trouble in kindling a fire with lightwood.

	Yesterday I saw Col. O�Hanlon & he gave me an invitation to visit him in the country & says he will send for me & a few others some day during the Session.  He is as warm & as firm as ever.  I met Col. Hayne in the streets yesterday.  He seemed very kind & sociable & enquired after you & your mother, Susan 7 Anne.  Mr. [W.B.] Carli[s]le the editor of the Columbia Telegraph came to me yesterday & invited me to an entertainment to be given by the Press of Columbia to all the persons in any way connected with the Press in South Carolina.  Whilst sitting in Col. Fairs room after my return from the State House, Col. Manning came in & invited us to take a glass of brandy in his room.  There were a good many persons, & Major Cant[e]y remarked that I grew younger �someone replied that I brought my sons down with me to let the people know that I was a married man.  Dr. Goodwin replied that they were worth showing.

	I must, however, tell you that I had just sizzed myself off, in the way of clothes at a�shop & was dressed very genteelly�so much so that Burt enquired where I had got those fine clothes.  In purchasing them, Frank enquired if I had money enough to pay for them all &of his own accord offered his quarter of a dollar to help pay if I was short of funds.  The little fellow pulled it out in the store & made the tender.  My clothes have cost me $58.00.  Frank cost oversack coat, pants, �hat, boots & cravat.

	Col. [Christopher William] Dudley, senator from the Peedee country, came to my seat in the House of Representatives yesterday and said he wanted to put me in nomination for Chancellor that he differed with me in politics, but nevertheless preferred me to Wardlaw or DeSaussure.   Memminger is not a candidate.  I told him it was out of the question to suppose the legislature would elect me.  He thought differently, & said that although they differed with me in politics, they had great respect for me &c &c.  He left me & said he intended to feel about & see what the prospect was.

	The Governors Message was read yesterday.  It goes for secession.  As soon as it was read Col Memminger & said we were about commencing a revolution & a change of our Government & it was proper to appeal to God for assistance.  He proposed [a] day of fasting &c.  Col. Jno. Preston & J[acob] P[inckney] Reed made more speeches in favor of the resolution.  It occurred to me that South Carolina would need assistance from Heaven in a contest with the Federal government and I thought it was well enough for some of them to have prayers said for them.  Judge Cheves was present & looks very well.  The Georgia elections are all going in favor of the union & this fact is not relished at all in South Carolina.
	I do not know that I mentioned to you in my last letter that Mr. Fulk indulged in a great deal of abuse of Dr. Simmons & said he had behaved badly, & that no one would send to him again.  I am glad Pickerel is so correct in his notions.  Cox is a union man, but is disposed to be prudent.    So are thousands in our state.  Judge Cheves speech is the most extravagant disunion argument I ever read.  The Legislature has ordered thousands of copies to be printed for distribution.  I met him today.  He did not recognize me at first.  When I mentioned my name, he said I had grown much stouter.  I said I had not had the pleasure of seeing him for several years.  He replied that it has been twelve years.  I saw you the last time, at Greenville, on my way to the Virginia Springs.    He then enquired after you & said you were the relation of his dear friend General Hayne who would any day have died for him.

	Col. Dudley had written a long communication announcing my name for the Chancery Bench.  He showed it to me this morning & I objected to its publication.  I know full well that I could not be elected, & did not wish to have the public attention directed to me since�associated with depot.

	The Board of Trustees met last night & elected Col. Preston President of the College.  He looks pretty well & he is much improved in health.  I voted for [Fitzhugh] McMaster as Librarian & not Rivers.  McMaster was elected.  Rivers got only 3 votes.  Judge Butler is�  He asked my motive for bringing the boys.  I said I brought Willie for my companion & Frank for Willies.  He said it was a great improvement to them and mentioned a son of General McQueen�s who was a companion for his father always having travelled with him.  I saw Mr. Petigru last night.  I bought the spoons for $5.00�very nice ones.

	The Georgia elections have cast a damper on the Legislature.  I told Col. O�Hanlon how you had rece[ive]d his letter.  We�next Landry with him.    My love to all.  Tell your mother Mr. Ford enquired after her & claims kin.  He is a candidate for assessor.   B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter the night Mr. Rhett delivered his oration on Mr. Calhoun informing me that Mr. McLure of Chester had sent a list of subscribers to The Patriot.  This gratified me very much & I mentioned it to Mr. Petigru who is here.  McLure is an old union man.  Col. Grisham is here & said he had quit politics, but as soon as he saw my Prospectus he determined to take two copies.

	Dr. Lieber sent for me last evening to take tea with him.  He is a strong union man & so is Professor Williams.  They both will take The Patriot.  I had a most interesting conversation with Dr. Lieber & his Lady for three hours on politics.  When I left them the Dr said it was a treat to meet one like myself & unburden his heart to him.  He said he should call at my room frequently during the Session.  But that he disliked to walk the streets of Columbia so cold were the citizens to him.  He enquired how I got on in the Legislature.  I told him I found none of that coldness towards myself. That I was cordial towards all & they seemed, at least, to reciprocate my cordiality.

	Yesterday I introduced my resolutions on the subject of a Southern Congress, & the editors of the Carolinian & Telegraph come to me immediately for copies so you will see them in the papers.  I have no doubt, as I told Dudley, that the State will yet have to adopt my course after all the above heaped on me.  Some firery Resolutions have been offered for secession &c. [William Aiken] Owens of Barnwell wishes a convention.  Middleton wishes to postpone the election of Senator  �B. Perry to keep the members of Congress from going on to Washington.

	There was quite an excitement yesterday, in the House, in consequence of hearing that some United States troops had been landed in Charleston.  Speech after speech was made full of patriotism & war.

	Rhetts oration was a good one.  He paid handsome compliments in it, to Lowndes, Cheves, Hayne, Legare, Jackson &c.  The cry of fire was raised toward the latter part of it, & I left with Willie.  There was a great crowd, & several packets picked�one pick packet was apprehended in Charleston as soon as he arrived.  Col. Maybin told me he now had one in his house & had his eyes on him.  He is from Baltimore.

	Mr. Petigru came to see me & left his card.  Yesterday morning he sat with me an hour in the House & we had a great deal of talk.  I told him you had kept his letter to show your acquaintances in the hope of doing good.  

	I am glad that you have seen Mr. Arthur & that he is no politician.  I hope you [are] informed well as to passing events.  I am sorry however that you think so badly of your church & its members.  The addition of Mrs. Choice surprised me.  I hope she will be more Christian & less vindictive.    But my dear wife I do not think that the professors of Christianity are a whit better than other people in charity, kindness, liberality all the social virtues.

	Willie & Frank are doing well.  Dr. Croft came here last night & expressed great surprise at seeing them.  Luther McBee came here the other day & is quite well.  Alexander has not yet reached here.  Mr. Kilgore is here.    So is Mr. Campbell.  Col. Irby has paid Elias Earle who came yesterday.  I have heard nothing from Dr. Anderson.  

	Since writing the above I have seen Col. Townes & recd your letter of Saturday morning.  I was truly glad to hear from you & that your family were all well not�the increase.  Townes told me you sent him my letter to read.  You must be careful about showing my letters as they are written for your eye alone.  I never saw such a gathering & coming in of wives as I saw this evening.  Monday is commencement & the Greenville Rail Road brought them down by dozens from Newberry & Fairfield.  I felt rather envious as I saw them approach their husbands.

	I have just been to a supper of the Press.  Judge Porter, Mr. Woodward Crowly of Virginia & many others were present�also Col. Townes, Campbell, Reed &c.  I have left them & their war speeches to conclude my letter to you.  In the morning I go to spend the day with O�Hanlon & will carry the boys with me.  I have to start at 6 oclock.

	It is now twelve oclock in the night.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I went down to Col. O�Hanlons with Mr. Duncan & carried with us Willie & Frank on Sunday last.  
We had a pleasant excursion in spite of the rain.  The Col. Sent his carriage, two or three horses, four or five mules & negroes to meet us at the Rail Road depot & escort us to his house about four miles distant.  The carriage broke down & we all mounted horses & mules & road on.  Willie & Frank were delighted.  We met a most hearty & cordial welcome, a good breakfast, a fine dinner, plenty of wine & brandy & whiskey punch.  The Col. showed us letters from Gen. Jackson &c & we talked on the days of nullification.  	

       Today I went to the college commencement with Willie & Frank who sat on the platform whilst the boys were speaking.  I sat by Rob[ert] Barnwell our Senator in Congress, & he told me he had news on my political pieces.  He is opposed to separate state action, but is a disunionist & seemed to regret I was not one also.  The speeches of young Barnwell son of the Preacher, & Richardson grandson of Judge Richardson were very fine�some of the rest not very good.  Rions, I thought a poor one, although he took first honor.  There was quite a display of Ladies although the day was so bad.  They do not seem to care for the weather, so they can see & be seen.  Col. Preston made a war speech to the graduates.
       
       There is no doubt a fixed & settled purpose to dissolve the union as soon as practicable.  This is agreed upon by all the politicians.    But some of them are afraid of being whipped into submission.  Col. Preston is sailing with the current & Dr. Lieber says is [the] very way to�his present position.
       
       Dr, Lieber came to my room this evening & we spent an hour in delightful conversation.  He said he should call again.  Professor Williams met me today in the college, & said he had heard of my visit to Dr. Lieber, and that he should call on me as it was pleasant to meet with sympathy.  I never saw a man or woman more encouraged than Dr. Lieber and his Lady were by my conversation.  He said again tonight I do not know how it is these men are all so civil to you.  I told him I made them so.  I was civil to them & cordial in my manners.  
       
       Mr. William Easl[e]y has offered to take Frank back to Greenville in his Buggy.  I may send him.  But Willie is not disposed to part with him.  Col. O�Hanlon wished very much to keep them both for several days.  Mr. McBee is going up with Easl[e]y.  Willie & Frank have been twice to Alex Taylors & taken dinner with them.
       
       Tomorrow the election for Judge comes on.  I think Wardlaw & Whitner will be elected.  Burt will be elected Secretary of State.  Young will be elected Solicitor.  Reed opposes him.  Jones cannot get a start, & I believe he has found it out, most effectually.  I am sure he would not get the votes.  Duncan has found out that he will not do, to depend on, in a political struggle, & so said to me.
       
       The great debate commences tomorrow on the Southern question.  It will continue for a week or ten days.  My impression is that a convention will be called & what then I know not.  They are beginning to despair of Georgia & a Southern congress doing anything.  The Augusta Chronicle Sentinel is now sent to me in Columbia.  The State of Georgia has gone for the Union by thirty thousand votes.
       
       The weather is now very warm & wet.  When it clears off it will probably turn cold�if so have the hogs killed.
Tuesday evening
  
       General Whitner beat Col. Dawkins twenty votes & is Judge.  Wardlaw beat DeSaussure & Haynsworth a great ways & is Chancellor.  Burt is ahead for Secretary of State.
       
       Middleton made a disunion speech today & so did Keith of Orangeburg.
       
       Col. Hampton invited me to dine with him tomorrow at five oclock.
       
       I see a great many persons here from the upper country.  Choice, Rowland, Jno. Jones, the three Townes, Col. McNeely.
       
       Tell Susan Hoke I have sent to Charleston for her music.
       
       I hope to hear from you tonight.  I wish you were here.  I would very willingly exchange Willie & Frank for you.  The next session this must be the case.  There are a great many wives here with their husbands.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Frank is not inclined to go with Mr. Easl[e]y & therefore I shall not send him.  He is however very much in my way but a great favorite with all the members.  Col. Dudl[e]y told me tonight that it was the expression of all that Frank was a remarkable boy in looks & appearance.  I replied he was very different from Will & explained to the Col. the difference.  Tom Poe a little boy has just brought a message from his uncle that I would let Frank go home with him in the morning to the Peedee country.  Tom has given Frank a Harmonica which plays beautifully.  

	Someone gave me today a little china doll left with him by Mr. Barnwell.  I saw Mrs. Taylor & Martin in the gallery today but did not speak to them.  Will came to my seat in the House & pointed them out to me in the gallery.  I saw them looking at Will & myself in the House.  But I had at that hour to go to the College to meet the Faculty.  Mr. Barnwell, [John Izard] Middleton & DeSaussure & myself were a committee to meet Col. Preston, Dr. Lieber, Thornwell & the other Professors to arrange a matter of government for the College.  Will went with me.

	I am sure you will be greatly distressed when I inform you that Col. Ben Perry has beaten Burt by two votes for Secretary of State.  I voted for Burt & wished him elected in spite of all his prejudices against my politics.  He is really in friendship attached to me.

	I could not go to Coil. Hampton�s dinner party yesterday in consequence of the meeting of the Board of Trustees in the College last evening.  Middleton & myself send word by Speaker Simmons [James Simons] as to our excuse.  


We had quite an interesting meeting of the Board of Trustees last night & transacted important business.

	Col. Ben Perry has just given a toast of champaigne wine & I have partaken of it.  This in consequence of his election.  Frank�s great ambition seems to be to eat two dinners.  He leaves the State House at ? past one, eats dinner & returns�then at four he eats with me.  Willie stays till I eat.

	Col. Jno. Preston made a speech today whilst I was in College.  I told him I was sorry not to have heard it.  Mr. Harrison of Anderson told me today that he expected the Legislature would go with me after all.  Several persons have �to my Paper.  I hope you & family are all well.  In the course of an hour I shall hear from you.  But before that time I have to close & mail my letter.

	I shall probably speak on the Southern question next week.  There seems to be a disposition to hear me.  I shall try & make a good speech.  Yesterday I was introduced to Col. Tomlinson of Georgia & a member of their state convention.  He said he was glad to meet a union man & I must send him my paper.

	I have bought a great many Books at 75 cts per volume which would cost 2.50 per volume.  They are English books & printed in England.

	I have bought a beautiful likeness of Terry�  I saw Miss Martha Calhoun in the gallery today but did [not] speak to her.  There is a great display of Ladies in the gallery.  

	Kiss Fanny & Anna for me & tell them to kiss you for me.  Yours truly a lovingly, B.F. Perry

Maj. Dawkins has become very sick on the defeat of the Col.

My dear Liz

	I was very much gratified last night on receiving your letter & the one from Anna to Willie.  Tell Anna she writes a beautiful letter & I said to Willie she could beat him.  I had no idea she could write so well.  We are blessed my dear wife in our children.  They are very far superior in looks & intellect to most children I meet.  In behaviour I believe they are as good.  At the college commencement I noticed two little boys about Franks size on the platform in front of all the Professors & Trustees behaving very bad.  I thought to myself that if Frank was behaving in that way I should be terrible provoked & mortified.  Willie is a little man every inch of him, & I have never seen his equal.  Fanny is the prettiest & most intellectual child I ever saw.  Tell Anna I shall take great pleasure in hearing her play on the Pianno when I return home.  Willie is now reading by my side & Frank cutting with his knife.  I shall go to church after breakfast & carry Willie & Frank.  Col. Herndon asked me the other morning if I ever whipped my children & said he had occasionally to whip his.

	On Friday I heard the first sermon ever preached in the State House by Whiteford Smith.  It was a noble discourse eloquently delivered full of patriotism & liberty and good sense.  He urged wisdom & prudence in our deliberations & cautioned in strong terms against rashness & precipitation.  

	Yesterday Mr. Robert Barnwell sat with me in the House for an hour or two & we exchanged very fully our views & opinions.  He is very much opposed to separate state action & goes for a Southern Congress.  But he thinks disunion will ultimately come when the South is united.  I am confident of the reverse.

	Col. Pickens sat with me some time yesterday also & his views are moderate.  I think he will be elected Governor.  I saw a letter yesterday from Col. Hammond to Senator Gist of Union which denounced in strong terms separate action as folly & disaster.  He said the state would be crushed immediately by secession.  The opinion is that Rhett will beat Hammond for the�Senate.

	I had another visit from Dr., Lieber last night.  I wanted him to go into the sitting room & sit with me there amongst all the members.  But he said no.  I wish to talk with you & not the other members.  So we went to my room & had a long chat, a good union talk& I am sure Mrs. Lieber would have been glad to have heard it.  I gave the Dr. when he left me Poinsetts recent letter in the Mercury to take home & read.  These letters of Hamilton & Poinsett annoy the disunionists very much.  

	The weather is now cold & I hope you will tomorrow, Monday, have those hogs killed.  They have been wasting my corn.  I am glad to hear that the stock are all doing well & some of them increasing.  Hochee no doubt would be very glad as Anna says for Willie to come home and give him a little variety by a ride to the farm & other places.  

	The Debate is still going on in the House on Federal Relations.  But the small guns have been fired�the big ones are kept in reserve for the latter part of the debate.  I shall probably speak about Wednesday.  John Read went off like a bag of wind yesterday & was for war & secession. [William Aiken]
 Owens followed in the same track.  When [William Ferguson] Hutson of Beaufort or Colleton made a pretty war speech, Jones tried to get the floor & finally succeeded for Monday.  My namesake Josiah B. Perry made a pretty good speech & was for secession.  What Jones will be for I know not.

	The committee of Ways and Means appropriated $125,000 yesterday morning to build a navy to fight the U. States.  Memminger & myself voted against it & were the only members of the committee who did.  The military committee are about appropriating $200,000 more to arm the state and fortify the coast.  I told them that this was a matter which the U., States ought to do!  Russel[l] Middleton was for the navy & was steamers.  I told him the U. States could send a half dozen ships as well [as] one to Charleston.  He is on our committee & seems a worthy & intelligent gentleman.

	I will make Willie write after our return from church.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz  

	The business of the session is now pressing so hard that I shall not have time to write you as often & as long as I have done.

	The debate on the Federal question is still going on.  Col. Memminger spoke all day today, & I tried to get the floor to reply but it was given to Col. [Elias Chumpton] Leitner.  He was generally expected too, & so understood that I should speak next.  I will probably speak tomorrow or the next day.  Col. Memminger alluded to me in his speech, & said �when action comes, I shall then see my friend from Greenville in our midst as I now see him.�  I have prepared myself for a pretty good effort.

	[James Washington] Harrison of Anderson came to me today & said he thought when the Legislature met I was alone but now he believed a majority of the House were with me.  I told him I began to feel as now always should in a majority [be] quite magnanimous.  It is true a majority of the House are with me in action, but very hot in words.  Such is Col. Memmingers position.  Col. [James] Chesnut made a very able speech yesterday, & took my ground of a Southern congress.  Col. [Erwin Patton] Jones made quite a failure�about fifteen minutes�said nothing but a few set phrases & I really felt for him but his vanity kept him from feeling for himself.  

	The Legislature have agreed in the House to adjourn on Friday week 20th Inst.  So you must send Breechees to Fulks Friday evening.  I will meet him there Saturday morning 21st.  He will leave home Thursday morning & stay at Laurens C.H.  I begin to feel anxious to get home�would be very willing to make my speech & go tomorrow.  The gallery was crowded with Ladies today & Mr�.Mauldin pointed out one, whom he said favored you very much.  I did not think so nor do I know who she is.

	I hope to receive a letter from you in one hour.  The children are around me.  They stay with me altogether.  They come into the State House & stand by my side.  Some times the doorkeeper sends them up in the gallery.  But Frank whenever he sees him go off will slip in a boost of his dexterity.     

	They have had one ballot for Solicitor�Reed 63�Young 51�[Benjamin Yancey] Martin of Abbeville 45.  I think Young will be elected.  The Governor�s election will take place Thursday.  I think Pickens will be elected.

	I have just got the spoons beautifully engraved.  I have also bought a good many cheap, rare & valuable Books�also a revolver pistol�a bottle of cologne�a hair brush & three beautiful plaster of paris figurines�a cheap pen & pencil for you- a ball & a whip & knife for Frank�a ball & several books for Willie.

	I went to church on Sunday & heard some beautiful music.  Miss Sally Elmore sings beautifully & I heard her voice above all the rest.  She is a second Jinny Lind.  My friend Dr. Thompson of Union thinks so.  He is the medical student I met in Philadelphia.

	I hope you & household are all well.  I assure you I am very anxious to see you & Fanny & Anna.  Tell Anna she must write again.  I hope too your mother & family are well & that Mr. McBee arrived safely at home.  I wrote a long letter to Mr. Carson the other day.  I would write as I promised to Mr. Croft but suppose he had gone below.

	I must now conclude & believe me dear Liz your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I recd a letter from Elford saying he had recd two hundred dollars from General Thompson.  He was in Baltimore & going on to New York.  I have also recd a most encouraging letter from General Thompson.  He says Elford is in fine spirits.  But strange again the General does not mention his marriage.  B.F.P.

	I have but a few minutes to write you.  The Legislature have just adjourned & meet again at six oclock & I am not waiting for dinner.  The children are playing ball in the room.  They have been with me all day in the State House, except when they came here for dinner.

	Yesterday I got the floor after Col. Leitner had spoken.  He spoke very badly, & the House was in  a[t]tentive.  As soon as it was perceived that I had the floor I saw persons begin to sit themselves.  There was some anxiety or curiosity to hear me.  It was known that I differed with the other members in regard to my notions about the Union.  Earlier as profound silence prevailed over the House.  I had spoken but a very short time before I saw the faces of the members turn pale.  They seemed amazed at my boldness and yet felt deeply the force of my argument.  The account or sketch of my speech in the Carolinian is very meagre & imperfect leaving out one half & changing one half of the other half.  I am now writing it out, & will publish it in extensor.  I spoke one hour but did not say half that I intended to say.  It is my purpose to write it out fully.

	Professor Williams of the South Carolina College came to me & said this morning that he gave me his heart as cordially as he did his hand�that he was in exstacy with my speech although he did not hear it�his son did.  I saw Col. O�Hanlon sitting with a face beaming with joy but I have not seen him since.  Mr. Middleton said to me this morning that I had amazed the House with my ultraism & boldness.  I thought so too.  The newspapers have all spoken respectfully of my speech but regret that any one should hold my sentiments.  Col. McGowen [McGowan] replied to me yesterday evening but did not make a very able effort.  Col. Dargan brother of the Chancellor replied this morning & Col. Lyles of Fairfield.  They were all very respectful.  No one is yet elected Governor or Lieutenant Governor.  You will see the vote in the papers tomorrow morning.  Reed has beaten Young for solicitor, & it is a most cruel thing.  

       I see Choice is here with Mrs. Walker on their way to Greenville.  They leave in the morning & so do the Townes &�.  I saw Mr. Hutson the other day.  We are both on the same committee.  He informed me that he was a relation f my wife�s & spoke kindly to the children.  I told the children that he was a blood relation of theirs in his presence.
       
       We adjourn next Friday week.  �that is tomorrow week 20th Inst.  You must start Reuben with the carriage Thursday morning so that he will reach Fulks Friday night.  I shall go up Saturday morning & get there by eight oclock.  This will enable me to reach home Sunday evening.
       
       Nothing of interest in the Legislature except the debate.  The Legislature will not do much.  I must now stop.  I shall hear from you tonight.  I was very much pleased with your long letter.  When I read it Willie & Frank had gone to bed.  Frank proposed I should read it aloud.  The little fellow listened some time but before I got through with the letter he had gone to sleep.  
       
       I hope to hear from you again tonight.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
   
P.S. Tell Anna & Fanny that I do not forget them although not mentioned in the body of my letter.

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night and was truly glad to hear you were all well.  It made me anxious to see you, & be at home once more�. The scolding you gave me about spending money.  You must bear with my breach�.  My books, my dear wife, & my little children are my only sources of enjoyment & happiness in this life.  It is impossible for me to exist without a fresh supply of books every year.

	I was sorry to hear of Scotts sickness.  I have had apprehensions for months past that he was not a sound horse.  If we loose him, Byron & Selim will have to be our carriage horses for some time.  Corn is now so dear that the expense of keeping a horse is very great and even the death of Scott would perhaps be a saving to us.  So you see I have a good desal of philosophy & am disposed to make the best of my misfortunes�even the scoldings of my dear wife I take patiently & put them to a good account.

	Friday morning I visited with fifteen or twenty Senators & members of the Legislature the Lunatic Asylum & passed through all the buildings, saw all of the inmates & walked over the grounds & garden & green house, all of which are interesting.  I saw old Mrs. Alston.  She looked comfortable & happy.  In one room a sitting room or parlor I saw fifteen or twenty women, all neatly dressed & well behaved.  No one would have supposed that they were crazy.  In the male department a man stepped up to me & claimed my acquaintance.  His name was Lindsay from Spartanburgh.  He told me about a case I had at Laurens in which he was a witness, which was true.

	Yesterday there were a good many speeches made on Federal relations.  But the debate is beginning to loose its interest.  The Senate decided last night by a vote of 34 to 8 to call a convention of the state.  I do not think however the House will agree to it.  But it would perhaps be just as well to let them go ahead & have their own way till they find themselves checkmated.

	The Governor has just rece[ive]d a letter from the President in reply to the one he wrote about the troops in Charleston.  The letter places the Governor in a very ridiculous point of view.  I suppose it will hardly be published.  The President says to him that he is commander in chief of the army & navy of the U, States & has a right to dispose of the troops as he pleases & denies the right of the governor to ask for his reasons in his movements of the army.

	I have looked at the desks for your mother & they are from $4 to $12.00.  There is a letter writing case in the Library your mother may have.  It was given me by Mr. Headen & is of no use to me.  But I suppose it would not suit her.  I cannot get Susan Hokes music.  

	You must start Reuben for me Thursday morning.  He was stay at Simmons at Laurens & reach Fulks Friday night.  Saturday morning I will meet him at 8 oclock & we can get home in two days if the roads are not very bad.  So you may look for us Sunday night about nine oclock.  Mr. Duncan will go up in the stage, & reach home or Greenville C.H. Saturday 12 oclock a day and a half in advance of me.  I wish I could go with him.  You have no idea how anxious I am to get home to my wife, my children, my books & my office.  It is pleasant to leave home occasionally, but it is far more agreeable to my feelings to return home.  There is no place like home.  I shall eat your Christmas dinner promised to me & the children with great satisfaction but I hope the first meal will be supper & we will dine in the night to make the journey.  But the roads may be so bad that we may be disappointed.

	The children are well except a slight cold.  They have been a source of pleasure to me & a good deal of trouble.  When together they behave worse than separate.  As you say they are very much inclined to tease & plague each other.  By himself Willie is remarkable manly & a companion for me.    But with Frank he annoys me a good deal.  They both stick to me as close of leaches�Willie all the time.  Frank is more disposed to go off.  I hope the trip will improve both of them--learn them behaviour & manners.  But Frank is pretty hard to manage at the table.

.	Tell Anna & Fanny that the plaster figures are for them & one for you�three in number.

       I must now conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	The House has been in session all day today & I have now just eaten my dinner at six oclock.  We meet again at seven oclock tonight, so I have but a few minutes to write.  The children too are both leaning on my table and bothering me.  They came home & got their dinners & are now eating raisins & almonds. They live well.

	The subject of a convention & Southern Congress has been before the House all day, & we have voted a hundred times almost on the various propositions & made as many speeches.  Still the final vote is not yet taken & is very doubtful.  I begin to think that we shall do nothing, neither call a Southern Congress nor a convention.  But the matter will be decided tonight.  Forty two votes are enough to defeat a convention and we had forty eight today.  But some may bolt.  Several gentlemen here told me that I am the only honest man amongst them all, who vote against a convention.  The House was a good deal excited today.  And several severe threats were made to Col. Memminger.

	I gave my speech to the Carolinian to publish today.  He says he will do so next week.  The speech is very long 45 pages & will fill one whole side of the Carolinian.

    	I am in the Columbia Telegraph this morning, a compliment to me.  He notices two articles in North Carolina & Georgia abusing me, & says that no one who knows me will doubt my purity of motive. 

         Mrs. Jones & her children came down here last night & I saw Tom Jones this morning.  Frank seemed delighted to see him & invited him to dine with him at Maybins Hotel, which Tom did.    So Frank is playing the gentleman quite young inviting his associates to dine with him at a Hotel.  I was engaged in the House.
       
       The Governor was inaugurated yesterday & quite a crowd as usual.  The speech you will see in the Carolinian.  

	I hope to hear from you tonight & next Thursday night.  Col. Corn of Walterborough & old Mr. Verdier have both taken a great fancy to Frank.  Verdier is a Frenchman worth $300,000 & no children.  He says he must have Frank & I told him to take him.  But Frank protests very strongly against any such arrangement.

	I must now conclude.  I will write you again once more before I leave Columbia.  Kiss Anna & Fanny for me, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am almost tired to death with legislation.  For several days past we have met at ten and adjourned at 12 oclock in the night�sitting fourteen hours, with only a recess of one hour.  I am almost worn out.  Today I made a speech on a Bill concerned with Federal relations.  The question had been discussed a long time.  I tried once or twice to get the floor but did not succeed.  Some ten or fifteen had made speeches.  The question was taken and only three or four voted as I did in the negative.  I then got up and begged to have my vote recorded against the Bill & made a speech of some length which was listened to by the House with intense interest.  I felt what I said & I made the House feel.  When the ayes & noes were taken I had a majority of fifteen.  The vote stood sixty to forty five.  My four votes increased wonderfully.  It felt as I felt it take[s] a good speech.  The result showed it.  In the course of my words I replied to Campbell, who is a yanky, the son in law of Bennet.  He felt it & winced.  I told the House that I was a native of South Carolina.  General Bonham, Col. Boozer, Col. Dargan, Col. Thompson and many others came up & congratulated me on my effort & success.  The Bill was levelled at the yankys. 

	I rece[ive]d an invitation to dine with Dr, Lieber tomorrow with the boys Frank & Willie.  I shall do so.  The Dr. wrote me he wished to have a fraternizing conversation with me before I left.  

	Miss Calhoun & her mother sent me a message about going up with them on Saturday.  They have a carriage but not room enough to carry all the family & Miss Calhoun was going up in the stage.  I sent work I would give her a seat in my carriage.  She has returned for answer that she accepts.  Soi you need hardly look for us Sunday night.  I feel assured we shall not now be able to make the journey in two days from Fulks.  I afterwards saw Miss Martha Calhoun in the gallery.  She saw me & bowed to me but I did not speak to her as I was�an opportunity to speak.

	I have just seen Elford & he & Duncan will leave in the morning.  I will write you again by Duncan tonight.  Yours truly. B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your long letter & will write you a line in reply by Wednesday.

	I am truly sorry to hear such bad news about the horses.  If I had known of the lameness of Byorn I would have gone up in the Stage with Mr. Duncan.  But it is too late now to change your arrangements.  I am sure you have done the best as you always do.  I have as you know great confidence in your judgement & arrangements.

	I went to the Rail Road the other morning but could hear nothing of your bundle nor have I yet heard anything about it.  But I will ascertain & find out in the morning.  It is now after ten oclock &
The Legislature in session & will be till midnight.
	I shall try to get home Sunday night but think it almost impossible if Miss Calhoun takes a seat with us & we have to travel with her mother.

	I am glad you have sent something to eat.  The tin box I left at Fulks & told Reuben to car[r]y it home.  I suppose he forgot it.

	You are mistaken in supposing that I am not treated well by the members.  We are all cordial.  I shall be glad to meet your mother & family at dinner on my return home.  You did not say anything about the writing desk for your mother.  

	I am afraid I shall not be able to get the seeds or hops.  

	I am distressed to hear that the smallpox is in the Country.  The children ought all to be vaccinated

	I shall be truly glad to be at home again.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just come up from dinner & have one hour till eight oclock to myself.  At eight some Virginia young ladies are to pay Mr. Yeadon a visit & I shall have to be in the drawing room.

	Mr. Yeadon, General Combs of Kentucky & myself are all the white persons about the establishment.  I wrote a long account of my journey down here for the Patriot & will not repeat it to you.  President Fillmore is expected here the last of this week�will stay with Mr. Yeadon.  His chamber is filled up in most magnificent style.  

	I saw your uncle Arthur & Col. Isaac Hayne this morning.  They both asked me if I was able to get a room & I replied I was staying with Mr. Yeadon.  They asked after you & Mrs. McCall.  I saw Captain Cunningham who likewise enquired after you.  

	I have been so constantly engaged today from breakfast till dinner in the convention that I have but little to write except what I have already written for the Patriot & I dislike to write the same thing over again.

	I met Miss Brenner on the�& she is very much improved in her appearance.  She is to sing in Charleston this week.  Last night we started to church with the Virginia young ladies who are to take tea here this evening.  They are pretty and quite interesting.  Mr. Yeadon staid with their grandfather Mr. Winston when in Richmond in 1846.  He is now here a delegate.

	The Proceedings of the convention I have given in my letter to the Patriot.  Mr. Duncan is staying with Mr. Ford who married Miss Gerard.  Mr. Butler at the Charleston Hotel�the McBees & Irvine are there also.

	Mr. Yeadon is living in great style.  His family have gone to the country.  I am very pleasantly situated�quite private amidst all the crowds & bustle of the city.

	Tell Anna Mr. Gantt enquired how that very interesting little daughter of mine was.  I will now suspend my letter till after tea & perhaps all morning.

	Our company have gone & I am left all alone in my glory.  Yeadon has gone over to the Courier office & & General Combs has gone to Mr. Conners.  It is now half past eleven oclock & I will go to bed.  The evening passed off very pleasantly.  Mrs. Bryant came to receive the ladies.  She is a relation of Mr. Yeadons.

	I hope you & the children are all well & I also hope to receive a letter from you tomorrow evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am detained here by a very important case between Mr. Bobo & Col. Maybin of Columbia.  It will probably be tried tomorrow & if so I shall be at home Wednesday.

	I hope you will be able to keep up till my return, but I am afraid not.  You know my anxiety about the matter.  It is true I could be of no service, but it would be something to you to see and have a husband�s sympathy and love in your suffering.  My return will be pleasant anyway�pleasant to find you still about, & still more to find you with a sweet babe by your side.

	God bless you & preserve you & help you in your trying situation.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Mr. Spencer is just starting & I have time only to write you a line.

	Willie & myself are quite well, though I was very sick the night I reached here.  The pills & the fatigue of coming have exhausted me completely.

	I hope to be at home Sunday.  Nothing done yet in court.  I have written a long article for the Tri-Weekly on Saturday.  Willie is now asleep.  I have eaten breakfast.  

	I hope you & the dear little Baby are well & a great many persons here enquired after him.  Never was an infant more famous at his birth in the ordinary circles of life.

	I must stop & will write you again by Saturdays mail.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Mr. Elford & now he will write a short one to you.  It is late in the night & I hope you & little Hext the Union Boy are both sound asleep & as well as could be expected,  I go from here direct to Pickens on Wednesday.  There is not much business in court.

	Judge Johnston informs me that he left his wife in your situation, & that her health is bad.  Mr. Perrin I�said his wife was also in the same condition.  Col. McGowan who was married last January was afraid for his lady to ride on the Rail Road in consequence of her situation.  He told me of a sad accident on the Rail Road a few days since�Col. McCords daughter married to Mr�.started on the rail Road to Augusta & was confined in the cars & brought forth a fine infant being & likely to do well.  I suppose the little fellow was travelling at the rate of twenty miles an hour when he came into the world.  My client Walker met with a terrible accident too.  He was coming too court with his wife, & she was confined on the road!  Truly these are beautiful times with you women folks.

	I hope your mother is keeping her promise & taking good care of you.  How�the baby will be when I see it.  I shall be delighted to see the little fellow.

	God bless you & the children & preserve you.  If anyone comes to Pickens write me a line or send a newspaper.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have just thought of another piece of news.  Last court I saw here a fine, handsome your music teacher from New York.  Dr. Sloan a young man here fell in love with her & she with him.  Some months since she left Mr. Bensons & returned home.  Since that time she has given birth to a bouncing boy, & thrown all of her friends here with great consternation.  She was greatly esteemed & very pious.  Dr. Sloan has gone off & nobody knows where.  The young woman Miss Horton has exhibited a piece of writing in which they acknowledge themselves husband & wife.  This was pretty cunning & is by our laws a legal marriage!

	But enough of this slander.  The girls have left here�very few now at Bensons.  I suppose they are afraid of being served as Miss Horton was.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot which will please & amuse you.

	Dr. Anderson has directed me to call on Sullivan & get $300 balance of my fee & Sullivan told me this evening that he would pay it.

	I was employed in a new case today which may detain me here some time.  The principal business I had here has been postponed by the other side

	The election here has gone in favor of cooperation, & will throughout the district.    My impression is that it will throughout the state.  

	Write to me about the elections by tomorrows mail.  I hope you & the children are all well & doing well.  Hext, I am sure is a good boy, & I wish to see him very much�this you may tell him.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I had not time to write you this evening before the mail closed.  I wrote a few lines to the Patriot which I knew you would see the night it arrived.

	My cold is better, but I felt Bad coming down in the stage.  [several words obscured by blotting]  Jones came down with me.  We stopped at the head of the rail Road ten miles above Newberry C.H.  The next morning we had a car full to Columbia.  Judge Whitner & his daughter were in company�also Judge O�Neal[l] & Chancellor Johns[t]on.  Col. Ware has brought his little son down with him.

	Tell Willie & Frank that a great many persons have enquired about them.  Dr. Powe says that his son often speaks of them.  Dr. Goodwyn enquired after them.  

	I saw Arthur Simpkins this evening.  He came to our room to electioneer.  He is a candidate for Commissioner in Equity.  He brought me a letter from Richard Harrison of Florida.  I shall vote for him.  There is a good deal of electioneering.

	Everyone seems kind & cordial to me& a great many have taken an occasion to compliment me for my course and the hottest secessionists in the Legislature have done so.

	I saw John Cunningham a few moments today but did not enquire about his mother & sister.  There is to be a meeting of the Cooperation party here tomorrow.  Judge Cheves is here.  Judge Butler is not here yet.  His niece is to be married next Thursday or perhaps Tuesday.

	    I had a pleasant interview with Governor Means this morning & he seemed in a good humour.  He told me that old Mrs. Hughes was in town & immediately afterwards I recd a letter from Dr. Roach informing me that old Mrs. Hughes wished me to intercede &c.

	I feel great anxiety about you & the children.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  The colds & fever are so common that I am in constant apprehension.  Goldsmith lost a negro woman with cold, as I came by his house & he is down with fever.

	Col. Brockman & Duncan are in my room & talking all the time & I am somewhat bothered.

	Let me hear all about your household affairs and especially the children.

	I have seen very few persons today.  In my next letter I will give you more news.  Give my love to the children & accept the same for yourself.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening, enclosing one from Anna and another from Willie, and for all of which I am very much obliged to you.  I hope to receive another tomorrow evening.

	The reference to William & Anna�s going to the writing school I am willing you should do as you please about and Frank too may go if you think he will learn anything.

	I have two little packages for Susan, sent by General Martin.  I will send them up by young Markley who goes up tomorrow.

	I met Col. Isaac Hayne this morning as I was going down the steps & he coming up.  We spoke and shook hands & passed on with the ordinary enquiries.  He did not ask anything about his aunt & cousins as heretofore.  General martin seemed kind & friendly. 

	We have just had a visit from Arthur Simkins & he was electioneering for commissioner.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this evening & gave me an invitation to tea tomorrow evening before I go to attend the board of trustees.  He wrote me a letter this morning inviting me to tea this evening.  The Dr. is delighted at the result of the election.

	Duncan, Brockman & myself are getting on very well in one room, except that the Colonel snores a little too much. 
	I am glad to hear that you are all well, & that little Hext has experienced no evil from his magnesium.

	Tell the children all that I will bring them some pretty presents & write them a letter shortly.

	In regard to my purchases I have bought a pair of boots & a hat�life of Randolph�Lives of the Queens of France & Scotland, Lady Wortley &c &c.

	I will now close my letter as the clock is striking ten & perhaps I may write you again tomorrow.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I thank you for your letter yesterday evening written on Monday last.

	I sent you yesterday by Mr. Powell two bundles for Susan & one for yourself with a letter from someone.  When I wrote you last I thought Powell was Markley.

	I took tea with Dr. Lieber last night & went from there to attend the Board of Trustees.  Nothing was done in the Board.  Dr. Manly of Alabama is spoken of as President�several spoken of as candidates for Professorship.

	The Governor gave me a blank pardon to fill up for Magistrate Hitt.  I will send it up this evening & present Taylor of escorting him to Columbia.

	I saw Mr. Buist yesterday�also Col. Dawkins & Col. Herndon who all enquired after you & the children.  Herndon tells me he has five children & is alarmed at the idea of any more.

	Yesterday I was employed in court in a case of the Spartanburgh Manufacturing Company against Col. Maybin.

	Tell Willie & Frank that a great many persons have enquired after them.  I did not know before that they were so important persons in the Legislature.  Col. John Preston enquired with seeming interest about them.  He tells me that Mrs. Calhoun & Martha are at his house, & that there is no hope of Miss Martha living long.  She is in the last stage of consumption I believe.

	I am met by everybody with great cordiality a7 have had a good deal of amusement in talking about secession.  

	I have purchased the Pictorial Bible for you�.  The subscription price was $25.00.  I gave $15.00.  It contains thousands of plates & illuminated letters.

	My cold is something better but going out last night made it worse.  We are getting on well in our room.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  I feel a deep interest in hearing from you every mail.

	Tell Willie & Anna to write me again & Frank too if he goes to the writing school.

	In haste yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mr. John Izard Middleton enquired kindly after you & children.  He said Mrs. Middleton arrived safely & were all well.

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter of Wednesday & will write you a few lines, as you have been so good a wife as to write me every mail.  I hope your kindness & love will never grow less.

	I have just come up from the supper table when I saw Judge Butler, who enquired kindly after you all & especially Willie & Frank.  Really these two young gentlemen are quite famous.

	I have had a great deal of pleasant chat with the secessionists, & they all seem to look upon me most favorably.  My article about Col. Memminger & looking to the Lord & being dismissed has been published in the Carolinian & excited a good deal of amusement at the expense of Memminger.

	Tomorrow Mr. Middleton & myself are to dine with the students in college at one oclock.  We dine there to see how the students live.  They complain of the fare dreadfully.  

	I have been placed on the committee to examine students applying for admission to the Bar next Tuesday.

	I have introduced my bill to give the election of Electors to the people & made it the special order of the day for Tuesday next.  I will make a short speech for it.

	Col. Brockman recd. A letter from Mr. Carter of Charleston very highly complimentary to myself in particular & the Greenville people in general.  

	The secessionists are holding a meeting tonight & the cooperationists had a meeting last night.

	Old Mr. Reese who wrote the letter you mentioned has been a great while a strong friend of mine, and I am truly sorry he is going to leave the state.

	I am glad you & the children & servants are all getting better of your colds.  

	My old friend Fre� has been to see me, & was delighted at my presenting his memorial & having it printed.

	We are all getting on very well.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

P.S. I do not care to rent my Farm at all & especially to the persons applying.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter last night informing me of your purchases & that you might have to draw on me.  I will honor my draft you may make.  Let me know how much money you may wish & I will enclose it to you.  I have lent Col. Brockman two hundred dollars.

	Mr. Latta has been to see me & invited me to dine with him next Sunday in company with Judge Evans.  Mr. Latta enquired after you & your mother.  I saw Judge Cheves yesterday.  He was very kind in his enquiries about your mother, sister & yourself & children.  The Judge looks pretty well but like a hard drinker.

	I met Barnwell Rhett yesterday.  He was very cordial in his meeting & paid me some compliments.  Judge Butler has not yet arrived.  Sam Townes will go up this evening & I may send some package by him.  We are quite friendly & I voted for him.

	You must write me what you wish me to purchase for you & I will do so.  Tell Anna to write what she wishes me to purchase for her.  Also Willie & Frank must write me in the same way.  I will write to them as soon as I have leisure.  But I assure you I have no time to do anything.  Yesterday I was in court pretty much all day.  But you will see an account of the courts & Legislature in my letter to the Patriot.  

	I am glad your carpeting has all arrived & will be pleased to see it on my return to see the House looking neat, wife pretty & children hearty & cheerful.

	I must now quit & go to breakfast.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	I recd your letter this evening & was very much pleased with it.  As you were so good as to write to me & your mother did not, and as I wrote to her last night I will [write] you this evening.

	Willie & Robert Duncan have gone to the theatre.  Mr. Duncan and Col. Brockman are out & so are the other two boys.  Mr. Center is unwell & in his room so I am all alone.  Just as I had finished this sentence Dr. Blanding came in to see me & sat till after ten oclock.  Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams were here just before.  I have no time to write or do anything.

	Tell your mother that I have written an account of the first days proceedings for the Patriot & will not write them over again.

	We Are all getting on very well, & the members seem very cordial to me.  My old friend Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger is here & at this house and we have a great deal shot.  The old gentleman is failing rapidly.  Edmund Rhett sits by me in the convention & we have had a great deal of talk.  He enquired after your mother & grandmother & aunts.

	I have just received a long letter from Mr. [William Alexander] Rosborough of Chester very complimentary.  I have also recd a dogrel poem in print�Hamilton, Petigru, Memminger, Thompson, myself, Butler, Orr &c &c.

	I saw Augustus Hoke here yesterday & I suppose he has gone home today.

	I will not close my letter which is more for your mother than you.  I will bring you & Fanny something pretty.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your letter to Willie.  He seemed a little affected by it.  He has gone again to the Theatre tonight with Mr. Duncan.  He & Robert were very much pleased last night.  I should have gone too, but my feet are so much hurt by the pavements. That I cannot wear my boots this evening.  I am now all alone which is a sore thing.

	The Convention got on slowly.  Today the committee of twenty one was appointed, & I am on it with all the Judges, chancellors, Senators & ex Governors of the Convention.  We meet in the morning to decide what is to be done.  How long the convention will sit, & what they will do no one can tell.

	I shall not leave here before the last of next week�certainly not before Thursday.  I am glad you are getting on so well with your household, and that you feel so much relieved from the annoyances given you by Minerva.

	Willie is behaving well & says he will write you tomorrow & that he will write to Anna also.  I have spent my time most pleasantly & agreeably.  Judge Hayne boards at Maybins & we have had a great deal of chat.  I have laughed a great deal at the secessionists & cooperationists.  Col. Stork told me this evening that he heard a bet made last night between two members of the Convention & a dozen bottles of wine that I would be elected to the United States Senate in less than ten years.  

	Someone sent me through the mail last night a dogrel poem in four cantos, abusing in very scurrilous terms, Hamilton, Petigru, Preston, Thompson, Memminger, Butler, Isaac Hayne, Orr, Pres[s]ly &c &c myself & the Southern Patriot.  It has excited some interest & curiosity.

	General Martin said jesting that he would [like] Willie to go & see his wife & Mrs. Taylor, but I have heard nothing more of it.  I think your kin are not very affectionate.  I was APPOINTED BY Judge Wardlaw one of the committee to examine the certificates of members.  This brought me in contact with them.  Most of them spoke to me & shook hands with me as they came up to the clerks desk, but I could not catch the eye of Perroneau Finley & we did not speak.  I have not met him since.

	I had a visit yesterday from Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams & Mr. Thornwell this morning.  Mr. � came to pay his respects this evening and gave me�Address�about the Mountain Men.  I recd a fine letter last night from [William Alexander] Roseborough [Rosborough].

	I must now conclude with my love to you & the children.  I am delighted to hear that Hext can stand alone.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry 

P.S. Col. William A. Williams arrived here last night & invited Irby, Col. Watts, and myself to dine with him tomorrow.  I hope he will also pay our fees.  He came down to challenge Scurry, but Irby, Watts & myself have decided against it, & he expresses himself to be governed by our opinion.  

	Judge Huger says that Mrs. Poinsett & Mrs. Pringle are not reconciled & that Mrs. Poinsett refuses to live with her.  The Judge says Mrs. Pringle is �a woman of temper.�  Mrs. Poinsett has gone to Stateburgh to spend the summer.

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your letter and am only able to write a few lines in reply.  I have just finished a long letter to Elford about the convention & other matters & it is now late in the night.  General Thompson has just left our room.  Mr. Center is in another room.

	The Convention has done nothing yet. Tomorrow we will have a general discussion.  When we met this morning it was the most crowded house I ever saw.  There was great anxiety to hear the Report of the Committee of Twenty one.  After Judge Cheves had read the report, I presented my report  embodying the sentiments of myself, and it was well recei[ve]d.  The Convention then adjourned.   I saw General Thompson & Miss Jones at the State House and walked home with them.  Miss Jones seemed disposed to be pleasant & talk.  After dinner I walked out with Willie & my colleagues to threw Asylum &c.  Taylor & Willie his son came to see us this morning and left their cards.  My old friends� Dr. Landrum & Co. O�Hanlon also came. 

	I am glad your household are all well.  I shall be glad to see you and the children and especially Hext stepping about.

	Col. Brockman has just informed me that Miss Harriet Walker is in the house opposite & married to a young man by the name Flemings and well married.

	I must now conclude my letter as I have nothing more to say.  Willie has gone to bed & the others are talking in the room.  I have not had time to see about my likeness.  Judge O�Neall will be here on Saturday next.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter to Willie & he seemed pleased with it, and your good advice brought tears to his eyes.  Sine the return of the Duncans he is more of a companion for me & I value more his company.  I have bought for him the Scottish Chiefs & Traders of Warsaw which he is now reading & sitting at my table.  I am writing just after supper.

	Tell Anna I like very much her deportment in church in taking another seat, & reprising the officious attentions of a little boy.  There is nothing that I admire more in a little girl than retiring diffidence & especially towards the other sex. 

	Willie listens with great attention to anything said or written about Hockey.

	I am sorry to hear Mary is sick & hope she is better.  You must be in a bad condition for servants whilst cleaning the House, & you had better postpone it till the family are all well.

	It would be wrong to let Frank beat himself, or expose himself in any way.

	I had just had my likeness taken.  It is a noble looking face & head�much larger than any previous daguerreotype of myself.  He is the best I ever saw.  Mine is in its rough cast & will be sent to Lexington in that condition.  This man Zealy says that Lexington requested him not to paint or touch the likeness.  Judge O�Nealls was sent back because it had been colored & was too small.  His charge was $10.00 including a frame.  He said anyone who had been in his room today recognized my likeness instantly.  I was fortunate in getting this man to daguerreotype me.  

	Mr. Rhett has resigned his seat in the Senate.  It is not known who the Governor will appoint as his successor.  General Jones of Edgefield told me today that no appointment would be made for ten or fifteen days.  Pickens, Governor Richardson & Governor Seabrook are applicants through their friends, but Governor Means does not fancy any of them.      

	I was told that my Report was to be published with the proceedings of the convention & will go forth to the world with the report adopted by the Committee.  I am glad of this as I wish it to be read.

	Today I have been rather lonesome.  Wallace Thompson came this evening & was full of my attack on General Wallace.  The Carolinian contains an extract from my editorial correspondence & complements my courtesy.

	Judge Huger left this morning.  I have had a most pleasant and agreeable week with the old gentleman & we have been very much together as he boarded at this House.  Mr. Finl[e]y spoke to me yesterday very cordially & I did not recognize him.  Judge Butler & myself were walking & met Mr. Barnwell & Mr. Finl[e]y.  I spoke to Mr. Barnwell & was not going to do anything more than bow to the other but he immediately called me by my name & shook hands.  The more I see & know of Mr. Barnwell the more I like him. 

	I shall probably get off from here Thursday morning.  The Trustees meet Wednesday night.  My cases are the first on the docket & will be disposed of in two days.

	Willie will probably write you tomorrow.  He says he does not know how we can write so much to each other.

	Dr. Blanding said to me this evening that he did not suppose that either John Preston or myself would receive the appointment of Senator.  Col. Martin of Abbeville said he would like to see me receive the appointment.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your long and most acceptable letter this evening & as you have been so good in writing my mail, I will do the same.

	I have just taken my supper & did have some idea of going to the theatre, but it is raining & the house would be unpleasant.  Willie is reading the Scottish Chiefs.  I read to him your letter.  He assisted me this morning in endorsing my briefs.  Judge Frost recognized him as my shadow.

	The court commenced the trial of my cases this morning.  We disposed of three of them.  Tomorrow the Court of Errors, which includes the Chancellors & law Judges sits on two more of my cases.  I hope to get through Wednesday & start home Thursday morning.  You may expect me to rouse you up about twelve oclock Thursday night.  But I will write you again tomorrow.

	I am glad the children enjoyed themselves so well on May day.  But I was sorry to hear that you had fatigued yourself.  I hope it has all passed over.  I am afraid to that the children may feel the effects of their �potion.  You ought to take care of Mary.  She is such a beast that she will have no care of herself.  It may be slow fever, which is my greatest of terrors.  Do not commence your house cleaning.

	I hope Reuben and Charles are getting on pretty well with the farm.  Mr. Barrett was to send me some fodder.

	General Thompson left here this morning with his wife & sister in law.  They go on home & he returns to Columbia tomorrow.  No appointment of Senator will take place for ten or fifteen days.

	Col. Dudl[e]y came this morning & told Willie he would give him a keepsake to remember his fathers friend by.  I will get the articles you wish oranges & cocoa candy.

	I hear the�of my resolutions�every day.  Henderson of Laurens came down this evening & said
all the secessionists he met preferred them to the report of the Committee.

	I have nothing new to write you.  Most of the persons have gone from Columbia & this House quite deserted except by clerks & shop keepers, who are regular boarders.
     
	Every time I see a little baby I recall Hext to my mind�s eye. Tell Anna & Frank & Fanny that I think of them very often and you, my dear wife, are constantly in my thoughts & heart.  Good night, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line.  And I have very little to write.

	My horse did very well, never drove one which was more gentle.  He is gentler than Caleem.  Willie can drive him any where.  I am very much pleased with him.  

	As I came on Overtook Col. Townes & John Jones & even stopped on the road side & ate our dinner very pleasantly & they both drank of my wine & brandy.  

	I have been here all day without reaching my cases.  We will only be able to try Paris case.  The other will have to be postponed.

	I have met Chancellor Dunkin who enquired after you very kindly & seems very pleasant.  He asked for the Southern Patriot this morning & said he had not seen it since he left Charleston.

	Mr. Burt, Young, Perrin, McGowan, Sullivan are all here.  It is probable I shall not leave till Wednesday evening & stay at old Pendleton.

	I shall be glad to hear from you at Pickens.  But I am afraid no one is going from Greenville.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I am here quite well & shall leave this morning for Abbeville & will endeavour to return home Sunday night.  I feel much better than when I left home.  I had a fine sleep last night & this morning the air is cool & pleasant.  I think the quantity of mineral water that I drank last night had a good effect in making me sleep & feel well.  This is quite a pleasant place & I wish you were with me.

	Monday night I staid with my old friend Mr. Richardson the grandfather of Mrs. Thomas Gowen.  They were very kind to me & you must be kind to Mrs. Gowen.  Gowen sent down & got a milk can of Mr. Richardson whilst I was there & a baskett of butter.

	I met my old friend Capt. Hugh Wilson & wife yesterday & he seemed very glad to see me.  

	The Bell is now ringing for breakfast & I must close my letter.  I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	I am here & very anxious to hear from you & know how Edward & the fever are coming on.  I saw Col. Ware this evening who says he left Greenville after dinner Tuesday evening & heard Dyer speak of having some of the boys sick.

	Mr. Reed is quite sick with billous fever.  I saw him this evening.  His wife was confined two days since & is dangerously ill.  Norris the one who took tea with us is sick at Bensons with typhoid fever, says Mr. Harrison.
		   
	I spent last night at Mr. Hammonds & found Mrs. Hammond a very important witness.  I have examined Mrs. Reed & Mr. John E. Norris.  In the morning I start to old Pendleton by the way of � Garrisons & will reach there tomorrow night.

	Frank does very well & is great company for me.  Yesterday we fell in company with Bruce & old Mrs. Green & took dinner with them on the road to Anderson.  They were coming here.

	Tell Reuben & Charles when not better employed they may grub out the place we spoke of building a house at over on the Farm and which we commenced clearing last winter.  

	I hope to hear from you at old Pendleton Friday morning.  Take care of yourself & the children & the Servants.  Make them keep everything clean in the kitchen & rooms.  The sickness in Charleston is alarming.  It is now very warm weather & should it continue the sickness will increase.

	Good night.  Frank has just gone to bed to sleep.  How happy I should be to peep in & see you & the children.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	I am now writing to you an hour before day.  I have made my own fire & am sitting in my morning gown & slippers.  I believe this is the only time I shall have for all the evening my room is full of visitors.

	I will now give you an account of our journey down here.  Monday night we passed very pleasantly at John H. Harrisons who married Miss Benson.  Anna was much pleased with them.  Mrs. Harrison whom I went to examine is a very strange old woman.  She would not be sworn and would not answer my questions.  My visit amounted to nothing for I could not prevail on her to be examined.  Sometimes she would give me no answer at all. Her son tried to persuade her, but she was incomprehensible.  She is either fool or worse.

	Tuesday we came to the head of the rail road & staid at Littles, a pretty good home.  Mr. Harrison Jr put up a good dinner for us & we did well on the road.  At Broad River we took a boat & fortunately it was a good day or we should have fared badly.  The boat was open & the stream full of shoals and dangers.  I am sure I shall never go down the river again much less up it.  I met Ransom Calhoun at the River coming up.  He came into the cars to tell me how bad the passage over would be.  The day before he started on the boat coming up, got out & walked eight miles, & reached the Bridge three hours before the boat, but the cars had gone before he reached the Bridge, & he had to stay behind.

	Anna wrote you last night.  I saw the letter on my desk & thought it was to me, & broke it open, but discovered my sins late & resealed it without reading.  She seems very well satisfied here & Janney tells me that he will not charge a cent if she stays all the Session.  He has a little daughter about her size,  & they have taken Anna into their room.  I have not seen or heard anything of Taylor or Mrs. Taylor.  I met Col. Hayne yesterday & he seemed very cordial.  His election is exciting some interest.  I suppose he will be elected.  My friends & acquaintances were all glad to see me & gave me a very cordial greeting.  I have received from Dyson three Hundred dollars by Dr. Campbell.  When I get the fee from Gladden I will send you a check to pay Dr. Irvine if he is at home.  When I have the money I like to pay my bills at once & be done with it.

	Nothing has been done in the Legislature before my arrival.  I took a part in the first debate that occurred yesterday on a contested election.  I think Judge Evans will be elected U. States Senator & Manning Governor.  There are about twenty candidates for Senator.  

	Mrs. Brooks & her daughter are at the House, & will remain here till after the commencement Ball.  The clock is now striking five, almost an hour yet till day.  Anna recd your letter last night only. It  ought to have been here the night before.  There is great irregularity in the mails.  I was glad to hear you were all well & doing well.  I hope to hear from you every day.  It is now raining very hard. & has been for the last forty hours.  I am afraid we shall have a terrible freshet again.  If the rains here have been as heavy in the upper country we certainly shall.  Reuben & Charles must see to the cows & especially the one General Thompson gave me.  I hope the horses are not injured by the trip.  Write me all about everything.  Tell the children to behave well & I will give them a present on my return, but nothing if they do not.

	I must now close my letter & write to others.  Sam Townes is sick.  Duncan, Morgan & McBee are all well.  McBee seemed glad to see me & appears very cordial.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am again writing to you before day.  I received your letters of Wednesday & Thursday last night after my return from the Board of Trustees.  I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  The mails are now so irregular that there is no certainty of hearing from each other.  For several days past the mails did not reach by the boot the�the end of the Rail Road.  Yesterday the cars ran off & the passengers came back.

	Anna is behaving remarkably well & is as fine a little [girl] as ever.  She stays with Janneys little daughter & amuses herself by going into the drawing room & listening to the Piano, helping about the house where Mrs. Janney is and riding out notwithstanding the bad weather.  It has been raining excessively since we have been here.  I have not even thought of Annas going to Charleston.  I wish her to stay a day or two after the weather breaks off & se the Town, state House, Mrs. Taylor &c.  She comes up to see me every morning after breakfast & then again after I return from the State House.  I have not seen here since receiving your two last letters.  I read to her your first letter & it affected her to tears.  She seems to have a good heart & an affectionate disposition.  I will not begin to enquire about sending her to Town [Charleston].

	Col. Isaac Hayne was elected attorney general yesterday by three votes.  I voted for him & so did [Perry Emory] Duncan, [William Pinckney] McBee & [Nathaniel] Morgan.  Brockman voted for neither.  Hayne spoke to Burt about my vote & Burt told him that I was a magnanimous fellow & would no doubt vote for him.  The contest excited great feeling I think. [Richard] DeTreville behaved badly in the canvas.  He offered to Duncan if he would vote for him to give him two votes for Jones.  Duncan informed him that he took no interest in Jones election.  I am afraid Jones will be elected by his usual duplicity & polarizing.

	Nothing of consequence has yet been done in the Legislature.  The election of U, States Senator takes place on Monday.  I think Judge Evans will be elected if he consents to run.  I am to see him this morning on that subject.  General Adams spoke to me yesterday about the governors election.  He seemed very cordial.    In fact all of my old friends & acquaintances have met me most cordially & paid me great respect.  Governor Means last night came up & walked back with me from the college.  My broken arm has excited a good deal of sympathy.  Col. Watts told me he expected I was like General Shields, who carried his arms in a sling & as a lady said in Columbia to excite sympathy.  I replied that my wound was very different from General Shields.  It originated in my awkwardness & Shields in patriotism & glory.

	I made a very judicious purchase of law books yesterday for Spartan D. Goodlett, who sent me $50.00 for that purpose.  I have bought nothing for myself except a new hat which I had made after measuring my head.

	You had better send for the corn which has�& have her fed well at home, or she will get so poor that she will give no milk.  Make Reuben attend to the horses & cows well.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	Mr. Keith goes up in the morning & offers to take my letters.

	I went to the Episcopal Church today & heard a good sermon from Mr. [Peter] Shand.  Anna went to the Roman Catholic with Janneys little daughter.  She was greatly pleased with the ceremonies.  I did not see Mrs. Taylor in church.  I saw but did not speak to Col Taylor.  I went with Mr. Petigru & Col. Alston & sat very much in front of him, but he went out of the House & I did not see him again.

	Trimmier of Spartanburgh & his wife & sister in law are at the House, & going to Charleston Tuesday next.  Mrs. Trimmier who seems a�woman just married said she would take charge of Anna in�her to Town [Charleston].  I think I shall send her down in that way.  She is enjoying herself very much.  

	This morning after breakfast I found you Friday letter on the center table.  I was truly glad to hear from you and felt sorry when I thought you would not probably hear from me before this morning.

	I was sorry to hear John was sick & hope he is out by this time.  I was glad to hear of the return of our stock & that you were in beef by the return.

 	The Townes, Campbell, & John Jones & Gossett have all come from Greenville.  John Jones tells me Mrs. Thompson is up yet.

	Write me often & tell me all the news of Greenville.  Col. Augustus Townes is wishing to address Miss Garlington it is said.  I am glad Hillhouse is going to be moved.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter this morning & will not write you again, though I do not know when you will receive either of those letters.  The mails are all irregular& no doubt you began to think hard of my neglect.  Before you received my first letter.  I hope to hear from you again tonight but I do not know how.

	The cars below here ran off last night & killed Col. Richard Singleton & his grandson Van Buren, crip[p]led a great many other passengers & did other mischief.  This is a most horrible accident.  The rail road or culvert gave way, & cars, passengers & engines were all mashed up together!

	Anna & little Ellen Janney have just been in my room.  She seems very well satisfied but expresses a wish to go on to Charleston.  The weather & uncertain condition of the road here prevented me looking out even for an opportunity to send her.  I will carry her to church tomorrow, & Monday let her see Columbia, & then send her to Charleston.  My time is so much occupied here that I cannot pay any attention to her in the day time.  

	We did nothing in the Legislature today, but elect solicitors commissions &c.  Jones was elected treasurer.  No one of any consequence was a candidate.  Dawkins�Bonham were reelected solicitors.    

	The weather is now cold & likely to continue so.    Mr. Keith speaks of starting on Monday.  He is to call for the Greenville delegation tonight & give us an oyster supper.

	Anna took your letter this morning & read it & returned it to me this evening.  She says that she has written to you today.

	Col. Beaufort Watts asked me yesterday if Williams & Dyson had paid me $1,000 for a fee in the case of Scurry.  He said William promised him to do so.  I told him Dyson had paid me $500. & perhaps Williams might yet add $500 more.  The Col. expressed a great hope that he would.

	I have not heard or seen anything of Gladden & I shall draw on Hill for the $100 if not paid shortly.  Col. Brockman said he had the money to pay his note but he begged me to wait till holiday in January.

	I will now close this letter & write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter written on Sunday & was truly sorry that you had not heard from Anna & myself since we arrived here.  I have written you a good many letters & Anna has written two or three.  But I was apprehensive that my letters had not gone.  The greatest irregularity exists in the mails.

	Anna was to have gone to Charleston this morning but Mr. Trimmier postponed going till tomorrow.  This I am glad of, as it will enable Anna to go & see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.  General Martin saw me in the streets yesterday & got out of his carriage to ask me to let Anna stay with him.  He had just heard of her being in Columbia.  Mrs. Martin called to see Anna yesterday but she was out.  On her�  She stated that she had called to carry Anna home with him.  They are keeping house.  Today I will carry Anna around there & let her go & see Mrs. Taylor.  Anna is delighted with Columbia.  She has been to see the Lunatic Asylum, Hamptons House, the governor &c.  She went this round with Mrs. Brooks & Mrs. Trimmier and Col. Jno. D. Williams family.	

	I was amused the other evening at Annas observation in the drawing room.  There is a courting scrape going on here between two little creatures�Miss � & our little � Dinkins.  Anna & Janneys little daughter were peeping & saw them kiss, saw her slap his face & heard him make some very impertinent remarks.  She told the whole scene & wished to know if that was not �very near courting.�  I told her I thought it was �very near.�

	I bought Anna a beautiful medallion for $7.00.  She was very anxious for one as some other little girls had them.  It is intended for a miniature.

	I am very much engaged here & have scarcely a minute to spare.  I am now writing before day.  In fact it is the only time I have to write.  Whilst I am dressing Brockman & someone is in my room till breakfast.  I am engaged on law matters till twelve oclock.  Then I am in the Legislature till near night.  After supper I am at the college till eleven oclock.  Last night I did not go to bed till one oclock.  I was in company with Mr. Petigru & Col. Aldrich. 

	Mr. [William Ford] DeSaussure was elected U. States Senator till March yesterday.  Judge [Josiah James] Evans will be elected today for six years.  Cols. Calhoun & Carew of the Senate spoke to Brockman yesterday to feel me about running for Governor in opposition to Col. Manning.  Mr. Middleton of the House came to me about the same time and said he had been requested by some of his friends to enquire of me if I would have the office if elected.  They said the secessionists were all going to vote for me.  I said to Middleton it was an office not to be referred to as sought for but that I did not wish to be voted for.  He said Manning had no pretensions to the office except his property.

	In the Board of Trustees last night we had an interesting discussion in which Mr. Barnwell, Judge O�Neall, Col. Manning , Mr. Petigru, Mr. DeSaussure & myself took a part.  There is likely to be a serious rebellion in the college.  One hundred of the students have signed a pledge to quit unless the stewards hall is dissolved.  We meet again tonight.  

	I am glad to hear John is out again & that you are all well.  I must now conclude my letter & dress.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from seeing Anna start to Charleston.  She went off in good spirits with Mrs. Trimmier & Tolleson of Spartanburgh & their families.  She was greatly pleased with Columbia & said she was willing to stay here longer.  Yesterday Judge Butler & myself started with her to see Mrs. Martin & fell in company with Mr. Robert Barnwell, Col. Preston & Col. Hampton & whilst delayed in our walk, we met General Martin & his wife, and they took possession of Anna.  She staid with them till night.  Mrs. Martin told me that Mrs. Hayne was expecting her to stay all the winter in Charleston.  She will have two weeks to stay before I start home.  I gave her $28.50cts & told her if she wanted more money to write me.  I would have given her more, but had nothing but four hundred dollar bills left.  Gladden has not paid me nor Col. Brockman.

	Yesterday evening whilst in the drawing room, a servant told me that there was a gentleman down below in a carriage who wished to see me.  I went down & found Governor [David Lowry] Swain of North Carolina, now President of the North Carolina University, & an old school mate of mine.  He said he had come by Columbia on purpose to see me & was about being turned off for the want of a room.  I told him to get out & I�both my room & bed with him.  He did stop & we spent the evening very pleasantly.  I introduced him to Judges Butler, Wardlaw & Withers, Col. Manning & others.  Professor Brumby was an old acquaintance & I sent for him.  Towards eleven oclock Mr. � got a bed & room for him, & we did not sleep together.  We had not seen each other for thirty years.  He said he remembered my�well, but that I was much fuller & stouter.  He left this morning.  I introduced Anna to him.  He enquired after my family & told about his.  Professor Brumby begged that Anna might go & stay with his little daughters.

	We had several ballotings for U.S. Senator yesterday.  Judge Evans is ahead & will be elected today.  He said he had nothing to do with it, and that I had the entire control of his name to run him or withdraw him when I pleased.  This is what his son told Dr. Zimmerman.  Pickens, Chesnut, McGrath, & Preston were all run.  The secessionists still speak of running me for governor.  We are doing very little in the Legislature.  Today we shall have some discussion on the Electoral Bill.  I may make a speech.

       I recd your letter last night & am thankful that you write me every day.  I hope to hear tonight that you have recd all of my letters.  You had perhaps better purchase some hogs to kill.  Consult Mr. Hoke about it.    Though it is rather warm just now, I will send the money if needed.
       
       Give my love to all the children.  Write me about them.  I have no time to write & must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night dated Dec. 1st and was surprised you did not mention Mr. Keith.  I wrote by him & he promised to call & see you & deliver my letter to the Patriot & am afraid that he has neglected to deliver that also.

	Yesterday I made a speech on the Basis of Representation, whilst this Bill for the division of Pendleton was under discussion which has now for me some honor.  Dr. Broyles told me it was the best speech he had ever heard.  There was a crowded House.  The Senate had just adjourned, & the Senators came in to hear me.  Mr. [William R.] Tabor the editor of the Charleston Mercury told me at dinner that he was very much pleased with my speech & had listened to it with great interest.  The Reporter of the Charleston Courier came to me for a copy of it & I have written it out for him.  I think the speech will be read with interest & gives the people some valuable information in regard to basis of representation.

	We have had a good deal of discussion in the Board of Trustees & I have generally taken an active part.  The question before the Board is a rebellion of the Students on account of the Commons.  Mr. Barnwell & Mr. Thornwell made capital speeches on the subject.   

	The electoral Bill has been postponed till Tuesday next.  I may speak on that question.

	My name is mentioned in speaking of candidates for Judge., but it is too soon to expect that position after our political excitement.  The secessionists still talk of voting for me for Governor & Manning is a little uneasy about it.

	I saw Mr. Carter the book seller in Charleston yesterday.  He told me that I ought to expect some high appointment from {Franklin] Pierce.  That whilst at the North last summer he heard a friend of Pierce�s speak of me & said that Pierce himself had frequently done so & valued my character.  He took down my name in full to President Pierce.  

	I hope to hear from Anna tonight.   Mrs. Brooks & her daughters are still here.  There are now a good many ladies coming in to be at the Commencement ball.

	Mr. � spoke to me last night & made himself known.  He enquired after your mother, you & sisters & children.  He seems a very excellent man, said he was with me in politics & always had been.   

	Mr. Miller of Georgia & President of the Senate of Georgia was introduced to me yesterday & said he took great pleasure in reading my Paper & was a subscriber to it.  He got me to present his petition for the city council of Augusta about the bridge to the Legislature.

	Tom Butler was not elected to carry the votes to Washington.  A young man from Spartanburgh named Edwards now in college was elected.

	I am sorry you worry yourself about the servants.  Take everything cooly & don�t expect them to do well.  We have good servants at this house.  I make my fire before day because it is no trouble, and a pine drys in my room & may kindle instantly.

       My friend G.M. Thompson the Boot and shoe merchant made me a present the other day of a superb pair of boots worth ten dollars.  This was clever in him.  I paid him the Bill for negro shoes thirty dollars.  I have also paid Lyons & sons the money collected for them of Kilgore amounting to $64.00.  I am now left with $300.00& $100 due me from Gladden.
       
       We had quite an accession yesterday from Greenville.  Sam Mauldin, Joab Mauldin, Dr. Pasley &
Hasan [Hamlin] Beattie.  It is rumored that Sam Mauldin is crazy & attempted to kill himself.  Sam Townes & Frank Townes will leave here this morning.

	I must now dress & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  I wish to see you all very much.  Anna was a great comfort to me whilst she remained here.  It is a great thing always to have someone near you when from home who is dear to you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just sat down to write you a letter.

	Your letter & Annas have just come to hand, and another one from Anna to me.  I have been engaged in the Legislature late tonight, & at the supper table got into conversation with Mr. Petigru & Col. Chesnut & sat a long time after anyone else had realized.  The house is full of ladies, & the table is crowded with them.  They are dancing & promenading & almost seen over me at every turn I make to get through the crowd.  There is not one of them as pretty as my wife & so you need not be jealous of me.

	There is a young lady here from Georgia a Miss Baxter, daughter of Judge Baxter, who is said to be talented & is bold & good looking.  Col. Keith has been wishing to introduce me to her.  I heard a good story in reference to her.  She dresses in the extreme of fashionable dress & open bosom &c.  Dr. Bailey a member of the Legislature was a competitor in the boat race in Charleston & beaten by a boat called Becky Sharp from Georgia.  This he disliked very much.  He was looking at Miss Baxter dancing the other evening & enquired who she was.  Hearing that she was from Georgia, he exclaimed �another Becky Sharp.�  The expression was told to Miss Baxter & no doubt pleased her very much.

	I liked your last letter very much and hope you will always write me such.  I do not care to be praised in your letters, but I like expressions of your love for me.  I hate scalding & reprising.  I wish you were here with me most sincerely.  There are some pleasant ladies.  Mrs. Chesnut is not one of them.

	I saw & spoke to Mrs. Elford & Miss Crayton this morning.  Joab Mauldin & Miss Crayton are gone to his wedding.  He is married tomorrow.  Mrs. Elford will go to Town [Charleston] in the morning.

	Mr. Beattie & Mr. Cox are here.  Greenville has been pretty strongly represented this winter at this House.  Mrs. Brooks leaves here in the morning.  Dr. Pasley goes up to Greenville & I expect him to carry this letter.

	In the Legislature not much done.  General Harrison told me this morning that everyone said my speech on the division of Pendleton was the speech of the session.

	Col. Glover has been elected Judge. He beat Col. D�.  We have some thought of running Elford for Glovers place.

	My speech is published this morning at length in the Carolinian.  Anna writes me for $10 more of money.

	I must conclude & will write you tomorrow.  All well, yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your scalding letter last night.  It is anything�pleasant to receive letters repining & grumbling from ones wife.  I wrote you all the complimentary notices & remarks made by gentlemen about me, and therefore instead of being gratified & pleased with them, & loving me the more for them you burst forth in a passion because I cannot be what some of my friends would desire to see me.  This is poor consolation to me.  For God sake my dear wife divest yourself of this disposition & habit.   It makes both you and myself unpleasant.  Look on the bright side of the picture & not the dark.  It is just as easy & far more consoling.  I did not write to you to create the belief that it was possible I could be elected either governor or Judge at this time but to show you that there were members of the Legislature who thought of me for those high offices.

	My speech made the other day on the basis of representation & the division of Pendleton has been very highly complimented.  [Nathaniel] Morgan came to me & said that whilst listening to the speech & seeing the effect it was producing. [he] could but feel proud of me as a colleague & that he too was from Greenville.  He said that if the people of Greenville could have been there to have heard it, they would never have thought of opposing me again.  McBee also complimented the speech.  Augustus Townes told me that he spoke of my speech in a crowd of gentlemen & they all commented in high encomiums on it & me.  The speech will be published.  Col. Glover asked me for a copy of my notes of the speech.  They all say it embodied information which was new to them.

	The Electoral Bill was postponed yesterday till Tuesday.  The Bank Bill was discussed & I took a part in the discussion.  

	Another terrible accident happened on the Charleston rail road.  The two night trains met & broke everything to pieces.  One man was killed & a great many injured & crippled.  The cars did not reach here till four oclock last night.  I have not yet heard from Anna.  Perhaps I may when the mail is opened.  There was no accident on the train the day she went down.  

	The ladies are crowding in here from all parts of the state for the commencement Ball.  Janneys house is full of them.  I wish you were here.  Next winter I will engage a room for us & you shall stay all the session.  Hext by that time will be out of the way.

       Dr. Keith of Orangeburgh & Mr. Dantzler his cousin [Olin Miller] Dantzler a member of the Legislature went off the other day to fight a duel in North Carolina.  It is said that Judge Butler has had them arrested as he passed through Charleston.  
       
       Col. Brockman has just been in today to pay me his morning visit & says Sam Mauldin is in a very bad way, & wishes to destroy himself, tried to jump out of the cars as he came down.  They keep a constant watch over him.  Joab is on his way to Darlington to get married.
       
       I must now conclude my letter.  Last night I felt worn out & exhausted by the loss of sleep & went to bed early.  I could not attend the meeting of the board of Trustees last night.  This morning I feel pretty well.  My arm & hand are improving.  I am beginning to use the hand a little & this morning was able to button my shirt sleeves for the first time.
       
       I am very much pleased with Janneys Hotel.  It is far superior to Maybins.
       
       Tell Willie I should like for him to be here next Fall to enter college.  Ham[lin] Beattie is here for that purpose.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
           
P.S. In regard to Susan & McBee I have nothing to say.  I am sorry to ever hear them mentioned.  Morgan had a long talk with me about them the other morning.  He said Luther made a pretty good story on his side of the question.  Therefore I told him of his conduct which shocked Morgan very much.  Yours &c, B.F.P.

My dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning & it gave me great pleasure to hear that you had safely arrived in Charleston.  There have been so many Rail Road accidents lately that I was uneasy last night when I did not hear from you.

	I was glad to hear that all of you aunt Elizas family were well & that you had been out visiting your aunt Hayne & the Coles.  You must give my love to all of them.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last evening.  They were all well.  She professes great anxiety about you & your good behaviour.

	I will deliver your message to Miss Janney when I return to the Hotel.  I am now in the House of Representatives.  The cars did not reach Columbia till four oclock this morning.  This was the reason I did not receive your letter last evening. We have a house full of young ladies at Janneys.  They have come from all parts of the state to attend the commencement Ball.  Some ten or twelve are in a room next to me, & this morning they made so much noise & such bursts of laughter & screams that I could not sleep. I thought they must be crazy.  I am sure you would not behave so reckless.

	I have just written a letter to your mother, but since receiving yours, will write her again & enclose yours to me.  

	In regard to your returning to Columbia exercise your own pleasure.  I shall be glad to see you here as soon as you get through with your visits.  It would perhaps be well enough to avail yourself of Mr. Trimmiers returning to Columbia.  I wish you were here now.  You would enjoy yourself more than you did last week.  
	  
	I am glad to hear you speak of practicing.  It is well enough to unite study & pleasure.  

	If you wish any more money, write to me and I will send it to you.  Your mother wishes you to get a cloak, comb &c.

	I went to church this morning & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Thornwell.  It was late when I reached the Chapel & it was crowded.  Governor Means saw me without a seat & beckoned me on the platform & I sat by the side of him.  This politeness on the part of his Excellency I appreciated.

	The Hotel is running over with Ladies.  I never saw such a crowd of young ladies in the market.  They seem to show by their freedom of swooning that they are anxious to be courted & are here for that purpose.  I think it would make them happier than they�now are to be married.  But how long their happiness would continue is doubtful.

	Tomorrow is commencement and after that event we shall begin to be more quiet.  The ladies will begin to depart.  I wrote a long letter today for the Patriot & which you will see.

	Poor [Samuel] Mauldin was today placed in the Asylum.  He remonstrated most earnestly against the act.  It was, says Mr. Duncan, the most trying act of his life to leave him in the Asylum.  He begged & plead[ed] not to be left there.  It is a melancholly thing.  I drew up his papers last night for his restraint.  He had become dangerous to himself.  He is an opium eater & nothing but opium will appease his mind & nerves.

	Amongst the persons here are Leitners & Bobo�s daughters.  Miss Leitner enquired after you & Willie this morning.  I met a Miss Bobo who said she was at school at Greenville when we were married & attended a party at Mr. Crofts give[n] to us.  Col. Perrin & his daughters are here.  My friend McLure of Chester & his daughters.

	There was duel fought Friday between Dr. Keith & Mr. [Olin Miller] Dantzler of the House.  The former was shot in the arm.  He is here & walks about with his arm in a sling.  Dantzler was untouched.

	I met the reporter of the House this evening who is an Irishman.  He had been reporter for Congress and said that he had seldom heard such a speech as mine on the floor of Congress.  He said he had heard of my reputation as a debater but that I had far surpassed his expectations.

	This morning I shaved with my left hand.  This is a decided improvement in my arm.  

	I recd your letter dated Friday morning last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  
	
	I will write you after the commencement is over.  We have agreed to adjourn on Wednesday the 15th inst.  I will write you about sending the horses & carriage in time.

	Nothing yet has been done in the Legislature.  My speech will not make its appearance till Tuesday morning.  It is very long.  B.F. Perry

House of Representatives, [Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I rece[i]ved your letter written Sunday this morning.  The Mails could not be opened last night in time to get our letters & was scolded by the Barkeeper.  

	I wrote you everything I knew or had heard of to Sunday evening.  I went to the Commencement in the College & was pleased with the performance of the young men.  P.E. Griffin of Society Hill delivered a very fine Poem representing a conversation between Sir William Wallace & Bruce.  In speaking the part of Bruce he addressed me so personally as to attract the whole College.  Governor Means said that Griffin had made me the Sir William Wallace of his Poem.  The first part of his address  spoken by Bruce was very much like some of the abuse heaped on me by the Secessionists, ambition, traitor &c. &c.  But at the close of the Poem finding out the real sentiments of Wallace, Bruce says to him, �now I acknowledge you as a Patriot pure & devoted to your country.�

	There was a very large concourse of persons in the College & a vast number of young ladies all wishing to look interesting & desirous of attracting the notice of the young of the other sex. Whilst I was standing on the Platform or Stage near the crowd as they were going out of the College, I saw Mers. Hodge & Thompsom & spoke to them�directly after words a lady came by & spoke to me, said she supposed I had forgotten her, said that she was Mrs. Barclay, introduced me to her daughter, said she had been at my house, knew you & the children, & enquired most kindly after you.  I had no remembrance of her at all.  She got separated from her company whilst speaking to me & I walked home with her & her daughter.  But still I did not find out who she was.  Col. Garlington says he supposes she is the widow of Barclay the painter of portraits.  I am sorry I did [not] recognize her.  She was quite intelligent & seemed pleasant.     
  
       Last night the Ball came off at�& the college boys behaved badly & the young ladies refused to go back to the dancing room after the supper.  The Boy Henry who waits on me said the College Boys got drunk & yelled & screamed.  
       
       I am glad you have heard from Anna & am very willing she should remain in [Charleston] Town as long as her friends desire her. But from her letter to me I think it likely her friends have not been very pressing in their solicitations for her to stay with them.
       
       I had a note this morning  from Miss S� requesting me  to carry a bundle to Mrs. Arthus which she sent.
       
       I am glad you are getting on better with the servants & hope you will begin to look on the bright side of everything in stead of the reverse.  Our happiness is in our own hands, & if we makeu up our minds to fret & worry & opine at anything that does not go at as we would wish, we shall always be unhappy�on the contrary if we look at the real  pleasures & comforts that we have we shall be satisfied & happy.  Instead of repining for honors & pleasures & property we cannot acquire, let us enjoy & appreciate those that we have, and thousands & hundreds of thousands as good as ourselves have not & never can obtain.  I believe the happiness of every individual is in his own hands.  If he wills to be happy he may be and if he desires always to look as the dark side of the picture & consider only his misfortunes  he will most certainly be unhappy, whether President of the United States or a king on his throne or a peasant in the woods or a member of the Legislature from Greenville with as good a wife & as fine children as I have.

	I am writing to you amidst the confusion of the House & have not time to read over & correct it.

	I shall be glad to see Elford this evening.  Poor Mauldin attempted to beat his brains out in the Asylum after being left there.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Glover clerk of the House will be elected Judge in the morning over Col. Dawkins & Col., Fair. 

P.S.  Mr. & Mrs. Efford and Miss Crayton have just arrived & I think you for the letter & will write you tomorrow again.

My dear Anna

	I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, and to hear that you were well and enjoying yourself amongst your kind relations.

	I received a letter also last night from your Mother.  They were all well & she sent me your letter to her.  I had sent her your first letter to me.  Also you see how much we value your letters.  

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here going down to Charleston.  They have letters for you & Mrs. Elford will call & see you.

	Enclosed I send you ten dollars which you desire.

	Mr. Janneys little daughters enquire a great deal about you. & say I must write for you to come back.  They are anxious to have you with them again.  One of them said she was going to write to you.

	I have to write several letters this morning & must conclude this.  In regard to your coming up with Mrs. Trimmier you can do as you please.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning at my seat in the House of Representatives.

	Your letter last evening enclosing one from your Aunt Hayne was rece[ive]d last night after my return from the State House.  I was glad to hear from you & your punctuality as a correspondent lays me under great obligations to you.  If I had time I would write you more of a statement & love in my letters but I am so much pressed by business that I have no time for indulging in such feelings.  My letters to you all seem matters of fact epistles & will be amazing to our descendants one hundred years hence.  I was sorry that you did not hear from me the day you wrote me.  But your goodness and love have contributed to the right course whenever you do not hear from me.  The mails are very irregular& I really have not time to write.  I find that at Mr. Janneys I am compelled to spend more of my time in conversation and company than I did at Maybins.  There is more society there& it would be rude not to participate.  There are more persons too to see me than [I am] used to.

	I made a speech the other night on the Charleston Institute & on appreciation for the same.  Mr. Tupper came to me the next morning and said if the Institute awarded premiums for eloquence they would most assuredly bestow on me the first premium for that high gift for my speech.

	I read your Bill of groceries to Brockman & Elford & they both said it was impossible for our family�on that amount of Sugar, and that our servants must steal it.  Elford told me as to the quantity he used & said it would be no doubt be twice as much if he did not keep it locked up.  I am afraid our servants do steal the sugar.  Brockman said it was a pretty good bill for a grocery store.  I reduced the quantity of sugar considerably but�all the other articles.

	Elford leaves here tomorrow.  Mrs. Elford went on the other day with Mr. Cox & some Baptist preachers to Charleston.  I Am willing fore Anna to stay & come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.  Mr. & Mrs. Trimmier have returned.  I rece[ive]d a long letter from Anna this morning.  She is very much pleased with Charleston & seems to enjoy herself very much.  I am very much grattified to know that Anna has drawn forth the good opinion of her friends in Charleston.  She is a very sensible & most affectionate little girl�far superior to the ordinary girls of her age.    She too a happy cheerful disposition which is a great thing for anyone.  It makes life pleasant & add to the happiness of others.

	Mr. Beattie will leave in the morning & if anything occurs I will write you tonight by him.  The Legislature has gone down to the college at this time to witness the laying of the new cornerstone of the chapel & will be back in a few minutes.  President Thornwell delivers an address in the House of Rep[resentative]s this morning & the ladies are now assembling.  I must conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Friday night, [10 December 1852]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, and will now add a few lines more.  Mr. Butler leaves in the morning & will carry my letters.

	After writing to you this morning, President Thornwell delivered a most eloquent address at the laying of the cornerstone of the new Chapel before both Houses.  I introduced a resolution to publish it.

	We have elected H[osea] J[efferson] Dean of Spartanburgh the clerk of the House in the place of  Col. [Thomas Worth] Glover.  I claim some credit for having elected him.  He got no votes but Greenville & Spartanburgh the first ballot.  He fell a long ways behind & we still voted for him.

 	Nothing has been done in the Legislature this day, but ballot for clerk.  The weather is very bad & raining very hard.  Mrs. Brooks & her daughter left yesterday & went thirteen miles & had to return.  They left this morning & the day has not been much better.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne this evening.  He told me that he saw Anna last Sunday & she was enjoying herself very much.  He went down on Saturday & returned Monday.  

	Mr. Duncan has promised to carry me up in his carriage.  It will leave home Wednesday morning & stay at B.F. Mauldins or Ackers that night & the next morning get to the rail road by twelve oclock.  We expect to reach Donalds in Abbeville Thursday about that time & then come to Col. Wares that night.  You may expect us home Friday evening.  Anna can stay in Charleston & come up with Mrs. Elford.  This is my present arrangement.  This will prevent the necessity of sending Reuben & the carriage after me.  Instead of coming through Laurens we shall go up by Cokesbury in Abbeville to Donalds the head of the road.  

	In connection with the rail road, let me tell you that Col. Brown the Engineer died having made use of $8,000 of the Rail Road money.  This accounts for the style in which he & his wife lived.  How few persons are perfectly honest!

	I must now conclude, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Your letter of Thursday was not rece[ive]d till this morning.  Last night we were sitting in the House of Rep[resentatives] till midnight fighting over the Bank of the State.   I made a speech of some length & it was very highly complimented.  I think it was about one of my best speeches.  The House was greatly crowded & they listened with much attention.  Col., [Benjamin Faneuil] Hunt & myself had several passages of�in debate.  He was very rude & wrong in his statements & my victory over him was complete.  The speaker had to reprove him & this morning he called me up to his chair & said that his remarks were intended for Hunt & not for me as he stated to the House.  He further said that if the Speaker ever reproved Major Perry for a want of courtesy or dignity in the House or in debate he would go very far out of his way.

	I do not know whether I mentioned last night that Dean of Spartanburgh was elected Clerk of the House. I wrote you two letters by Mr. Beatty [Beattie] last night which I suppose you will get Sunday morning.  I am now writing in the House & interrupted every moment by business or Members coming to my seat to consult me & transact business.  

	As you like to hear what is said about me I will tell you what several members have said, who are now serving for the first term.  Dr. [Allard Belin] Flagg told Brockman that he was never more surprised in a man in his life�that I was just the opposite in everything that he had heard about me.  McKay of Georgetown said he expected to see a fierce war�but that he had found me civil, courteous & dignified & was greatly pleased with me.

	I recd a letter last night from Anna.  She says she will stay & come up with Elford & his wife.  She writes me that she is enjoying herself very much & wishes me to come down & see her before I return home.  But this I shall not be able to do.

	I am glad to hear you are all well.  I think Easl[e]ys wife will have trouble enough unless he is more amiable to her than �the rest of mankind.�  I am glad to hear that Willie & Frank are employed in such athletic exercise as cutting wood.  I wish them to have good constitutions & would be unwilling to see them spend one year on a farm, working and studying alternately.  

	I hope our servants will now do well & am glad you continue pleased with Becky.

	I am very anxious to meet you all again & will leave here most joyously next Thursday.  I�my wife & children better than fame or honors or country or anything else on this earth & had & had rather be with them.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d this morning your letter written on Friday & am sorry you did not hear from me that day.  I wrote you by John Jones and he ought to have arrived there Friday morning.

	The Legislature sits every night till eleven or twelve oclock & I do not get your letters till the next morning.  The Greenville mail is not opened till about nine oclock & that is after Janney sends to the Post office.

	I have written you so often lately that I have nothing to write this morning except that there is  proposition to adjourn on Friday next instead of Wednesday  which I expect will be concurred in by the Senate.  The House have found it absolutely necessary to protract the session two days in order to get through with the business of the country.

	A large box came to Maybins Hotel for me yesterday by the rail road from Charleston.  I suppose it is from your aunt Eliza.  But how I shall get it up is doubtful.

	You directed me to buy some dye for my whiskers.  This I have done, & this morning I applied it.  The whiskers are as black as a crow.  The application will remain for one month, & then the whiskers must be dyed again.  

	This is Sunday morning & I believe I shall not go to church but remain at home & write for the Patriot.  I hope you have received the two letters I sent you by Beatty.

	I recd a letter yesterday from General Thompson.  He said nothing about his family or wife.  I supposed she would have presented him with an infant before this time.

	My old friend F� has invited the Greenville delegation to dine with him today.  But I dislike to go out at all.

	I begin to feel homesick & am willing to adjourn at any time.  A little absence from you and the children is pleasant, because it affords so much pleasure in returning.  But after two weeks the time drags heavily.

	I will either come up with Duncan or in the stage.  You need not therefore think of sending the carriage & horses for me.  It is probable we shall not adjourn before Friday.   So you may expect to see me next Sunday perhaps in the morning in the stage.

	Give my love to all of the children & tell them how anxious I am to see them.  Don�t Hext begin to talk yet.  I am afraid he will forget me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	I was glad to hear from you last evening & to hear that you & all of your friends in Charleston were well.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mama yesterday & they were all well.  She wrote a great deal about you & said she was affected to tears, on reading your aunt Elizas letter giving an account of you.

	It will not be in my power to go to Charleston before I return home.  I suppose the Legislature will adjourn Wednesday, though we may sit till Friday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford will take charge of you and bring you home.  If you want any more money write to me & I will send it to you, or Mr. Elford will let you have it.

	Mr. Trimmier & his family passed through here the other day.  I did not see any of the ladies as they went to another Hotel.  Mr, Janneys House was full.

	The Governor is inaugurated today & there will be a large concourse of ladies & gentlemen to hear his speech.  I wish you were here to witness the ceremonies & see the crowd.

	I have not got the key of the carpet bag.  I left it at home.

	You must remember me to all your friends in Charleston & say to them that I should be very glad to see them.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

The State House

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line now, for I am afraid I shall not be able to do so tonight.  But I am writing amidst the confusion of the House.

	The Governor Elect [John L. Manning] has just been inaugurated & I have been to see him & take a glass of champaign.  He said to me that he should look to me as one of the counsellors & advisors of his administration & one of the most important.  Governor Means said to me that I now would not notice him, but paid all my attention to the Governor elect.  I replied that it was proper to pay first my respects to the rising sun.  He interrupted me by saying that he hoped I would not forget the setting sun.  I assured him that was no danger of that.

	Col. Brooks came to me just now & said I was the most remarkable man in South Carolina.  That I was the more abused & traduced than anyone in the State, and yet I had more influence in the House of representatives than anyone else and commanded more the attention of the members than anyone in the House.  He said the Edgefield delegation were particularly influenced by my speeches & votes.  That Mr. [Wiley] Harrison of that district who was a very hot secessionist said he wished his name commenced with a P and mine with�, so that I would have to vote before him& he might know how to vote, as he always wished to vote as I did.

	I recd last night a letter from [John] Livingston of New York enclosing the proof sheets of my Biography.  He says the likeness will be sent me in a few days.  The sketch makes sixteen pages & reads pretty well.  With a good likeness I hope the Biography will be creditable to me, & I feel under obligation to General Thompson for the sketch.

	I recd last night a letter from Anna.  She seems well pleased & happy�says she had no idea you & I would value her letters so much as we have done.  I wrote to her this morning & said she must come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  It is yet doubtful whether we adjourn on Wednesday or Friday.  

	Tell Willie that Anderson who is in college enquired when he would be in college, last night & young Buist returned home from college this morning.

	I will now close my letter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Last night I made a speech to the largest town meeting ever held in Columbia on popular Education & was most raptu[r]ously applauded.  I spoke for an hour.  Professor Reynolds followed me in a beautiful speech on the same subject.  I have been all day writing it out for publication.  

	I have just stopped to write you a line.  Your letter Saturday evening was read & as usual gave ne great pleasure.  I am truly glad that Tuesday is so near at hand.  I want to see you & the children very much.

	Col. Dawkins came up from Charleston Friday.  He says five sixth of the people there are indignant at Taber.  His coming here in relation to resign & he has done so, He was burnt there in effigy there too.

	I send you a letter which I recd from Dr. Douglass, a Senator from Chester for many years.  It is only a specimen of what I hear hourly every day.  Your affectionate husband, B,F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[i]d two letters from you this morning dated last Saturday & Tuesday.  They were here last night, but I can never get my letters now till next morning.

	I thank you again for your punctuality as a correspondent.  One of your letters was a very long one�the other acknowledging the receipt of my letter by John Jones a very short one.  Together they made two pretty good letters.  I am glad Hoke has purchased some pork for you.  I expect you were pretty well out of meat.  It is cheaper to purchase pork than bacon, but I suppose we shall have to do both.  Two thousand & three hundred pounds will not be enough.  

       Your house will no doubt look very neatly with new carpets & sofas &c.  And I only wish I was there now to lounge on the sofa instead of having to trudge through the rain & mud & darkness to the State House, which is a half mile from the Hotel.  I went down there this morning at ten oclock.  We sat till four & adjourned for dinner.  Now we return at six.  I have just dined and�sitting in the parlor & am writing my wife.  This is like a good husband.  I am not at all interested in any of the ladies here, not even �Becky Sharp,� and did not make her acquaintance although Col. Keith & Mr. [William R.] Tabr of the Charleston Mercury both made the proposition to me.  They are all or nearly all gone now, & we are quiet once more.  What a terrible rumpus young ladies in the market kick up at a Hotel when fifty one are all assembled together.  They make more fuss than gentlemen & shout as much as college boys.

	We adjourn positively on Thursday night & leave Friday morning.  You may expect me Saturday evening with Mr. Duncan.  His carriage & horses will go down one day too soon & have to remain at Donalds.  

	I will enclose you all of Annas letters as I have not time to write you any longer.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  You need not write me after receiving this letter as I will be on my way to Greenville.

	I hope you find old Lasly & his girls useful.  Yours truly & affectionately. B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter last night, which gave me great pleasure as all your letters do.  I received one from your mother at the same time requesting me to send to her all of your letters to me.    She says your letters to her are short, but well written.  You see my little daughter both I and your mother value your letters & how much we love you.

	I should be glad to see you before I return home, but I cannot go down to Charleston.  The Legislature adjourns tonight & we all leave here in the morning.  I hope to be at home with your mother, Willie, Frank, Fanny & little Hext Saturday evening and should like to have you in the group or family circle.

	You will come up with Mr. Elford.  I have sent him funds to pay your expenses & to let you have more money should you need it.  

	Enclosed I will send you some stamps to put on your letters as you requested.

	We have bad weather & so much rain that you will not be able to see much of Charleston.  The winter is an unpleasant time to travel or visit.

	I am very much fatigued by our night sessions.  We sit every night till eleven or twelve oclock.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am now in the State House writing to you amidst the confusion & noise of threw members.  Last night I recd a letter from you, but you had recd none from me since writing your previous letter,  I have written you a half dozen letters unacknowledged.

	We had quite an achievement here last night about twelve oclock.  I made a speech on the Blue Ridge rail road, which had a happy effect, & with Mr. Trenholm of Charleston carried that great measure most beautifully.  It is generally conceded that we changed the decision of the House.  I intend to write out my speech on that subject.  We did not adjourn till midnight.  On returning to the Hotel I recd your letter.  There was also a note from Gen. Thompson saying that his wife was delivered of a noble boy & she was doing well, & requesting that I would telegraph the glad tidings to Wilmington, N.C.    The note was written to Mr. Duncan.  I suppose he hardly knew what it was about.

	Your Box is a very large one & I do not know what I shall do with it.  If it gets wet on the stage it might be ruined.  It cannot come up in the carriage.  I must however do the best I can with your�clothing.  I am afraid if Elford & Brockman were to see it they would think of that as they did about the sugar.

	I must now conclude my letter & go into the Senate to electioneer for the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  

	I shall be at home Saturday evening.  Your affectionate husband &c, B.F. Perry

	The Hotel.  5 oclock pm.  I have just taken dinner & will add a line before I go back to the State House.  I had sealed my letter.  Nothing however has happened during the day except I have been very much complimented for my speech last night on the Blue Ridge Rail Road Bill.  General McGowan, Mr. Gourdin, Mr. Trenholm and many others said I spoke very handsomely & carried the House against the previous�& judgement.  The President of the George Town Bank said, that Mr. [Charles Alexander] Thornwell, a member of the Legislature, & brother of the President of the college, pointed to me today & said that whom shunned two years ago by all politicians as death, & now sir he has more influence in this House than any now on the floor & is more courted by the politicians and aspirants.

	I have to go back to the State House.  If anything special is heard from Anna tonight I will write you again.

My dear Liz

       I have just been to the Post office & recd your letter enclosing one from Anna.  I am afraid I shall not have time to write you this evening & am therefore writing you now in the House of Representatives whilst the clerk is reading over the journals of yesterday.

	I recd a letter from Anna last evening after writing to you.  She writes cheeringly as to her visit.  I would send it to you but it is at my room & I will be at home the day you receive this letter.

	Your Box gives me much trouble.  If it gets wet it will be ruined and now there is nothing but rain.  I do not think it can be sent on the stage.  Mr. Bryant in whose book store it is says I had better not send it to the Rail Road till the weather breaks off.   He will then send it to the Rail Road & a wagon will take it from Newberry.  It will come safer than by the stage.  But I will enquire more about [it] before I leave here.

	Last night the Senate came over & voted for the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  It has this moment passed the third reading in the House and is the law of the land.  This is a great achievement & has drawn on me many compliments & praises.  The Columbia papers this morning speak in high terms of my speech & Mr. Trenholm�s & attribute the passage of the Bill to those speeches.

	I leave in the morning bright & early.  If anything takes place worth writing I will add a postscript this evening.  I assure you I shall be most happy to meet you & the children again & be once more at home.

	I have authorized Anna to draw on Mr. Elford for any money she wants.  He will have $100 from Hill & Gladden.  I am glad to hear that Anna is so well thought of by her relations in Charleston.  I think all of our children are very superior to most children of their ages.  This, however, is the opinion no doubt of every parent.

       My arm is so much better that I can begin to use my hand a little.  But it pains me occasionally.  I am glad that Hexts eye was not hurt worse.  The children ought to be careful.  It is a wonder more accidents do not happen.
       
       Yesterday I had a present of a gold pen from a Book seller Mr. Middlekoff.  I weas purchasing some paper of him.  He & his wife sit next to me at the table.  He has lately opened a book store in Columbia.  Yours most affectionately, B.F. Perry
