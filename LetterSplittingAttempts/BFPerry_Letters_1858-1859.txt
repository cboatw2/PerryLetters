Dear Papa

	I have just received your letter this morning, in which you say that you have sent the money to Col. Memminger.  He will send it in shape of a draft or check, I suppose, for he has already sent his sons their money.  I suppose I will get it in a few days.  I will have to get it all in gold when I start home and as the banks have resumed specie-payment, I presume there will be no difficulty in that.  I will start from here next Wednesday or Thursday two weeks.  I don�t know exactly which day yet.  I can sympathize with you, and Ma about Anna.  I have�nt heard from her this week, but I hope that she is well enough to be by this time on her way home.  She said that she was to start on the 30th, which was last Wednesday I believe.

	I will call on Judge Evans, and Col. Orr, if I can find them in Washington.  The Memmingers are going to stop a very short time in Washington.  They will be gone before I get back from Annapolis.  I have�nt heard from Frank in some time.  He owes me a letter.  I mentioned in my last that the reason We did�nt go to Mr. Winthrop�s was that it snowed so hard.    The weather is very cold at present, at least cold enough for skating.

	I received a letter from Ma yesterday and one on Tuesday.  I will twice move before going starting home.  

	Christmas has come and gone, and so has New-years day.  We had holiday only on Christmas day.  Today is Saturday.  I generally write on Sunday, so I expect that you will get this letter a day sooner than usual.  

	I hope that you have got better from your cold by this time.  I am much obliged to Fannie for the book-mark that she sent me.  

	I will now close.  Give my love to Ma and all.  I hope soon to have the pleasure of being with you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	I met Anna here last night, & we go up to Greenville in the morning.  She came from Philadelphia with Miss Graham to Washington & from there with Dr. John LeConte to this place.  He health is better & I hope she may soon recover.  She stood the journey very well & regrets very much not seeing you.  She says she wrote you to meet her at the Annapolis Junction, and is afraid there was some mistake.  But I suppose you could not get permission to leave your school.

	I left them all well at home.  It is not late in the night & I have been writing letters to various persons.

	If you can get permission go on with Willie to Washington & stay a day or two.  But I suppose you cannot & perhaps ought not leave your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received Captain Blakes Report of your studies & conduct last night which mortified your mother & myself very much.

	You have sixteen demerits in December!  What are they for?  Let me know.  The first month you had only two & the second month six.  Now you have sixteen!  This is advancing most rapidly in bad conduct.  I thought the longer you staid, the less your demerits would be.  Young Daly only had ten in one whole year at the military school in Charleston.  

	But in your studies too, you have gradually fallen off.  In Arithmetic you have fallen from 68 to 89, in Geography from 26 to 57, & in Grammar from 26 to 39!  This is too bad.  You must study harder.  If you love your father & mother who love you so much, be a good boy & study hard.  Do not spend your time idly.  Keep to your books constantly & be sure you have got every lesson well.  Get Mr. Bradford to instruct you in your lessons.

	You must remember my son, that your happiness & success in life depends on your good behavior, industry & hard study.  If you are dismissed from the school you are a disgraced & ruined boy.  I have no property to give you & you have to make your fortune.  By great exertions & good luck I have placed you at a school where you may do well & succeed in life.  Turn over a new leaf & resolve to do better.  What would the people of Greenville say to you coming home in disgrace, dismissed from school.

	I was pleased with your letter to Anna & made an extract from it for the Patriot.  The people of Greenville have a high opinion of you as a good & clever boy & you must not disap[p]oint them.

	I hope you will write back to me, how it is you have got so many demerits, & have fallen off in your studies.  I hope too that you will write that you intend to do better this month & every month.  You do not know with how much interest er look forward to your Reports every month.  

	I suppose Willie will be with you about the time you receive this letter.  If he keeps you from your studies he had better not stay more than one day,

	We will come on & see you in June.  And it will be such a pleasure to find you doing well.  Anna thinks she is improving.  But she looks pale & has a bad cough.  All the rest are well.

	Write soon to your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mama

	I am not at Mrs. Green�s in the great city of Annapolis.  I arrived here last night.  I started from Cambridge last Wednesday evening and ought to have got here Thursday evening, but when I got to New-York I found that I could only get my trunks checked to Washington or Baltimore.  So I concluded to stay all night in Baltimore, and came on here yesterday morning by the 10 o�clock train.  But when I got to the depot with my trunks, I found that the train did�nt connect with thew Annapolis train, and that I would have to wait for the 5 o�clock train.  So I just checked my trunks on to Washington, and came down here without any baggage.

	I went to see Frank last night after I got here.  He looked better than I ever saw him, and seems very well pleased with the School.  He took dinner with me today, and I will go to see him again after supper.  Tomorrow evening he will come to see me and go to Church with me.  I will leave here day after tomorrow morning (Monday) for Washington.  I am sorry and ashamed to say I forgot and left those letters of introduction, that Pa gave me, in my room at Cambridge.  I will call on Col. Orr at any rate.  I shall in all probability leave Washington Tuesday evening, and get home Thursday night

	No train leaves this place tomorrow, so this letter will not start before I do.

	I hope you are all well and that I shall soon see you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & were glad you were well & expecting to see Willie.  I suppose he is with you today & will go to Washington tomorrow, Monday.

	We are sorry to learn that you have already got six demerits for this month.  You can avoid getting demerits if you will try.  And you should always be on your guard against doing anything that will bring them.  I hope you will now resolve to avoid all for the future. & study hard.  You cannot succeed unless you resolve to study hard & be a good boy.

	Edward B� wrote me a letter the other day to get Col. Orr to obtain for him an appointment at West Point.  I have written to Col. Orr for him.  

	Anna is about the same & looks badly.  She rode on horseback once last week & will ride again when the weather is good.

	All the rest of the family are well.  Hext is going to school & Hayne is going with him, but not to study.  Arthur looks very well & is a fine little fellow.  Fanny is growing very tall.  Your grandmother & family are all well.  Susans children are going to school.

	It is said Col. Orr will not be a candidate again for Congress.  Col. [John Durant] Ashmore of Anderson is here electioneering for his place.  Col. Farrow of Spartanburgh & Col. Jones are also candidates.  I expect Col. Dawkins will not be a candidate.

	Give my respects to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & tell your chum Mr. Bradford that he must see that you study your lessons well.

	We look forward to your letters with great interest & would be glad to see you with Willie & have you all at home once more.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We have not heard from you except through Willie for eight or ten days.  Last week we received a letter from Willie in Annapolis stating that you were looking better than he ever saw you, that you had dined with him that day & were to go to church with him the next day.  He stated too that you were well pleased with your school.

	Willie wrote that he would leave the Monday following for Washington & be at home the same week.  But we have not heard from him since.  I went to the depot to meet him Friday & Saturday.  I suppose he will be here tomorrow evening, Monday.  I thought he would stay in Washington longer than he expected.  I hope he went to see Col. Orr, Judge Evans, and Governor Hammond.

	We are very anxious to hear from you & hope to receive a letter tomorrow.  You must write once a week & oftener if you have time.  But do not let your writing or anything else interfere with your studies & duties in the Academy.  Think of nothing but your studies & duties.  You ought to try & learn fast & keep as high up in your Class as you possibly can.  Try & get higher & higher every month.  Your success in life & your happiness in life depend on your good conduct & hard study at this time.  Remember how�graduate & what a disgrace it would be for you to be dismissed.  

	We are all well except Anna.  She still looks badly & has a bad cough.  We are very much distressed about her, but have hopes of her recovery.  She is taking medicines which Dr. Jackson sent her from Philadelphia.  She rides out when the weather is good.  But she has only rode once on horseback.  She has been nowhere except to your grandmothers since her return.  A great many of the girls have been to see her.

	Fannie is growing very tall & will commence her school studies next week.  Hext & Hayne are going to Miss Powell.  But Hayne only goes for company.  He does not learn anything.  Arthur has grown fat & rosy & looks very well.  He is still nursing & very passionate like all of my children.

	The servants are all well.  Old Charles got married last night to his old wife with whom he had been living for the last twenty years.  They were never married before, & Baylis persuaded him that he ought to be married.  He had a large party & all the servants went out to Dea�.

	The Horses are all looking very well.  Tom Thumb is suffering for exercise.  How he would like to have you ride him.

	The schools commence here next Wednesday & the Boys are beginning to come in.  They expect a large number in the Furman College.

	The weather has been very mild all this winter.  We have had no ice or snow but a great deal of rain.

	Write us soon & all about your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & were glad to hear you were now going to study hard.  But we were very much mortified to hear you would be lower this last month than you had been.  This is too bad & you must study.  You say you do not wish to leave the navy.  Why do you not study hard.  I do not know what will become of you if you are dismissed.  My dear son I entreat you by the love you have for your mother & myself to turn over a new leaf & make it a point of honor to learn well your lessons & perform every duty in your school.  

	If you will only make progress in your studies I will send you money or anything else.  But not till you do so.  Let your report for February be good.

	Willie came last Monday.  He will go back the last of this month & stop & see you again.  We will send some things by him to you.

	We are all well but Anna.  She is about the same.

	I am going to ride out & must stop.  Your mother will write you in a few days.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Thus is Sunday & Valentines Day.  The whole face of the earth is covered with snow & the trees with ice.  We never before had so destructive a sleet.  The shade trees are all broken down.  The large oaks in thew yard are stripped of their limbs.  The house tops are covered with broken branches of trees.  The cedars are ruined.  Now the ice is falling off the trees & there is a constant noise.  

	Did you receive any Valentines?  Anna got two very pretty ones last night & threw one into the fire without letting us see it!

	We have all been bound for the last two days in consequence of the snow & sleet.  No one went to church today.  The streets are impassable.    But the weather is not so cold as one would suppose.

	I write to you today by request of your mother, but have nothing to tell you.  Your letter was rece[ive]d last night & you must write all about your examination.  I hope you will do better hereafter.

	Willie will return the last of this month.  You mother will send you some shirts, your Indian cap, & slippers.

	Tim, whom I once owned, was here just now & asked to see your likeness.  He says it does not look as well as you do.  He thought too that Willie did not look well.

	Anna seems better, but looks badly.  All the rest of the children are well.  Mary & Charlotte are sick.  Monarch threw Willie into the river yesterday, but did not hurt him, except a good ducking.  The horses all look well.

	You ought to go & see the Legislature in Session�go up some day.  It is something to remember.

	You must keep all your letters to read years hence when your mother & I have passed away.  

	We would like to see you very much.  But don�t want to see you dismissed.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter last night &was glad to hear you did well at your examination, & that you were now going to study hard.  This you must do, for you have been falling off, in numbers ever since your first Report.  The last is the worst of all.  Let your next Report be better & every other still better.  How much pleased we shall be at it.  I know you love your Father & Mother, & we had a hard struggle to get your situation for you.  Do remember this.  Hold on to it as you would your life, & rise with your class.  How dreadful it would be for you to be sent home or turned back.  Keep out of idle company & when at your book study do not idle away your time with your book before you.

	We had all like to have been burnt up just now.  Mary�s room caught fire.  One of her children caused it.  Her bed is burnt up.

	Anna is not so well & gets weaker.  I am very uneasy, and much distressed about her.  She looks very pale & is very weak.  A good deal of her time she has to be in bed.  The rest are all well.

	Willie will start back next Friday & be in Annapolis Monday or Tuesday evening.  He will carry you some clothes.

	Today the Baptist church is dedicated.  Tomorrow the military companies parade & have a ball.

	I had seen an account of your fire & was very sorry to hear of the old church being burnt.

	You must give my love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & my respects to Captain Blake.

	Hamlin Beatty [Beattie] & Sally Cleveland are to be married in April.  I have no other news to tell you.  Miss�McBee was very much pleased with your letter in the Patriot.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received no letters from you last week.  This we regret very much.  You ought to write once every week.  I hope however to receive a letter from you Monday night.  This is Sunday & I write you every Sunday.  But hereafter I shall be on the circuit & may not write you for two or three weeks.

	I suppose you have seen Willie & received your trunk of clothes & cake.  He left here yesterday & expected to visit Annapolis Monday or Tuesday.  He will tell you all the news from home.  But he is not, however, much of a news monger.  

	Your mother says you must not let your cake get you any demerits.  She is afraid that you will have visitors at unreasonable hours.

	We received your drawings last week & all thought them very good indeed.  You have a talent for drawing but you must not let it occupy too much of your time.  Do not neglect your other studies.

	I am very anxious to go on & see you immediately after my circuits are over the last of April.  If I can I will do so & return to the court of appeals in May.

	Anna is about the same.  She does not seem to improve any.  Some times better & then worse.  I have great fears about her health.  All the rest are well.  Hext & Hayne are going to school to Miss Powell.  Fannie goes to the Academy or Female College.

	Your mother will write you in a day or two and tell you all the news.  I have none.

	Another month has now passed by & we shall soon receive another report as to your progress & deportment.  I hope it will be gratifying.  You do not [know] how much we all love you, & desire to see you successful in your studies.  You have a fine situation, & thousands of boys would be glad to be placed as you are.  Think of that & improve your time.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & your mother says I must write you.

	We are all well except Anna.  I do not think she is improving & have great fears about her.  I hope, however the warm weather will produce a change for the better.  

	The day Willie left here he fell in company with Judge O�Neall & the same day the Judge met with a terrible accident on the Spartanburgh Rail Road.  He was thrown off the track & badly injured.  He has lost the use of his legs & will never be able to hold court again.

	Col. Orr has declined being a candidate for Congress.  Col. Ashmore, Col. Irvine Jones and Mr. Vernon of Spartanburgh are candidates.  Col. Ashmore will probably be elected.

	I hope you are studying hard & behaving well.  In the report of the Secretary of the navy I see a list of the cadets who were dismissed last year.  I hope you will not have your name amongst them next year.

	Write us how you are getting on in everything.  Tell us all that happens to you. 

	Fannie had some little girls here last night, & amongst them Mary Cleveland, who is a sweet little girl and I believe one of your belles.  She is certainly prettier than�Croft.

	But you must not think of the girls till you are a lieutenant in the navy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received a letter from Captain Blake stating you had been found deficient in your studies!  You do not know how unhappy this made your mother.  I have no words to express my grief and sorrow.

	I hope you will now begin to study & learn your lessons.  What disgrace will it be to see you returning home!  How can you look your friends here in the face after your dismissal!.  They will all laugh at you .  And you will be ruined.

	My dear Son only think how hard I struggled to get you in the naval school and what a terrible misfortune it will be to be dismissed.  If you have any love for your mother, any regard for me, or only consideration for your own happiness do study & redeem your character.  Dont let one moment pass in idleness.  Study all day & all night.  Do not sit on your book thinking of something else.  Say your lessons over & over again.

	I will come on next month if I can & see you & I hope by that time you will stand well in your class.

	When I have done so much for you, it is too bad to see you throwing away your golden opportunities.

	Think of nothing but study & good behaviour.  Remember next June you are to go on that cruise & see the world.  But if you do not study you will not go, but come home to be ridiculed & laughed at.

	I believe now, my dear Son, you will begin to study.  You said so, in one of your last letters, and if you only knew my heart I am sure you would.  Your affectionate Farther, B.F. Perry

	We rece[ive]d your letter of 21st Inst last night & were glad to hear you were going to study better & do better.  I hope my dear Son you will not relax in your resolution.

	I was glad to hear you were pleased with you roommate.  Capt. Blake writes well of him.

	Anna is getting better & we think now that she may recover.  The doctors say so.  But she has been ibn great danger & is still confined to her bed.  But her breathing is much improved.  We have been in great distress about her, & you ought not to increase our distress by your idleness or bad conduct.  I hope you will not.  

       Captain Blake writes you are doing better.  I am trying to arrange my affairs so that I may go on & see you in two or three weeks, but it is doubtful whether I can.

	The Students in the South Carolina College have had a great rebellion & ninety seven have been suspended till October & five more till May. They wanted holiday & tarred the benches.

	Willie Beattie has returned from Virginia & says the university is broken up on account of sickness.

	We are all well except Anna.  Becky is up & about again.

	Court was here last week.  We did not get half through.  Judge Wardlaw comes back to hold court in August.

	You must study hard & behave well.  Dont idle over your book but study & think of what you are studying.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We recei[ve]d your letter last evening & were glad to hear you were now doing very well.  I do hope you will study hard, my son, and keep up with your class.  Do not idle over your books one moment.  Get your lesson over & over again.  We shall soon receive your Report for march.  I hope it will be better.  Let every Report, sent me, show that you are rising, & standing better in your studies.  Each one should be a little better than the previous one.

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to go & see you in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be able to do so & get back to the court of appeals the first Monday in May.  

	Anna is better, but still in bed & very weak.  She takes a great deal of medicine &requires a great   
Deal of nursing.  Her mother has not been out even to church for several weeks.  All the rest are well.

	I have no news to tell you except that the students in the South Carolina College, in the military schools in Columbia & Charleston, at Yorkville & in Newberry Academy have had rebellions.  The schools here are going on very well.  The Village is quiet.  There is a revival in the Methodist church.  Wiley�s wife came to see him yesterday & she is almost white.

	Let us hear from you about your new roommate.  Do you continue to like him so well as you did.  How do you two get on together.  Waddy Williams has returned like a bad penny to his mother.  You mother says you must not be like a bad penny & return [to] us.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We did not receive a letter from you last week.  You ought to write regularly for we are uneasy my dear son when we do not hear from you.

	Anna is better & Dr. Earle thinks she will recover.  But she is still in bed & unable to sit up.  In two weeks Dr. Earle says she may ride out.

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to go & see you next week but it is uncertain whether I shall be able to get off in time to return to the court of appeals in May.

 	Minerva is very bad off with soar throat.  All the rest are well.

	Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Hext is learning very fast.  Hext & Hayne are very affectionate towards each other.  They are always together.  Fannie is going to school & growing very fast.  She will be a young lady in size very soon.  Arthur looks very well & grows finely.  He will not talk yet. 

I hope, my dear son, that you are now studying hard & ambitious of keeping up with your class.  I have not rece[ive]d your Report for march yet.  I hope it will be better.

       Tom Jones & Tommy Arthur are going to school at Spartanburg & came home the other day in uniform with brass buttons all over their coats.

	We did not receive a letter from you last week, but I hope we shall tomorrow.  Franks last letter was missent & delayed three or four days on the route.  It went to Greenville N.C. & was forwarded to this place.  Yours may have taken the same direction.

Franks last letter was well written & gave us great encouragement.  But his Report came yesterday for March, & I see he got 26 demerits that month.  This is more than he received before all together.  I am anxious to know what he did.

	I find it impossible to leave home in time to visit you & return to the Court of Appeals.  If I go I shall start Thursday morning & will not be able to go beyond Annapolis.  I should like to see you, but I am more anxious to see Frank, as it has been so much longer since I saw him, & he needs more looking after than you do.

	I hope my dear son that you are studying hard & behaving well.  You are now of an age to appreciate your opportunities.  Be thoroughly educated, & you will see in after life how much it will be to your advantage.  I have felt all my life the misfortune of wanting a thorough education.  It never can be entirely overcome.

	Anna is doing very well & recovering, but still in bed.  Dr. Earle thinks she will entirely recover & be as well as she ever was.  The rest all well.  Fannie, Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Arthur is growing finely & your mother is well.

	Hamlin Beattie & Sallie Cleveland are to be married Tuesday evening at the Episcopal church.  Choice & Beattie are to give large parties.  We are all invited to Beatties.  Anna only to the wedding.

	Mrs. Nance has written me she wishes to purchase Wiley on account of his wife.  But it is impossible for me at present to part with him.  I may hereafter when I can supply his place.  

	There is a great revival here in the Methodist church.  All the little girls in the college are joining
& many of the boys.

	I understand Col Ware�s eldest daughter is very anxious to marry Arnold, & her parents object & they had quite a scene there the other day.  Arnold was present.  I believe he is the sheriff of Laurens district & is good looking but poor & of a very poor family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received your letter last week, which was delayed several days, by the carelessness of some Post Master.  It was sent to Greenville N.C. & forwarded to Greenville &c.

	I was pleased, my dear Son, with your letter.  It was well written & beautifully written, giving a favorable account of yourself & studies.  But since that I have received your Report for March in which you have 26 demerits!  What were they for?  How did you get so many demerits in one month?  Tell me all about it?  What have you done?

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to visit you next Saturday night, but I may not be able to get off.  I have to leave here on Thursday in order to get back in time for the Court of appeals the second day of May.  If I get off, I shall not be able to go further than Annapolis.  I will not be able to visit Willie.  But my getting off at all is very uncertain.  I wish to see you very much.

	Anna is still improving, but still in bed & very weak with a bad cough.  Dr. Earle thinks she will recover, & be as well as she ever was.  I hope so & think so.    But it will be a long time before she recovers her strength.

	The rest are all well.  Your grandmother & aunt Susan & families are all well.  Fannie, Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Arthur is growing finely & looks well.  He will not talk yet, but understands all that is said to him.  

	Willie Beattie and Sallie Cleveland are to be married Tuesday evening at the Episcopal church.    They are to have grant parties at Choice�s & Beattie�s.

	You must my son for your own sake & for the love you have for your mother & myself be studious & good.  Do not let them dismiss you for want of hard study or good conduct.  Remember you must be a gallant officer of our noble navy.  What a situation you have & how much you will loose if dismissed.  How disgraceful too to be dismissed.

	I hope to hear from you Monday.  I did not hear from Willie last week.  He was doing well when we last heard from him.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d your letter this week & were glad to hear you were doing well & had recei[ve]d no demerits this month.  I hope you will now begin to see the necessity of studying hard & being on your best behaviour.

	I have been disappointed in visiting you.  Perhaps I may go on from Columbia to see you the first of May after getting through the Court of appeals.  I go down to Columbia the last of this week.

	We here had a great wedding in the village--Hamlin Beattie to Sallie Cleveland.  I was at the party at Beattie�s.  It was a very handsome affair.  There was a large collection of the young people & some old ones.

	Pauline Ware was also married to Mr. Arnold last week & they go off to Mississippi immediately.  Col. Ware & his wife were very much opposed to the match.

	Anna is better & rides out every day.  Dr. Earle says she will get well.  She is gaining her strength.

	Arthur is sick today�has an eruption all over his face & high fever & bad cold.  He is taking medicine & I hope will get better.  The little negro children were affected in the same way & get well in a day or two.  

	We have had a great religious revival.  Twenty or thirty are to be baptized today.  Mary Mauldin Betty & Oscar are amongst them.  Georgia Sperman about twelve years old is to be baptized.

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you Friday which stated that the youngest Memminger & Blake were supposed to have the measles.  I hope it may be nothing worse.  You have had the measles & therefore in no danger of that disease.

	Arthur is quite sick this morning with an eruption something like the measles; but it is confined to his face & he has a little fever.  Some of the little negro children have been affected in the same this�& recovered in two or three days.

	Anna is improving & rides out a short distance every day.  Dr. Earle thinks she is with prudence out of danger.  This is a great mercy to us, for your mother & myself have been greatly distressed about her.

	The morning of Hamlin Beatties �fair, his father came to me office & insisted on my going.  I did so.  They had quite a magnificent wedding party.  I have seldom seen a handsomer supper.  The company was large.  The Bride & Bride Groom looked very happy, & I hope their happiness will continue through life.  The mother of the Bride refused to attend the wedding & parties.  Her father was present.

	Pauline Ware was married last week to Mr. Arnold a grandson of old Joe McCullough.  He was not the man I spoke of in my last letter.  His father is a clever worthy man & the Arnolds are mostly respectable.  They go off to Mississippi.  Pauline said she would rather marry Arnold than share the throne of any monarch on earth.  This was great devotion in [word obscured].

	I have been disappointed in the trip north.  My professional duties are such that I cannot leave home at all without loss, and inconvenience.  You must make haste & be admitted to the Bar in order to relieve me.

	I go to Columbia this week to attend the court of appeals & will be there eight or ten days.  The Board of Trustees of the South Carolina College meet the first week in May, and we shall then have a report as to the Rebellion.

	Twenty or thirty persons are to be baptized today in threw Baptist church�some of them only twelve years old.  Mary, Betty & Oscar Mauldin all join today.  The Methodist too had a great revival & numbers have joined.  The Presbyterians also but the poor Episcopalians have�yet from the religious excitement.  Mr. Arthur said to me at Beatties the other night that religious revivals always followed money [page torn].  I suppose on the principle that trouble always begets reflection & disappointment in this world induced a hope of success in the next.  Men are apt too to repent when misfortune overtakes them.

	I was glad to hear all about your messmates.  I hope they are all clever young men.  Cultivate friendship, kindness and affection , my son, with all your associates.  There is more pleasure & happiness 
In being kind than spiteful & cold.  Never make an enemy if you can possibly avoid it.  I have suffered much in life by not obeying this maxim.

	We heard from Frank yesterday.  He says he is doing well & complains that you do not write to him very often.  

	Mr. Everett has been winning golden opinions in Charleston & Columbia by his eloquent orations on Washington and Charity.  I hope his visit will do good.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I came down here yesterday evening to attend the Court of Appeals & may have to remain here eight or ten days.

	General Thompson came down with me to deliver a Lecture on Mexico.  He asked a good deal about you and how you were getting on at the Naval Academy.

	I saw George Wells here yesterday.  He is very much pleased with the Citadel and is doing well�was dressed up in his uniform.  Perry was with him who used to go to school at Greenville.  I have not seen Dyer yet or Westmoreland who are both from Greenville.  

 	Edward Buist called to see me this morning.  He did not join in the late rebellion and says he has learnt wisdom by experience.  The college is doing very well now.  I saw the President Judge Longstreet this morning.  The Board of Trustees meet on Wednesday.

	If I have time I may come on & see you before I return to Greenville.  I hope you will study hard & get no demerits this month.  We did not receive a letter from you the day before I left home.  But I suppose it was rece[ive]d Saturday.

	They were all getting better at home.  Anna is thought to be out of danger.  Arthur & Hext had had something like scarlet fever & were getting well.

	I have nothing further to write you & must close by subscribing myself your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

	I Have just taken dinner & smoked a cigar, & will now write you a letter.

	I did no go to church this morning, but spent the day very pleasantly in conversation with Mr. Woodward, formerly a member of Congress, General Thompson, Col. Summer, Col. Owens & Col. W.C. Preston & Judge Longstreet for a short time.  I may not have spent the day piously as if I had gone to church, but certainly more agreeably.

	I saw Mr. Janney & his daughter last night & they and all the�, & my friends made a great [many] inquiries about Anna�s health.  Tell her she ought to feel kind[ly] toward everybody when all manifest so much interest in her.  Mr. Janney promised to send out to get some strawberries for her  today.  If he succeeds, I will send them up in the morning by the conductor Mr. Isaacs.  Mr. Janney offered some preserved peaches, & I see oranges & bananas & will send some in the morning.

	

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are both in Baltimore.  I suppose they will be at home before I leave here.  General Thompson & Miss Jones came down with me.  We met on the cars Mr. B� �on his way to the Governors.  We had a pleasant time & reached here half after two oclock.

	Young Buist came to see me this morning & said he had learnt wisdom by experience.  He had nothing to do in the rebellion.  Young Moore and Knotts & Whitner are here applying for admission to the Bar.

	In conversation this morning Woodward & Summer said I looked & my appearance & face & person reminded them of Col. Benton, and Woodward then added that he did not wish to flatter me, but that Col. Benton was the finest�& most imposing man in his appearance he had ever met.  I relate their compliments for your gratification, knowing how much you value such thinks.

	I was leased with Judge Longstreet.  But he is extremely ugly.  He said he was always, when a boy, said to be the ugliest fellow in the world, and General Thompson replied he had held his own remarkably well.  He & Thompson were old acquaintances.
	
	As we came down we met the longest train I ever saw on the Greenville Road going up filled with the�holders & their wives & daughters.  There are no ladies here now except one or two.

	Col Pickens was disappointed in sailing for Europe and has returned home, but will go back to New York shortly.  Governor Allston will be here in the morning.  General Quitman Keitt & Bonham tomorrow evening.  Col. Watts enquired kindly after you & Anna.  The Judges did not come down yesterday & I suppose we shall have no court tomorrow.  If I had known this I might have staid at home till Monday morning.

	I hope you & the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  I hope Anna is still improving & that Arthur & Hext are well.  The weather is very hot today.  

	I will write to Willie & Frank this evening.  I will send you the �Greyson Letters� a pretty book which I purchased yesterday full of humor & wisdom.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few minutes, to write you a reply.

	I have bought two dozen oranges & a dozen bananas to send by Wells in the morning.  Janney is to get me the strawberries this evening.

	There is a great crowd here now.  They have come to see & hear General Quitman tomorrow.  Robinson & his wife from Fairfield are here.

	I shall be detained longer in court than I expected.  Nothing was done today in my cases.  I hope to try one tomorrow.

	I was glad to hear Anna was getting better, that Hext was well & Arthur better.

	I will get the caps as you requested.  I have bought for myself a frock coat $18, pants $6.00, hat $5 & gloves &�$2.00.  The coat is a very nice one indeed & fits well.

	I am sorry for poor Dr. Stone & will attend to his business.  I am glad to hear he has sent a prospect ahead of him.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are expected to return Friday evening with Miss Graham & Tulula.

	General Thompson delivers his lecture this evening & I suppose I shall have to go & hear him.

	Col. Preston called with his carriage yesterday evening to take Miss Jones & General Thompson to ride & wished me to go with him, but I declined.  Maybe Col. Preston & Miss Jones may make a match.  The old man looks pretty well.

	Col. John Preston has gone to Europe & old Mrs. Hampton went with him to remain several years, & she is over eighty years old.

	I think you have scolded Frank enough.  Write him encouraging letters.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Martin which I have to answer this evening.

	In the next room there seems to be any number of children squalling & they annoy me.  I changed my room yesterday on account of the sun.  But the children are worse than the sun.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your very short letter, but you say you will write longer ones after hearing from me.  I wrote you a long letter Sunday & another yesterday. 

	I have done nothing today.  The Courts did not sit, but the Judges went to hear General Quitmans speech.  Having nothing else to do I went too, and was much interested in it.  There was an immense convocation of persons�several thousand.  The College Hall which is an immense building  was very crowded with ladies.  Being a Trustee of the College a seat was provided for me.  I took General Thompson with me.  Miss Jones went early with Col. Preston.

	Yesterday evening at the supper table I was surprised by your uncle Col. Hayne coming up & speaking to me.  I did not know of his arrival.  He took a seat with me & had a great deal of chat.  This morning he informed me that he too was to make a speech at the Quitman exhibition as the only surviving aid of General Jackson.  He did speak for some time after Quitman had got through about Jackson & the Battle of New Orleans.  The old gentleman is looking very well & is as full of fire &�as ever.  I thought whilst speaking that he would shake himself to pieces.

	General Thompson goes up in the morning & Jann[e]y has got me some strawberries which I will send up by him.

       This morning at the breakfast table a lady spoke to me holding out her hand & said she was Mrs. Anderson.  It was some time before I could tell who Mrs. Anderson was.  But in the course of the conversation I found out she was a Miss Kincade.  We sat together at dinner today & had a great deal of talk.  She has a little son with her who had been in the military Academy.  She enquired about Frank & how he liked the school.  She wishes to send her little son there.
       
       I am not writing to you amidst great confusion on one side of me the babies are squalling & on the other General McGowan & Col. Owens & others are most�over their wine.  
       
       I shall be here till next week some time
       
       I saw Col. Keitt & general Bonham this morning.  They enquired kindly after you & Anna.  Keitt is looking very well.  I did not ask him about Miss Sparks.  I was afraid it was a sore subject.
       
       Your uncle Arthur returns tomorrow.  Col. Memminger & Mr. Petigru will be here tomorrow.
       
       It is now so dark that I must quit.  I hope you & the children are all getting on well.  I am anxious to see you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & will write you a few lines before going down to the Board of Trustees.

	I was invited to dine with General Quitman today at Dr. Greens where he is staying, but declined the invitation.  I could not get back in time to attend the meeting of the Board of Trustees & I do not like General Quitmans political character & have written freely about him.  It will be a great dinner.  The Ball last night was a grand affair.  But I did not attend that & therefore thought it better not to accept Dr. Greens invitation.  The Governor insisted on my going & offered me a seat in his carriage.

	General Thompson went up this morning & I sent a jar of strawberries.  Miss Jones did not go to the Ball.  I saw her this morning as she was starting home.  She showed me my Jar of strawberries & asked me to look what a nice present she was carrying home to her sister.  I told [her] they were mine & I was sending them by the General to Anna.  She then promised to see that they went safely.  General Thompson had also purchased some & she supposed mine was his.

	This evening Elford & Town[e]s came down & Willie Beattie.  Elford tells me they have located the Baptist Theological Seminary at Greenville & seems much delighted at it.

	I have done nothing today.  The students were examined & all were admitted.  Moore & Knotts amongst them & Whitner &c.

	I will send up in the morning some apples & jelly if I can get them for Anna.  

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Hold� this evening about his Anderson business & wishes me to write a letter to Sam[ue]l Earle forbidding him to pay out the money.

	I am tired of waiting for my law cases & it may be the last of next week before I can return home.  But some good luck may hasten the hearing of the cases.

  	The babies & their young mothers & nurses have all gone & there is now no noise or crying to disturb me.

	I am glad to hear Anna is improving & that Hext & Arthur are so much better.  I am sorry Anna does not like the Book.  It is said to be a very fine one.

	I will enquire about the books you mention.  I have bought several books.  The Bench & Bar of Georgia�the autobiography of Goethe & his Sorrows of Wert[h]er�H� life by his son.

	I hope McCullough paid the money to Col. Hoke & that Ware paid him also.

	I told Col. Owens General McGowan what I Had written to you yesterday & they told me I must write today that they were still & silent.

	Col. Carn is here & is killing himself drinking I am afraid.  His young wife has not made him as happy as his brandy.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have done well today.  The Court of Errors sat & the case of Tate & McCallister was argued.  After dinner I went to the college & the Board dispatched all their business.

	Memminger & Petigru came up last night.  As I came from the college this evening Tom Long came up & spoke to me very cordially.  He & Hawthorn & their wives are here.  I bowed to them at the supper table as they passed by me & I promised�to call up & see them.

	I did not go down to the college tonight to hear the boys speak as I am very sleepy & will go to bed.  There are no bow� at this time in Columbia.  I hope you have rece[ive]d the strawberries &�jelly & apples.

	I am glad to hear that Col. Ware has paid some money.  This will help.  I wish McCullough had paid that would have helped more.

	I have worked hard today all day & dined with Governor Allston, & now I am really tired & will go to bed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	After writing you a short letter last night I felt so bad that I went to bed.  I felt sleepy, & thought I could sleep off my unpleasant feelings, but I soon found that there was an increased commotion which would defy sleep.  The ice water, green peas & fruits which I have been eating have affected my bowels & I spent a very unpleasant night.  I am somewhat better today, but was unable to examine the Equity students.  This morning I am unable to go down to the college exhibition tonight.  Mr. Petigru says Judge Longstreet regretted very much my absence last night.

	We heard this morning the melancholy intelligence of Judge Evans� death.  He was perfectly well & in the Senate yesterday, & died at ten oclock in the night.  This is a sad death.  I had great regard for the Judge & most sincerely mourn his loss.  He was one the best, wisest & most exemplary men I ever knew.  He died of a disease of the heart.  You will perhaps see his death notice in the mornings papers.  The Bar have a meeting in the morning.

       I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  Tell Hext I have bought him a nice drum which he can beat loud & long.  I enquired for your Books but they were not to be had.  The Book seller said he would�& get some of them.  I have got the promise of some remarkable strawberries next Tuesday.  I hope to return home Wednesday.  If so I can carry the strawberries up.  You must save all your cream & we will have a nice supper.
       
       Col. Herndon, Fair, Dawkins & Thompson are all here now & they enquired after you & Anna.  Herndon said he had intended sending his daughter to Burlington till he heard of Annas sickness.
       
       I bought a check today for $414.00 & sent Southworth which is all that I owe him for the Heirs of D�barn. 
       
       I have bought a most beautiful & interesting work of humor & fun & pictures �the  Cyclopedia of humor� in three volumes which I will send up for the enjoyment of you Anna & Fannie, but take special care of it.  It contains five or six hundred pictures.  The children & servants will view it if they are allowed to look at it.
       
       Dr. LeConte did not return this evening.  They are expected tomorrow evening.  I will give your letter to Miss Graham & invite her the last of the month if you wish.
       
       I have not yet purchased any groceries.  But will do so before leaving.
       
       Long & Hawthorn & their wives left here this morning without my seeing them.
       
       I am very anxious to return home.  Nothing was done today with my cases.  Tomorrow one of them is to be argued.  Two will remain for next week.
       
       I must now conclude.  Col. Dawkins came to me this evening & suggested that I should accept the temporary appointment of U[nited] States Senator till the meeting of the Legislature.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	When I wrote you last letter Friday night, I thought my attack of diar[r]hea was over, when in fact it had just commenced.  I did not sleep one moment that night.  Mr. Janney gave me�brandy &�but they had no effect in stopping the disease.  I was up & down every twenty minutes all night & finally concluded I Had an attack of cholera.  Just before day I sent for Dr. Fair.  He came & administered the pills composed of laudanum�&calomel &c.  After taking four at intervals of twenty minutes, the disease was checked.  But I was left prostrate�not able to attend the Bar meeting or to my case before Chancellor Dargan.  I remained in bed all yesterday till night.  Mr. Janney was very kind and attentive to me.  So was Col. Memminger, Mr. Elford & Col. Herndon.  I have been down to breakfast & feel well but rather weak.  I shall endeavour to return home as soon as possible.  I hope to get through my business on Tuesday.

	Dr. LeConte returned with his wife & Tulula Saturday morning but Miss Graham did not come with them.  I saw Talula at the breakfast at table this morning.  She looks pale & I think her health is not good.  She seems dull spirited, but enquired kindly after Anna.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte yet.  She is very much affected by her journey.

	This morning Nat Heyward came up & spoke to me & enquired after you & your mother & family.  I did not know him till he told me his name.  He is becoming gray.

	Dr. LeConte came to me room to see me soon after he returned hearing that I was sick.  

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday evening & the one you sent from Willie.  I suppose I had better send him a check for one hundred dollars.  I intended sending you some money in my last letter but forgot it.  I will enclose ten dollars in this letter.  	

	This is Sunday but I shall not venture out to church.  I hope to be able to go into court tomorrow & go on with my business.  I have been eating green peas & drinking ice water.

	Dr. Fair has just been to see me again & says I am well, but may have to take magnesium tomorrow to gently open my bowels.  He seems very skilful[l] & I like him very much.

	My friend Janney is most devoted, & I must tell you of his extreme appreciation of me.  As soon as he heard of the death of Judge Evans he went to Petigru, to get him to use his influence with Governor Allston to have me appointed to fill the vacancy.  He says Petigru approved heartily but said he could not approach Allston on the subject.  He then spoke to Chancellor Johnston, who also favored his�.  But the Governor left here determined not to make any appointment.  He is an aspirant himself to the position.

	Mr. Janney has just been up to see me again.  His daughters have something to seen Anna when I go up.

	It is now after ten oclock.  I wrote you this morning a long letter.  Before going to bed I will add a line or two.  

	First let me tell you what I have heard in reference to your uncle Arthur.  He is to receive the appointment of U[nited] States Senator to fill out the present term till the meeting of the Legislature.  Governor Allston said if he had the appointment at all he should appoint Col. A.P. Hayne. This will be very grateful to your uncles vanity & ambition but I do not think he will be acceptable to the people at large.

	  I saw Mrs. LeConte at the dinner table & also at the supper table.  I gave your letter to Miss Graham to her to send on.

	Whilst at the dinner table I saw a fine looking naval officer in undress military uniform come up & take his seat with a lady near to me.  I looked at the lady & thought her face was familiar.  The officer was a stout fine looking red faced man with quite a military air.  They got through dinner before Dr. LeConte & Col. Memminger & myself, with Mrs. LeConte & children all seated at the same table.  When they had gone Mrs. LeConte said I will tell you a piece of history about that lady.  She married when very young, an old man for his money & who was very jealous of her.  He died & left her sixty thousand dollars as long as she remained a widow.  But on her second marriage it all went to his children.  She has now married that captain in the navy & given up her fortune.  He looks like he drank.  Her first husband was Seager of Mobile.  She is granddaughter of Dr. Fair.  This explained my remembrance of the Ladys face.  On looking at the Register I see his name is Dur� & a Lieutenant in the navy.  I rather think Mrs. Seager has made a bad bargain.  I would not give sixty thousand dollars for Lieutenant Dur....  But he is fine looking, about thirty years old & Mrs. Seager may think she has made a good trade.  Perhaps she has if he is as good as he looks.    She has got a husband to take care of her & & is no longer troubled with the money.

	I have told you all the news & will conclude & go to bed.

	I feel quite well & will be able to go into court tomorrow.    I enclosed ten dollars in my letter to you this morning.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Sunday & was distressed to hear of your accident in riding out.  It is really fortunate that you & Anna were not seriously injured.  I cannot imagine how such a thing should occur.

	I was grieved too that you had not rece[ive]d my letters.  I have been very sick, but am pretty well now.  But I am afraid to remain here much longer lest the disease returns.

	I will endeavour to send you something by Wells in the morning.  I hope you get my letter enclosing ten dollars.

	I hope to get through with my cases tomorrow.  I have gained the great case in the court of Errors.

	I sent Willie a check for one hundred dollars this evening.

	Nothing was done in Court today in consequence of the death of Judge Evans.

	I suppose your uncle Arthur will be appointed by the Governor but the appointment will give great disappointment.

	I must now stop write letters in answer to those you sent me.

	We are all well except & she is improving.  Fanny spent yesterday at Mr. Clevelands with Miss Mary your little sweetheart.  Hext has gone this morning to the Sunday school.  Hayne & Arthur are running about the yard.

	Your mother has written you that we have sold Wiley.  John has taken his place in the stables & does very well.  He will make, & does now, make a good hustler�drives well.  We do not miss Wiley at all.  I sold him for $1200.  He is with his wife.

	The Greenville Cars yesterday evening ran over a poor drunken man & killed him.  He was lying in the track & the Engineer did not see him in time to stop the cars.

	I am glad to hear you are safe.  But don�t be too certain & relax in your studies.  Study hard all the time.  You don�t know my dear Son how much pleasure it gives me to hear of your success in your studies.  You ought to study hard for the gratification of your Father & Mother.

	You must write me when you expect to start on your voiage & the places you expect to visit.

	We are all well except Anna & she is improving very fast.

	Your mother will write you all the news in her next letter.

	Lula LeConte is to be with us next week to stay with Anna some days.  The father & mother will come up the week after on their way to Flat Rock.

	If you go to Europe you must write us whenever you can & let us hear all about your voiage.

	Our House is finished & looks pretty.  We have got a room filled up for you when you return next summer.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Did you receive the draft for $50 I sent you two weeks ago.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Susan who said last evening that she would go this morning in the carriage with Peter.

	We are all pretty well.  I have been very much affected with headache & cold.  Willie has a terrible rising on his face, which he broke & has disappeared.  Hayne has bites & sores on his feet which prevent his going to school.  Hext is quite well & Arthur is very well except he frets at night.

	The Servants are all well & doing well.  I have had no trouble with them.  Clara seems a good housekeeper, & performs her part well.  John attends to the horses finely & at dinner waits on the table.

	Your mother has bought a fine large horse of Prince, which I she will feed well & take good care of will be as good a horse as Fern�price $172.00.  The Pony is getting mischievous.  He ran off from Willie yesterday evening & kicked him with both feet but did not hurt him.

       Judge Magrath, Col. Orr, Col. Keitt, Mr. Conner, Dr. Hamilton are here now, & Judge Wardlaw, Mr. Porter, Mr. Mitchell & other lawyers will be here this evening.  The Federal Court opened & adjourned yesterday.
       
       I want to see you at home again.  Home is rather a lonesome place without a wife & I don�t wonder at all of the gentlemen getting married again who loose their wives.
       
       I hope Anna has improved & enjoys the climate & fare at Thomas�.  I am sure Fanny & Annie & Vardry have enjoyed the visit.  I hope you have.
       
       There are no peaches, & the watermellons are so trifling that I do not think they are worth sending to you.  Clara is making some things to send to you in the way of�
       
       A Box came from Eliza Hayne & a letter to you.  Last week Mrs. Stokes brought some peaches but they were not very fine.
       
       I shall be very busy tomorrow & the remainder of the week.  I have finished paying for Alfred & have taken Gowens note & Hil[l]houses.  This is about all I have done in the way of business.
       
       The weather has been warm, but this morning it is cool & pleasant & I have been sneezing again�I do not like.
       
       The children have done well.  Mrs. Hoke offered to do anything she could for them.  Willie has been invited to Mrs. Mauldins & Hokes to tea, but his swollen face prevented his going.
       
       I shall be glad to take a little holiday next week & make my escape from the court, leaving you in charge of the House & children.  Give my love to �, Fanny & Annie & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letter Friday evening, & were glad to hear you arrived safely at Cambridge.  Your mother has requested me to write you today, which is Sunday & say that she will write you again next week.

	I am sorry Edward Stokes did not enter college but am glad he is to remain, & tell him he is pursuing the proper course.  Let him prepare himself for one of the classes & then enter college.

	We heard of you in New York through Mary Mauldins letter.  Elford returned last Thursday, but I have not seen him.  Mary Mauldin came to see Anna yesterday morning but she & her mother had�out.

	General Thompson enquired about you last week & asked me if you were not promising.  I told him I was afraid you were wanting in ambition.  He told me to say to you that you owed it as a sacred duty to your father, who had done so much for you, to be ambitious, have energy & distinguish yourself in life.  I said likewise that I must appeal to your sense of duty to me & your mother to be studious, energetic & prudent.  I hope my dear son you will consider his good advice & follow it.

	It was my great misfortune not to receive a finished education & I have felt it through life.  You will have such an education & be indebted to the hard labors of your father for it.  You must therefore improve it.  General Thompson said no young man in the State would have a better opportunity of doing well than yourself�That you would fall heir to my professional business & clients & that you must have energy & perseverance & industry to retain them.

	The General also said to me that it was a waste of time novels & the trashy literature of the times�That it was injurious to the mind, & gave you a distaste to solid substantial learning.

	You must try to improve yourself in every letter that you write & in every piece of composition you make.  You must learn to speak in your societies & debating clubs.  Study well your subject & tell it as you can.  Anyone who can talk may learn to make speeches.

	I hope to receive soon your standing in your class & college.  Send it to me as soon as you can.

	I have no news to write you.  We are all as usual.  Anna about the same.  Hext has had sores on his feet which has prevented his going to school for a week past.  Fannie had the other night a similiar attack to the one you had here, but is now well.  The little girls had a fair in which she took great interest and they made upwards of one hundred dollars for the Sunday school.

	My circuit will soon commence & I am very busy in my office.  William Jacobs� negroes have all been indicted for stealing, breaking open his sons house & I am defending them before Donaldson & five freeholders.  The trial will take several days.  The old mans sons are all turning out badly & worrying him to death.  He has worked hard all his life for his children & made a fortune for them.  His sons are all drunkards & worthless.  What a misfortune?  Two of them have married strumpets�one shot himself & committed suicide�another ran off & has never been heard of�a fourth is worthless & harassing his father.

	My dear son let me conclude by instructing you to be good, keep out of bad company, have energy & determine to make yourself a name in the world.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night which filled the household with joy at your safe return to the U[nited] States after a long absence on the wide ocean.

	You must [write] a full account of your voiage & tell us all you saw &c.

	Your mother wrote you at Cherburgh, but I suppose you did not receive her letter.  I was in hopes you would be at that Port whilst Queen Victoria & the European Louis Napoleon were there.

	We are all pretty well.  Anna is a great deal better.  Fannie has grown very much.  Hext & Hayne are going to Miss Powells school.  Arthur is beginning to talk.  Your mother enjoys good health.  I am quite well.    The servants are all well except Becka & Charles who are complaining.  The Horses are all fat & sleek.  We have two little deer in the yard again & they are great pets.

	All your acquaintances enquire about you & are anxious to see you.  Willie was with us four or five weeks this summer.  We heard from him last night.  He is now in the Senior class & is doing well.

	I hope dear Frank you will now turn over a new leaf & study hard, study all the time�git your lessons so that you will not miss one word.

	I am almost sorry that Bradford has been restored for Col Orr tells me his Report was that he would not study himself or let others study.  He said this accounted for your bad standing in your class.  You must not let idle boys interfere with your studies.

	Col. Orr told one of the visitors of the naval Academy to notice his little pet Frank Perry & report how he stood in his class.  He felt mortified when the Visitor returned to Washington & reported you deficient in your studies.

	I would not have you reported deficient again for any consideration.  I intend to visit you this Fall or Winter certainly & shall expect to find you much improved, grown & studying hard and behaving well.

	Your mother will write you all the news.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We have not heard from you, except through Mr. Miller, since your arrival at Annapolis.  He wrote very flatteringly of you, said you had improved, was spoken of in high terms by the officers of the Preble and that you were not going to study hard & not be so lowdown as you were last term.  You must have pride & ambition to study hard &study all the time.  Now that you have go over your old studies you ought to stand no. 1 in your class.

	You must write me all about your cruise & sea life, what you saw and what you did on board the vessel.  Also write me all about your classmates & the new cadets.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Col. Alexander Taylor enquired about you very particularly last Sunday.  He & his family are here now.  His two youngest sons whom you saw at Cashiers Valley are fine little boys, manly & well behaved.

	We are all well except Anna.  She has fever & is taking blue pill.  Dr. Earle has put a blister on her which gives her great pain.

	I was employed last week to defend a young man only nineteen years old named John Fowler for killing Felix Rodgers below McBees Factory.  He struck him with his gun.  Rodgers was drunk & rushed on him with a rock.

	We have today an Egree� gale & the weather is very bad.  You got back in good time.  It would be terrible weather at sea.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you this week at Annapolis.  It was well written & gave us great pleasure.  But we are sorry to learn that the applicants from South Carolina are rejected.  The rejection of Pearson must have mortified Col. Boyce for the Col. married a Pearson.

	I hope my dear son you will do �your post� as you promise in your letter towards upholding the character of your state at the naval Academy.  But to do this you must study harder than you did last year & behave better.    Who is your roommate.  A great deal depends on him.  You are such a good natured social fellow that you are easily lead estray by your companions.

	You must write me all about your studies & the school.  I am glad you spoke to Col. Boyce & told him you heard his speech at Greenville.  You must write us good letters & give us an account of your sea voyage as your mother sends your letters to her friends to read.
	  	
	James Moore who graduated here when Willie did, has been admitted to the Bar & is going to make a speech with me in a murder case.  John Fowler killed Felix Rodgers below McBees Mill & paper factory.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is not so well as she was.  Dr. Earle is again visiting her.  Hext has a nice little puppy which amuses him very much.  Hayne goes to school & came the other day for ten cents to buy a copybook.  He is going to learn to write before he spells.

	The Furman University does not seem to do as well as it did last year.  Mr. Furman has quit it.  There are not more than half as many students as they had last year.

	You must remember me to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  We were pleased with your pictures of Cheerburgh & Cadiz which were rece[ive]d the other night.

	There is great electioneering going on in Greenville now.  Pinckney Dill is opposing Bob M� for ordinary, McDade & Runnion are for tax collector. Ashmore & Vernon for Congress.  Col. Jones has withdrawn.  The election takes place next Monday tomorrow week.  I suppose Stokes, Campbell, Easly & myself will be elected to the Legislature.  But I have done nothing to secure my election.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

	We received a letter from you Thursday evening & were pleased to hear of your good resolutions not to get demerits & to study hard.

	I see your roommate was turned back & that is a bad sign.  I wish you were with someone who is a hard student & steady.  Do my dear son take an interest in your studies & have pride and ambition enough to behave yourself well & recite your lessons well.

	I shall be glad to see your roommate return with you next June & spend some time with you.  I hope he is a clever fellow, has good principles & studious habits.

	I have been very busy this week & start to Anderson Court in the morning.  My Professional business is increasing & I want Willie at home now to help me write.  You write so good a hand I wish I had you in my office.  But your destiny must be the wide ocean.

	I have no doubt it is a pretty hard life at sea, but then when you get to Port you have great satisfaction in seeing the different cities of the world.

	Anna is better than she was a few days since.  Arthur has a cold & bad cough.  Hext has a swollen cheek & toothache.  Becky & Charles are still invalids.  Alfred too is unwell this morning.  Your grandmother & Susans families are all well.

	The election takes place tomorrow & there is considerable excitement.  The friends of Vernon have got their ticket printed with a tadpole on it.  Ashmore said the bone & sinew of the country would support him but �the tadpole aristocracy� might vote for Vernon.

	In haste your affectionate father.  Be a good boy & study hard.  B.F. Perry

       I write you in great haste as I am preparing to start to Pickens Court.  Your mother has given you an account of the elections.  
       
       Anna is much better & improving fast.  If she gets no back sett this winter I hope she will be well by spring.    
       
       I shall go on to see you this winter.  Col. Orr remains in Congress till next March, so you will see him in Washington if you go there.  But Col. Arthur Hayne will not be returned to the Senate this winter. 
       
       I am pleased to hear you have grown so much.  I shall expect to see you almost a man in size and quite a man in manners behaviour & intelligence.  I take a great pride in you & Willie & you both ought to be ambitious and do well on my account as well as on your own.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We rece[ive]d your letter as usual Friday evening.  I returned from Pickens Court the evening before.  Hext went with me & was very much pleased.  He bought himself a pretty knife & is delighted with it.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is not so well as she was last week & I am very busy preparing my cases, so I have no time to write you a long letter.

	You must study hard & behave yourself well so as to stand high in your class.  You ought to stand first as you are going over the same studies you pursued last year.  Do my son strive hard to avoid demerits & get a high stand in your class.

	We did not hear from Willie last week.  But rece[ive]d a catalogue from him.  He is doing very well & has a pretty good standing in his class of one hundred & twenty five.

	Everybody enquires after you & ask[s] how you are getting on & how you like the naval school.  I am sorry there are so few South Carolinians in the school.  Why is it?  Can they not enter?  Or do they not apply?

	We recei[ve]d a letter from you last night to Anna & were glad to hear you were well & doing well.  But you say you do not like the Seas much.  I am sorry to hear you say so, as your destiny is on them.  I hope you will like them better as you see more of them.

	Anna is still feeble & weak.  She & your mother think of going to Aiken to spend the winter & leave me at home to take care of the children.  But I shall endeavour to go on & see you this winter.

	I saw Col. Orr last week & told him you were going to pay him a visit about Christmas.  He said he would be very glad indeed to see you & enquired a great deal about you.  On his account you must study hard & make rapid progress in your studies.  He enquires about you when he sees anyone in Washington from the naval Academy.

	I shall see your Report in a few days & hope it will be a good one.  Poor George Wells has studied so hard in the Military school in Columbia that he has had to leave on account of his health.  But will return as soon as his health is regained.

	James Moore who was in the Furman University made a speech in defence of John Fowler with me & did very well.  He will one day make a good lawyer & a man of distinction.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Your Mother, Anna & myself arrived here yesterday.  Anna stood the fatigues of the journey pretty well, & seems better.  As soon as I get through with my appeal cases in court I will go on with them to Aiken, & return.  The Legislature & the Court of Appeals both meet tomorrow.  I have never seen so many candidates before the Legislature.  They annoy me very much.

	We left the children with your Aunt Susan & I hope they will do well.  We received a letter from you the night before leaving home & were glad to hear you were well & doing well.  If you only knew the anxiety your mother & I felt about you & your success in the naval school I am sure you would study hard & behave well on account of the love you have for us.  It is a matter of the greatest importance to you in after life to pursue your studies now with zeal & energy.

	Edward Buist has taken the first honor in the South Carolina College.  This he did by hard study & industry & good behavior.  His talents are inferior to several in the Class.

	You must write to me in Columbia for the next four weeks.  I shall go on & see you the latter part of December.  I am very anxious to see you again.  It semes a great while since I saw you.  How much pleasure we shall all have in your returning to Greenville next June.  Your affectionate Father, B,F, Perry

	We did not receive any letter from you last week.  You must direct your letters to Columbia S.C.

	Your Mother & Anna are still with me & I do not know whether they will go to Aiken or not.  Anna is very feeble but cheerful though reduced to a skeleton.  We called in Drs Fair & Tresvant.  They give us very little hope of her recovery.  This causes us great distress.  And you must be a good Boy & give us consolation in our distress.

	I rece[ive]d a letter last week from the Revd Edmund Dawse of Sherborn Massachusetts in reply to one I write the Post Master of Sherborn enquiring about my Fathers family there.  He gave me the history of the Perry family from 1679 almost two hundred years ago.  He says his grandmother & my Father were brother & sister.  He had my grand Fathers family Bible before him in which all the births & deaths were recorded.  My grand Father Moses Perry was twice married & dad sixteen children.  This letter has given me great pleasure.

	George Wells has taken the first honor in his Class again, but is in very feeble health.  Dyers son is doing well & stands high in his Class.  I hope you will be stimulated by their example & keep up the reputation of Greenville.

	I have not heard from Willie since I came to Columbia.  

	We had two ballottings yesterday for U[nited] States Senator, & the contest seems to be between Governor Adams & Col. Memminger.  But Rhett, Chesnut, McQueen & Manning are running.

	The College Boys are doing well & are all quiet.

	Anna is still in the same feeble condition, but she thinks she is better.  She eats & does not throw up her food as she did a week since.  She & your mother will remain here till Wednesday or Thursday & then go to Aiken or return to Greenville.

	We heard from the children yesterday.  They were all well & doing well.

	Your mother purchased some handkerchiefs for you & will have your shirts made.  I still hope to be able to go on, & see you the latter part of this month.  But it is somewhat doubtful.  Your mother has written to Captain Blake to let you visit Washington Christmas.  If I can I will be there about that time.

	Col. Chesnut has been elected Senator in the place of Judge Evans.  He is a friend of mine & if you go to Washington you must call & see him & General Hammond & Col. Orr & General Bonham.

	We returned home last night with Anna.  She stood the trip better than we expected & seems pretty well today.  She rested well last night.  We are all well except Alfred.  The children are all as hearty as little pigs.  Poor old Charles is dead.  He had been sick such a long time at Mr. Deans.  Mrs. Thomas Roberts died last week.   

	I wish to see you very much, but I am not afraid I shall not be able to go on to Annapolis this winter.

	I am glad you are getting higher in your studies, but sorry to see so many demerits the last month.  Try & behave well & study hard.

	I am glad you are well of your cough.  You must be careful not to catch cold in going from a warm room out into the cold air.

	We are all well except Ann.  She is very feeble, but coughs less than she did.  She says she feels badly & has a very soar throat.  

	Your grandmother Susan & Ann took their Christmas dinner with us yesterday.  They are all well & talked a great deal about you & Willie.

	I have just written to Willie to call & see you as he comes home.  Your mother says you must send by Willie the things you bought in Europe & your old clothes for the servants.  When Willie returns she will send you some sheets &c.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies.  Be good & studious.  The people of Greenville enquire very often how you are doing.  They feel an interest in you & you must be ambitious & rise in your class.  

	We have a cold wet, dull Christmas & nothing new to write you.  

	I think I mentioned to you that I had recei[ve]d a letter from our kinspeople in Sherborn, Massachusetts.  They say that the whole town is connected there with the Perrys & have invited me to go & see them.    Is there anyone in your Academy from that part of Massachusetts.

	We received no letters from you last week.  But saw your arrival announced in the Washington Review.  We also see by the same Paper that�compliments were paid the naval Students for their good behavior whilst in Washington whilst other students were playing the�.  This is very gratifying to your mother & me.

	I hope you got the $20 I sent you before you started to Washington.

	I am sorry Col. Orr was not in Washington whilst you were there.  I see from the newspapers that he was in New York at that time.  I hope you called to see the members of Congress from South Carolina.

	We look for a letter from you now with great interest to hear of your trip to Washington.

	Willie will start home 19th Wednesday & will call to see you about Friday 21st Inst.

My dear Son

	The fears expressed in my last letter to you have been realized, as you know by the letter of Mr. Gaillard.

	Poor Anna is dead & I have just returned with a broken heart from the funeral.  [Words obscured] was a beautiful one & I have just written an account of it for the Patriot and Mountaineer which you will see next week.  

	She said she loved all of her brothers & Sister, but you she loved more than any other.  She begged that you would be a good boy & remember & love her memory�that you would prepare to meet her in Heaven.  I hope my dear son that this advice will not be thrown away on you.

	She said you must send the presents intended for her, to her mother & that her mother must look at them & remember her.

	The village generally have manifested the greatest interest in her death.  The stores were all closed today as the funeral procession passed.  The day was very rainy & bad but still there was a great turnout of the villagers for her funeral.

	She manifested a willingness to die & Revd. Mr. Gaillard said she died as a true Christian.

	I have no heart my dear Son to write you a long letter.  I hope you may receive this before Willie passes you.  Tell him that Anna sent her love to him & said he must also prepare to meet her in Heaven.

	We are all well, though in greatest affliction bowed to the Earth.

	Truly your affectionate Father.  My obituary notice of Anna you will see much to interest you & I will not repeat it.  B.F. Perry

	We received your letter last week, but you had not then heard of the death of your dear sister.

	Yesterday Mr. Arthur preached her funeral & made a fine sermon on death.  He spoke of Anna in beautiful terms.

	Your mother is copying the Sermon & perhaps we may have it printed.

	Mr. Gaillard wrote a beautiful letter and Mr. Richard Freeman a sweet poem on Anna�s death which you will see in the Patriot of last week.

	I have received one of the best letters I ever read from Col. Memminger on Annas death.

	We are all in great affliction & almost broken hearted.  I hope her death may make us all Christians.  You must try & be religious & good prepare to meet Anna in heaven as she requested.

	We are expecting Willie home tonight.  I did not write you yesterday in consequence of Annas funeral.  

	We all wish to see you very much & I wish you could have come home with Willie.  But you must study hard & be punctual in your lessons.  Do not fall behind again in your class.

You my dear son must prepare yourself for heaven as well as for this world.  You must be a good boy & be a comfort to your Parents.  Behave well & study hard.  Prepare for your examination.  Have a high standing in your class.  

	Willie is with us.  When he returns your mother will send you a trunk full of clothes & presents.

	We are all very much obliged to you for your presents.  They are very pretty, but sad to look at, now that Anna is no more.

	We have rece[ive]d a great many kind letters in our affliction & I think of publishing them in a pamphlet as a mourning tribute to Anna�s memory.

	Do my son study hard & keep from being dismissed.  You ought to love your Parents & study for their sake.

	We are already broken hearted by the death of Anna, & if you come home in disgrace it will crush us to the Earth.

	Enclosed I send you the ten dollars you wish.  Do not spend it foolishly.  Your mother says she would like to have good likeness of you.  The one you sent is not.

	We are all well.  Willie is with us.  He will return about the first of March.  I will send by him for you to read the Life of Commodore Decatur, the beau ideal of a naval hero.

	Your mother recei[ve]d a letter from you last night, & we are very anxious to receive your next letter.  We hope [to] learn that you will not again prove deficient in your standing.

	Uncle Robert Foster died Saturday morning last in his eightieth year.  I have just written an obituary notice which you will see in the next Patriot.

	We are all well.  Willie will return the first of March.  I will send you by him a parcel of Books which you must read & take care of & return to me.  Your mother will send you some clothing &c.  I will send you my likeness in a frame as you desired in your last letter.

	It may be that Willie will have to send your trunk down to Annapolis, without stopping to see you, as he will be in company with Memminger & not have time tis topo to se you. 

	I hope my dear Son you will study hard & be a good boy.  Your sisters death has made a serious impression om all of us & I hope it will on you.  �Prepare to meet her in Heaven� as she requested.

	We have recei[ve]d a great many pretty letters from her friends which I am going to have printed in a pamphlet with her funeral Sermon & will send you one of them.

	Fannie goes every day to Anna�s grave & spreads flowers on it as she requested.  Her friends do so likewise.  She has been greatly mourned by the entire community.

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you last week, & your mother received one last night communicating the refreshing news, as to your �splendid examination�.  We are all delighted to know that you have done well & hope from henceforth that you will study hard & determine to graduate with honor.

	You have no idea my dear son of the importance now to be attached to your studies.  Your future happiness & honor depend on them.  Their neglect will make you a poor miserable wreck through life & perhaps a drunken blackguard.  On the other hand if you study hard & behave well you make such a man as Commodore Decatur or Lord nelson.

	I wish you also my son, to be good, honorable & religious.  Never do a mean thing or a dishonorable one.  Never tell a falsehood on any account.  Be kind & gentle and pray to your God to make you a good boy.    Never curse or use profane language.  Never touch spirits of any kind.  The great danger of a naval officer is intemperance.

	Col. Jones has got an appointment for his son Thomas at West Point.  I should hardly suppose he could enter the Military Academy, and if he does I am sure he will not stay there long, for it is said he is stupid & bad & will not study.

	Willie will leave here tomorrow week the 28th of February & will probably pass Annapolis 2nd (Wednesday) of march.  He will carry your trunk & send it down from the junction if he does not go by to see you.

	We are all well.  I am going to have all the letters received about Annas death printed with Mr. Arthurs sermon in a book & will send you a copy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letters last week & your drawings, and if you only knew the pleasure they gave your father & mother I am sure you would try to study hard & be a good boy.  Your examination was a good one & your drawings are fine.  I do think you ought to have been higher in drawing, or your fellow students have great talents in that line.  We were all delighted with your drawings.  Your improvement in your standing will make us more glad to see you in June.

	You must now determine to go on improving & take a high stand in your class.  Do not let other boys outstudy you & take off all the honors of your class.  Be as good as any of them, & show that that you have as much talent.  Keep up the honor of old South Carolina in the naval school and do honor to your family.  There is more pleasure & happiness in being well & good than in being ignorant & vicious.

	Willie left here yesterday morning & I suppose you have seen him or will before this letter reaches you.  He carried a trunk full of presents to you, and I am afraid they may direct your mind from your studies.

	We are all well but still in great affliction.  The death of Anna has been a severe bereavement to us, & to the whole community.  She is never out of my mind, and it seems I can never get over her death.  I would give worlds if I could restore her to life & see her once more.  But I hope my dear child we shall all prepare to meet her in Heaven as she requested.  The tears are now flowing so rapidly from my eyes that I must close my letter.

	We received two letters from you last night informing us that Willie had arrived in Annapolis.

	We were very sorry to hear that you had got 28 demerits last month.  If you go on in this way  you will soon get your 200 & be reported to the Secretary of the Navy.  Do my son try to get no more.  You say you have had bad luck.  It is bad conduct.  There is no luck about demerits.

	We were glad to hear that your standing in your studies was good.  But you must try & stand higher in your class.  Let your sole aim be to rise & stand at the head of your class.  A boy will never do anything without ambition to excel.

	I am glad to hear you intend writing to Thomas at Fairfield.  Open a correspondence with him & tell about his studies to be admitted.  He will thank you for it & be your friend when he goes on.

	I have no news to write you.  The Furman University & the Female college have opened well & have a large number of pupils.  

	We are all well.  Vardry has been deaf, but is getting better.  Susan & her children all took dinner with us today.  Your grandmother is better.

	I am constantly receiving letters from a cousin I have found out in Massachusetts.  He is a Preacher & a very intelligent & educated gentleman.

	Fannie is now going to school again.  Hext & Hayne are also going to school.  Arthur is grown a great deal & is very pretty & smart.  Fannie is very tall & almost a young lady.  You would hardly know her.

	We all look forward to seeing you in June with a great deal of pleasure.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We are all well.  I go to Anderson court in the morning & will be gone all the week.  I shall see Col. Orr & hear something about your visit to Washington.

	There have been several attempts to burn up Cox & Gowers carriage establishment & Hext has just come to tell me that they have caught the Incendiaries�Kirk Smith & Parker two of the workmen.  Smith is a boy & son of Chesney Smith.  He had been whipped by Cox for forging an order.

	We have ordered a beautiful monument for Annas grave from Philadelphia costing $400.  The iron railing cost $200 & is on the way.  Fannie goes almost every day & strews her grave with flowers.

My dear Son
	
	I received your letter written after your return to Harvard last night & was glad to learn that you had safely arrived in time to attend your recitations.

	You must have staid one day in New York.  Why did you not mention it.  I enquired of Col. Goodlett who left New York last Thursday�a week & he had not heard of you.  They all stopped at the Astor House & Boyles Crayton had his packet book stolen.  He took the precaution to out it under the head of his bed when he went to sleep & forgot to put it in his packet when hew dressed.  I do not understand how anyone can be so foolish as to do this without putting his packet book in his sack or pantaloons or vest.

	There was another attempt last Thursday night to burn up Cox & Gowers carriage establishment.  The incendiary shot at one of the watchmen Carson & missed him one inch only with an�ball.  Carson fired twice in return.  He then discovered the mess in the shop in a blaze.  Fire had been put in through a broken pane of glass.  Fortunately it did not spread & the lower part of town was aroused.

	I go in the morning to Anderson Court & will be there al the week I am afraid.

	We recei[ve]d a letter from Frank last night.  He said he was getting high averages in his class, had read the life of Decatur & was more in love with a naval life than before.

	I am pleased to hear my dear son your determination to try & gratify the wishes of your parents.  We have done much for you & love you dearly.  You must be good, honorable, religious, studious & ambitious to make for yourself a name & reputation.  You have had more advantages than most young men and more is expected of you.  

	Hext has just come to tell that there was another attempt to set fire last night to burn up Cox & Gowers shop & that Kirk Smith & Parker two of the workmen were detected & have been lodged in jail.  Smith is a boy & son of Che� Smith.  He had been whipped by Gower for forging an order.  I have not heard the cause of Parkers fiendish revenge.

	We have ordered a monument for poor Anna in Philadelphia which is exquisitely beautiful & will cost there $400.00.  The Iron railing for her grave has been forwarded on.

	Return day was yesterday.  We had a small return.

	Be careful of your health.  Do not catch cold.  Don�t go out of nights.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you & the Picture of the Preble ship this evening.  Your letter was very gratifying, & I hope you will determine to persevere in your studies.  Let Decatur & Perry whose lives you have been reading, be your models & try & imitate their virtues.

	I go in the morning to Pickens Court & am not writing to you in the dining or sitting room & your mother at my side.  The children have just gone upstairs to wash & go to bed.  They are making a terrible fuss in their ablutions.  

	I returned from Anderson Court Thursday evening.  We had bad weather & not a great deal of business.  One night after I had gone to bed at Anderson a musical band came & serenaded me & called for a speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  I had to get up & dress & make a short speech.

	We are all well & anxiously expecting the time when we may see you once more.  I am glad to hear you have grown so much.

	I must now close my letter & write one to Willie.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Our Court adjourned last night & Judge Whitner has ordered an Extra court if two weeks for Greenville on the 19th of July.  This will prevent my going north this summer unless I go in May.  But it will be the means of seeing more of you when you come home.

	We rece[ive]d your letter as usual last week.  We all looking forward with great pleasure to your visit in June.

	Your mother has just rece[ive]d some rings, chains and breast pins made out of the hair of your dear sister & intends a pin for you.  She has likewise had several likenesses of poor Anna taken to give her friends.

	My dear son you must study to be religious & wise [&] never do anything wrong.  

	Cox & Gower have got the Jail full of Incendiaries Oberly & wife, Parker, Smith, & Wisen� have been arrested.  Parker confesses that Oberly gave him three ten dollar Bills to burn up the Steam mill!  How horribly bad some men are!

	I received your very ac[c]eptable letter last night, and it was truly gratifying [to] your mother & myself to learn that you were coming on so well in your studies.  I always knew that if you would only study you could stand high in your class.  I hope you have now broken the ice, & will turn over a new leaf & be ambitious of distinction.

	In the course of two months your June examination will come on, & I shall then expect to see you stand well in your class.  This will make your visit to us more gratifying both to you & your parents.
	   
	I go to Laurens Court in the morning & have just returned from Spartanburg court.  This will end my circuit.  I expect to carry Hext & Hayne with me.

	   Fannie has been sick, but is well again.  Arthur is quite well.  Your mother has been a little unwell but is better.  Your grandmother is poorly.  Vardry is very deaf, & your aunt Susan has great fears about him.

	This is a delightful day but we have had cold weather lately & the fruit is somewhat injured by the frosts.

	We are all well.  Hext went with me to Laurens court & was unwell on his return but has recovered.  I was unfortunate at Laurens court & left my horse �Tim� sick there & do not expect he will ever get well again. 

	In relation to your clothes, you had better purchase a handsome uniform to wear when you go out , & wear your jacket uniform  in the cars & about the house.  You need no citizens clothes at all.  If you want any money to buy clothes I will send you some.  But dress all the time like a Midshipman.  In that way officers always travel.

Dear Sir [Charles Lanman]

	I have looked over portions of your Congressional Dictionary with some interest & ask leave to suggest one or two corrections.  I see you ask for such information.

	There were two William Butlers on Congress from South Carolina�one the Father & the other the brother of Judge Andrew P. Butler our late Senator.  You have jumbled them together.  General William Butler the father was a gallant Revolutionary officer, and served in Congress many years.  He was turned out of Congress by John C. Calhoun in 1811, he was before that turned out by Robert Goodloe Harper.

	Dr. William Butler the son of the General & brother of Senator Butler was in Congress in 1842.  He graduated at the South Carolina College in 1810 & married a sister of Commodore Oliver H. Perry.  For some time he was a surgeon in the U[nited] States Navy.

	In reference to William Smith you have again put two men together, both of whom were men of great ability.  William Smith of Charleston was in Congress immediately after the organization of the federal Government & took a very active part in all the debates.  He continued in Congress for a number of years.  He afterwards changed his name to William Lawton [Loughton] Smith, & was in Congress afterwards for several years.  He was beaten by Langdon Cheves.

	Judge William Smith was in the Senate, but never in the House.  He moved to Alabama, was appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States but declined the office.  There was another William Smith in Congress from the upper part of South Carolina about 1800 whom you do not mention.

	In speaking of Andrew Pickens you have again united Son & Father.  General Andrew Pickens who was in Congress in 1795 was never Governor of South Carolina.  His Son Andrew Pickens, the Father of the present Russian Minister Col. F.W. Pickens was Governor of South Carolina about 1818.

	I am with great respect yours &c., B.F. Perry

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & were glad to hear your good resolutions about getting no more demerits.  But what did the court of enquiry do with the boys who administered the tar & feathers.  They ought to be dismissed as well as the fellow tarred & feathered.

	  I am going to Columbia Tuesday & will carry with me Fannie & Annie.  They are delighted with the idea of going.

	We are all well, & all anxious for you to return home.  You will be treated with joy by everyone. And this should make you study hard & behave well.

	We had a frost this morning which I fear has done great injury to fruit, wheat &c.  The loss of peaches in the summer is a great depravation.  

	Your affectionate Father.  I am starting to church Sunday morning.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was so much fatigued last night after trotting over the town, trying to find some clothes to make myself appear decent that I was not able to write you. 

	Fannie has just finished a long letter to you & I suppose has told you all the news.  I may be telling you the same things over again.  There was a considerable crowd yesterday on the Rail Road; but today seven cars came laden with stockholders & their wives & children.  The Greenville folks yesterday  all went on to Charleston.  Mrs. Beattie, Hamlin, Willie, Mrs. Choice, Mrs. Cleveland, B� & others.  Choice stopped to represent his stock.

	Col. O�Hanlon came to see us today & made a great many enquiries about you & the children.  Fannie & Annie had gone out of their room & he did not see them.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seemed glad to see us & have been very kind.  Miss Graham is about starting to Europe.  Lula is very much pleased with her school.

	Fannie & Anne are delighted with their trip & are enjoying themselves very much.  They went up to see Mrs. Taylor this morning & were invited to stay with her.  But they prefer staying at the Hotel.  Mr. L� &daughters are very kind.  The Governors drawing room will�was given to them yesterday, but I preferred their being near me & they have rooms near where we staid last winter.

	I have seen very few persons to converse with.  My purchases are two coats, four waistcoats, a dozen socks & a pair of pants, boots & a hat.

	There is great dissatisfaction with the management of the Rail Road & an effort will be made to reform the management by turning out some of the officers.  The weather is warm & we have had rain.  I hope you & the children are doing well in our absence.  I would tell you all who were at the Hotel if I knew them or you would know them when their names are mentioned.  Mrs. McPheters & her daughters you know.  Tow[n]es of Abbeville & daughters are here.  His daughters are going to school at Barumville [Barhamville].  

	I think it likely I shall remain here till Monday & then return with the girls & remain at home instead of coming back again.  Though I ought to be at home Salesday.  

	The acquittal of Sickles was mentioned last night & Mrs. LeConte & the Dr. both agreed with me that�deserved his fate, but that Sickles is an unmittigated scoundrel.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

They are going to remain with their aunts a couple of weeks & I return home this evening.    They are now gone to church & will come & take dinner with me at the Hotel & then go down to Mrs. Haynes.  I have staid to write to you & Willie.  I have heard nothing from you since I left home. But I suppose your mother.

	We have a great many persons from Greenville in Charleston at this time�Capt. Choice & wife, B� Cleveland & family, Robert McKay, � & family, Mrs. Beattie, Hamlin & wife, Willie Beattie & others.

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night and was sorry to hear you say that you sometimes wished to resign.  Don�t think of such a thing again.  You have a most enviable position & do not give it up for the world.  Study hard & behave well & determine to be a distinguished Naval officer.

	You must never again sign any more papers, or enter into any combination with the students to restate the laws of your school.  Be obedient in all things.

	The tarring & feathering was a disgrace to all concerned.  If a student misbehaves let the teacher correct him.

	Enclosed I send you $20.00 which you wrote for in your last letter.  You did not say what you wanted it for.  I suppose to buy clothes.

	You must write me in your next letter when you will start home & how much money you will want to bring you home.

	We are all well.  Fannie & Annie are still in Charleston & will return with Mr. Arthur next Saturday.  They have been enjoying themselves very much in Charleston.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie last night.  He says Harvard is very dull & lonesome to him.

	  We are all well & I have no news to write except a most hor[r]ible case of poisoning took place at Newberry last week.  Mr. Stewart & his whole family were poisoned by their cook, & it is thought they may all die!  Mr. Stewart lives in Greenville in the Summer at S� former place near Poinsetts old place.

	I am glad to hear you say you will not need any more money Willie is wanting all I can well spare.  His expenses have been very heavy.  It is a great saving to have a son educated by the Government, as you will be.  I hope you will think of this & remain at the naval school.

	But unless Memminger or some other clever person travels with you, I think you had better not  take the trip at all.  It is lonely travelling by ones self.

	You had better go out into the country & spend your time.  Go to the old town of Sherborn & see your ancestral kindred.  I want to know something about them.

	The is Saturday & I am very much engaged in my Equity business.  For two days T.P. Reed & myself have been on a Reference & just concluded it before the Commissioner.
	
	We are all well.  But I have the melancholy news to communicate of Flora Junes� death.  She died the morning suddenly.  Yesterday she was walking in the yard�ate something which disagreed with her & died with cholera morbus.  Poor girl!  He death made me think of Anna & I wept at the startling news.

	I have nothing further to write.  We heard from Frank last night.  He wrote for $15.00 to help pay his expenses home.  How much less he spends than you.  It is a great matter to have a son educated by the Republic.

	I sent John to Laurens yesterday for Tim & hope he will be able to return with him.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	This is the last letter I shall write you before your return.  I suppose you received the draft for $25.00.

	 We are all well.  I have taken Wiley back.  Mrs. Nance gave me $300 to do so.  I have let him go to Newberry to hire out his time.  The horse Tim is slowly improving.  Zach Mauldin lost a child yesterday.  Doctor Bell is dying or dead.  Annas monument was shipped 4 June & will cost $500.  The Letters on her death will come out this week in a book of 100 pages.

	 We shall be glad to have you & Frank at home once more together.  He is very much improved, but still indolent & wanting in energy.  

	I was truly glad to hear of your distinction in your class, but sorry to learn you were not going to speak.

	I had a notice of your distinction inserted in the Patriot & it has been copied with the Carolinian so you return home distinguished & known to the State.

	We are all well or tolerably well.  Clara & Sandys youngest child has been quite sick.  I am somewhat troubled with the summer complaint.

	Why have you not written to us?  Not a word since you left on your tour!

	You will get home just in time for the Commencement at Furman University.

	I received your letter on my arrival at this place, which was handed me by Edw[ard] Stokes, and I was very glad to hear you were all well, & that you were attentive to the office & making progress with your studies.  I would have written you before, but have had but little time & that little leisure I have spent in writing for the Patriot, which letters you will see.

	Edward Stokes went with us to Mount Auburn & has been unwell since.  He wrote me a note yesterday saying that he was sick & desired me to come & see him before leaving.  He stated he was getting better.

	Your mother, Frank & Fannie have engaged themselves very much.  Frank has met several of his fellow students & they seem clever boys.  I have found about twenty dozen of my kinspeople whom I like very much.  Two of them are members of the Legislature.  You will see my letter about Sherborn in the Patriot.

	I was greatly dissatisfied  yesterday by the rain, which prevented me hearing Everett & Felton  on the Inauguration of the Webster Statue.  I rece[ive]d an invitation but could not turn out in the rain.

	We leave here in the morning for Montreal direct & shall not go to Quebec.  We will see Niagara & the Hudson & be at home the first day of October, Saturday.  We have made some pleasant acquaintances & met a good many friends at the different Hotels.

 	We are all well & found all going on well on our return home.  Alfred is lame.  He went after a cow the other day & sprained his ankle but otherwise well.

	There is a [word obscured] of a great many engagements between the young people here but how true I know not.  It is said Sue Hoke & Donaldson are to be married shortly.  Spartan Goodlett and Sally Crook are said to be engaged.  Sease Butler & & Austin�Georgia Townes & another Austin�Mary Early & Blocker of Edgefield�Robert Dav� daughter & Harris a student�Anna Green & Davis of Beaufort are to be married shortly her mother told me yesterday.  Several other engagements which I do not remember at present.

	I saw Doctor Irvine yesterday.  Pinckney is very much dissatisfied & wishes to return home.  His father says he may come back in December at the end of his quarter.

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & will be absent all the week. Your mother & Fannie have been very busy for several days past in planting rose bushes and other flowers around the enclosure of dear Anna and they will make it a lovely spot as it should be.--the resting place of one so sweet & lovely�snatched from life early.

	You must tell the students from South Carolina that I am sorry I did not get to see them.  I should have been glad too to have seen Harper whose father I knew well in my boyhood.

	Hext is going to school.  Hayne & Arthur are playing about.  Willie is studying hard & does well in my office.  He helps me fill up Writs & other papers & I find him of great convenience to me.

	I hope my dear son that you will study hard & behave well�have no demerits & take a high stand in your class.  If you could only feel & realize the interest your father & mother take in your success in life I am sure you would try to realize our fond hopes.  

	  May God bless you &�you & make you a consolation to your Parents & an�to your profession is the prayer of your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night and we were very glad to hear from you.  Two weeks had elapsed since your previous letter.

	You say you have received only four demerits.  You ought to try & receive none.  You know all the rules of the Academy & obey them.  Then you will get no demerits. 

	I am glad that Harper said what he did to you.  Your grandfather and his grandfather lived more than thirty years, within a half mile of each other & were great friends.  His father addressed your aunt Mrs. Hunt.  I always liked him very much but he was a grown young man whilst I was a boy.

	I returned from Pickens court last week but did not see any of Fosters family.  Hawthorn & Long are doing pretty well.  Next week is court here & I shall be very busy.

	The Revd. Mr. Buist was�last summer and he was the one who enquired after you.  He is Doctor of Divinity.

	I brought from Anderson Court a beautiful English Terrier for Arthur & he is delighted with the dog.  He sleeps with him.

	We are all well & the children are going to school.  

	Do you receive the Patriot regularly.  Let me know.

	Dr. Irvine says Pinckney will return about Christmas & wish to call & see you as he comes back.  Col. Ashmore tells me that he will go & see you before Congress meets.

	Spartan Goodlett is to be married shortly to Miss Lyles of Fairfield a daughter of William Lyles.  I had heard that he was courting Sally Crook.  But he is positively engaged to Miss Lyles.

	Donaldson & Miss Sue Hoke are to be married 15th of November.

	Write us once a week & study hard.  Let me have a good report from you in November.  Col. Orr enquires about you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Your letter to Willie was rece[ive]d last night & enclosed I send you five dollars which you wrote for.

	I am very busy in court & have not time to write a long letter.  We have just got through with the trial of Oneale for setting fire to Cox & Gowers carriage shop.  He was convicted, but will be imprisoned & not hung as he ought to be.  Willie took the testimony for us in court & did it very well.  So he is becoming useful to me in my practice already.  He is studying very well and will make himself a lawyer by next Fall.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I returned yesterday from the court of ordinary at Spartanburgh.  There was a trial of a Will case
In which I was concerned and succeeded in establishing the Will.

	This morning I have written a letter to Col. Ashmore, who was here during my absence & who will visit you tomorrow week as your mother has already written you.

	I shall start to Columbia on Saturday & hereafter address your letters to me there till the 21st of December.

	We are all well. & I have no news to write you except what you mother has written you.

	Hexts dog poor Watch was found dead the other evening & no doubt poisoned by some vial person.  Hext is very much grieved at the loss.

	I am sorry you sold your overcoat.  It was a pretty one & a remarkable one.  No doubt you are cheated in the clothes you got in exchange.  I am very much pleased with my overcoat & it is the admiration of all who see it.

	I hope you are now studying hard, as you say you will, in your last letter.   My constant & never ceasing command to you is to �study hard & behave well�.  In after life you will reap the reward.  Be ambitious to excel your fellow students in good conduct & in your studies.  Try & take a higher stand in your class.  Be high up, instead if low down.

	I am very busy & have not time to write you further.  In your next letter let me hear how the South Carolina students stand in their classes.

	Hext & Hayne went with me to Laurens Court week before last, & behaved very well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I go down to Columbia in the morning & will be in the Legislature till towards Christmas.  You must write to me there.  This is a very wet day & gloomy weather.  I have been packing up my clothes although it is Sunday & we have a Methodist minister staying with us.  His name is Stacy, & [a] very clever intelligent gentleman he is.  We are to have another tomorrow.  Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p] the President of the Female College at Spartanburgh.  I shall not see him as I go off in the morning.

	There is a great Methodist Conference here.  Akins came here & about 2:30 Pres�.  They are quartered on the Village {last few words obscured by stain].

	Anna Green was married last week & Willie was one of the groomsmen for Mr. Davis her husband.  He also waited on Donalson & Sue Hoke.

	I am glad my dear Son that you are going to study hard & be transferred to a higher section.  I hope you will succeed.

	Col. Ashmore will be with you tomorrow.  I hope you will be allowed to see him & converse with him a long time for he has promised to give you a great deal of advice.  

	If you wish to go to Washington in Christmas time, & get permission to do so I will send you money to defray your expenses.  Write to me whether you will be allowed to go.  Col. Ashmore will invite you if it is necessary to receive an invitation & you wrote him to that effect.

	Willie is studying law very hard, & makes good progress in his studies.  Hext is going to school & doing well.  Fannie is also going to school & doing well.  She is one of the smartest & best little girls I have ever seen.  Hayne & Arthur are doing well & looking well.  Your mother is well [and] so are all the servants.

	Col. Ashmore writes me that you are a noble looking boy & he knows you could do well. I hope when he sees you & knows of you he will not change his opinion.

	Now my dear son be a good boy & study & make a man of yourself of whom your family and country will be proud.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely as our friend Stacey prayed that I might do.  My room was retained for me, & I took into it my old friend H[enry] C[linton] Young who was without a room.  There was a great crowd on the cars & no less than five�.

	I went to the court this morning & saw twenty-six students admitted Rice amongst them.  I then went with Chancellor to his room to get a decree for the sale Mayor Smiths land.  He spoke to me of the letter he had written you.  I told him it was very gratifying to you.  He said, a parent might think it was a back breaking affair to loose a child & it was bad enough for he had experienced it, but it was nothing to loosing a wife.  No human misery & affliction was like that which he too had drunk to the dregs.  He then spoke of his first wife, & I thought strange of it as he married another wife soon after the death of his first.  

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly & affectionately after you & all the children.  Mrs. LeConte is not so stout as she was.  Lula will graduate next July & return home in the fall.  Dr. LeConte has a niece with him who reminded me of Lula.  

	There was nothing done of interest in the Legislature yesterday or today.  I presented Mrs. Rowlands petition, Dr. Crooks petition about sheep & dogs, and Peter Caubles about his son Willia[m�s]�.

	McKay, Thomas & Jeter are here electioneering very hard.  I think McKay will be elected.

	Mr. McBee has just arrived & brings the news of Joab Mauldins death.  I met Dr. Goodwyn going up to see him at the instance of Mrs. Mauldin, but turned back on receiving a message that Mauldin would be dead before he could reach Greenville.  He told me that there were one hundred & fifty Methodist Preachers on the cars going up Monday & they had been furnished with a paper where they were to stay.

	  The Governors message is pretty fierce & firery.  Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts enquired after you.  Col. Hayne also.  Young DeTreville who once was at our house came up & spoke to me yesterday.  He is very much improved.  I have only�to � Rhett at a distance & have not yet spoken to him. 

	I hope you are getting on very well with our Methodist friends, the children & the servants.

	The Governor has one of Dr. Fairs houses & Col. Allen has another.  But Janney has a greater crowd than I ever saw here.  Yeadon has gone to Roaches old House.  I am sorry for that.  Pope is here & is as lively as ever.  Memminger came today & Judge Frost.  I sit at Dr. LeContes table with Pope & others by invitation of Mrs. LeConte.  She sits at the head of the table & assigned me a seat on her left & the Dr. on her right.  Pope said to her she was the presiding Empress of our table.

	I have bought a new hat & waistcoat.  The weather is very warm & I cannot wear my overcoat.  

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  God bless you & the children.  Give my respects to Stacey & Ship[]p].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday, just after the House adjourned and as I was going to dine with Col. [Joseph Duncan] Allen.  I was glad to hear you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist clergy.  I was afraid they would give you trouble.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  In the evening I dined with Col. Allen & then went to the Board of Trustees.  The Col. gave us a fine dinner.  Edm[und] Rhett, Yeadon, General Edwards, Pope, [Francis Wellman] Fickling, [James H.] Norwood and others were guests.  Yeadon is low spirited.

	I have notice yesterday of my Bill to establish a separate court of appeals.  Rhett got a copy of it & introduced the Bill in the Senate.  [William Sidney] Mullins from the Pee Dee introduced a Resolution yesterday to dissolve the Union.	  But I do not think it merits any serious consideration.  The Harpers Ferry affair has excited everybody very much against the north & very�.  If I thought the northern people generally entertained the sentiments of Wendel[l] Phillips, � Smith &c. I too should be in favor of a dissolution.  But I do not believe such sentiments are entertained by the statesmen of the north or the masses of the north.

	Bryant sent me a Bill of your Books yesterday--$28.35 which I will pay this morning.

	I saw Dr. Laborde yesterday & he enquired after you kindly.  I got the Board of Trustees to subscribe for twenty volumes of his Book. 

	I was invited yesterday to dine with Gov. Gist, but was previously engaged to Col. Allen

	I will write a letter for the Patriot the last of this week.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from W.H. Cooper of Spartanburg yesterday saying he was coming down to Columbia to get me to file a Bill of Injunction to restrain the administration of his Fathers Estate from carrying slaves out of the State.  So I have law business as well as Legislation to attend to.

	Mr. Petigru & Governor Allston came up last night & were at the Board.  This morning I breakfasted with Mr. Petigru & gave him a Brief in Stokes & Sullivans case.

	I must conclude & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  I have to go into court at ten oclock to finish the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  I was all day yesterday engaged in the argument of the case & did not get to vote for Mc�.  Thomas beat him badly.  Mr. Petigru argues the case of Stokes this morning & I was with him last night till a late hour preparing for the argument.

	I have drawn up a set of Resolutions to submit in the House today on Harpers Ferry.  There is no excitement here on the subject.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist ministers, children & servants.  Mr. Young knows Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p]s father & says he was a Lawyer of considerable distinction, but a very rough, uncouth profane man.  He saw him once  sitting in the piazza of the Hotel at Court in the summer  in his shirt sleeves & barefooted!

	In conversation yesterday with a number of gentlemen Col. Isaac Hayne remarked that I was regarded as the extreme of non resistance in South Carolina & yet no other Southern State had ever yet come up to mu platform as laid down in our State Convention.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I had a long political chat with Edmund Rhett.  By the by he tells me that Mrs. Rhett has not been able to leave Charleston yet & he wishes she had remained at Greenville.  

	I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & will write you a few lines enclosing Col. Ashmores letter which I know will gratify you.

	Today after writing you I went to the Court House with Mr. Petigru & concluded the argument in the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  Chancellor Wardlaw expressed himself in my favor & Chancellor Johnston expressed doubts.  Chancellor Dunkin said nothing.  Mr. Petigru made a pretty good speech, but nothing remarkable.  There is not so much in great men as their reputation gives them.

	When I got through the Court I went to the Legislature & introduced a set of resolutions which produced quite a sensation in the House.  They took the members so much by surprise that I was applauded.  My Resolutions are very strong & you will probably see them in the papers.    Copies of them were in great demand by the Editors & Reporters.

	I have paid Mr. Bryant $28.85cts your Bill & I suppose it right.  But how come it so much more than the Bill sent you.

	Mr. Stokes goes up in the morning & so does Price.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & a very bad day.  I have just had my breakfast & will write you a few lines.  I wrote you two letters by Saturdays mail which makes up for my omission the day before.  I have just written a long letter & an interesting one for the patriot, two sheets of foolscap, to which I refer you for much news.

	At the breakfast table I met Col. Thomas of N.C. & got to talking with him on rail roads.  I did not get up from the table till ten oclock.  It is now too late to go to church & the weather is bad.  I recei[ve]d your letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well & doing well.

	The Hotel is filling up with Ladies for commencement.  Col. Henderson came with six�one a Miss Scott he says is related to you.  I told her I was happy to meet a kinswoman of my wife.  She is not pretty.  Hendersons daughters are not very pretty either.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte for several days.  The other night she spoke of you as being the neatest & best housekeeper she had ever seen.  She said after living as I did at home, she did not know how I could put up with such a Hotel as the Congaree.  The Board of Trustees have ordered a House to be built for Dr. LeConte & Mrs. LeConte says it shall be a picture of a House.  I told her I would move in the Board to have her put on the building committee with the Dr. & Mr. DeSaussure.  Tell Willie Mrs. LeConte enquires very particularly after him & wishes to know how he is studying.  She may be thinking of the�made Lula.

	I have heard nothing from Frank except through Col. Ashmore & yourself.  He ought to write me.

	The excitement is becoming very strong against the north & in favor of disunion.  But I have no serious apprehensions myself of any such thing.

	Bishop Elliott delivered an address in College last night, but I could not venture out to hear him.  I was anxious to hear him too.

	Tell Fannie Mr. Janneys little daughter enquired kindly about her & was anxious I should have brought her down with me.

	Say to Hext, Hayne & Arthur I will bring them some present�Hext a knife.  Mr. � Clark whom we met of the Rail Road last summer between New York & Philadelphia says he never saw a little girl like Fannie.  She was so quick to�the boot to�& get her seat, so disposed to take care of herself &c.

	I must close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recei[ve]d your letter & write you immediately to relieve you of all unpleasant feeling  as to my consistency.  My resolutions were offered in strong language to rebuke the fanatical spirit of the north & express what would be the consequence of its going on.  I further wish for South Carolina to do nothing & let the other Southern States act & I am sure their course with be wise.  There is a dispensation here to act.  My object is to keep the State from acting & leading off.  I say again I have no apprehensions of disunion. But we are getting into a terrible excitement & I am afraid South Carolina will again act foolishly.

	Judge Longstreet made a most bitter & fiery speech today at the college to the graduates on disunion & slavery.  It was out of place & will not add much to the Judges reputation as a literary President.

	Mrs. LeConte told me at dinner that she heard a lady in the college pay me a very high compliment.  The Lady said I was the finest looking & most dignified of all the Board of Trustees & looked like Washington.   Mrs. LeConte sends her love to you.

	I was glad to receive Col. Ashmores letter.  I will send Frank the money when he writes me.

	I will send you Bryants Bill.  But I expect it is all right.

	The weather is bad, & Mr. Stokes did not return today.

	I am glad you are getting on so well with the Methodist Preachers.  But you must have too many of them.  They will all be gone tomorrow or next day & I suppose you will feel relieved.

	I write you in a great hurry.  The Commencement was not a very fine one�not as many ladies as usual.  The Fair has broken up the commencement.  The ladies all come down then & don�t care to come again.

	In regard to Fannies going I don�t approve of it.  But will be at home or write you again before the 20th.  You don�t know that Mr. Wallace wishes her company & he is unknown to me.  

	It is now growing dark & I must conclude.  Dr. Crook wrote a long letter about an abolitionist  taken up in Greenville named Willis.  The excitement has reached Greenville & will run over the State like wildfire.  Much foolery will be committed I have no doubt.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter at four oclock and will write you a line before going to meet the Board of Trustees.  I have just eaten dinner and rece[ive]d three notes to collect in Greenville for the Johnson Female University.

	Stokes returned today & told me he saw William.  He says he did not know his house when he got home.  It was so filled with Methodist Preachers.

	The death of Cook was very sad.  There was a sad death here�that of Col. Ballenger.  Governor Adams too is not expected to live.

	I saw Barnwell Rhett here today.  He congratulated me on my Resolutions and I told him extremes sometimes met.  He said yes & interlocked.  �fell on different sides of a river & met, formed an island & were fruitful.  My Resolutions are perfectly harmless, & just right.  They contemplate no action unless the whole South will act and they give a severe rebuke to the north.  If such sentiments become general at the north we must separate.  

	Nothing was done in the legislature today, except to pass a Bill to elect an additional Judge.  There was a Bill to protect sheep from dogs which passed.  I am still receiving petitions from Dr. Colcock on that subject.

	Col. Orr came today & could not get a room at this Hotel.  He came up into my room & dressed & then went to the Assembly House.  If I had been here I would have left in my room as Young has gone.  I have a room to myself.  The Hotel is very much crowded.  Seven ladies in one room & only one had for them.  I heard Whaley say, who came up with them, I have two large double beds in my room & ought to propose to exchange with them.

	My law cases will not come up before next week & then I am ready to go home.  I am really tired & disgusted with legislating.

	I will send you what the mercury says of my resolutions.  We took a vote today which shows that the disunionists are not so strong as I expected.

	In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now dark & I have just got up from dinner.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & was reading it till my regular seat at the dinner table was taken.  Mrs. LeConte said, as she got up from the table, that I ought to come to the table always in time to secure my seat as it destroyed the pleasure of dinner not to have me to talk to.  She had with her at the table today two young ladies.

	Whilst Col. Menninger was speaking today on the Blue Ridge Rail Road, Judge frost came & took me into the Library to give me some instructions, & there I met Miss [Dorothea] Dix.  I spoke to her & told her who I was.  She said she ought to have recognized me.  She was talking to Col. Hampton about the Lunatic Asylum.  She has grown fat & stout, & has [a] new set of teeth.  She seems a great favorite with the members.  I had very little conversation with her as I had to return into the Representation Hall.  She enquired about you.

	Yesterday I did not have time to write you as I had to meet Judge Frost & Trenholm on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.

	The Chancellors have ordered the case of Stokes & Sullivan to be reargued in May.  This is a good sign for my clients.  

	Stokes went down to the Rail Riad depot today to see the Methodist preachers.  He said there were five cars full.  I saw major Warren of Camden who told me Greenville had�hospitality & he was delighted with our village.  

	You will see in the Carolinian some fellow has�his hats �Perry Hats�.  The fire eaters are beginning to find out the depth of my Resolutions & do not like them so much as they did at first.  My object in offering them was to prevent action on the part of the state, for I believe that the northern people will yet come right & we shall have no disunion.  But the State ought to express herself strongly in regard to her course.

	I shall perhaps tomorrow, speak on the Rail Road.

	A man came to me today & gave me five dollars for counsel & advice.  I wasn�t spared in purchasing books for you.  I asked for�but B�out did not have it.  I see it advertised in Charleston & will have it ordered.

	I met today Col. � of Charlotte who enquired after you very kindly.  The ladies are all gone from this Hotel.

	I hope you will not have rest after the Preachers have left you.  

	The weather is very cold & I wore my overcoat to the House.  You cannot imagine how much attention it attracted.  They all said I looked like a Russian Emperor & everybody wants one like it.  Dozens of members enquired where they could get one.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & have purchased for you �� of Hearts,� �Life for a Life,� & �Gregson Letters� & Home & Abroad� with the five dollar Bill given me yesterday for counsel & advice.

	Tell Major Bolling his case is ordered to be reargued next Spring.  This is a great victory & I have hopes of a success.

	The Blue Ridge was killed today in the House suddenly & before I made my speech.  I do not care.  South Carolina will never do anything & is fit for nothing but to quarrel with the Union.  I am disgusted with the Legislature& with politics.  Hereafter the State may pursue her own course & I will pursue my profession & live at home in the bosom of my family, caring nothing about public matters.  I hope Willie will never engage in political life, but devote himself to his profession.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  I rece[ive]d a letter this evening from General Thompson saying my Resolutions had given him great satisfaction.  Hammond son of the Senator came to me today & said his uncle requested him to tell me that my resolutions filled his heart with patriotism.

	The weather is very cold & my overcoat is most comfortable.  I tried to get sa dressing gown but could not.  You must have me one made out of�& nice material.  Can you not do this before I return  home.  Have it well padded & lined.  Make it after my old one.  Clara can do it.  Have it thick & warm.  I suppose you can get the padding in Greenville such as ladies use for their pretty coats, or cotton preferred.  

	I have heard nothing from Frank.  I will write him in time to send the money for his visit to Washington.  

	Governor Adams has an internal, ulcers in the entrails, which are very painful & killing him.  I want to see you all very much & when I get through with my law cases I shall return never to come back as a member of the House.

	I have just received your letter & Franks, also one from Mr. Arthur.  Col. Orr dined with me today & I left the Legislature before it adjourned.  We had a pleasant dinner & just as we left the room we met Mrs. LeConte going in to dinner.  Dr. LeConte has gone to Georgia & left her here.  I like Col. Orr very much & we agree very well in our political views.  I met John Cunningham as Col. Orr & myself were leaving Governor Gist today & he told me that his mother was delighted with my resolutions & took me again to her heart.

	Col. Orr, Sullivan & myself called to get a pardon from the Governor for young Sullivan & he granted it.  Nothing occurred in the Legislature today worth mentioning.  My Bill for a separate Court of appeals comes up on Monday.  I have hopes of its passage, although it was killed in the Senate yesterday.

	I am glad to hear Frank is doing well & will write him tomorrow & send him $20.00.  Though I may wait till he writes to me.

	I sent you this morning by Wells two Books & have the other two to read.  So your letter came too late to make the present in money.  I hope the Books will�as well.

	I am sorry to learn the sow had such bad luck with her pigs.  She had better be fattened & [word obscured].  Tell Alfred so.

	Col. Orr invited me to dine with him Monday at the Assembly House.  I will do so.  I will write to Major Bolling tomorrow.  I will also write to the Patriot tomorrow..

	My cases in law come up Tuesday & when I get through them I will be ready to return home.  I would give a great deal if I could be at home today & return Monday.

	Mr. Arthur wrote me about a Bill which he says the Episcopal church will present.  I saw old Mr. Bryce this evening who told me he was at my House.  I saw Dr. Smith also his nephew.

	  I have bought several Books & amongst them Reminiscences of Rufus Choate, a most admirable book.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

[10 December 1859]
Saturday night
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I did not go down to the Legislature this evening as the weather is bad, & nothing of interest before the House.

	I received your letters & one from Col. Ashmore this evening.  The Colonel says my Resolutions are extremely all in Washington as �the very thing�, & that others submitted are all �stuff�.  He writes gloomily, & thinks disunion fast approaching.

	It is probable that our Legislature will adjourn to meet the first Monday in May.  It is to be voted on tonight.  I am very willing as I shall have to come down anyhow.  We did nothing in the Legislature today.  Last night we had a warm discussion on the Spartanburgh & Asheville Rail Road [Greenville & French Broad].  Col. [Allen] McFarlan[d] & myself spoke against it.  [James] Farrow and [Oliver Evans] Edwards for it.  There is no danger of the Bill passing.

	Col. McFarland told me the other day that his mother enquired about you & cried, & said you had shown her more civility at Greenville than anyone else.

	This morning Governor Manning came to me and told me that the people were preparing to tar & feather a Massachusetts stone cutter who had declared himself an abolitionist.  Shortly afterwards I heard the mob shouting.  They made two negro men take him and whip him!  This is horrible & so regarded by thinking men, but the people are run mad & I fear will commit outrages all over the State.  This poor fellow had simply told that he was an abolitionist.  I did not hear that he had in any way interfered with slaves.

	I have just heard that Mr. Everett & Mrs. Carson are to be married.  You know she was in Boston when we were there.  Everett must be seventy & she cannot be more [than] thirty five.  This will be a union between Massachusetts & South Carolina.

	John Cunningham tells me that Pamela is better than she has been for ten years.  She may get well in her old age.  Mr. Everett ought to have married her.  But he has got a much more buxom wife in Mrs. Carson.

	I told Mrs. LeConte that you said it was a pitty that Frank was too young for Lula, but that I was going to write you, I could substitute Willie who was about the right age.  She says Lula will make a good wife.  I hope not so gay, & fond of admiration as she is.  She goes to the State House every day & stays up in the gallery till we adjourn.  She says she oversees herself in looking at the members & watching their movements whilst no discussion is going on.  Mrs. Spratt is with her every day, & she is a very pleasant & smart lady.

	I will now go down & get supper & will write you again tomorrow.  I rece[ive]d a note today from Miss Dix suggesting me to aid in the passage of a law about the Asylum.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	The clock has just struck seven, & I will write you a few lines before breakfast, as I take dinner today with Col. Orr at the Assembly House & will have no opportunity of writing you in the evening.  At ten oclock l I go to the court of appeals to hear decisions read.  At two my Bill for a separate court of appeals comes up & I shall have to speak on it.  My cases in the lower court of appeals will be taken up tomorrow I hope.

	Last night after I had gone to bed  & after ten oclock someone knocked at my door & I asked who was there.  No reply was given & without getting out of bed I unlocked the door.  A gentleman came in, shook me most cordially by the hand whilst I was still in bed & asked if I did not know him.  There was a glimmering light in the room & his voice [&] manner & laugh reminded me very much of Captain Cunningham.  But I remembered he was dead & did not think it likely the old gentleman had taken the trouble to pay me a friendly visit from the spirit world at that unreasonable hour.  The question was proposed to me again, �don�t you recognize my voice.�  I had to confess I did not know him as my spectacles were off & the room dimly lighted by a few coals from the hearth.  But still I thought of no one but Captain Cunningham.  The size too suited very well.  Had the Captain been in this world I should have promptly said Captain Cunningham.  He replied �you say,� �Ben.�  I then got up & lighted a candle & he sat & talk[ed] with [me] an hour.  He was just on his return from South America & had stopped in Columbia to see his daughter who is at the Barhamville Academy.  His wife & family returned last Summer to Alabama & his eldest daughter was then placed here at school.  He is stout & fat & looks old.  He enquired of you, & how many children I had.  He has three only & has lost one.  He had returned by way of Paris & London & is now a union man.  He says it will never do to break up the union & that slavery will be gone if we do.  England will leave against us & crush us.  Heretofore he has been a disunionist.  He said it seemed strange to think I had a son reading law & he a daughter grown.  She is as large as you are he says & will remain two years at school yet. 

	Mrs. LeConte asked me last night if I knew the gentleman in Greenville who married Mary Hardin of Savannah�Israil Charles.  She says he is terribly taken in & has got a devil.  The brother of her last husband, Hardin, married Doctor LeContes sister.  It was his daughter that was here with Mrs. LeConte last week.  She says the father of Mrs. Charles was a perfect devil.  She was in love with Hardin her second husband & he made her marry a preacher.  For a short time the Preacher sued for a divorce.  She then married Hardin but had a son by her first husband who killed his stepfather & was to be tried for murder.   One week before he died in Greenville.  Mrs. LeConte enquired if he did die, for she thought the report was not true.  I told her that a young man who passed as her son really died in Greenville.  She says Mrs. Charles is highly connected in Georgia.  

	I wrote letters yesterday to Col. Ashmore, General Thompson & the Patriot.  I thought I would wait a day or two [to] receive a letter from Frank before writing him.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & that you are all are getting on well since the Methodists have left you.  

	I must now close my letter & go to breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night on my return from court.  I dined with Col. Orr & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mason, Sam Townes� �perfect gentleman� keeps the House.  Ben Yancey has turned union man & says England will crush the Slave States if they dissolve the union.  Tell your mother there is no danger of War or disunion.  The northern people are getting right again.  Their meetings in Boston & New York were glorious.  I am now very busy with my law cases& will get through in a day or two.  Yesterday my separate court of appeals was defeated in the House.  But Rhetts Bill passed the Senate & we will try & pass it in the House.  The House is now discussing the Slavery question.  I shall not be able to be there today.

       General Easl[e]y & Goodlett came down yesterday.  Easl[e]y told me a great deal of news about Greenville and the abolitionist extremist there.  Mrs. Spratt came up the other day & I told her she ought to have heard her husbands speech & I told her she ought to have come sooner to have heard her husband�s speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  She asked me in Spratts presence if he made a good speech.  I told her the Blue Ridge was between us whilst he was speaking & I could not see his performance well.
       
       I sent you two books by Poinsett Wells which I hope you rece[ive]d.  I know you will be pleased with the Gregson Letters.  I will speak to Stokes about sending the books.

	The Bell has just rung for supper, but I will write you a few lines in time for the morning mail.  I wrote you this morning before breakfast.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was surprised to hear you had not rece[ive]d the Books.  I saw Mr. Wells who told me he sent them to you!  How is it?  He goes up Wednesday�& enquire about them.

	Dr. Fair invited me to dine with him tomorrow which invitation I have accepted.  Col. Allen invited me to dine with him this evening but I declined as I had promised Mrs. LeConte to take an oyster supper with her & her brother Joseph & his wife & others in her parlor.

	 Today we had an interesting discussion in the House on selling free negroes for crime.  I gave Col. Memminger a little�.  He told me at dinner he had never seen me look so savage as I did.  Mrs. LeConte said I was greatly exited.  I did not think so.

	I argued the case of Dickey & Barrett today in the Court of appeals.  Tomorrow my other case will go on & then I shall be ready to go home if the Blue Ridge & separate court are not passed.  Both Bills are coming up again.

	I will now close & go to supper.  You tell all your friends there is no danger of abolitionists, or war or disunion.  I fear the people will make fools of themselves in Greenville.  Mr. McBees stock only entitle[s] his sons to go down to the Rail Road convention free.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Enclosed I send you two ten dollar Bills to pay your expenses to Washington on Christmas.  You must tell Captain Blake about it.
	
	Why have you not written to me?  I have been waiting to receive a letter from you before I sent you the Money.  When you write me now, write to Greenville as I shall return there in a few days.

	We are very much excited here about the conduct of the northern people in reference to old Brown.  But I hope all will be right & the north may see their error.

	I was glad to hear from Col. Ashmore you were doing so well.  Your mother sent me your last letter which was very gratifying.  I hope my dear son you will study hard & rise still higher in your class.

	I have just taken dinner & it is night.  I have to go back to the House at seven to finish my separate court Bill which has been under discussion all day & will pass.  I have made three or four speeches on it today.  	

       I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & will explain all when I see you.  Dr. Fair told me last night  that Governor Adams could not live long & he was conscious of it.  He is going about the House & will till a day or two of his death.  How sad.

	I gave the�to Stokes today & he will bind them very reasonably for $1.29 per copy in black Morrocco with gilt &c.  They will be finished next week.  I have not spoken to Mrs. LeConte since I gave her the poetry & letters.  Today I sat a different table with�,although my seat next to her was kept for me but there was no room for�.

	I feel as if my Bill for a separate court will be a triumph & I am sure it will pass about nine oclock  tonight.  Fifteen or twenty members have changed their votes.

	I send this evening a letter from Warren & Wilkes approving my Resolutions & very complimentary.

	The weather is not so cold here & I cannot wear my overcoat.  I put on my cloak.

	My Court Bill passed by thirty votes about nine oclock.  This gives me great pleasure.  For eight years I have been striving to pass it.

	Enclosed I send you Franks letter.  I also send you two Books.

	Mrs. LeConte said tonight that she was now more anxious to see Frank than ever, & admired his letter very much.  She says the pictures will be very highly valued by Miss Graham & Lula.  She admired the poetry very much.

	I have been very much engaged today in the House and have but ten minutes  to write before going back,  I voted today in a minority of one in opposition to Col. Memmingers Resolutions for a Southern Confederacy.  I also pounced on him again today in my speech.  I want confidence in my firmness & political integrity.  He sails before the wind.  Col. [William McCreight] Shannon came up & congratulated me on my boldness & independence.  My remarks about Memminger & [William Sidney] Mullins excited a great deal of merriment in & out of the House.  Their speeches were so different from their Resolutions that I told the House they had exchanged speeches or picked up by mistake anothers Resolutions.

	I shall return home Tuesday evening.  My Court Bill has passed the Senate.  The Spartanburgh Road is defeated in the Senate.  

	The Poetry you sent although tolerable is not�in the Book where there is so many pieces so much better.

	I sent you some books by Mr. Easl[e]y.  

	I must now go back to the House.

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter last night & enclosed Col. Ashmores to you as he mentions Frank.

	In regard to Fanny�s visit tell her I want to see her when I get home & I think she will improve more at home than with Miss Wallace.  There would be trouble in her returning.  The weather will be cold & unpleasant & she may take cold running about in the country.  I should be uneasy, & I know nothing of the family she is going to visit nor has she received an invitation from any of the family except the little girl.  I do not think Fanny is so bad off for a visit.  After poor dear Annas fate, I am unwilling for her to be abroad from us.  Tell Fanny I will buy Simms History of S.C. for her, & she may read that during Christmas.  I have bought a beautiful little knife for her to clean her nails with &c.  I bought a knife apiece for Hext, Hayne, Arthur & Luther & a whip apiece.

	I mentioned to you in a letter, last week, that I had sent Frank $20.00.  I saw Mr. F� today, & he enquired about you.  I have not yet given him the poetry,  I gave Miss Janney hers & Mrs. LeConte hers & Miss Grahams & Lulas.  She says it is beautiful & has poetic�in it.  She said she liked Franks letter very much & that she was more anxious to see him than ever & that Lula was anxious to have seen him last summer.

	In one of your letters last week you asked me if I thought Mrs. LeConte loved her husband.  I don�t think any wife who is so fond of the admiration of gentlemen as she is can love her husband or anyone else.  But I do not think she is bad hearted.  I have never thought polite people & people kind to everybody very affectionate.  Politeness & fashion assume the place of affection.  No one has a heart for all the world.  But I think Mrs. LeConte has kindness & goodness of heart.  Someone was talking about the poor fellow whipped here yesterday and she begged him to stop, that it made her sick.

	I see in the Carolinian this morning a communication nominating me for Governor.  Who could have written it I have no idea.  But it is well written as you will think.  But I do not desire any such empty honor & if I did there is no possibility of its being given to me at this time.

	Mrs. Spratt, this morning at the breakfast table, said I must bring you down with me in May, if the Legislature met.  I said I was going to come down in May anyhow to the Court of appeals & you were to come with me.  I like Mrs. Spratt.  She seems good & smart.  She told me that she did not see me in my seat in the House last night.  I told her I was more agreeably employed in writing a long letter to you.  She said that was a good excuse for a husband to make.  I have a standing invitation to take tea with her & Mrs. LeConte in Mrs. L�s parlor every evening, but I have only been once.

	I am afraid may letters are so long you will not have patience to read them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I was so much engaged yesterday that I could not write you.  In the morning I went to the court of appeals & was all day engaged in my cases.  They are all disposed of.  I gained the case of Boinest�Chaplain.  The court will�the case.  This you may tell Boinest or Dicky if Willie sees them.  I think I will get a new trial in the case of Boinest�ads Dicky.

	I did not go to the House yesterday at all.  In the evening I went to dine with Dr. Fair & had a most eloquent entertainment which I did not leave till nine.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & the pamphlets & will go this morning to have them bound.  I gave Mrs. LeConte her poetry & Ashmores letter, also one rece[ive]d from Frank yesterday which is very encouraging.  I have not seen her since.

	I will not leave Columbia as soon as the court of appeals is disposed of & the Blue Ridge.  General Easl[e]y goes up in the morning & I may send Gregson letters 7�abroad to you.

       I have nothing more to write you.  I sent Frank $20.00 yesterday.

	I received your letter last night & from what you say I am afraid you will not be allowed to visit Washington.

	Your letter to me in Columbia was rece[ive]d the morning after I wrote you.  Since my return home I have seen your Report, & I hope you will continue to rise in your class & go on improving.

	We are all well.  This is Christmas day & very dull and cold.

	You spoke of receiving a beautiful letter from Miss Pamela Cunningham your god mother.  You must write her in reply & give our love to her.  If the letter was to you individually, send it to us to read.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from Col. Ashmore last week.  I also recei[ve]d a very long letter from Col. Pickens our Minister to Russia.  He says he feels apprehensions for the South since hearing about the Harpers Ferry invasion. I hope all will pass over & we shall have no disunion or civil war.

	Col. Memminger has been appointed a minister from South Carolina to Virginia to express our sympathy &c.  The Legislature adjourned Thursday, but I came off before several days.

My dear Liz
	I arrived here safely as our dear friend Stacey prayed that I might do.  My room was retained for me, & I took into it my old friend H[enry] C[linton] Young who was without a room.  There was a great crowd on the cars as I came down & no less than five�.

	I went to the court this morning & saw twenty six students admitted Rice amongst them.  I then went with Chancellor Johnston to his room to get a decree for the sale of Mayor Smiths land.  He spoke to me of the letter he had written you.  I told him it was very gratifying to you.  He said, a parent might think it was a back breaking affair to loose a child & it was bad enough for he had experienced it, but it was nothing to loosing a wife.  No human misery & affliction was like that which he too had drunk to the dregs.  He then spoke of his first wife, & I thought strange of it as he married another wife soon after the death of his first.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly & affectionately after you & all the children.  Mrs. LeConte is not so stout as she was.  Lula will graduate next July & return home in the fall.  Dr. LeConte has a niece with him who reminded me of Lula.

	There was nothing done in the Legislature yesterday or today.  I presented Mrs. Rowlands petition, Dr. Crooks petition about sheep & dogs and Peter Caubles about his son Will[page torn] �.

	Mr. Kay, Thomas & Jeter are here electioneering very hard.  I think Mr. Kay will be elected.

	Mr. McBee has just arrived & brings the news of Joab Mauldins death.  I met Dr. Goodwyn going up to see him at the instance of Mrs. Mauldin, but turned back on receiving a message that Mauldin would be dead before he could reach Greenville.  He told me that there were one hundred & fifty Methodist Preachers on the cars going up on Monday & they had been furnished with a paper stating where they were to stay.

	The Governors Message is pretty fierce & firery.  Col. Watts enquired after you.  Col. Hayne also.  Young DeTreville who once was at our house came up & spoke to me yesterday.  He is very much improved.  I have only�to �Rhett at a distance & not yet spoken to him.  

	I hope you are getting on well with our Methodist friends, the children & the servants.   

	The Governor has one of Dr. Fairs houses and Col. Allen has another.  But Janney has a greater crowd than I ever saw.  Yeadon has gone to Roaches old House.  I am sorry for that.  [Joseph Daniel] Pope is here & is as lively as ever.  Memminger came today & Judge Frost.  I sit at Dr. LeContes table with Pope & others by invitation of Mrs. LeConte.  She sits at the head of the table & assigned me a seat on her left & the Dr. on her right.  Pope said to him she was the presiding Empress of our table.

	I have bought a new hat & waistcoat.  The weather is very warm& I cannot wear my overcoat.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  God bless you & children.  Give my respects to Mr. Stacy & Ship[p].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
