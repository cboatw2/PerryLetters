My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just finished drinking my tea, have left Mamma & the girls & have come upstairs to write to you.\'a0 I would have written yesterday, but I had been shopping from after breakfast until 3 oclock & was so much fatigued that in the afternoon I was obliged to lie down, & in the evening Aunt Eliza & Aunt Hayne took tea with us.\'a0 I have been in King street all of the morning, but as I rode I do not feel so much fatigued as yesterday.\'a0 I have bought a great many articles & priced almost all, some things are dearer & some \ul cheaper\ulnone  than I expected.\'a0 When I tell you what I have given for the different things you must not scold, for what I have given a high price for, I have made up\'a0 by giving a low price for other things.\'a0 I have bought carpeting for the Drawing room $2. a yard & the dining room $1.40.\'a0 To make up I have gone without a chamber carpet, & have got the Entry & staircase carpet \ul very\ulnone  \ul cheap\ulnone , only 50 cts a yd, & \ul beautiful\ulnone ; the oil cloth would have been for the Entry $40, for it is a dollar & a half by the \ul square\ulnone  \ul yd\ulnone  & the carpeting for the Entry has cost only $17.50, & the staircase $12.50 cts.\'a0 For the entry & staircase carpeting I have given but $30 & the oil\'a0 cloth for the \ul Entry\ulnone  \ul only\ulnone  would have\'a0 been $40.00.\'a0 In addition to going without the chamber carpet, I have determined to buy \ul one\ulnone  Calico dress only, & I think I will even go without a shawl.\'a0 I consult \ul good\ulnone  \ul judges\ulnone  as to the carpeting, & they advised me to think of the quality, & instead of getting such as would last one or two winters, give more & get carpets that would wear well for \ul years\ulnone .\'a0 All of the carpeting I have got for the two rooms, Entry & staircase comes to $170.00 & if I have given \ul less \ulnone for the carpeting & bought a chamber carpet, it would have come to more.\'a0 But I think I have argued the subject sufficiently, & if you see me favourably inclined to one side, your natural disposition will lead you\'a0 to take the other, & you will never be convinced that I am right.\'a0 I have tried to act for the best & if even you \ul my\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone , do not approve of my conduct I will not be unhappy, for my \ul conscience\ulnone  acquits me.\'a0 I have bought a pair of Astral Lamps for $30, a pair of Pitchers $4.50, a pretty little pair of castors $3.00, nice plated ones are $12, or 14.\'a0 The pair I have got are a new kind & \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone .\'a0 I have got two pair of glass candle sticks $1.00, a pair of Decanters $8.00.\'a0 Other articles I have \ul priced\ulnone  but not bought.\'a0 Tomorrow I intend to look at spoons, Mantel glass, Fenders, Andirons &c.\'a0 Shopping is very fatiguing.\'a0 Sometimes I am inclined to buy a thing at the store I am at, rather than go further.\'a0 I have never been so worried in\'85& constantly thinking can I afford this, can I afford that.\'a0 Shopping is pleasant when you have \ul plenty\ulnone  of money, but not when you are limited to a little sum.\'a0 However you must have \ul confidence\ulnone  in me & \ul believe\ulnone  that \ul all\ulnone  I do is right, & that I have a \ul better\ulnone  \ul judgement \ulnone & more \ul experience\ulnone  in these things than you. I will stop with this subject, & write of what will interest you more.\'a0 You did not expect my first letter to you to be filled up with \ul one\ulnone  subject, \ul shopping\ulnone .\'a0 I will now write of \ul you\ulnone , \ul myself\ulnone  & \ul others\ulnone .\'a0 I \ul miss\ulnone  you a great \ul deal\ulnone , & would have \ul even\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone , if I had not been so engaged in King street.\'a0 Last night I thought sleep had forsaken me.\'a0 I lay so long awake, I suppose it was because I had not \ul you\ulnone \'a0 to caress & put me to sleep.\'a0 I hope it will not be the case tonight.\'a0 You must write to me \ul often\ulnone  to make up for your absence.\'a0 I promise to answer \ul every\ulnone  \ul letter\ulnone , which will be doing \ul well\ulnone , so engaged as I am.\'a0 You recollect last year I was not so punctual, but I\'a0 love you \ul more\ulnone  \ul now\ulnone , than I did \ul then\ulnone .\'a0 I take more pleasure in writing to you.\'a0 My love for my husband is \ul great\ulnone .\'a0 Your wife \ul longs\ulnone  to see you.\'a0 The Diamond Rings are finished, & are \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone .\'a0 Susan & Ann are delighted with them.\'a0 I think they are \ul prettier\ulnone  than the one you first gave me.\'a0 It is a nice guard to my wedding ring.\'a0 I am writing with a very bad pen.\'a0 You must excuse both composition & penmanship.\'a0\'a0 I feel \ul quite\ulnone  \ul tired\ulnone .\'a0 I expect to hear from you on Saturday.\'a0 I hope I will not be disappointed.\'a0 Believe me, your \ul affectionate\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone , E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you yesterday and answered it immediately, but in reading my answer today, I am not altogether pleased with it, and have determined to write another.\'a0 In future\'a0 I will always send a letter the day I write it, for if you keep it any time, and read it over often, you find so many errors to correct, that you are not satisfied, and in the end destroy it. I was as usual very happy to hear from you.\'a0 When deprived of your \ul presence\ulnone , my greatest pleasure is to \ul hear \ulnone as \ul often\ulnone  as I can, that you are \ul well\ulnone , \ul happy\ulnone  and \ul enjoying\ulnone  yourself. I am sorry my supposed neglect has been the occasion of ruffling your good temper, but I do not think I have neglected you.\'a0 I have not only answered all of your letters but written others besides, which now I am very sorry I sent, as you thought me unkind, and your feelings were hurt. Never mention that word \ul purchases\ulnone  to me.\'a0 I am sick and tired of it.\'a0 If I have been unkind, and neglected you, that has been the occasion of it.\'a0 If you have reproached me, that word has occasioned your reproaches.\'a0 This is the last letter I am to write to you, and I expect to receive but one more from you. Thursday morning you will be here, and I assure you, you return to a wife who loves you, she loves the husband who now returns to her, more than the \ul lover\ulnone  she greeted last year. Mamma and Susan are waiting for me to go out with them.\'a0 This is my excuse for a short letter.\'a0 Excuse the paper on which I have written.\'a0 If you are as interesting as you were last year, it is unnecessary to make an apology. Last night was most tempestuous, yet today is\'85. Uncle Wm is married last Tuesday in the country.\'a0 Believe me, \ul Yours\ulnone  \ul very\ulnone  \ul affectionately\ulnone , E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter last Wednesday, and it gave me \ul much\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 A week has not elapsed yet since I have written to you, but as I think you would like to hear a little oftener than \ul once\ulnone  a week, I will not write you a few lines.\'a0 I will try to write to you \ul twice \ulnone a week.\'a0 If that is not \ul too often\ulnone , perhaps you have not leisure to \ul read \ulnone my letters, if so, tell me.\'a0 \ul You \ulnone must only write to \ul me\ulnone  when at \ul leisure\ulnone , and \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul convenient\ulnone .\'a0 I do not wish your letters to interfere with any \ul business\ulnone  \ul whatever\ulnone .\'a0 If I do not hear from you I have too much \ul vanity\ulnone  to think it proceeds from \ul neglect\ulnone .\'a0I read your letter in the Mountaineer this morning, and I am glad I did, as it gives me an opportunity of expressing my opinion, and advising you with regard to some of the subjects that will come up before the Legislature for discussion.\'a0\'a0 For instance the Rail Road.\'a0 I \ul hope\ulnone  the State \ul will\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  give her security for the loan of a million of dollars.\'a0 She has involved herself already, and has better get out of the difficulty as fast as she can, instead of involving herself further.\'a0 The Rail Road was too great an undertaking ever to have been commenced by one State, and everyone has come to that conclusion, though afraid to express it.\'a0 Let the company go on as well as they can, with individual aid, and not impose upon the generosity of the State.\'a0 If they fail, it is well they should at once, without going any further.\'a0 I think my arguments have convinced you, If you were of the contrary opinion.\'a0 I will therefore proceed to the next subject. Retailing Spirits.\'a0 If you read those resolutions passed in Colleton with regard to temperance, you have my opinions.\'a0 I do not think the Legislature ought to act on the subject yet.\'a0 Wait until it has been longer before the people.\'a0 Try other means, before prohibiting the Retailing.\'a0 Next Session, (when you are again elected) will be time enough for the Legislature to consider the subject. Your bill to make Judges go out of office at sixty, is a very good one, if you expect to go in, when one comes out.\'a0 I think it will generally be approved, except by the Judges and their families.\'a0 If it affects those presiding at present, you will lose the vote of Judge Gantts family.\'a0 However as I suppose they are not of much influence in the district, I can get over that objection. Although you are from home, I wish you not only to be \ul satisfied\ulnone , but \ul happy\ulnone  (as I am).\'a0 I would think you would find it very pleasant in Columbia, and after a time when the Conventions are over, it will not be so crowded.\'a0 If you mind being absent from me, the next time perhaps I may go with you.\'a0 Next year our expenses will be so much less than this, that we may have a little money to spare, and it will be quite a pleasant trip.\'a0 You must write a description of the Bride (Mrs. Cunningham).\'a0 I dare say she is pretty.\'a0 If I was Pamela I would have forgiven her for marrying my brother; gone to Columbia in their company, and passed a delightful Session. I received a letter from Susan last Mail.\'a0 She says Mamma has received your letter, and it has given her \ul great\ulnone  satisfaction.\'a0 She says they are all much obliged to you for the trouble you have taken about the house, that now Uncle Robert is gone, they would rather be next you than anyone; that Uncle Arthur is enthusiastic about you (so \ul I\ulnone  say, take care and behave well to him), and that Mamma considers herself favored to have such a Son in law.\'a0 They are pleased with the plan of the house; only wish it higher from the ground if possible.\'a0Mrs. Mays came to see me the other day.\'a0 She says the baby looks like both of us.\'a0 She seemed though to think he looked most like you.\'a0 [word obscured] he has your smile.\'a0 She admired him greatly.\'a0 I like her very much.\'a0 The weather has been so bad I have not been out once since you left, and have seen no one, but Mrs. Mays & Sally Sloane, except Robert who has been here twice every day, after Breakfast and at Tea.\'a0 He goes tonight in the Stage. The Servants do \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , even \ul James\ulnone  attends to his business.\'a0 The Cow gives as much Milk as usual.\'a0 Victoria is well.\'a0 Minerva burned the Chimneys this morning.\'a0 It was raining at the time.\'a0 Willy is quite well, and has \ul grown\ulnone  since you left.\'a0 He improves every day in beauty & interest.\'a0 He sleeps at night in my \ul arms\ulnone , and we have \ul good\ulnone  nights.\'a0 I am not much disturbed.\'a0 I kissed him for you.\'a0 He was in my lap when I read your letter, and he seemed anxious to devour its contents.\'a0 He is a \ul precious\ulnone  \ul little\ulnone  \ul darling\ulnone .\'a0 I am afraid I am not \ul thankful\ulnone  enough for him.\'a0 Delia is very fond of him, and makes him a goo[d] nurse. I must soon stop writing, as I have to writ[page torn] by Robert.\'a0 Excuse the bad writing.\'a0 I write[page torn]\'a0 hurry with a bad pen.\'a0 I pass my time q[page torn] ly; get up early, and do not go to bed until[page torn] am occupied all day, and find the days quite short.\'a0 Do send the Shoes and other things by the first opportunity.\'a0 The Shoes, Gaiter boots I mean will save my buying stockings. Hoping to hear soon from you, and that you are quite well and happy.\'a0 I remain your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Having rained the whole week, the walking is so bad, I have not been able to go to church today, and as the baby is quiet with Delia, and I am now at leisure, I think I cannot spend a part of the day better than in writing to you, particularly as I this morning read the Services for the day, and one of Bradley\'92s good sermons, so my conscience acquits me. I hope this letter will arrive in time to \ul prevent\ulnone  your doing what has \ul worried\ulnone  me since I received your last.\'a0 Buy a \ul Rattle\ulnone  for the baby at \ul $6.50\ulnone !\'a0 My husband, how could you think of such a thing when I told you to buy a Rattle.\'a0 I meant a common Straw one, such as I have seen for 25 cts or 50 cts at furthest.\'a0 If we were rich, and had money to throw away, I would not spend such a sum on a\'85to be and you to buy a \ul Rattle\ulnone  for $6.50.\'a0 If you had the money to spare, and had got something useful, or entertaining, such as a Waggon for him, or a Musical box for me, I would have no objection, but to give so large a sum for a handsome toy, when you could have got a common one, for little or nothing, to answer the same purpose. Is what provokes me.\'a0 I think it an actual sin to spend money in such a way, and can hardly think you have done it.\'a0 If you have, do I beseech you carry the Rattle back to the Jeweller, and get him to exchange it for something more useful or interesting.\'a0 If you can think of nothing else, a \ul Musical\ulnone  \ul Box\ulnone , if it does not cost more than $6.50, which you know I always said when we\'a0 had money to spare I would like to \ul have\ulnone , but if you can think of anything more useful get it.\'a0 \ul Do\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  \ul keep\ulnone  \ul the\ulnone  \ul Rattle\ulnone .\'a0 The bell I bought the other day for 37 \'bd cts will answer the same purpose.\'a0 For once get over your scruples about changing your mind, and exchange the Rattle, the prettier it is, the more loth I would be to put it in a baby\'92s hand.\'a0 The \ul little\ulnone  \ul Waggon \ulnone I would like to have \ul above\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone  \ul things\ulnone .\'a0 That would be \ul indeed\ulnone  \ul useful\ulnone .\'a0 Willie should ride in it every day.\'a0 If you have no other way of getting it home, you must box it up and bring it in the Stage.\'a0 I would deny myself of anything to get it for Willie.\'a0 Riding will be such an amusement for him.\'a0 I will be disappointed if you do not get him the waggon, and truly grieved if you bring home the Rattle.\'a0 I do hope you have \ul not\ulnone  \ul bought\ulnone  it, or if bought it, that you will \ul exchange\ulnone  it.\'a0 In this instance my dear husband please your Wife. Your letters with that \ul one\ulnone  \ul exception\ulnone , have given me \ul much\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 I would like to hear every Mail, if writing to me does not interfere with your other business.\'a0 You have seen Professor Lieber.\'a0 Robert says he \ul has\ulnone  a Wife, that himself, his wife and son, have been at his father\'92s house. A \'93refresher\'94 in Mr. Alston\'92s case would be very acceptable, and cause you to be indebted to the settlers on Paris Mountain.\'a0 Judge Butler\'92s reason for liking you was a very good one. I have not been out of the house since you left.\'a0 It has rained every day until today, the Sun is shining beautifully, but the ground is wet.\'a0 Mr. Townes has a son.\'a0 Minerva says she heard it is so small it can get in a quart cup, that it must have been born prematurely.\'a0 I do not know that this is \ul correct\ulnone .\'a0 I only heard it from \ul Minerva\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Sloane is to move into Mr. Roberts\'92 house next week.\'a0 Roberts left yesterday morning.\'a0 He has been to see me \ul twice\ulnone  every day since you left, after breakfast, and at supper.\'a0\'a0 When he bid me good bye, he said, \'93he was much obliged to you and me for our kindness to him.\'94\'a0 I sent by him the box your recollect Aunt Elizabeth Hayne left with me.\'a0 I put in it a pin cushion apiece for Susan and Ann; a little Shoe for Susan Hayne;\'85box I filled up with eatables for Robert.\'a0 I have finished making Delia\'92s Calico dress.\'a0 It is made as nicely as Margaret could have made it.\'a0 She looks so improved in it you would hardly know her.\'a0 I am afraid Willy even feels strangely in her arms.\'a0 This last mentioned personage is \ul now\ulnone  \ul asleep\ulnone  in the cradle.\'a0 May he have a \ul long\ulnone  \ul nap\ulnone .\'a0 I love him more and more every day.\'a0 He increases in interest daily. I think I may get a letter from you this evening, so will stop writing, as I may wish to add a little more tonight.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have this moment received your letter.\'a0 How \ul delighted\ulnone  I am that you have not purchased the Rattle.\'a0 I have almost a mind to tear up this letter and write another, \ul omitting\ulnone  the \ul scold\ulnone , but I think I will let it remain so, as it may serve you as a lesson for the future.\'a0 You must if you are able to get the Waggon and send it home some way or other. Wills hat fits to perfection.\'a0 It is a little beauty, and so becoming to him, you would scarcely believe \ul I\ulnone  made it.\'a0 It is made of striped silk, & the rim turned up.\'a0 I have made one for the society of the same shape. They gave me the materials.\'a0 We have not met since you left as it rained yesterday.\'a0 He has only been to Mrs. Sloanes once.\'a0 I intend sending him to Mrs. Hoke\'92s soon.\'a0 Mrs. Gower sent for him this evening, but he was asleep.\'a0 When he has a \ul carriage\ulnone  \ul of\ulnone  \ul his\ulnone  \ul own\ulnone , he shall go out a great deal. James does quite well.\'a0 Victoria\'92s misconduct was not his fault.\'a0 It seems to me Rose gives as much Milk as usual.\'a0 I have now a bowl full of Cream.\'a0 Carlos has acted badly.\'a0 She almost killed the Duck.\'a0 I thought it had better be put to death, but contrary to my expectations it has recovered.\'a0 The other night after I was in bed, & the candle put out, I heard him howling in the Drawing room.\'a0 Delia was obliged to come down & let him out, and this evening he was at the front door & knocking & looking for admittance in a furious manner.\'a0 He was turned away with the broom stick.\'a0 Uncle Arthur had better give up all thoughts of Presiding & quietly go home & preside over his own household.\'a0 Good night, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was disappointed last night in not hearing from you.\'a0 I believe no Columbia package arrived, or if it did nothing for me.\'a0 I received a letter from Susan, which in some measure made up for not hearing from you. Your Waggons from Pickens arrived yesterday.\'a0 The Man (I do not know his name) says the agreement was to bring one Waggon for 95 dollars, and the \ul wooden\ulnone  part of another Waggon of the same size for 25 dollars, which made up the debt of a hundred dollars.\'a0 He says the Waggon was not to have been \ul painted\ulnone , but someone offered to paint it, if he could have the use of it for a few days, and he drove it to some place (E\'85I believe) and was offered 90 dollars right off for the Waggon, so that though you have got it for 75 dollars only.\'a0 You can sell it for 90 dollars.\'a0 It is a Red Waggon, and is now standing in the Stable yard.\'a0 The pieces of the other Waggon, I have had put in the Lumber room, that they may not be exposed to the rain.\'a0 A Blacksmith will have to put them together.\'a0 You must expect in parting with the Waggon to ask \ul 90 dollars\ulnone . The weather is now good, and has given me an opportunity of returning some of my visits, and of others coming to see me.\'a0 Tuesday Miss Harrison & Charlotte Smith came, and afterwards Mr. Pinckney, who said, he was afraid I might be sick as I was not at church on Sunday, so had come to see me.\'a0 He was very kind, and said his Sister was coming to see me, to ask me to spend the day with them this week.\'a0 So accordingly Miss Pinckney came yesterday, paid me a long visit, and said, I must take my work, and my baby, and go early tomorrow morning and spend the day with them, so I am to dine with them tomorrow.\'a0 Miss McBee afterwards came and then Mrs. Dr. Butler.\'a0 I showed Mrs. Butler the hat I had made for my baby, and she admired it so much, and said \ul her\ulnone  \ul baby\ulnone  was \ul greatly\ulnone  in want of one, and that she did not know \ul where\ulnone  she could get one, that I offered to \ul make\ulnone  her one, furnish the Silk and all.\'a0 You know she has been kind in sending us things, and she admires Willy so much, that she has quite won my heart.\'a0 So I intend to deny myself of something or other I may need, and spend the money in getting the materials to make the hat for her baby.\'a0 I assure you I am so beautiful a Milliner, that if reduced I could even gain a livelihood, by bringing into use my accomplishments in that line.\'a0 Miss McBee said she had no idea I was so ingenious, that one not accustomed or \ul obliged\ulnone  to work, should work so beautifully.\'a0 I told her, since I could recollect I always had been fond of my needle, that we \ul all\ulnone  could work.\'a0 I commenced showing her how to knit Socks. Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Coleman came to see me, but I was out.\'a0 I had gone to see Mrs. Hoke and Mrs. Townes.\'a0 Mrs. Townes\'92 baby is really the \ul ugliest\ulnone  \ul little\ulnone  \ul thing\ulnone  I have ever seen, though rather \ul too\ulnone  \ul large\ulnone  to get into a \ul quart\ulnone  \ul cup\ulnone .\'a0 It was born a month too soon, so Mrs. Gordon says it will \ul sleep\ulnone  for \ul one\ulnone  \ul month\ulnone  instead of being able to\'85like Willy.\'a0 It looks as if it hardly \ul breathed\ulnone .\'a0 It is a weak, puny little thing, but do not \ul mention\ulnone  what I say to anyone, as it may seem \ul ill\ulnone  \ul natured\ulnone , but I only tell the truth.\'a0 I carried Will with me, and Mrs. Townes says he is the \ul prettiest\ulnone  \ul baby\ulnone  she has ever seen.\'a0 She thanked me kindly for some Syllabubs I had sent her the day before, & which she said were the \ul nicest\ulnone  she had ever tasted.\'a0 Mrs. Wm Roberts was there and as she held Willy, she said, \'93this baby is just ten days older than mine would have been.\'94\'a0 I felt \ul sorry\ulnone  when I thought what \ul comfort\ulnone  she had been deprived of.\'a0 Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Sloane\'92s daughter seems an amiable lady. The Servants have all gone to the \ul Show\ulnone .\'a0 It has been the subject of conversation for days past, so I told them if they behaved well, I would give them 25 cts apiece & let them go.\'a0 Minerva & Delia, so I gave them quarter of a dollar, but James staid so long last night at the Post office playing, I was obliged to send Delia after him so I would not give him the money but have made him pay his \ul own\ulnone  \ul expenses\ulnone .\'a0 They have all three just gone off, so Willy and me are alone.\'a0 He is on the carpet amusing himself. Mrs. Butler says it is paying Willy \ul no\ulnone  \ul compliment\ulnone , but he is the image of you, particularly his \ul nose\ulnone  (which you know is the exact opposite to yours).\'a0 Willy\'92s eyes are particularly admired & are pronounced by all, \'93\ul very\ulnone  \ul fine\ulnone  \ul eyes\ulnone .\'94\'a0 Everything said of my \ul husband\ulnone  & \ul child\ulnone  goes \ul straight\ulnone  to \ul my\ulnone  \ul heart\ulnone .\'a0 I have quite forgotten myself. All seem \ul very\ulnone  \ul kind\ulnone  to me, now that I am alone.\'a0 Dr. Crook has been to see me \ul twice\ulnone  and even Mr. Wells, when he came to get your Office key, said \'93recollect if you wish anything call upon some of us.\'94\'a0 I had the baby in my arms, and he said , \'93it was a remarkably fine baby.\'94\'a0 I get along astonishingly.\'a0 Dr. Crook said, \'93who would think for a Charleston g[page torn] come up here, keep house so well \ul alone\ulnone \'85a little \ul Soldier\ulnone .\'a0 Delia and little William are my protectors at night.\'a0 Minerva takes care of the Kitchen & James.

Dr. Crook offered to take me to see the Giraffe, but I did not care to go.\'a0 Augustus Hoke has this moment come to ask me to go.\'a0 He is the \ul image\ulnone  of his \ul Father\ulnone , even his \ul manner\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma prefers a \ul small\ulnone  \ul door\ulnone  between her Drawing & Dining Rooms &[word obscured] \ul Railing\ulnone , what I call \ul Banisters\ulnone  to her back steps.\'a0I have come to the\'85of the sheet my dear husband, & Willy is crying.\'a0 I am quite \ul well\ulnone , & hope to hear by the next mail that \ul you\ulnone  \ul are\ulnone ; so adieu for the present.\'a0 Your ever affectionate wife, E.F.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received two letters from you.\'a0 There must have been some mistake in the Mail, or I would have received one last Friday.\'a0 I am anxious to see the things you have purchased, but you must run no risk in sending them; wait for a safe opportunity.\'a0 Do not purchase the Rattle.\'a0 The Waggon (unless it costs \ul too\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , for if it costs a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone  I do not wish you to buy it).\'a0 You must contrive some way of bringing home.\'a0 Could you not box it up, and bring it behind the Stage, as if it were a trunk?\'a0 The Waggons that carry cotton to Columbia, are these not returning by the way of Greenville in which you could send a box? You have not mentioned Col. Brockman.\'a0 I suppose you see him often.\'a0 You must not forget \ul Greenville\ulnone  \ul friends\ulnone .\'a0 You are everything to them.\'a0 I think you might as well have given Mr. Powell a certificate.\'a0 I am not sorry he is rejected.\'a0 I feared him as your rival.\'a0 I see by the papers your bill has not passed. Mrs. Beattie came to see me yesterday.\'a0 She said she had heard such accounts of my baby, that though she did not owe me a visit, she had come to see \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 She said Willy is thought the prettiest baby in the village.\'a0 \ul That\ulnone  however is no compliment; the baby\'92s here are so ugly.\'a0 Willy might be the \ul prettiest\ulnone  and yet \ul ugly\ulnone  \ul still\ulnone .\'a0 \ul I\ulnone \'a0 think him the prettiest baby in the \ul State\ulnone .\'a0 He has not only pretty features, but he has a sweet, intelligent countenance.\'a0 He is so strong, lively, and active.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney said the other day looking at him, \'93you are certainly a \ul wise\ulnone  \ul looking\ulnone  little being,\'94 and Miss Pinckney said, he seemed ready to \ul fly\ulnone  \ul away\ulnone  with animation.\'a0 I am shortning his frocks a little, making them all the length of pin\'85 which you may recollect.\'a0 They are still a good ways below his feet.\'a0 Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Beattie and others say it is time for him now to be wearing \ul Shoes\ulnone , so if your \ul funds\ulnone  \ul allow\ulnone  \ul of\ulnone  \ul it\ulnone , I wish to buy him two or three pair of \ul Kid\ulnone  \ul Slippers\ulnone ; you can guess the size.\'a0 Remember the bootees that come up to the \ul ankle\ulnone , but \ul Shoes\ulnone , with a \ul Strap\ulnone  in the \ul back\ulnone , that comes\'85and ties in front.\'a0 If you have not money enough (I know it was pretty scarce with you) it is of no consequence.\'a0 Willy can by holding on to a Chair, \ul almost\ulnone  stand alone. I dined with Miss Pinckney last Friday, and spent a pleasant day.\'a0\'a0 Willy staid upstairs with the children.\'a0 There was no one there but myself.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney was engaged all day on business.\'a0 I only saw him at dinner, and a short time afterwards.\'a0 He seemed \ul depressed\ulnone .\'a0 I know he feels \ul deeply\ulnone  the death of his Wife, though he appears so cheerful in company.\'a0 He must feel her loss every moment on his \ul childrens\ulnone  account.\'a0 I know not a greater affliction that can befal[l] children, than to be deprived of their Mother in Infancy.\'a0 \ul No one\ulnone  can supply \ul her\ulnone  \ul place\ulnone .\'a0 No one else has that instinct, by which she knows at once all their wants, and how to supply them.\'a0 Neither do I know a greater affliction that can befall[l] a husband , than to be deprived of a Wife whom he has married in youth, whom he has fondly, devotedly loved, preferred to all the world beside, and to whom he has been accustomed to impart every thought, wish, and feeling.\'a0 The loss can never be supplied.\'a0 No, not even by a \ul second\ulnone  \ul Wife\ulnone . Mr. Pinckney lent me a Book to read on the \'93Lords Supper.\'94\'a0 I told Miss Pinckney she must return my visit.\'a0 They have things very plain.\'a0 It is a nicely furnished house; so \ul comfortless\ulnone , it has such a \ul bare\ulnone  \ul look\ulnone .\'a0 Large windows glaring open without curtains, a carpet not covering the whole of the room, no fenders &c; a small pine table, in the Dining Room, not even painted, answers as a Sideboard.\'a0 Even Minerva said, \'93Why Mistress. Mr. Pinckney must be very stingy; I never saw such a scant looking house.\'94\'a0 Yesterday the working society was to have met, but it rained.\'a0 So they have not met but \ul once\ulnone  since I joined it. Mrs. Coleman has been to see me \ul twice\ulnone , and left word she could never find me at home.\'a0 The weather has been such, I have been out \ul twice\ulnone  visiting since you left, and those times she came to see me.\'a0 Her little niece (Mr. Young\'92s daughter) is with her.\'a0 I will be so busy this week \ul working\ulnone , perhaps I will not be able to write again until next Sunday.\'a0 Perhaps as it is, I write \ul too\ulnone  \ul often\ulnone .\'a0 I only promised to write \ul once\ulnone  a week, & I have written \ul twice\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you have received \ul all\ulnone  of my \ul letters\ulnone .\'a0I did not know what I was undertaking when I promised Mrs. Butler to make her baby a hat.\'a0 She has sent me the size of the head, and it is larger than mine.\'a0 That must be my first employment.\'a0 I have also a Calico Cloak & Bonnet to make for Willy to wear in the yard; a flannel night dress for him; and some flannel shirts; also to shorten some of his frocks and petticoats; and enlarge his caps, besides mending for myself, and various other things.\'a0 Willy will be \ul six\ulnone  \ul months\ulnone  old tomorrow. I have been to church today morning and afternoon.\'a0 The wind is blowing now.\'a0 It seems to be getting quite cold.\'a0 Mr. Hooker has at last cleaned the roof of the house, and put in the glasses.\'a0 Allan has not done anything yet.\'a0 He says he is employed for his master, will come as soon as he can.\'a0 Carlos has at last \ul killed\ulnone  the Duck.\'a0 Jessie has not made her appearance.\'a0 Victoria is well.\'a0 Rose gives as much Milk as usual.\'a0 The Shoults get their [word obscured] portion of Food, so I suppose are satisfied.\'a0 Minerva, Delia and james were delighted with the \ul Show\ulnone .\'a0 For myself, \ul last\ulnone ; though not \ul least\ulnone ; I am suffering a little with pain in my face.\'a0 A \ul Wisdom\ulnone  \ul Tooth\ulnone  I think is coming.\'a0 I can hardly open my mouth wide enough to eat. Mr. Jacobs sends Butter every Friday, and I always weigh it.\'a0 Last Friday when the Butter came, we had not touched the Butter of the week before.\'a0 I have bought a bushel of Apples.\'a0 I like to give them to the Servants every now and then.\'a0 They are so fond of them.\'a0 I still have some of those left that you bought.\'a0 They improve from keeping.\'a0 I am sorry Wiliam Hayne is drooping.\'a0 I hope his prospects are not so. It is time to go to bed.\'a0 Willy is asleep in the Cradle, Delia on the Rug, and it is twenty minutes past ten oclock.\'a0 I commenced writing late, so good night my good husband.\'a0 Ever Your affectionate wife, E.F.

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received two letters from you last night.\'a0 Owing to some mistake in the Mail, I was disappointed twice last week in not hearing from you, so to make up I have received by each of the last two Mails two letters.\'a0 Last night I received a letter Dec. 2d, which ought to have been received before the letters that came Sunday night.\'a0 However it has at last come, and I dare say there will be no mistake again.\'a0As you say my letters give you \ul much\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 I will not write to you by \ul every\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry you are tired of Columbia, and so \ul impatient\ulnone  to get home.\'a0 If you know how \ul well\ulnone  Will and me get along, you would give yourself not a \ul moments\ulnone  concern about us.\'a0 He gives me not the \ul least\ulnone  \ul trouble\ulnone .\'a0 In the day Delia attends to him \ul entirely\ulnone , \ul except\ulnone  when I am nursing him, and at night I manage him so \ul well\ulnone , that I am thinking when you come back, you will be so much in the way, we will have to put you in \'93Old Missi\'92s chamber,\'94 as Delia calls it.\'a0 Will and myself are enough to occupy one bed.\'a0 Now do not give yourself \ul any\ulnone  \ul uneasiness\ulnone  about us, only envy me the happiness of being able to attend to him, and administer to his little wants.\'a0 I am afraid you would be rather \ul mortified\ulnone , if you saw how happy both he and me are during your absence.\'a0 I assure you we employ out time \ul very\ulnone  \ul pleasantly\ulnone , and are \ul very\ulnone  \ul happy\ulnone .\'a0 I do not even feel \ul lonely\ulnone . I am glad you are occupied, and that you think you are gaining a little reputation.\'a0 Oh! My dear husband, I do hope you will continue in the Legislature.\'a0 It is to your \ul interest\ulnone  that you should.\'a0 I think a \ul Lawyer\ulnone  should desire to be a member of the Legislature more than any other person.\'a0 I do not see why Col. Brockman wishes it.\'a0 It is no advantage to him, but to you it is,, and it is the wish of \ul my\ulnone  \ul heart\ulnone  that you may \ul still\ulnone  be a \ul member\ulnone .\'a0 I do \ul hope\ulnone  you \ul will\ulnone .\'a0 The next time perhaps you will be \ul Senator\ulnone .\'a0 You must be \ul quite\ulnone  \ul happy\ulnone  though away from me.\'a0 If you were not sometimes absent from home, you would not know how to value it, so the remainder of your time be \ul contented\ulnone  and \ul happy\ulnone .\'a0 Why do you not send \ul papers\ulnone , \ul pamphlets\ulnone  &c to Dr. Crook, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Earle and \ul all\ulnone  the \ul gentleman\ulnone  here?\'a0 You \ul must\ulnone , If you have not already done so.\'a0 I hope Mr. Powell will not \ul injure\ulnone  you. I would rather you have attended the Commencement of the College, and spent some \ul other\ulnone  \ul time\ulnone  in writing to me, for then you would have told me about it when you come home.\'a0 I mean to ask you many questions.\'a0 Miss Pinckney, Mrs. Sloane and others, say Mrs. J. Cunningham is not pretty, but that she is lively and pleasant, that she is remarkably short and thick.\'a0 It is a pity she dresses in bad taste.\'a0 Pamela is so particular and observant in dress.\'a0 John dresses well.\'a0 He ought to direct his Wife, as I did you.\'a0 You recollect what a change I made in your appearance.\'a0 By the by, have you had your hair cut?\'a0 And has the Barber disfigured you by cutting it too short? I have not seen anything of Mr. Blassinghame.\'a0 I went to see Miss Williford\'92s the other evening, and on the way stopped and showed the baby to Mrs. Curtis.\'a0 She was much gratified & praised him very\'85says he looks like you.\'a0 Miss Margaret Williford says he looks like Ann particularly his mouth & chin.\'a0 Mrs. Service says he looks like me.\'a0 Mrs. [word obscured] yesterday sent me some Jelly.\'a0 Mrs. Sloane this week has borrowed eggs from me.\'a0 Mrs. Hoke has sent for Milk.\'a0 Mrs. Mooney Milk, Mrs. Horton Milk and Meal twice.\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  have \ul ceased\ulnone  \ul borrowing\ulnone  & \ul never\ulnone  will again, because I have an independent spirit.\'a0 It gives me pleasure to give or lend (except to Mrs. Horton who is too en\'85ing).\'a0 It shows I am friendly with my neighbours, and that they think me willing to oblige, but I myself will never borrow.\'a0 The reason I wish you my dear husband to economize, is that you may put up money enough, to render us always independent.\'a0 Until this house is paid for I feel uneasy.\'a0 If you have not spent much money in books I will not \ul scold\ulnone , but you know how much [two words obscured] you have already.\'a0 I am sorry Uncle Arthur is so foolish to continue a Candidate. So Mr. McBee is president of the Rail Road Company.\'a0 Pity so rich a man should have an addition of $4000 a year.\'a0 He ought to attend to it for \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 Have you heard anything of William and Pamela?\'a0 Is Mr. Cunningham in Columbia? I always thought Mamma had about $30,000 that if divided equally among us we would have $10,000 apiece, $22,000 in money, 8000 for house and 2000 for negroes would be $32,000.\'a0 I do not see why $5,000 is too much to invest in house and lands.\'a0 The money the house sells for in town will pay for the Greenville place, and Mamma will have the same money to live on she had in town, which will go further here, and bring higher interest.\'a0 I suppose she could not build a house \ul much\ulnone  cheaper, to be comfortable, than [page torn] she is to build.\'a0 It is the \ul land\ulnone  that is so expensive, 50 dollars an acre, though perhaps she could not get it cheaper [word obscured].\'a0 Judge Earle\'92s place is \ul too\ulnone  \ul far\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma would be willing to live on less every year, to enable her to get a place that she fancies, & near the village.\'a0 I wish now her land was just next Mrs. Hornbuckles, as it is, it is rather far.\'a0 However I will \ul talk\ulnone  about all this; writing it takes up too much paper.\'a0If Mr. Brown is in Columbia taking likenesses as he did last year, I wish you would have yours taken \ul without\ulnone  your \ul hat\ulnone .\'a0 I would value it much. I have a \ul commission\ulnone  for you, and if you wish to \ul please\ulnone  me, you must \ul execute\ulnone  it, if \ul within\ulnone  \ul your\ulnone  \ul power\ulnone .\'a0 It is this I wish you to get for me, \'93some \ul pieces\ulnone  of \ul Morocoo\ulnone  of \ul different\ulnone  \ul colours\ulnone .\'94\'a0 You can get it at a Shoemakers or Sadlers.\'a0 I suppose you could get a good parcel for 75 cts or 1 dollar.\'a0 I do not know the price however.\'a0 I wish it to make boxes, pin cushions, needle hooks &c.\'a0 If you can get the Morocoo \ul reasonable\ulnone , \ul do\ulnone  \ul get\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone  \ul some\ulnone , but if they ask a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone , you \ul need\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 At any rate inquire the price.At a Shoemakers or Sadlers, & if it is \ul reasonable\ulnone  \ul remember\ulnone , get me some.\'a0 With this request my dear husband I must close my letter.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you in which you mention you may perhaps be at home Friday night.\'a0 It was what I was thinking you would do; for it the Legislature adjourns the 19
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  you will either have to leave Columbia the day it adjourns, or remain there a day after it adjourns.\'a0 I knew you would prefer the former to the latter plan.\'a0 The letter that arrived Friday night, I will answer now along with the one that has just come.\'a0 This will be my last letter, as it is probable you will leave Columbia before another one would reach there.\'a0 In Wednesday\'92s letter you will tell me whether certainly you will be at home Friday night. You were mistaken in thinking Mrs. Butler meant to \ul compliment\ulnone  you when she said Will looked like you; it was the \ul reverse\ulnone , she said, it was paying \ul Willy\ulnone  \ul no\ulnone  \ul compliment\ulnone  but he certainly looked like you.\'a0 I was quite \ul offended\ulnone  that she should think you so \ul ugly\ulnone ; that it was no compliment to look like you.\'a0 I try to trace a resemblance myself though in vain; with the exception of the forehead where the hair grows.\'a0 I recollect when he was first born, I felt disappointed when I heard Mrs. Sloane say, \'93he looks like his Mother.\'94\'a0 I was in hopes he looked like his Father. The tale about John Cunningham is a bad one, I have no doubt \ul true\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. L\'85man would have no object in inventing it.\'a0 You recollect he told you in Greenville he had a note against him, for Jewels purchased for Miss Noble.\'a0 I suppose John found he could gain Miss Noble very easily without making her expensive presents; so changed his mind about giving her the Jewels.\'a0 You had better call\'a0 and inquire after Aunt Brewton.\'a0 She will be pleased with the attention, though she may not see you.\'a0 I thought perhaps William if he was still engaged would go to see Pamela before he returned home. I like Mr. Burt and hope he may be elected Attorney General though as I have heard nothing about it, perhaps he may not have the chance.\'a0 Mr. Bailey may not have resigned. Mr. Wells paid me a long visit last Friday.\'a0 He came to bring two Mountaineers that the boy had not brought the last two Fridays.\'a0 We had quite a chat, on matters & things in general.\'a0 I told him my fears of Mr. Powell, that he might injure you.\'a0 He was Jobs comforter.\'a0 He said Mr. Powell was indeed to be dreaded, that he was now a desperate man, capable of anything.\'a0 He says a great many here are dissatisfied with Mr. McBee\'92s election.\'a0 Dr. Crooks, Mr. Hoke and others.\'a0 I myself should think they could have elected a more competent one, one more distinguished, and publicly [word obscured] would give greater reputation to the Road.\'a0 I expect Mr. McBee feels as Genl Thompson says, Mr. Walker felt the morning after he received the solicitation to be Candidate for Congress, \'93a great man.\'94\'a0 Mr. Wells says Greenville like all villages is a backbiting sea which place, so many families are on bad terms.\'a0I am glad you have purchased Will a Waggon.\'a0 I have seen the kind of Chair you describe.\'a0 I am sorry now we got one from Mr. Harley, though it will do for him when he is older.\'a0 I have been thinking of the books you have purchased, & think you were \ul right\ulnone  not to let so cheap an opportunity pass.\'a0 I am \ul anxious\ulnone  to see them as well as the other things you have purchased.\'a0 What a pleasant evening we will spend next Friday looking at them.\'a0 I hope to see the \ul Coloured\ulnone  \ul Morocoo\ulnone  & \ul Willy\'92s\ulnone  \ul shoes\ulnone  among them.\'a0 I am also anxious to see your \ul accompaniments\ulnone  as you. You will find Willy [word obscured] improved, for he improves every day.\'a0 He is certainly the most interesting baby I have ever seen.\'a0 He now eats \'93Homoney\'94 at Breakfast & Supper, and I put a bone or peice of Meati in his [word obscured] at dinner.\'a0 I must tell you how economical I have been in dressing him.\'a0 You may perhaps recollect a Coloured Muslin dress I had when I was married blue & brown figures.\'a0 I wore it very seldom, so it was almost as good as new, but I had so outgrown it, that it was never altered to fit me.\'a0 Well!\'a0 I have cut it up, & will be able to make \ul three\ulnone  dresses for him out of it;\'a0\'a0 one I have almost finished and he shall have it on the night you arrive.\'a0 I have made him a nice Calico cloak to wear in the yard.\'a0 His Gingham bonnet I have not made yet.\'a0 Since he was born. I have done a stich of work for myself.\'a0 It gives me much pleasure to attend to him. I went to church this morning, but not this evening the wind blew so high.\'a0 The Working Society has not met one since you were away.\'a0 The weather has been so bad.\'a0 I have thoughts of inviting Miss Pinckney to dine here on Tuesday, if I can provide her with something to eat.\'a0 I must try and get some Eggs, & Mary Croft will assist Minerva in making what is necessary.\'a0 I wish if I \ul can\ulnone  to return [page torn] invitation.\'a0Mrs. Butler was here yesterday.\'a0 She came to hear [words obscured] & thought perhaps you had mentioned Mr. R\'85 P\'85& his family.\'a0 I told her of the books you had purchased, & when I told her of Scotts Commentaries, she said, she would like you to purchase \ul her\ulnone  a \ul set\ulnone , if it was the \ul Bible \ulnone & \ul Commentaries\ulnone  \ul together\ulnone  at \ul $4.50\ulnone .\'a0 Of course now you will not have time, and most probably no money to spare, but I mentioned it to you, as she told me to.\'a0 I am glad you purchased them for yourself.\'a0 They are so valuable.\'a0 Books cost so \ul much\ulnone , that they can be got cheap, it is well to get them.\'a0 That large Bible you got last year, persons think cost 15 or 20 dollars, & you know it only cost five. Jessy this evening made her appearance in company with Judge Earle\'92s boy.\'a0 She is now in the Stable.\'a0 Mrs. Griffin came yesterday to know if you would buy any Cider if she sent it.\'a0 I said yes; about 30 gallons.\'a0 Allen has not been here to do anything.\'a0 It is now past 9 time to go to bed.\'a0 This is my last letter to you for a long time. I expect to hear once more from you.\'a0 Ever Your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am happy to be able to inform you, that Willy is \ul convalescent\ulnone .\'a0 Dr. Earle last night said there was no need of his further attendance, that In a few days Willy would be well, & that soon he would ride out, & riding would do him good.\'a0 He thinks now of nothing but \ul eating\ulnone .\'a0 Has been fretting because I would not let him eat Jelly & sweet Wafers Mrs. Pearson sent him, & which Dr. Earle said were not good for him.\'a0 He said I must write & beg Grandma to send him some Puffs, & wishes he was well\'a0 & could dress. \'a0He is tired of bed.\'a0 He slept well last night. & this morning had a movement of the bowels without taking medicine.\'a0 Dr. Earle says all he will need now is a little Rhubarb & Magnesia when he is confined in his bowels, & must be prudent in eating, that after this sickness, which he calls Inflammatory Fever, he will be \ul stronger\ulnone  & \ul heartier\ulnone  than \ul before\ulnone , & grow\ul  fast\ulnone .\'a0 Dr. Crook was here this morning, & said Willy was doing well & might eat anything, but I will not follow that advice.\'a0\'a0\'a0 The rest of us are well.\'a0 Mamma is unwell. She has not been able to come in for two days.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Yancey came to see me yesterday; they leave next Monday.\'a0 How thankful you will be to hear Willy is so much better, you can stay at Anderson as long as you please.\'a0 Willy drinks Wine whey all day, & last night for his supper took two cups of hot water tea, one with biscuit soaked in it, the other with bread.\'a0 He is now awake, looking at me writing & looks as bright.\'a0 Dr. Crook would say as a new dollar.\'a0 Ever yours, Liz\

It gave me much pleasure, but it also has given me so much uneasiness, that I cannot rest until I have opened my mind to you.\'a0 You said you were busily engaged in the Legislature, making speeches on the Richland election.\'a0 I thought of course your speeches would be in favor of the Democratic Candidates, but in looking over the little pamphlet you sent, I saw that it was Mr. Rhett who introduced the resolution that Mr. Adams, Black &c. should take their seats, and as you had been speaking on Mr. Rhett\'92s side, I found to my utter astonishment that you had been making speeches in favor of the \ul Whigs\ulnone .\'a0 Your political course has really been inconsistent.\'a0 You are for Van Buren, yet against the Sub Treasury, a Democrat, yet making speeches in favor of the \ul Whigs\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to be careful how you act.\'a0 In the part you have taken in the discussion, they will have two subjects of complaint, first, that you have taken the part of the \ul Whigs\ulnone , and secondly, that you were on the same side in the discussion with the lower country members.\'a0 For instead of being on the side with Mr. Wardlaw, Henry, Thompson &c. you were on the side with Mr. Rhett, Phillips and others from the lower country.\'a0 You know Greenville is prejudiced against you, on the latter account, & I am afraid the prejudice with be increased.\'a0 I am afraid also you will be claimed by neither party, and supported by none at the next election.\'a0 You are really so calculated to distinguish yourself in public life; that, that is the reason I am anxious you should continue in the Legislature, and be careful how you act;\'85not offend your constituents, and cause them not to vote for you again.\'a0 You go to the Legislature, distinguish yourself, yet find it hard to be elected again while Earle, Smith\'a0 & Ware who I do not suppose will open their mouths except to say aye or no, will be again elected without the least difficulty.\'a0 The course they pursue, and perhaps the only one they \ul could\ulnone  pursue, though without honour to themselves, is certainly the safest for a reelection, but your course is different; you make speeches & distinguish yourself, but as it is impossible to please everyone, each speech you make displeases someone & in that way you make more enemies, than those harmless quiet ones do.\'a0 The long & the short of\'a0 [word obscured] this I wish you to remain in the Legislature.\'a0 I think it is a field whereon you can distinguish yourself.\'a0 I therefore wish you to be careful in the course you pursue that you may not offend your constituents and cause them not to vote for you again.\'a0 Always take the side of the upper country.\'a0 Do not\'a0 speak when it is unnecessary, and you may get yourself into trouble; recollect to introduce the resolution to repeal the fee bill; do not let anyone get the start of you.\'a0 I will stop writing for the present, with this advice after all act as you think best, but give my advice consideration.\'a0\

My dear husband, I have just received your second letter, and read it with much pleasure.\'a0 I am glad you pass your time so pleasantly.\'a0 You are now in the society suitable for you among refined intelligent gentleman, who know your value and appreciate your talents.\'a0 I wish it was your fortune always to mingle with such. You would then not find it so hard to obtain a seat in the Legislature.\'a0 There would be no office which they would not think it an \ul honour\ulnone  to bestow on you.\'a0 As it is your sad fate to dwell among an ignorant, conceited, anxious people who are ready to slander and find fault with you for everything you do.\'a0 You ought to be careful and judicious in the course you pursue, and not offend them so seriously as to be defeated at the next election.\'a0 You are so calculated to shine in public life that I wish you to continue in the Legislature as long as you can, & I am constantly uneasy lest you should do something to offend the people & cause them not to elect you.\'a0 You must not forget to be the first to introduce the fee bill.\'a0 You must always take sides with the upper country.\'a0 I would much rather you in debate be on the side with Mr. Wardlaw, Burt, Henry &c. than with Mr. Rhett & the lower country members, & you must associate with those from the upper country, \ul particularly\ulnone  your colleagues; be \ul very\ulnone  \ul kind\ulnone  to Mr. Earle, Simth, & Ware.\'a0 I wish you would be \ul very\ulnone  \ul attentive\ulnone  in sending pamphlets & other papers important or unimportant to your constituents.\'a0\'a0 I think they are \ul pleased\ulnone  when you do & \ul displeased\ulnone  when you do not.\'a0 Dr. Crook \ul told\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone  you sent him the Governors message.\'a0 \ul Write\ulnone  to him & some others too.\'a0 Last year Dr. Crook told me you were sending no papers home.\'a0 He expected you did not wish to be elected again.\'a0 I should think it delightful for one of your talents to be a member of the Legislature.\'a0 You can display them with such advantage there.\'a0 I would rather be in the Legislature than in Congress; would rather be distinguished & popular in my own state than anywhere else. Wiliam Hutson is a cousin of ours, & I believe a fine young man.\'a0 Thomas Fuller who I believe is a member; we knew \ul well\ulnone  in New Haven.\'a0 He married Miss Means a cousin of ours also, but we never saw her but once.\'a0 He invited us to his wedding.\'a0 Have you become acquainted with him?\'a0 Mr. Albert Rhett I regard as a friend.\'a0 I believe he had a sincere friendship for our family.\'a0 Our acquaintance commenced in New Haven.\'a0 Those we knew there we will never forget.\'a0 I always feel interested in hearing of him.\'a0 I liked him very much.\'a0 He invited us to his wedding.\'a0 He was quite intimate with Mamma.\'a0 I wonder if he recollects all about New Haven.\'a0 You may \ul remember\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone  to him if you think proper.\'a0 I am glad my letter gave you such pleasure.\'a0 Will is quite well & looks healthy.\'a0 Three of his jaw teeth have made there appearance.\'a0 I do not think he has forgotten you yet.\'a0 Dr. Crook was here the other evening.\'a0\'a0 Will went up to him & sat in his lap.\'a0 I think he knew it was not you, but he reminded him of you and he felt pleased to be in his arms.\'a0 You must tell Mr. Albert Rhett that I have a little son named William Hayne McCall.\'a0 Mamma has just been downstairs for a moment.\'a0 She says you must remember us all to Mr. Rhett & tell him we have never forgotten him; but always think of him with the greatest regard, and she hopes the friendship he once felt for one member of her family (now in another world) will be extended\'a0 and perpetuated in her & her remaining children.\'a0 You must call\'a0 & see Aunt Brewton when convenient, & be \ul kind\ulnone  to her.\'a0 She is so afflicted.\'a0 She feels kindness now particularly.\'a0\'a0\'a0 Do go & see her \ul soon\ulnone  & give our love to her.\'a0\'a0 Victoria does remarkably well.\'a0 We have abundance of Milk & cheese two or three times a week.\'a0 We make just enough butter for table use.\'a0 We have not slaughtered the hogs yet.\'a0 John is very busy at the house.\'a0 I expect he will not kill till you come back.\'a0 Mrs. McBee sent us some Sausages last night.\'a0 Dr. Crook promised to send some potatoes last night after supper.\'a0 John came up & said, \'93Mrs. Perry, James is thrown from the horse on his head.\'a0 I want you to give him some Turpentine.\'94\'a0 At first I did not understand him & thought he said the horse was thrown on its head.\'a0 I was relieved when I found it was James.\'a0 He said he felt rather unwell, so I told him not to ride the horse again, but let John water it.\'a0 Today I sent him to Dr. Crook\'92s to know if he ought to take anything.\'a0 He said I must give him a dose of Castor Oil & Gum Arabic water.\'a0 I did so, & he is now much better, almost well.\'a0 Susan & Ann say I must tell you, you must not bring anything for them from Columbia.\'a0 You have been already so kind to them, for he would have let them stay so long under their roof as you have.\'a0 They have the greatest regard for you, & will in the present case take the will for the deed.\'a0 I tell you you must bring them something, but do not bring an expensive present that you cannot afford.\'a0 They like Music boxes very much.\'a0 If you were to see a pretty one for a \ul few\ulnone  dollars, you might bring them one between them.\'a0 Perhaps you might get a very pretty one for 5 dollars; you ought not to give \ul more\ulnone .\'a0 You know I told you this time not to be \ul extravagant\ulnone , but bring us \ul cheap\ulnone  presents, not more than two or three dollars apiece.\'a0 You say you have already made me a beautiful present.\'a0 I know that it is an expensive one as it was bought in a Jewellers shop.\'a0 I do hope you have laid out your money judiciously.\'a0 Write me what it is you have bought.\'a0 I hope it is not \ul Silver\ulnone  \ul tumblers\ulnone .\'a0 I would rather have anything than them.\'a0 I think they are perfectly useless, unless you have everything to correspond.\'a0 I think I will be pleased if it is anything but \ul silver\ulnone  \ul Tumblers\ulnone .\'a0 Do relieve my mind \ul soon\ulnone , & do change the tumblers if you have bought them for something else.\'a0 You say you intend purchasing a beautiful copy of Nicholas Nickleby.\'a0 I would much rather you buy a \ul plain\ulnone  \ul copy\ulnone , that will \ul cost\ulnone  \ul less\ulnone , & spend the rest of the money in buying other books.\'a0 You say you have purchased some books already & \ul one\ulnone  you think I will admire. Perhaps the rest are Law books.\'a0 There is a book called \'93The Realities of Life\'94 written by a Miss Gaillard in Charleston.\'a0 If you were to come across it, & it was \ul cheap\ulnone , I would like you to get it.\'a0 I believe the Stores in Columbia are very dear,\'a0 You had better buy your books at Auction.\'a0 I would rather have a \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul straw\ulnone  \ul hat\ulnone  for Will than anything else, & one larger than the size I gave you, that he may wear it next summer.\'a0 Perhaps you might get some lady to purchase it for you, Sarah Taylor for instance.\'a0 Write me word how much Musical boxes cost.\'a0 We all admire them very much, but perhaps in Columbia they are very expensive.\'a0 Do not buy \ul one\ulnone  until you have written me the price. Recollect take the part of the \ul upper\ulnone  \ul country\ulnone  in debate, be \ul kind\ulnone  to your colleagues, \ul attentive\ulnone  in sending pamphlets to your constituents. Introduce the \ul fee\ulnone  \ul bill\ulnone , & do all you think best.\'a0 Go to see Aunt Brewton.\'a0 Be as economical as possible, judicious in your selection of books, consult my \ul taste\ulnone .\'a0 Write word what is the present you have bought, and the price of Musical boxes.\'a0 If they are \ul cheap\ulnone  I would like one but if they are \ul dear\ulnone  I would not.\'a0 I am afraid you cannot read this letter it is written so small.\'a0 If you write letters for the Mountaineer take great pains with them.\'a0 You must be a consistent Politician.\'a0 My dear husband I have [word obscured] you a great deal of advice, but I hope it will not have so great an influence over you you will follow it in opposition to your own judgment.\'a0 My next letters will relate more to family, \ul except\ulnone  \ul as\ulnone  \ul regards\ulnone  \ul silver\ulnone  \ul cups\ulnone , do as you think best.\'a0 I remain as ever your affectionate wife, E.F.

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am alone & disengaged, therefore will take this opportunity of writing to you.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney being away there is no service at his church, and Mr. Croft proposed reading the services and a sermon, at his house and inviting a few friends to join with him.\'a0 He invited all of us to attend and to pass the remainder of the day with them.\'a0 Mamma Susan & Ann have gone.\'a0 I have remained at home with Willy.\'a0 This latter personage I have just dispatched to the kitchen with Delia, that I may have a little quiet to enable me to write to you.\'a0 The weather is quite gloomy.\'a0 It snowed last night & the sun has not shone today.\'a0 For a few days past we have had considerable rain. I have been reading for a few days past, \'93The Young Lady\'92s Friend\'94.\'a0 I think it a valuable book, & will take many useful hints from it.\'a0 It recommends Mrs. Hamiltons \'93Letters on the Elementary Principle of Education,\'94 and \'93Hints on Nursery Discipline.\'94\'a0 The first I have often heard highly spoken of, and the latter, the Author says, is a valuable little book.\'a0 If you can find them I would like you to buy them for me.\'a0 They may assist me in bringing up Willy well. I hope you are \ul against\ulnone  Mr. Henry\'92s resolutions.\'a0 I think the Legislature has no right to \ul instruct\ulnone  Senators.\'a0 If they elect them, they ought to let them act as they think best; if they disapprove of their conduct, they need not elect them again.\'a0 I am sorry you introduced the Resolution to vote for VanBuren & Johnson as only half the resolution was adopted, & it will just get you into trouble for nothing.\'a0 It will make you more unpopular with the Whigs.\'a0 You had much better have let someone,\'a0 who has not such fault finding constituents as you have, or whose constituents have not such high opinions of themselves and more confidence in their representatives than yours have in you.\'a0 I hope you will not introduce the Penitentiary again.\'a0 It is of no use.\'a0 It is an unpopular subject, & will seem like obstinacy in you to be pressing it on the people.\'a0 A Penitentiary\'a0 wont do for this State at any rate at present.\'a0 The State cant afford it; it will be an expense.\'a0 There are not criminals enough to support one.\'a0 There are only two persons now in Greenville jail, & if the Penitentiary reforms society as you say it does, why then there will be fewer criminals than there are now.\'a0 There will be nobody to put in , & it will be a useless building.\'a0 After all the money expended on it, it will do where crime \ul increases\ulnone , not \ul decreases\ulnone .\'a0 Do don\'92t introduce the subject at pre\'85.\'a0 Some years hence will do.\'a0 The Rail road I expect is as great an embarrassment now as the state can bear.\'a0 I am sorry you did not introduce the Fee bill.\'a0 I told you not to let anyone get the start of you, but my dear I will stop giving advice.\'a0 I promised not to give anymore, & you are perfectly competent to judge for yourself.\'a0 I would not give you any if I thought you were \ul influenced\ulnone  by it.\'a0 I only think by opening my mind to you, I may suggest some ideas that may not have occurred to you before.\'a0 I think your judgement \ul perfect\ulnone , & all others so \ul imperfect\ulnone  that they generally think contrary to you, & that you know ought to be taken into consideration before you act.\'a0 I expect I am the most \ul presuming \ulnone wife there ever was, but you are the most \ul indulgent\ulnone  of husbands.\'a0 Remember act as you think best, but I hope you are against \ul Istruction\ulnone  (you are too noble & independent for that) (except from me). I forgot to tell you in my last letter when I requested you to buy the dozen large & dozen small knives \ul without\ulnone  forks, to buy also a pair of Salt spoons.\'a0 We have but \ul one\ulnone , the other is broken.\'a0 If silver is expensive, buy Mother of Pearl.\'a0 They answer just as well, perhaps better, or buy \ul any\ulnone  \ul kind\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  think \ul best\ulnone . I am quite uneasy until I hear how your cold is; do take care of yourself.\'a0 I hope to get a letter from you this evening.\'a0 I sent James to Dr. Crook\'92s today to have a plaster put on his back.\'a0 The Doctor told me to send him.\'a0 He is better but not well yet.\'a0 I do not let him ride the horse.\'a0 John waters him.\'a0 The Doctor said he must keep quiet until he was quite well.\'a0 Mr. Hoke went to town Saturday morning.\'a0 He is to bring up the box from the Miss Seabrooks. A glass for Mamma\'92s picture &c.\'a0 He was very obliging, said he would do anything, if it was only put\'a0 down in writing, that he might remember better.\'a0 Mrs. McBee invited us all to tea Thursday night to meet Mrs. Croft.\'a0 Susan & Ann went & spent a pleasant evening.\'a0 I have not yet heard who is elected Commissioner in Equity. Mr. Townes or Mr. Butler.\'a0 I will stop writing for the present until I hear from you tonight.\

My dear husband, \
\
	I have just received your letter, & it has given me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 It also removed any uneasiness, as you do not mention your cold incommoding you.\'a0 Mamma has not yet returned from Mrs. Crofts so I will write until she comes.\'a0 As you took my advice in such good part, instead of ceasing I will continue giving it, on this condition, that you do not follow it unless you \ul choose\ulnone  to.\'a0 Perhaps it may profit you.\'a0 I was just wondering before I received your letter whether you saw as much of Mr. Burt as you used to & whether Mrs. Burt or any of the members wives dictated to them as I do to you.\'a0 I dare say you are the only one who are so much favored; how \ul thankful\ulnone  you ought to be.\'a0 I am glad you remembered me to Mr. Burt.\'a0 You may remember me to whoever you think proper.\'a0 I think you must pass your time quite pleasantly, & would like you to spend it so for \ul years\ulnone  to come, but that is as you think.\'a0 I shall never advise you again on this subject, at least so \ul urgently\ulnone  as I did before, as my advice [word obscured] to have proved so \ul fatal\ulnone .\'a0 I hope while you enjoy pleasant company, you are not \ul inattentive\ulnone  to your \ul Colleagues\ulnone .\'a0 Do be \ul kind\ulnone  to \ul them\ulnone , or when they come home they will tell the people you are \ul proud\ulnone , & as you are \ul not\ulnone  \ul proud\ulnone , you may not make that impression.\'a0 You can \ul gain\ulnone  & \ul lose\ulnone  by \ul them\ulnone  than all the other Members put together.\'a0 It is your \ul Interest\ulnone  to be kind to them.\'a0 Give them no reason for speaking against you here.\'a0 I hope they will not be jealous of you; if you are attentive they will not.\'a0 I hope you send pamphlets, papers, reports & all sorts of things to your constituents, Whigs & Democrats.\'a0 They will then see that you have not forgotten them but are thinking of them \ul all\ulnone  the \ul time\ulnone .\'a0 Do not return home until the Legislature adjourns.\'a0 Stand at your post until the last moment.\'a0 But I hope all this advice is needless. The books you mention as having bought do not suit my taste, except Moore\'92s Life of Bryon, Nicholas Nickleby.\'a0 I am glad to have if it was \ul cheap\ulnone , but the others you mention are \ul mere\ulnone  \ul trash\ulnone .\'a0 I would rather have the works of Bulwer, that you have \ul not\ulnone  got.\'a0 I like them \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , & twenty volumes for $2.50!\'a0 I never heard of anything so cheap.\'a0 Do keep the set you have bought already for \ul yourself\ulnone , or get \ul another\ulnone  set \ul like
\f1\b \ulnone  
\f0\b0 them.\'a0 Mamma will either take the numbers you do not wish, or those you have \ul now\ulnone  at \ul home\ulnone . \'a0I would like to have twenty volumes all alike, & so \ul cheap \ulnone too.\'a0 You have none of Bulwers last\'a0 works & I would like to have them.\'a0 The Pickwick papers nobody likes & the others from their very names must be as worthless.\'a0 I like Bulwers writings & that long list I sent you & \'93\ul Madame D\'92Arblay\'92s Life of Dr. Burney\ulnone ,\'94 which I have heard was very interesting.\'a0 Those are the kind of books that I like, at least if they are \ul cheap\ulnone .\'a0 I don\'92t wish them if they \ul cost\ulnone  much.\'a0 I hope you will buy your books at Auction, & then as Bargains; but my dear husband don\'92t buy too many & in those you do buy make a good selection.\'a0 I like not trash, nor valuable books, but \ul pretty\ulnone  books.\'a0 The Pickwick papers are trash; the Family Library are valuable books.\'a0 Neither of them do I expect to read, but the pretty, light works I like.\'a0 But even in books I leave it to your judgement.\'a0 I suppose you will select well. Mamma has come home.\'a0 She with all of us were \ul Surprised\ulnone  to hear that Mr. Rhett should think the Friendship with him had \ul ever\ulnone  been broken off.\'a0 Mamma was not aware that anything had ever occurred to interrupt it.\'a0 Mamma says that she is Surprised & \ul grieved\ulnone  to hear that he should be under the impression that their had ever been any interruption to the friendship except the circumstance of their living in different places & consequently but seeing very little of each other for some years past, & \ul that\ulnone  though it interrupted their intercourse,\'a0 produced no change in [word obscured] towards him.\'a0 Tell him since their friendship first commenced, Mamma has never changed or ceased to have the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul regard\ulnone  for him.\'a0 She considers him one of the best & most disinterested friends she every had.\'a0 Uncle Roberts feelings & behaviour to him\'a0 would not in the slightest degree have influenced her.\'a0 The Friendship she has for him will continue through life, even if they never meet again. & she hopes he knows there was no real interruption to their feelings of regard except in his imagination, that the friendship which she hopes he still feels for her will always continue.\'a0 There are such sacred feelings connected with him\'a0 & his regard for our family that nothing could make us change in our feelings towards him.\'a0 The advice he alludes to as having given was on this occasion; when my brother returned from the North in bad health, when he recovered, his Uncles did not wish him\'a0 to go back again, but Mr. Rhett advised that he should return & finish his Collegiate course.\'a0 Mamma followed his advice.\'a0 She sent him back & when his health again became bad, Mr. Rhett went on for him, brought him home, carried him to Beaufort & kept him there for several months pursuing his studies.\'a0 Uncle Robert was not offended at his advising differently from himself.\'a0 Mamma says she knows he was not.\'a0 Miss Cheves [word obscured] might have had something to do with his coldness.\'a0 She was staying at his house when Mr. Rhett became engaged to her.\'a0 Aunt Brewton at first wished the match very much & I believe assisted in different ways conveying notes &c.\'a0 Afterwards when Miss Cheves broke off the match from fear of her father, she misrepresented him & spoke against him.\'a0 I believe she denied that she had been engaged to him when \ul he\ulnone  said she was (& of course they were engaged).\'a0 These things perhaps prejudiced Uncle Robert & Aunt Brewton against him.\'a0 Mr. Rhett I believe thought Aunt Brewton afterwards took Miss Cheves part & perhaps influenced her.\'a0 This made him dislike Aunt Brewton & treat her with neglect, & she thought he had treated her ungratefully.\'a0 I do not know if you understand it, but what I mean is that if Uncle Robert behaved coldly this affair might have had something to do with it, & Uncle Robert I believe thought he was conceited & turbulent & [word obscured].\'a0 \ul Do tell what I have told you\ulnone  to Mr. Rhett, or else he will think we have been very ungrateful.\'a0 Tell him Mamma always has & always will have the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul regard\ulnone  for him.\'a0\'a0 There never was any interruption to their friendship on her \ul part\ulnone .\'a0 It was only a suspicion of his, for Uncle Roberts feelings would not have influenced her.\'a0 She considers him of the best & most disinterested friends she ever had, & hopes his friendship will always continue for her even if they never met again.\'a0 I have always liked & admired him \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone  & take the greatest interest in him.\'a0 I would like to see him again.\'a0 Mamma regrets they have been able to see so little of each other for the last years.\'a0 Remember & tell him all I have said.\'a0 [word obscured] word about Miss Cheves if you would \ul rather\ulnone  not, but tell the first part & the last part.\'a0 Mamma requests it & it must seem to him so ungrateful, that anything should cause Mammas friendship for him to cease.\'a0 Ann is delighted with the [word obscured] box, Susan with the Gold thimble.\'a0 They would rather have them than anything.\'a0 Bring Mamma a butter knife like ours instead of a book.\'a0 She will be very much pleased with it.\'a0 If you see no hat suitable for Will it is no consequence.\'a0 I can make one or send to town for one where they will be cheaper than in Columbia.\'a0 If you see a suitable one it is \ul dear\ulnone  I would rather not have it.\'a0 I wish you to bring me \ul no\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone .\'a0 Those things you have bought for the [word obscured]\'a0 particularly the silver forks I will consider as my present.\'a0 You cant afford to buy so many different things, so I would much rather you buy nothing more for me.\'a0 Next year when money is more plenty, you can bring me a thimble or music box or something of the kind, so I pray you buy nothing more for me.\'a0 The butter knives & forks & other things I regard as presents.\'a0 If you see no cheap hat for Will just bring him a little trifle.\'a0 All the money saved\'a0 now will go towards \'85ing for the house next year.\'a0 Bring Mamma a butter knife like ours, the Musical box to Ann & thimble to Susan, \ul yourself\ulnone  & the books to me.\'a0 Do not send them by anyone beforehand; wait & bring them yourself.\'a0 E.F. Perry I have broken open my letter to tell you that though I give you advice I do not wish you in the \ul least\ulnone  to be influenced by me, against your judgement, for you I believe have as good a judgement as \ul anybody\ulnone , better than \ul mine\ulnone .\'a0\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I told you not to expect to hear from me by Friday\'92s Mail, but I have changed my mind & think I will write you a few lines, as Margaret will be here tomorrow, & I will be busily occupied with her.\'a0 I will devote this evening to you.\'a0 I write principally to apologize for the liberty I have taken in giving you so much advice.\'a0 Why my letters have been filled up with nothing but reproof and counsel.\'a0 I meant it all as a joke, but you may not have taken it as such, & perhaps may have been influenced by it.\'a0 If this has been the case, I will indeed be grieved.\'a0 I hope that you good sense and firmness have not deserted you, & that you have had independence enough to act out your own opinions, even contrary to dictorially\'a0 .expressed ones.\'a0 I woke up last night & began thinking about all this, & I was so worried at the thought that you might even unconsciously to yourself, have been influenced by my advice, that I could not go to sleep for hours.\'a0 I hope you will comfort me in your next letter by the assurance, that I am quite mistaken in thinking my opinions have such weight with you, that you course in the Legislature should be influenced by them contrary to your own judgment.\'a0 Even on the subject of the Penitentiary of course you are the best judge.\'a0 I suppose I have an opinion on every subject whether I understand it or not.\'a0 It is a chance whether I am right or wrong, but you who have opportunities of improving your mind, such a great mind, clear head, & good judgment; of course you are well qualified to think and act on every subject brought before the mind.\'a0 I am very presumptuous to direct your course on Political & other great matters.\'a0 I go beyond my sphere & do not understand what I am about.\'a0 That is your department, but household arrangements, decorations of the person, providing for the family, servants &c., & even keeping books.\'a0 In all these things I may be the adviser, & perhaps even the principal; in all except the l\ul atter\ulnone  business, there I will only give my assistance.\'a0 So my dear husband, with the hope that you have not been influenced by me, even on the Penitentiary subject, I will drop the subject & turn to another & more interesting one. Willy is a pretty interesting boy, & looks quite healthy.\'a0 I hope he will continue to look as well as he does now until you return.\'a0 He has not forgotten you.\'a0 We speak so often to him of Papa; it is impossible he should.\'a0 In the morning when I wake, I say Willy look for Papa, see him in the other side of you, & he instantly looks round.\'a0 He does not talk, & understands everything so well, that I am afraid he will not for a long time.\'a0 He understands everything, tell him to bring the Broom to Delia, to shut the door, to put wood on the fire, to sit down & he will do it.\'a0 He will do everything except behave quite as well as he ought to, & not be cross & troublesome some times.\'a0 I miss you at Meal times particularly, for you know it was your privilege to be favored with his company exclusively.\'a0 We all now enjoy that pleasure.\'a0 If you see no reasonable suitable hat for him, you need not be worried.\'a0 We can send to town for one at some convenient time. Mamma & Susan rode to the house today.\'a0 The carpenters had almost finished ceiling the garret, the front \ul steps\ulnone  are up, but not the banisters or railings.\'a0 The Bricklayers work I believe is finished.\'a0 Mr. Powel\'a0 is painting.\'a0 Castles says the Well will be a splendid one.\'a0 He has dug 14 or 15 feet and has come to two or three feet of water. & he says first rate water.\'a0 He says the Spring with a little labour will be an elegant one.\'a0 I must tell you how sociable he has become with me.\'a0 The day we went to choose the spot for the well, we were quite undecided.\'a0 Mamma would choose one, he one, & I one.\'a0 At last Mamma fived upon a spot she thought would do, & I was about to select another, when he hollowed out, \'93Lizzy mind what your Mammy says.\'94\'a0 We were all very much surprised & laughed, & thought it was a slip of the tongue from hearing Mamma & Susan call me so, but he continued calling me Lizzy & calls me so ever since.\'a0 It does not seem to proceed from familiarity but from artlessness & innocence.\'a0 We like him very much & think he is quite an artless & honest man.\'a0 Mamma\'92s Well will cost very little, perhaps not six dollars. Susan & Ann went to see Miss Harrison yesterday she invited them to the Wedding.\'a0 She is to be married the 24
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  Christmas Eve.\'a0 Mrs. S\'85 invited us all to pass the evening with her.\'a0 Mamma & Susan went.\'a0 The Miss Anderson\'92s have come.\'a0 They are staying with Mrs. Marant.\'a0 Mr. Suddeth prefers not taking them; says his house is not a suitable one for Ladies.\'a0 Mr. Buist has returned; he could not bring the box from the Miss Seabrooks as he came in a Sulky.\'a0 It was of no consequence, as Mr. Hoke will bring it next week. I will tell you what a trick I served Delia & Eliza unintentionally the other night.\'a0 I woke up & it was so light I thought it was daylight so I called to Delia told her to get up & make the fire & then go down & wake Minerva that we might have an early breakfast.\'a0 She got up & made the fire.\'a0 I told Eliza to go in to make Mamma\'92s fire, & ask what clock it was by her Watch.\'a0 The clock had run down, so I had not heard it strike.\'a0 Mamma sent word she thought it was Midnight, for she had not been to sleep since she went to bed.\'a0 I was shocked, & there were Eliza & Delia, bed put away, fires made, & ready to commence there days work at Midnight.\'a0 Eliza had even been downstairs to Minerva, who said she had just gone to bed.\'a0 They laid down by the fire & we all went to sleep again & slept for some hours.\'a0 I laugh whenever I think of it. I hope you have the list of books I wrote you.\'a0 I only mean you to buy them if you see them at the Auction & they are sold for very little.\'a0 I thought it would be better for you to purchase them than others you know nothing about & may prove to be of no value.\'a0 I know them all to be beautiful, interesting & valuable & know that you even would be pleased with them.\'a0 I dare say you will meet with none of them, as they are books that meet with ready purchases, & are not often sold at Auction.\'a0 Bulwers novels were really cheap.\'a0 His latter works would be worthwhile getting at that price.\'a0 If you see the book I mentioned written by Mrs. Hamilton & Hints on Nursery Discipline & by looking over them think they will be of service to me in training Will, bring them to me as \ul my\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone .\'a0 They will be more useful than a Gold Thimble.\'a0 Indeed there are so many necessaries that we must get, that I would be loth to wear a Thimble of such value, while we are denying ourselves so many other things so needed.\'a0 I would rather give Delia some good clothes.\'a0 I am now making her the d[ress] I bought.\'a0 I have cut it & fitted it very nicely.\'a0 Margarets working here has been of great advantage.\'a0 From helping her so much I am more expert in doing the difficult parts of a dress, which otherwise I might never have known how to do well.\'a0 I have promised Delia another dress & a few aprons. I sent to the Mill for a barrel of Flour on Saturday.\'a0 I did not pay for it, so I have contracted one debt for you to discharge on your return.\'a0 I gave John your message about the Cow & he says the Cow has as much as she can eat.\'a0 He says of Mamma\'92s horses, the one is 10 years old & the other only 9.\'a0 He insists upon it, says he has made particular inquiries.\'a0 I suppose he thinks since he has had the care of them they have improved so much that they have dropped some of their age.\'a0 Lawyer the other day brought you some Fodder, & after putting it away came in to ask for a dram.\'a0 As I poured the Whiskey out, I asked him how much I should give him.\'a0 When I had nearly filled the cup, he said that would do.\'a0 I said that will make you drunk.\'a0 He replied, Oh no!\'a0 I never get drunk.\'a0 I engaged from him a bushel of Potatoes.\'a0 He brought them the next day.\'a0 I paid him 37 \'bd cts, the price asked now.\'a0 He said they were as good Potatoes as were ever eaten.\'a0 On cooking them everyone proved to be decayed.\'a0 Yesterday Mamma called to Castles as he was passing.\'a0 He replied he would not come.\'a0 As then he was in a hurry, but would come tomorrow., that he was going to bring Lizzy some Potatoes.\'a0 I had engaged some from him.\'a0 James Williams is out of Jail.\'a0 I wish very much to know whether Mr. Townes or Mr. Butler is elected.\'a0 I would send to ask Mrs. Townes, but if he is \ul not\ulnone  elected, she may feel mortified to send word \ul no\ulnone .\'a0 Who do you think will be Governor.\'a0 So Mr. Magrath has not been made Attorney General.\'a0 I hope he will gain the object he has in view without that.\'a0 I am glad you were not a Candidate.\'a0 I expect even you would have beaten.\'a0 The village is very quiet & there is no news that I know of.\'a0 We all think it is much pleasanter than in Summer.\'a0 Mrs. Croft leaves in a fortnight.\'a0\'a0As I have written two such long letters, you must not be disappointed if you do not hear by next Mail.\'a0 I will write if I have time, but I am very busy.\'a0 Mamma Susan & Ann send their kindest regards to you, & Will I am sure would if he were awake & could speak.\'a0 Mamma & Susan have returned from Mrs. S\'85.\'a0 Mrs. Carson, Miss McBee & Mrs. Marant & Miss Anderson were there.\'a0 Mrs. Marant is willing to let persons have her servants if they will only [word obscured] & feed them , paying no wages whatever.\'a0 She \ul offered\ulnone  Dianna to Mamma & a little boy also [word obscured] she is the favored one if the offer is accepted.\'a0 There are so many servants now to be hired, it is difficult to get places for any.\'a0 A great many have been here to apply.\'a0 Yours truly & sincerely, E.F.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you, and it has given me such \ul pleasure\ulnone  that I cannot rest until I have expressed it to you.\'a0 I read the Cheraw paper before I opened your letter.\'a0 I know from your sending it, that it contained something complimentary to yourself, and I am \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone  \ul pleased\ulnone  with it.\'a0 The description is \ul so\ulnone  \ul correct\ulnone , and I am glad to find that you are appreciated by some at last.\'a0 Oh if you only lived among the intelligent and refined how much you would be valued.\'a0 I am grieved to think that if you were a Candidate another year, you might not even be elected; \ul you\ulnone  who ought to be considered an \ul honour\ulnone  to your district.\'a0 I wish you would write word to have that peice published in the Mountaineer that it may open the eyes of your Constituents.\'a0 What a discriminating man Col. Dudley is.\'a0 I like him very much, & have the highest opinion of his judgement.\'a0 He was right in putting you at the head of all.\'a0 Perhaps he has the same opinion of you as Mr. Luther McBee thinks I have.\'a0 The other evening at Mrs. Croft\'92s, he said to me, \'93Why Mrs. Perry thinks there is nobody equal to Major Perry.\'94\'a0 Without my intending it, he discovered my real opinion of you.\'a0 By the way I wish to tell you\'a0 that I like some of the Whigs very much, & he among them, as I wish you to be \ul just\ulnone , \ul liberal\ulnone  & \ul honourable\ulnone  towards them.\'a0 I wish I had given you this advice at \ul first\ulnone , but I hope you have acted upon it from your own high sense of justice & honour.\'a0 Mr. Adams is a particular friend of Mamma\'92s; though like Mr. Rhett, from not being in the same place. They have not seen much of each other lately.\'a0 The acquaintance commenced in New Haven. I am delighted to hear that you have made such a triumphant speech.\'a0 I wish I could have heard it.\'a0 I hope to have that pleasure some day.\'a0 You ought to send a great many of that Cheraw paper to your constituents, that they may see what you really are.\'a0 I am much comforted to find that you have only followed the last & best part of my advice.\'a0 I was quite worried to think that from the \ul high\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  you had of me, you might be influenced by me, contrary to your own judgement.\'a0 I am glad to find that you had a higher opinion of yourself.\'a0 My only advice to you now, for I cant help giving some,\'a0 is to be \ul just\ulnone , \ul liberal\ulnone  , & honourable to \ul all\ulnone  \ul parties\ulnone ; not to be influenced by party spirit.\'a0 For all parties are alike.\'a0 There are good & bad ones\'a0 among all, & the next political subject that comes up, you do not know\'a0 who you will be thrown amongst; perhaps the very ones you now oppose, so that ought to make a man moderate, liberal, just & honourable.\'a0 But you know all this as well as I do & better too.\'a0 I am going out of my proper sphere. But I was afraid you might be \ul unjust\ulnone  to the Whigs because you thought \ul I\ulnone  disliked them very much, & I wish you to understand that you must act \ul well\ulnone  towards them in the legislature whenever you think proper.\'a0 To conc[ink blotted] do as you think best.\'a0 You must not bring Mamma an expensive \ul Butter\ulnone  \ul Knife\ulnone .\'a0 You cant \ul afford\ulnone  it.\'a0 You must bring a \ul plain\ulnone  one.\'a0 Susans & Anns presents have cost so much, that you ought not to spend much on the butter knife.\'a0 Mamma would not care for such an extraordinary handsome one.\'a0 Ours were very pretty.\'a0\'a0 Susan & Ann are very much pleased & say they will keep the presents in remembrance of you as long as they live.\'a0 I am afraid the knives & spoons you have bought are too pretty, through I should judge they were reasonable.\'a0 I must take care next year to have some nice pickles to bring the pickle knives into notice.\'a0 They will then be quite useful.\'a0 [ink blotted] recollect that children of Will\'92s age wear pretty little \ul cloth\ulnone  \ul caps\ulnone  of various [ink blotted] ; perhaps you may see one that may suit him, & it will look better for winter than a straw hat; not a \ul fur\ulnone  cap, but a \ul cloth\ulnone  \ul cap\ulnone  so you may display your taste in selecting him one; a pretty little \ul cloth\ulnone  \ul cap\ulnone  suitable for his age & size.\'a0 I have seen \ul velvet\ulnone  ones also, but they perhaps might look too fine.\'a0 I leave it to your taste, but if you do not see a pretty suitable one, then bring him a Fathers love, & it will be as acceptable to him I am sure as anything else.\'a0 The other day Dr. Crook was here.\'a0 Will went to him, but did not take him for \ul you\ulnone  again, so tell Mr. Burt on a nearer\'85to him, Will finds there is not the least likeness\'a0 between Dr, Crook & his Papa.\'a0 I am certain he will recognize you, but I long to have the opportunity of seeing the recognition.\'a0 I do not think the Legislature will adjourn the 18
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  as they generally fix on one day, & afterwards upon another a few days later.\'a0 Mind do not leave as usual beforehand..\'a0 Write word if they change when I must expect you.\'a0 I hope you will go to see Aunt Brewton; indeed you must. I am glad I was mistaken in thinking Mr. Rhett had thought there was any interruption to the friendship\'a0 that existed between our families.\'a0 I was afraid he must have thought us ungrateful.\'a0 I always liked him \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , & am glad you have become acquainted with him.\'a0 I see by the papers Col. Richardson is elected & am very much pleased at it.\'a0 It was not at all a close a[word obscured by tissue repair].\'a0 It is quite late.\'a0 I will stop for the present & finish my letter tomorrow.\

	I will have time only to close my letter.\'a0 I am very busy.\'a0 Margaret is here finishing Susans dress.\'a0 She disappointed us last week.\'a0 Susan is sick with a bad headache, so I have to take her place & have not a moment to spare.\'a0 What has become of the Fee bill?\'a0\'a0 I hope you will alter it before you come home & satisfy the people.\'a0 Do not buy Will a cap, unless you see a reasonable suitable pretty one.\'a0 If you do not see one of this description, \ul I\ulnone  will \ul make\ulnone  him one.\'a0 Remember do not bring any unless it is pretty. I will write again to you by the next Mail.\'a0 Miss Harrisons wedding is put off until the 19

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 Mr. Hoke will be here Wednesday night.\'a0 Mr. Croft leaves Thursday morning.\'a0 He took tea there Susan & myself Friday night & spent a very pleasant evening.\'a0 Mrs. Smeddons family, Mrs. Marant, Miss McBee, Mr. McBee, Mrs. Carson, Mr. & Mrs. Beattie & Mr. Hamlin were there. You ought to send a Cheraw paper to your Father & mother & a great many to Greenville.\'a0 Do send one to Mrs. Dr. Butler?\'a0 I have a great mind to cut out the peice that relates to you & send it to her by Mamma.\'a0 When she returns her visit as she intends to do this week I wish her to see \ul who\ulnone  it is she \ul presumes\ulnone  to insult & whether such a man would be great afflicted at \ul her\ulnone [word obscured by tissue repair] to speak to him.\'a0 She really thought herself a great consequence. I must tell you of an incidence that has occurred that will surprise you.\'a0 One of the Shoults you put up in the pen to fatten & kill that we might eat, a few days ago had four pigs.\'a0 John did not discover it until two of the pigs were eaten up.\'a0 He then let out the Sou & the remaining pigs.\'a0 I am waiting to kill until you return.\'a0 The one hog we killed we have been living upon.\'a0 Together with some beef I bought, we have felt no want of meat. Do if you think of it inquire the price of \ul plated\ulnone  \ul cake\ulnone  \ul baskets\ulnone .\'a0 I do not wish any at present, but when you can afford it, the next thing I would wish you to buy for the house, I \ul think\ulnone  would be that.\'a0 I would only wish to know the \ul price\ulnone .\'a0 In Charleston I have seen them for 10 dollars a peice, but in Columbia I would expect they would be much more expensive.\'a0 You must have spent a great deal in the things you have bought.\'a0 But I think they were all reasonable.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\'a0 I have written you in such a hurry I scarcely know what I have said.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have taken up my pen to write you I hope my last letter, though if the Legislature does not adjourn as soon as you said & you let me know, I will write again.\'a0 I hope you will not leave Columbia until the adjournment.\'a0 I will be almost sorry to see you if you do. I wrote you in my last letter to \ul price\ulnone  Cake Baskets.\'a0 I am \ul sorry\ulnone  now that I did.\'a0 I am afraid you may think from that, that I \ul wish\ulnone  them, & to \ul please\ulnone  me, [you] may go & buy a pair.\'a0 I hope however you have not been so thoughtless as to buy any, for we see so little company, we have not the least use for them.\'a0 They are things that last for \ul life\ulnone , & when bought ought to be \ul very\ulnone  \ul handsome\ulnone , & very handsome ones cost a great deal of money, & a great deal of money you have not at present, & I would rather you buy them some time hence, when we have more use for them, & will be able to afford to get \ul handsome\ulnone \'a0\'a0 \ul ones\ulnone .\'a0 You have bought for the house all that is necessary at present, & I hope you think so too, so trusting that all the \ul anxiety\ulnone  & \ul uneasiness\ulnone  about the baskets has been without foundation, I will leave the subject & turn to another. Miss Harrison was here this morning, & invited us \ul all\ulnone  to the Wedding.\'a0 She says she wishes \ul us\ulnone  to see the ceremony performed, that only a few will be present there, & the remainder of the Company will come afterwards.\'a0 She is to be married Christmas Eve.\'a0 It is not put off as we heard.\'a0 She says even if she had had a small Wedding as she first intended, she would still have had all of our family at it.\'a0 That Richard feels under the greatest obligations to you & of course she would wish you & me invited.\'a0 She is to have three Bridesmaids:\'a0 Miss Maxwell, Ann and her sister.\'a0 I do not know who are the Groomsmen.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney I believe is to marry her. We went yesterday to the house.\'a0 We called for Mrs. McBee & she Miss McBee & Mrs. Carson went with us, the Waggon road, that is back of their house, across to fields to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 Mrs. McBee wished to know if that would not be the shortest road between her & Mamma\'92s & the best way of communication.\'a0 It was quite muddy yesterday as it has rained lately, but in dry weather, it will be quite\'a0 a short & pleasant walk.\'a0 We afterwards went home with Mrs. McBee and took a cup of Coffee, but could not stay long as we left Ann at home quite unwell.\'a0 We were quite disappointed about the Garden fence.\'a0 The garden is much larger than we wished it, & the fence is crooked.\'a0 It is nearer the Smoke house than it is the Kitchen, and nearer the Stable than the other side of the Lot.\'a0 We had wished the house to be in the \ul Middle\ulnone , and as much of the Garden one side of it as the other.\'a0 Instead of that, the fence commences just a \ul little\ulnone  beyond the Smoke house, & the other side almost touches the Stable.\'a0 By the Smoke House the fence ought to have been raised far above it.\'a0 It would have been a preetty\'a0 place for the Garden, away from the horses and pigs.\'a0 At any rate the house ought to have been in the middle as you intended, and as it is now, the fence looks quite crooked.\'a0 It slants a good deal.\'a0 I hope it will look better when it is finished next Monday.\'a0 I expect Mamma will move her Furniture.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says he will assist her.\'a0 He will get a four horse Waggon, & all that is necessary.\'a0 He will return home tonight, and with him we hope the box. Mr. & Mrs. Croft leave tomorrow.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 I hope I will receive a letter from you tonight.\'a0 I have written to you by every mail but one.\'a0 I am sure not one of the Members Wives have done that much.\'a0 I think you have been very good too in writing.\'a0 I expect you have written as often in not oftener than Mr. Earle has written to Miss Harrison, and your time every moment of it occupied, and he perhaps nothing to do.\'a0 You a husband & he a lover. I went yesterday to see Mrs. Coleman & Mrs. Long, and Shopped also.\'a0 Will is quite well.\'a0 He is all day in the kitchen and yard.\'a0 He is so troublesome in the house having no one to mind him.\'a0 By and by when I have a smaller family, I will be able to pay him more attention, and be more careful of him.\'a0 Poor little fellow at night when he wakes puts his face against mine to know if I am near him.\'a0 He does not speak a single word.\'a0 You will not hear him call you Papa when you return. I have nothing more to write about, so will now close my letter with \ul two\ulnone  requests, that you will go to see Aunt Brewton, if it is only for a \ul few\ulnone  \ul moments\ulnone  before you leave.\'a0 I know that she will be \ul hurt\ulnone  if you do not, and that you will bring me some \ul Morroco\ulnone .\'a0 Believe me your ever attached Wife, E.F. Perry P.S. I hope you have sent a great many of the Cheraw papers to Greenville.\'a0 You ought to request Mr. Wells to publish the portion relating to yourself.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to promise I have taken up my pen to write to you , & hope sometime during the day you will be employed in the same way.\'a0 I suppose you arrived at Columbia safely Sunday night & by this time have recovered from your fatigue.\'a0 You have been gone so short a time, that I have not much to relate,\'a0 but I will tell you all that I think will interest you.\'a0 I have been out but once yesterday for a little while to ride.\'a0 It has been raining, or looking like rain I think ever since you left.\'a0 I saw Mamma on Sunday.\'a0 She stopped for a little while on her way from church.\'a0 She said she was afraid John delivered you a very odd message from the answer he brought back to her.\'a0 She says she sent word to you that you must take great care of yourself, for you were of so much importance to us all, we could not do without you, and he brought back as your answer, \'93that the prayers of righteous men availeth much.\'94\'a0 I told her Johns message, that she would pray for you, and you must pray for me, and that you told him to tell her, that you expected her prayers would do \ul you\ulnone  more good, than yours would her.\'a0 So John was very incorrect in his message. I suppose you would like to know how I get along with the servants.\'a0 I have had no quarrels with them.\'a0 I get along quietly, but am not near as happy as I was this time last year when I was a simple Captain with one good Craft under my command.\'a0 My promotion has brought along with it so many cares, that I believe I would be willing again to occupy my former position.\'a0 Minerva is in \ul good\ulnone  \ul humor\ulnone  (and from this I judge that \ul harmony\ulnone  exists in the kitchen).\'a0 She goes about her business, and does not complain of having too much to do.\'a0\'a0 Delia sleeps in the room with me at night.\'a0 Her only fault is not coming the instant I call her, and doing immediately what I tell her to do.\'a0 I read to her last Sunday some verses in the bible.\'a0 I selected those that told servants to be obedient to their owners, and one in particular that suited her.\'a0 \'93Servants be obedient unto your Masters, and please them well in all things, not \ul answering\ulnone  \ul again\ulnone .\'94\'a0 George has been at home several days.\'a0 He said the ground was too wet to work at Mamma\'92s.\'a0 Today he is raking up the leaves in the front garden, and James is carrying them to the Stable.\'a0 George says the morning after you left, Mr. Cleveland as he was passing by, walked into the lot, and garden, & examined the piggery &c.\'a0 As he looked at the hogs in the pen he said, \'93Did Perry raise all those hogs?\'94\'a0 George said, \'93yes, and two more that we killed fatter than any of those.\'94\'a0 He then looked at the Manure.\'a0 \'93Did Perry make all that Manure?\'94\'a0 George said, \'93yes every bit of it?\'94\'a0 He then looked at the Turnips.\'a0 \'93Did Perry raise those Turnips?\'94\'a0 George said, \'93yes! and and pulled up one to show how large it was.\'94\'a0 Well I declare Mr. Cleveland said, if Perry is not beating all of us.\'a0 Ninny takes care of the baby & washes its clothes.\'a0 She goes home at night.\'a0 Eliza works, she has made one frock for Willy since you have been away.\'a0 I do not think her work will pay for her food & clothing.\'a0 I see her only when it is necessary.\'a0 I have had no cause of complaint against her, but doing her best she is such an unpleasant servant, that intercourse with her is disagreeable.\'a0 The Pigs, George says, are doing remarkably well.\'a0 I have not seen them, the weather not permitting me to walk to the lot.\'a0 The Cow does well as when you were here, that is tolerable.\'a0 Victoria gives no Milk, and Rose about two quarts a day.\'a0 Minerva says she milks Rose clean, & Victoria will give none, unless the calf sucks, & that she wont do.\'a0 Your horse is well, and I believe everything else about the Lot, particularly the Muses.\'a0 Willy I think I am making a better boy.\'a0 I find it much easier to make him good, when he is in the house & away from Clara & Edward.\'a0 I used to think he would be a better boy if he had children to play with, but I think it is the reverse.\'a0 He & Clara are constantly quarreling.\'a0 She came to me a minute ago saying he had struck her.\'a0 The book I have been reading, has been of great assistance to me in teaching me how to bring up Will.\'a0 \'93The Mother at Home.\'94\'a0 You must read it.\'a0 I hope by the time you come back, Willy will be a good boy.\'a0 He has been more obedient to me within a few days past, than he has ever been.\'a0 I have whipped him very little, but I have been \ul positive\ulnone  with him in making him do what I told him.\'a0 He speaks of you very often.\'a0 Little Anna still suffers with \ul wind\ulnone  and \ul acid\ulnone  \ul stomach\ulnone .\'a0 I was obliged today to send for some Infant powders for her, which I hope will so benefit her, that when you return you will have no more of \ul wind\ulnone , that enemy of infants. I wish you to execute a commission for the house.\'a0 I wish you to buy a pair of Table covers for the Tables in the dining room.\'a0 The one on the table in the middle of the room is so much soiled & faded I have been obliged to take it off, & the other one is very much faded too, so you must get a \ul pair\ulnone  of Covers.\'a0 I think \ul Scarlet\ulnone  \ul Covers\ulnone  are \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone , but you may follow your own fancy.\'a0 The Covers must be 1 yd. and \'be square.\'a0 If you cannot get them that size a little larger would be of no consequence but they must not be smaller than 1 \'be yd.\'a0 You must send the Covers by Col. Townes, or the first opportunity that occurs.\'a0 You\'a0 understand the size, one yard and three quarters square, and Scarlet ones I think are pretty, but exercise you own taste to get what you think pretty.\'a0 They will be about $1.50 a peice $3 a pair, or perhaps a little more. Mamma begs you to ask Mr. Roper when he writes to Mrs. Roper to ask her to send her bundle by someone going to Columbia, and you send it to Greenville by the first good opportunity.\'a0 You must excuse this badly written letter my dear husband.\'a0 I have written in a great hurry, part of the time with the baby in my arms.\'a0 I have met with so many inter[r]uptions it is now quite late, after dinner, & I have a \ul shocking\ulnone  pen.\'a0 My other letters shall be mates.\'a0 You must not be uneasy about me.\'a0 I get along quite well though I miss you more than I can express.\'a0 I am willing for you to be absent every winter a month at the Legislature, as long as the people will send you.\'a0 Mamma Susan & Ann desire their best love.\'a0 Ann feels unusually badly at present.\'a0 You must write me everything.\'a0\'a0 I have heard two books highly spoken of & recommended to get them, which you may get if you wish.\'a0 \'93The Queens of England,\'94 \'93Life of Miss Landon.\'94\'a0 Lately published.\'a0 They are the kind of books I like.\'a0 I must now conclude my dear husband, the baby is crying for me.\'a0 Believe me Ever Your affectionate Wife, E.F.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is washing day & I have charge of the baby.\'a0 She has just gone to sleep & I take the opportunity while she is sleeping to write to you.\'a0 Willy woke up directly after you had gone down, before the Stage left the door, & asked where Papa was.\'a0 I told him you had gone.\'a0 He commenced crying, but stopped when I told him you would come back again.\'a0 He speaks frequently of you, which surprises me, as in your late absences from home, he never mentioned you.\'a0 He says I sorry Pa gone to Columbia, Pa come back directly.\'a0 Pa did not go in his Buggy.\'a0 Pa went in the Stage & so I think he has behaved better than usual since you were away.\'a0 Anna is quite well and as good and interesting as ever. Yesterday I went to church; there was no service in the afternoon as it was communion Sunday.\'a0 Susan came for me and I went with the children to Mamma\'92s for a little while.\'a0 Ann had not slept the night before, and felt dreadfully; she said if she slept last night and was better she would come in tomorrow and stay with me a few days, but Mamma sent word this morning she had not closed her eyes all night, and was too sick to come.\'a0 She \ul really\ulnone  intended coming if she had been able. A Mr. Sutton brought you a letter from Mr. Miles Norton, and Mr. Hamlin brought you one from Spartanburgh from Mr. Henry.\'a0 He said he expected it was about business to be done in the Court of Appeals, so I opened it to see if it was necessary to send it to Columbia, but it was not about Law business.\'a0 It was about the Wine you promised to send for him, and Mr. Thompson.\'a0 He said he doubted whether you had remembered to write for it, and begged you to write immediately for the two quarter casks, for if they did not get it at once, it would be difficult to get it from Hamburgh or Columbia, as the season advanced, on account of the want of Waggons to haul it.\'a0 Therefore he begged you to write at once which I suppose you have done long ago.\'a0 I told Mr. Hamlin I had lost the key to my door.\'a0 He said He had it hanging up in his store, that he picked it up near the church door, and not knowing whose it was, had hung it where it might be seen & applied for.\'a0 I have sent for it, and it is now in the door.\'a0 You will be glad to be saved the expense of buying another lock, and which I would have particularly regretted, as it would have been owing to my carelessness.\'a0 I will be careful in future. Last Saturday two of Mr. Markley\'92s men came for the Chicken coop.\'a0 They said Mr. Stiles told them to come and take it.\'a0 I let it go as I believe you had told Mr. Stiles to send for it.\'a0 Saturday morning I heard a noise downstairs as if something had fallen.\'a0 I could not think what it was.\'a0 The doors and windows were shut so that the wind could not blow anything.\'a0 I went down and found Byron\'92s residence on the floor, or rather near the floor.\'a0 Its fall had been stopped by the stand.\'a0 It was stuck between the stand and the wall.\'a0 Mr. Murphy put the tack into the cord in so slight a manner, that the cord had slipped from the tack, & in that way the picture fell.\'a0 It is not at all injured.\'a0 The top of the frame has slipped down a little; but you can easily push it up.\'a0 I tacked the cord securely & hung up the picture again. I have had no trouble with the servants yet, and as I have determined not to be troubled by them, I do not expect to.\'a0 Everything in your household goes on as usual, not excepting Rose, who did not as usual come up last night in time to be milked.\'a0 George is complaining of a pain\'a0 in his shoulder which prevents his working as much as he usually does. Two Magnolia\'92s came last night.\'a0 The January and March numbers.\'a0 I do not know why those numbers came as you have them already.\'a0 The Herald, Courier, Mercury, & a pamphlet from Mr. Calhoun also came I paid Dr. Crittenden last Saturday 50 cts for the sweet Potatoes George got from him to plant.\'a0 You must not expect to hear from me again until Sunday night.\'a0 To let you hear Friday night, I would have to write day after tomorrow, and before I had heard from you it is not worthwhile writing so soon only to say we are all well.\'a0 I think it more probable Margaret will be here Wednesday & Thursday.\'a0 I will write to you Friday, so that you will receive a letter \ul Sunday\ulnone .\'a0 If you go to the Legislature again, I will write every Mail to prevent your being uneasy about home.\'a0 It was that reason that made me write to you so often last winter even when I was sick.\'a0 I [page torn] not wish \ul anxiety\ulnone  about \ul home\ulnone  to induce you declining to be [page torn] candidate.\'a0 I thought my letters would comfort you so, you would be willing to remain in Columbia a few weeks & acquire reputation.\'a0 I have been reading the Spartanbuergh Journal this morning.\'a0 It predicts War with both Mexico & England, & says we must \ul particularly\ulnone  mark his prediction, that before the first of March, that we will be engaged in War with England, that War will be declared before Congress adjourns.\'a0 He says we have nothing to lose, but if I was to lose you, I am sure nothing would repay my loss.\'a0 If I had much faith in that Journal, I would be very uneasy. The baby has woke up, & needs my attention so I must now close my dear husband, Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is now past eight oclock.\'a0 Margaret has just left me.\'a0 She has been here all day,\'a0 She is coming again tomorrow which would prevent my writing to you, so I am obliged to embrace this opportunity to enable you to hear by Sunday\'92s Mail.\'a0 I received your letter last night and as you may suppose it gave me great pleasure.\'a0 I was glad to hear you arrived safely and enjoyed the stores Mamma and myself provided for you.\'a0 I wish I had furnished you more abundantly, for I was afraid among you all you had hardly enough to stay your appetites.\'a0 I hope you found the Cherry bounce an agreeable addition to your bread stuff, at any rate that it was not in the way. I am sorry you have not been able to purchase \'93Destiny\'94, my heart was set upon your reading it.\'a0 It is so interesting, and I was desirous you should see that my taste and judgement were better than you imagined.\'a0 I think to make up you will have to bring me \'93Womans Reward\'94 or \'93The three Eras in Womans Life.\'94 You say you hope I have had no trouble with the servants.\'a0 I have had none except with George, who I am sorry to tell you has not done as well as usual.\'a0 He will not do anything except when he pleases, and it only pleases him to work in the garden.\'a0 Day after day he goes into the garden and hoes, hoes, when there are no weeds to be hoed.\'a0 He will neither whitewash, scour or cut up wood.\'a0 The wood is so large it can hardly be used in the kitchen much less in the house, and these cold days, particularly cold morning I have been obliged to sit without fire, and with my baby looking blue with cold until today when I paid Mr. Goodlet\'92s Jacob 12 \'bd cts for cutting up some wood,\'a0 Do you not think It would have been much more comfortable for myself & children to have been seated by a warm fire [on] a cold morning, than to have the weeds hoed in the garden.\'a0 As for the Scouring I excused him, because he said he had a pain in his shoulder, which he thinks perhaps he will never get rid of and that he may never again be able to scour.\'a0 But it put me to great inconvenience to hold the baby while Delia was scouring.\'a0 He will not Whitewash either, the only thing he likes to do is to work in the Garden.\'a0 I tell you these things to amuse you, and show you what an odd disposition he has.\'a0 I am glad you did not purchase him at $500.\'a0 It is too much to give for an old man, who will be less and less valuable every day that passes over his head, and who is disabled by Rheumatism from doing almost any kind of hard work.\'a0 I think another year you ought to get him\'85dollars, and the next year for less, particularly if the pain in his shoulder continues. Susan & myself rode to Mrs. Tabers one evening\'a0 and went over the house; there is scarcely any furniture in it, but of the little there is, there are a few peices I would like to have.\'a0 I dare say if she can neither sell or rent the place, she would like to dispose of the furniture, and that she would take very little for it.\'a0 There is a painted press such a one\'a0 as I have often told you I would like to have; also a wooden Sofa, stuffed, very comfortable, almost exactly the shape of our drawing room, with a pretty cover on it.\'a0 It would look very nice in the dining room.\'a0 It would be delightful to loll on by the window in summer and by the fire in winter.\'a0 You would like it exceedingly.\'a0 There were two nice bedsteads, a looking glass, 3 basin stand[s], & a few painted chairs.\'a0 These things with a few tables some paint stained, some common pine ones, & two Ottomans is all the furniture in the house.\'a0 You must ride there when you come back. I am getting quite sleepy & as you can perceive from the mistakes I make, you disapprove of going to bed late, and as it always gives me pleasure to act according to your wishes, present or absent, I must soon close my letter and retire.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 I will be very glad to see you again, but you must not return before you have finished your business.\'a0 Do not be worried about me.\'a0 I get along quite smoothly and comfortably.\'a0 George, I dare say will do better.\'a0 I have not been worried by him, only provoked a little at his obstinacy.\'a0 You must write when convenient.\'a0 You forgot to take the measure of Wills Shoe.\'a0 I will send it in this letter.\'a0 Do not forget Anna\'92s carri[a]ge.\'a0 She and the rest of us are quite well.\'a0 Susan was here today, Ann is suffering a great deal.\'a0 Willy says Pa is coming Sunday night.\'a0 I bought this pen on purpose to write to you, and Delia has spoilt it by making nose eyes & mouth on a cloth baby.\'a0 I heard from Mrs. Townes today.\'a0 She was quite well.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P. If you do not hear by Wednesdays Mail you may know I have nothing to write about.Be sure to get the shoes large enough.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to promise I take up my pen to write you a few lines.\'a0 The children have just gone to sleep.\'a0 They are both upstairs, & I hope will sleep soundly until I have finished my letter.\'a0 I neglected getting from you good pens & paper, so my first letter will present to the eye very little to boast of.\'a0 Tomorrow I will provide myself with better materials from Mr. Nicol, & you must make many apologies for this one. The children are both well, & behave pretty well.\'a0 I asked Will at supper what I should tell you for him.\'a0 He said, Tell Pa to buy me a horse, & that I have been a good boy.\'a0 There was no service this afternoon at the Episcopal church, so I let Delia go out, & took charge of the children myself.\'a0 I amused Willy by telling him stories about the pictures in his book, & he seemed very much interested.\'a0 Anna in the meanwhile walked about tearing up paper, snatching every now & then at Willy\'92s book, & busying herself in various ways, & looked so sweet & healthy, that I wished you were here to admire her.\'a0 I heard this morning Mr. Pinckney\'92s fifth sermon on the Millenium.\'a0 It was an interesting one.\'a0 He gave no reason for not preaching this afternoon.\'a0 I saw Mrs. Sam Earle at church.\'a0 She is now staying with her mother.\'a0 She said she intends coming to see me tomorrow.\'a0 She rode home in the carri[a]ge with Susan & myself.\'a0 Her mothers carri[a]ge was full.\'a0 She said she was sorry you are not a member of the Legislature & that she heard a great many regret you did not offer.\'a0 You may be sure I agreed with her. For I will never cease to regret your refusing to be a member.\'a0 If you have any regard for me you must offer for the senate the next time.\'a0 I am sure you could beat any one man in the district, though you do not stand so good a chance when four are to be elected, & for the senate you will have the trouble of electioneering but once in four years.\'a0 Mrs. Earle said her mother since she had seen Willy in church was almost crazy about him.\'a0 She thought him so beautiful, & now quite abused her child\'a0 because Willy was so much prettier than him; that until her Mother saw Willy, she had thought her child quite pretty.\'a0 Susan slept here last night.\'a0 She had been so much disturbed the previous night on account of Ann, that she wished to have a good nights rest, to enable her to sit up tonight & relieve Mamma.\'a0 They think Ann suffers as much, if not more than she ever has done, & they are constantly witnessing her sufferings.\'a0 Now I feel \ul greatly\ulnone  for Ann, but I cannot realize how she suffers, for I am not in the house with her & do not see her at the time she suffers the most but I know she is a great sufferer.\'a0 Last night was the seventh night she had not slept. Aunt Eliza in her last letter \ul requested\ulnone  Mamma to invite \ul you\ulnone  & \ul myself\ulnone  to pay her a visit this winter, that she would be very happy to have us with her.\'a0 She says nothing but Mr. Hayne\'92s \ul desperate\ulnone \'a0 situation would induce him to offer for an office, & that she will feel bitterly his defeat, that she thinks his \ul few\ulnone  \ul real\ulnone  friends & they are few indeed will exert themselves greatly.\'a0 I really think my dear husband you might do something for him.\'a0 You might ask Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cox, Mr. Earle to make Mr. Hayne at any rate their \ul second\ulnone  choice.\'a0 I would be gratified at your doing something for him. Judge Earle the morning he left authorized Mr. Choice to give George a ticket to look out for an owner for himself at 300 dollars until Thursday.\'a0 Mamma is strongly inclined to purchase him & I have advised her to, but she does not like to take so important a step without consulting you.\'a0 What a pity Judge Earle did not come to this determination before you left.\'a0 George seems suddenly to have acquired the use of his limbs & looks quite well.\'a0 He says he will give up drinking &Mamma can supply him with Tobacco (she says).\'a0 She will only lose 18 or 21 dollars interest a year, & that is not as much as she pays now for the hire of an additional servant.\'a0 George can work well for 10 or 15 years at least, & when he is too old to work, the expense of supporting him will not be much. He is very anxious Mamma would purchase him.\'a0 He dislikes leaving Greenville & his wife.\'a0 All to whom he has applied say they would like if they could to own him very much, that he can do everything so well.\'a0 You know we have never had \ul proof\ulnone  of his being dishonest.\'a0 We have only \ul suspected\ulnone  him.\'a0 With Mamma he would be out of the village, away from temptation, & John who is perfectly honest would be a guard upon him & himself has the superintendence of the Stable & Crib. So that George [if] he is dishonest would not have it in his power to be dishonest as he had here & when Mr. Croft takes home Rachel he can cook for Minerva & he can cut up wood, & keep the garden & whole place in such good order.\'a0 If Mamma thought you would approve of it, she would buy him instantly, & she wishes she could hear from you before George leaves but as no one is authorized to detain him longer than Tuesday he will have to go, but if you approve of the purchase, she wishes you to ask Judge Earle to let George return to Greenville & she will be his purchaser.\'a0 If Judge Earle has a kind heart he will certainly consent, if it is only on account of George\'92s wife, but not being himself a husband, perhaps he will have no sympathy on that point.\'a0 But I really think it is cruel to treat a man at George\'92s time of life in that way, now that he is in Greenville & former connexions, he ought to be allowed to remain for the rest of his life, & not for a hundred or 2 dollars carried to a strange place, separated from his wife, and perhaps be unhappy for the remainder of his existence.\'a0 Perhaps to have gai.. my cause I ought to have been less warm, & taken less interest in the subject, for now from obstinacy you will take the other[word obscured by repair tissue]advise Mamma not to buy him & refuse to say anything to Judge Earle but I request you to consider the subject well.\'a0 I am certain you will come to the conclusion to request Judge Earle to send George back to Greenville & let Mamma become his owner.\'a0 He servants have done quite well except Eliza one day[word obscured by tissue repair]me a little, but if she behaves well the remainder of your absence she need not forfeit her present.\'a0 I \ul miss\ulnone  you of \ul course\ulnone  but do not be anxious about me or hurry back on my account.\'a0 Stay as long as you ought.\'a0 Write me all the news.\'a0 I am ashamed of my letter.\'a0 If I thought it would get safe I would send it by George, but I afraid he might not find you.\'a0 My next shall be more creditable.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 I wrote more than I intended on this last page & have had to cut the sheet longer than I purposed\'85have therefore spaces left at the bottom of these pages & not room enough on this page.\'a0 I have been reading an account of Colts suicide.\'a0 What a warning his fate brought on by his own conduct, ought to be to others.\'a0 Mr. Simms ought to make it the foundation of a novel.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 Ever your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Though quite late I have taken up my pen to write to you, for I am afraid I might be prevented tomorrow.\'a0 You will be disappointed in not hearing from me tomorrow night.\'a0 Margaret was here yesterday and the day before and kept me so busy I had not a moment to spare.\'a0 I sat up last night until 12 oclock working on my dress so you may judge how closely employed during the day I must have been.\'a0 She has not finished with us yet, but will come back next week for a few days. I received your letter, and was very much pleased to hear from you, and still more so when I think perhaps I was the only wife so soon remembered\'a0 by her husband.\'a0 I \ul know\ulnone  Mrs. Townes did not hear from her better half, and I am almost \ul certain\ulnone  Mrs. Earle did not, for she was \ul surprised\ulnone  when I asked her if she had written.\'a0 I rather think Mr. Cox is so much astounded at the novelty of his situation, and feels such a responsibility on his shoulders, that he has not had time to think of his good wife at home, and what husband do you think received two long letters written only two or three days after he left home?\'a0 I wrote you a long letter by George which he promised to deliver into your hands.\'a0 I think he seemed rather pleased to leave Greenville.\'a0 He said if he could not belong to yourself or Mamma he would rather not stay; all (except you) are fond of change; even when well situated, and George is not an exception. I suppose you are anxious to hear how we get along without him; why as far as I can perceive, we do just as well without him as with him.\'a0 The chief business of a man servant in winter [is] cutting up wood; James seems to get along with pretty well.\'a0 The stable perhaps may not be attended to so well; for George devoted his whole time to it, but I dare say it is kept in sufficiently good order, & the corn in the crib probably feels safe now, though I think that was only a suspicion of ours.\'a0 I do not know that I will regret it, if you decide Mamma had better not purchase him.\'a0 I am afraid I was too urgent, and that\'a0 you have been influenced by me (as you are more apt to be when absent than present) to decide against your superior judgment.\'a0 I hope however you followed my last advice, which you know generally comes after advising you strenuously on any subject, and have done as you thought best.\'a0 We have some difficulty making up fires in the morning, having no splits, but that has always been the case. Today Mr. McBee sent a load of wood, and I took the liberty of asking the man to bring some wood that would answer for splits and he said he would. The servants have given me no further trouble than what I mentioned.\'a0 Eliza is now making Delia\'92s dress, and next week I think I will let her make up her childrens clothes.\'a0 I think Victoria does better than she did.\'a0 We seem to have an abundance of Milk; and yesterday I made two quarts of custard with cream.\'a0 I have been very neighborly to Mrs. Townes in sending her different things, and tonight she has sent me some Eggnog.\'a0 I have drunk some of it only; and the Brandy has got into my head.\'a0 Do not tell Col. Townes for the world, but do you not think he ought to take his name off from the Temperance Society. Some Fence Lumber was brought here yesterday, sent by Mr. Loveland.\'a0 I had no idea you intended building a new fence.\'a0 I hope it is for the front of the house, and the next lumber that is brought must be appropriated to the additional wings, we are contemplating for the house. Mr. Vicaes has put in the panes of glasses; and brought in a mallet to beat biscuits with. Col. Dunham has a sister here and neices recently from the North.\'a0 I saw the young ladies at church last Sunday dressed very fine.\'a0 Margaret says he is going to make them his heirs.\'a0 I hope they will be comforts to him.\'a0 I know of nothing new to tell you, except that the ground today and yesterday has been covered with sleet.\'a0 It is now melting.\'a0I am really glad your accident on the road was not more serious.\'a0 You must be careful in driving.\'a0 Your horse is used so little I wonder it is not more fractious.\'a0 Your economical scheme well nigh proved a very expensive one to all parties, particularly to the members of the Legislature. I am afraid Mr. Hayne stands a poor chance of being elected, as he is not a good electioneerer himself.\'a0 Mr. Martin I suppose will try his utmost, and Mr. Rhett also.\'a0 Cousin Isaac Hayne I believe is not coming on until January. You must not forget to buy a bell for the dining room.\'a0 I think you had better also get one for my chamber.\'a0 It would be the greatest convenience, so get \ul two\ulnone  bells for ourselves; and Mamma says she would like you to get one for her. Ann is still suffering a great deal and sleepless; she has exerted herself and taken exercise, but it has not prevented, or alleviated her sufferings.\'a0 The rest of us are well.\'a0 Willy makes me read what you said about his horse in your letter.\'a0 He thought of course you had written about the horse.\'a0 Today I mentioned your name to Anna; and she looked around the room, and out of the window for Papa.\'a0 She is as pretty and interesting as ever.\'a0You see I have bought pen & paper & charged them to you, only 18 \'be cts, half quire of paper for 12 \'bd cts, a dozen steel pens & stick for 6 1/4 cts.\'a0 It is now quite late, half past ten; time you will think to retire.\'a0 I will leave my letter open and perhaps add a few lines tomorrow.\

I hope to receive a letter from you this evening.\'a0 Willy says I must tell you he has been a good boy; but I don\'92t know that I can tell you the same; though he certainly is much better than he used to be.\'a0 I have not whipped him since you left. I suppose Columbia is as gay and lively as possible.\'a0 Susan is anxious for you to get her some Morocco, but I told her I knew you would not; you would think it was for me.\'a0 Write word if you \ul will\ulnone  get it.\'a0 If not she will commission Mr. H. Thompson, but she would rather you, as the last you got was so pretty.\'a0 I would like to know the \ul price\ulnone  of Rowlands Macassar, Kalydor, and Odonto, before you buy them.\'a0 If they are \ul reasonable\ulnone , I will wish them.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, Elizabeth F.

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter by Col. Townes, and read it with must pleasure.\'a0 I was disappointed at not hearing from you the last mail, but at the same time was pleased \ul business\ulnone  should prevent you; for I \ul knew\ulnone  \ul that\ulnone  was the cause of your silence.\'a0 I am \ul pleased\ulnone  that you have bought a gold pencil case for Susan.\'a0 I know she will be delighted with it, value it much, and be grateful at your attention.\'a0 I think I have heard her say she would like to have one.\'a0 Her two most valuable presents will have been given her by you, her gold thimble and gold pencil case.\'a0 You need not get one for me, another time when you can afford it better I would prefer it. Willy made me read over and over again what you said about his horse.\'a0 It is almost his constant theme of conversation.\'a0 His heart is set upon having one, so you must get it even at fourteen dollars.\'a0 I would rather him have his horse, than that you should bring anything for me.\'a0 Could you not box it up and send it in the stage now that it comes empty; or be on the lookout for a wagon; or make Mr. Cox bring it in his carri[a]ge.\'a0 What a pity you could not have sent it back in the empty carri[a]ge.\'a0 I would like you to bring Anna a doll, \ul not\ulnone  costing \ul much\ulnone . I can never be reconciled to your not being a member of the Legislature.\'a0 I feel that you have lost much of your importance; and I too, since your resignation.\'a0 When so much intriguing and electioneering is going on, it shows what importance is attached to honours, and it distresses me that already your career in public life is run; and that you have quietly resigned all pretension to fame, honour, and distinction among your fellow men; and that for the remainder of your life, you are to pass only as a \ul plodding\ulnone  \ul Greenville\ulnone  \ul Attorney\ulnone .\'a0 I would willingly give up several hundred dollars to see your name mentioned in the paper, with honour and distinction as I used to and to read those interesting letters written by you for the Mountaineer & to know that you were a Legislator & did much credit to the position you occupied.\'a0 You must not forget to give Mr. Hayne the box from Susan.\'a0 I long to know the result of the election.\'a0 You ought to have written me if there was any chance in his favor.\'a0 Mrs. Martin I suppose is not in Columbia.\'a0 Mrs. Keith must be thankful to have Col. Keith a delegate to the Temperance Convention.\'a0 I suppose you did not see her.\'a0 She is a sweet lady.\'a0 You must let me enclose all of your briefs in future.\'a0 I pleases me to think I can be of some use to you in your business.\'a0 I am afraid Mr. Barnwell Rhett will be elected senator, and I would rather anyone than him.\'a0 He is too conceited already.\'a0 What an aspiring family they are.\'a0 I expect they will all be members of Congress.\'a0 One of them will wish to take the place of Mr. Barnwell Rhett as Representative.\'a0 Mr. Edmund and Mr. Albert the only ones we know have always been kind to us; particularly Mr. Albert who has been a true friend, and performed many acts of friendship.\'a0 He was an intimate friend of my brothers.\'a0 I would like to see him again \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone . Mamma thought \ul you\ulnone  would know best whether George would be a good bargain.\'a0 She did not know whether the price asked for him was reasonable; and whether his age & drinking were an ins\'85 objection.\'a0 She thought these things\'a0 you would judge of better than herself.\'a0 If I see her tomorrow, before I close this letter, I will tell her what you say & give you her answer.\'a0 She needs another man besides John to cut up wood & attend to the whole place, but she was uncertain if it was better to get George, or give a little more, for a younger & temperate man, & who would be useful for a longer time.\'a0 You ought to have written what you thought. I will send this letter by Mr. Duncan along with a spoon to be marked for Anna, which I forgot to give you.\'a0 He will stop at Maybin\'92s, & he offered to take anything to you.\'a0 Have the spoon marked \'93Anna Perry\'94.\'a0 It is the one that Martha sent the first time I was confined; as Anna has taken the place of the little girl we lost then, she is entitled to it.\'a0 I dare say Mr. Janney\'92s little girl is beautiful.\'a0 She is entitled to it from both parents. The servants are giving me no trouble.\'a0 If they go on so, they will all be entitled to presents.\'a0 James cuts wood every day, so that I have it as abundantly as when George was here.\'a0 He says the animals are all well.\'a0 Willy behaves very well.\'a0 The snow has kept him in the house for several days, & it has quite improved his character & manners.\'a0 He speaks of you with affection.\'a0 Perhaps he connects you with his horse.\'a0 Anna is well, & I think understands everything.\'a0 She does not give me as much trouble at night as when you are here.\'a0 Susan slept here last night.\'a0 Ann was suffering more yesterday than she has ever done, but she slept last night, and is therefore better today.\'a0 Dr. Wurderman in his last letter said if her \ul bodily\ulnone  \ul health\ulnone  was good, the irritation of her nerves would be lessened.\'a0 The sickness is not entirely nervous.\'a0 I dined at Mamma\'92s today.\'a0 They desired their love to you. Mrs. Cox has heard of the death of her son.\'a0 Mrs. Marion continues about the same as when you left.\'a0 I have not seen her lately.\'a0 You are not particularly fond of news, but I will tell you something quite so romantic for Greenville.\'a0 Dr. James Williams & Anna D\'92Oyley have suddenly conceived quite a passion for each other & both are anxious & determined to be married.\'a0 Mrs. Baker is opposed to it, & for fear of a runaway match, report says, has had Anna locked up.\'a0 Persons say she ought certainly to give her advice, but not attempt to control Anna, particularly as she has never control[l]ed her before in her life.\'a0 James Williams got Mr. Pinckney to go & talk with her Mrs. Baker on the subject & before Mrs. D\'92Oyley, she asked Anna how she could think of acting so, when she had had before her eyes, for such a long time, her father, such a wretched drunkard, & knew what a life he had led her mother.\'a0 Anna I expect is very anxious to marry, & would join her lot wth anyone.\'a0 She [page torn] out that this yea[page torn] was determined to be married, if it was even to Tench Cox. I will give you a list of what we wish you to buy.\'a0 Mamma wishes you to buy her a bell to hang for her dining room.\'a0 If they are \ul not\ulnone  \ul expensive\ulnone  she would like \ul two\ulnone ; if they are \ul expensive\ulnone , only \ul one\ulnone .\'a0 Susan wishes \'93Miss Leslie\'92s seventy five receipt book\'94 and one dollars worth of Morocco.\'a0 Get it at the \ul same\ulnone  \ul place\ulnone  you got it the last time, & the same thin kind of different colours\'a0 I wish a box of Tooth powder, several peices of soap\'a0 such as you bought once, of an \ul oval\ulnone  form, 18 \'be\'a0 cts a piece.\'a0 \'93Sears Bible Biography\'94 & if you think they are not impositions & are reasonable, Rowlands Macassar oil, Rowlands Kalydon for the complexion, & Rowlands Odonto for the teeth.\'a0 You may pay for all of these things out of my quarterly allowance.\'a0 Willy wishes a horse, & Anna a doll, & \ul we\ulnone  wish \ul two\ulnone  \ul bells\ulnone , one for the dining room, and one for my chamber.\'a0 And after expressing my wishes, I leave them to be regulated by your purse. I leave my letter open to add a few lines tomorrow\'a0 A letter has come tonight for you from Augusta.\'a0 I think it is from the president of the bank of Augusta.\'a0 He says I enclose \ul Ten\ulnone  \ul Dollars\ulnone  amount of your fee, say Bank of Augusta Note No. 1669 Letter B Sept. 3
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super d 
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub 1836) and with it my thanks &c., & signed Robert F.

I have just seen Susan.\'a0 She says as George is so old, & drinks, , they will \ul give\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  the thought of purchasing him & if they buy, get a younger servant, & we all think 300 dollars too much for him.\'a0 I have known old servants to sell for 150 dollars.\'a0 George cannot cut wood well, & that is what Mamma principally wishes [page torn] servant for in winter, so she decides \ul not\ulnone  to buy him, & I expect you would decide for her in the same way.\'a0 Susan is very much pleased with the Gold pencil case.\'a0 She will value it extremely. I will send the letter that came from Augusta last night along with this.\'a0 Do not bring me a gold pencil case.\'a0 I assure you I do not even care for one at present.\'a0 I wish Willy to have his horse very much, but if your fiends will not allow you to get the other things I have mentioned you must not.\'a0 Do not return home until you have finished all of your business.\'a0 The longer you stay away, the more business it will seem you have.\'a0 But you must not think I am not anxious to see you.\'a0 Though I would not be glad to have you come home as soon as Col. Townes has.\'a0 Judge Earle I expect is so anxious to marry, that he will address the first lady that pays him any attention, & perhaps be taken in by some one unsuitable for him.\'a0 If he has taken so long to choose, he ought to be careful in his selection.\'a0 I should think he was in a predicament.\'a0 If he remains single he expects to be unhappy; & if he marries he is equally afraid of being unhappy.\'a0 Margaret will be here the greater part of the week; so if you do not hear from me, you must know I have been prevented writing by her.\'a0 I am afraid I will not be able to write by the next Mail.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Contrary to my expectations I am enabled to write to you today.\'a0 Margaret came so late this morning, I begged her to go away and come tomorrow.\'a0 She will be here the remainder of the week, so it will be impossible for me to write you by Sundays Mail.\'a0 I have just returned from seeing Mrs. Marion.\'a0 She looks wretchedly.\'a0 You say you always expect a death to occur before you return home, but you little thought one would occur in your own family.\'a0 Our old sou is no more.\'a0 She was found dead by the Market house this morning.\'a0 Mr. Hoke sent to tell me of it.\'a0 I enquired if she had been killed; (knowing how troublesome she was,) or had died a natural death.\'a0 He sent word he expected she died of\'85self, that she was very much swol[l]en.\'a0 He thought she must have been where they were killing hogs and eaten too much lights, that he lost one very suddenly a few days ago.\'a0 She has been such a useful animal to us, that I regret her death very much, and am afraid now even if we wish it, we will not be able to raise our hogs, for she was the only prolific sou we had. Susan and myself went last night to hear the converted Jew preach.\'a0 He was not as interesting as I expected, though he will be more so tonight when he will preach about the Jews in particular.\'a0 The Baptist church was very full. Dr. James Williams and Anna D\'92Oyle[y] are still in trouble.\'a0 Last week Mrs. Baker permitted them to see each other, but this week her heart is hardened, and she will not permit him to visit at the house.\'a0 James Williams the other night stopped the Columbia stage.\'a0 He had an idea that Mrs. Baker intended sending Anna to Newberry to the Dr. Croft\'92s, and that she was in the stage then.\'a0 I expect they will have to make a runaway match of it.\'a0 Old Dr. Williams says \ul he\ulnone  will give them a home.\'a0 Perhaps he thinks marrying will improve his son.\'a0 The young man went to see Mr. Pinckney a few days ago.\'a0 It appears he wishes him to exert his influence with Mrs. Baker. Having written so lately, I have \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 I do not think it is worthwhile even to send this letter containing so little.\'a0 I have visited very little since you left.\'a0 The Snow made the walking for such a long time bad.\'a0 It was impossible to go out.\'a0 Next week I intend to return my visits.\'a0 The weather is now warm and pleasant which will make us \ul feel\ulnone  the cold weather when it comes again. I hope you are passing your time pleasantly, and you ought to, for you are now among gentleman more like yourself than those you are generally with.\'a0 Mamma wrote work to Aunt Eliza, that she had better let Susan come up and pay us a visit, that she could go to Columbia and come on to Greenville with you.\'a0 She forgot you were travelling in your buggy.\'a0 I \ul know\ulnone  she will not come, but \ul if\ulnone  she were to, she is so \ul small\ulnone  she would not incommode you, and her trunk could come in the stage.\'a0 I am \ul certain\ulnone  however that she will not come. Miss Pinckney came to see me yesterday morning.\'a0 The servants still do well.\'a0 I hope to receive a letter from you tonight, and to hear that Mr. Hayne is elected.\'a0 Dinner is coming in, so it is a good time for me to close my letter.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P. P.S. I am ashamed to send so poor a letter, but hope you will be satisfied at hearing we are all well, except Ann who is still suffering greatly.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have a few moments to spare from Margaret, and will devote them to writing to you, as this may be the last letter that I will write, as you may leave Columbia in a few days.\'a0 I wish to mention two commissions I forgot in my last.\'a0 One is that you will get some \ul Leads\ulnone  for Susan\'92s Gold pencil.\'a0 They are so \ul small\ulnone . I know they cannot be procured here, and without leads the pencil would be useless.\'a0 The other is that you will get a prayer book for yourself.\'a0 You had said you would get one, but I think you may have forgotten it. I was very much pleased to receive your letter on Wednesday.\'a0 When I read that you hoped I had received the pencil case by Col. Townes, I was frightened, for he had sent me the letter but no pencil.\'a0 I instantly sent over to him to know if he had it.\'a0 He sent it over by Delia, and said when you gave it to him, he put it away safely in his pocket book, and never thought of it again.\'a0 In a few moments he came over, and apologized for his neglect, and I told him all the news in your letter.\'a0 He was anxious to know about Cauble\'92s case, which you had not mentioned. I do hope Judge Huger will be elected.\'a0 If you were only in the Legislature, you would \ul vote\ulnone , and do so much \ul more\ulnone  for him than you can now.\'a0 Dr. Crook says if he was there, he would get his vote; that he hopes he will be successful.\'a0 Those Rhetts are so ambitious.\'a0 They ought to be disappointed, and Col. Davie I think is very presumptuous. I am so anxious to hear of Mr. Hayne\'92s election.\'a0 I wonder you have not written me of his prospects, when you know I was so much interested on the subject.\'a0 Aunt Eliza says he went to Columbia sanguine, and even she had permitted herself to be hopeful.\'a0 I suppose it is decided now, and that he now has better certainty, instead of trying suspense.\'a0 Willy will be delighted with his horse.\'a0 You are fortunate to have found an opportunity so soon of bringing it home.\'a0 This morning in bed, he said he wanted to see Pa.\'a0 Susan is with me, and thanks you for the pencil.\'a0 We all think it very pretty.\'a0 We have been fortunate lately in receiving presents.\'a0 Dr. Irvine brought a package from Dr. Wurderman, containing four books for Mamma, Susan, Ann & myself, and a little box of old coins for Ann.\'a0 I was gratified at being remembered by him, and think it was kind & thoughtful in him to think of us.\'a0 He has now left for Cuba, and wrote that his health had failed so rapidly for eight or ten days, that he left Charleston with less regret than he otherwise would have done.\'a0 Yesterday Anna received a present from Frances Marion, a pretty little chain, a pretty little one.\'a0 The day before, Mrs. Smerdon told me she never could return my kindness to Mrs. Marion, and I suppose to show her gratitude, she sent the chain.\'a0 I was very much pleased at it. Mr. Simms is really complimentary to Ann at his wife\'92s expense.\'a0 I wish his cold water remedy could benefit her but she does not get better, through as she is able to ride, and sit up and take exercise, she is not as bad off as she was last winter,\'a0 Mamma has just sent word that she slept last night.\'a0\'a0 I think when sleep returns to her, she will then recover. I have stopped writing to read the Mountaineer, so I see the contest for secretary of state lies between Mr. Pinckney and General Jones, and it is decided before this.\'a0 I am very glad to hear you are so complimented on your good looks.\'a0 I think you are altogether indebted to me for your improved appearance.\'a0 As soon as those tremendous collars of yours were clipped, a marked change took place, and ten years seemed taken from your age, but your improvement is not altogether owing to the collars, but also to the happy life I have led you, for you look younger than when I married you.\'a0 The old Bachelors life you led would not have agreed with you, for as soon as you became a husband and father, an evident change took place.\'a0 If you would get a nice little \ul sc\'85toh\ulnone  to cover that exposed spot on your head, I think you would be still more improved, indeed it would be the greatest improvement to you, you can imagine.\'a0 I would then be perfectly satisfied, so for my sake if your can procure one that will answer well, you must get it. I would like you to bring Ann \ul three\ulnone  or \ul four\ulnone  oranges.\'a0 Remember \ul only\ulnone  \ul three\ulnone  or \ul four\ulnone , if you conveniently can in your trunk.\'a0 I am almost afraid to make the request unless you should waste your money and bring more.\'a0 But I hope you will only bring a few, & those few only if it is perfectly convenient.\'a0\'a0Not knowing the state of your funds, I may have been unreasonable in the number of my commissions, so I leave it to you to leave as many unperformed as you choose.\'a0 As I have kept you informed of Anna D\'92Oyleys\'a0 love affair, I must tell you the result.\'a0 Mrs. Baker has had \ul her\ulnone  way, & she has refused James Williams.\'a0 Report says Mrs. Baker whipped her, but I can hardly believe she went as far as that.\'a0 Altogether I think it has been a very disgraceful affair, and quite uncommon for Greenville.\'a0I hope this evening to receive a letter from you.\'a0 I must now close.\'a0 I have written a newsy longer letter than I expected to when I commenced.\'a0 Susan sends her love, and said she needed nothing to keep you in remembrance, but if she did, your present will bring you to mind & almost every moment of the day.\'a0 It is such a useful as well as pretty one. Mrs. Earle went home last Monday, but her mother expects her back again in a few days.\'a0 She was at church last Sunday.\'a0 Mrs. Carson is coming tomorrow to stay with her mother.\'a0 I saw Miss McBee a few days ago.\'a0 I suppose you have seen Mr. Carson.\'a0 I think Miss McBee said he wrote word that he was going to take a ride with you.\'a0 I should think you would find it pleasant having your buggy in Columbia, and I dare say you have plenty of time, not being in the Legislature, to ride. There is no news, nothing at all to relate, we are all here quite well.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P. P.S. The servants still do well.\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Though very busy working, I have stopped to write you a few lines, to prevent you being disappointed Friday night & to inform you how we are coming on.\'a0 You forgot to leave me good pens.\'a0 Those in the desk are so bad, I can hardly work with them, so you must make many allowances for bad writing.\'a0 I look forward with great pleasure to hearing from you tonight.\'a0 It seems an age since you left home. The incident of greatest importance that has occurred, has been a visit from Delia\'92s mother.\'a0 She came Sunday evening in the stage & left this morning.\'a0 She said this was the time she intended visiting Delia, that her little girl made a mistake when she said Christmas, that at Christmas if convenient she would like Delia to visit her, when she expects to see some of her other children.\'a0 I was very much pleased with Milly. She was far superior to what I expected to find her, & much younger & better looking.\'a0 She seemed very much pleased to find Delia so well situated, & gave her a great deal of good advice, to behave herself well & be thankful for having such good owners.\'a0 Very differently situated did she find Caroline, who she went to see & passed one night with.\'a0 She says Mrs. Lynch gave her a most dreadful character which she does of all of her servants except one, that she gives her very little to eat, & that all the clothes she had on, would not be enough to make an apron, & after working out all day, when she comes home at night from the fields, she has to spin a card of cotton, which would take her until 10 oclock, & Mrs. Lynch wont let her have the bed clothes to sleep on, which she gave her when she was sold (her share of the family estate).\'a0 She must be treated very badly.\'a0 I have always heard Mrs. Lynch was very cross.\'a0 Milly took off one of her petticoats, & made it into one for Caroline, & made her something else out of Hom\'85 she carried her.\'a0 She & Delia both cried at the thoughts of Caroline\'92s situation.\'a0 I have promised that Delia shall go to Spartanburgh at Christmas if she is a good girl.\'a0 Delia is 16 years old next July.\'a0 I will tell you all about the visit when you return.\'a0 Milly was delighted with Mamma who she went to see.\'a0 I told her she must see the old Missus as well as the young.\'a0 Miss Susan was very pretty but not prettier than me although I was married. Your trunk has come home & is a beautiful one.\'a0 If you had it with you where you were not known, you would certainly be taken for an old bachelor.\'a0 I have had no trouble with servants.\'a0 Jim is today helping John kill hogs, (Mamma bought five from Mr. McClanahan) & John says he will return the favour.\'a0 Jim I think is a very good servant.\'a0 I don\'92t know that you would have got a better one.\'a0 Eliza has been several days at Mamma\'92s working, but is now at home ironing.\'a0 Delia I hope will be better for her mothers visit.\'a0 Lindy & Edward do quite well, but are often in each others way.\'a0 Minerva I have scolded \ul once\ulnone  for sitting in \ul her\ulnone  \ul room\ulnone  in the morning \ul working\ulnone , instead of getting breakfast & James I know nothing about. The children of course you wish to hear about, & in compliment to you I will commence with Frank.\'a0 He is a sweet creature, now sleeps in Delia\'92s lap.\'a0 I am seated in the chamber.\'a0 Anna & Will every now & then run against the table & shake it.\'a0 I give them a slap & send them off & tell them I will inform you what bad children they are.\'a0 Anna is now rocking my chair.\'a0 Well!\'a0 Frank is quite well & grows & improves.\'a0 He laughs aloud, & can almost creep.\'a0 Anna has been very unfortunate, & burnt her arm against the chimney dog.\'a0 She was standing on the Fender trying to reach something from the Mouth peice when she fell forward; fortunately she was at the side of the chimney, instead of directly in front.\'a0 So instead of her face, her arm went against the dog & was burnt.\'a0 It is getting well, & you need not be uneasy.\'a0 I am determined she shall not get burnt again.\'a0 I was near her when she fell, & pulled her out instantly.\'a0 Willy fell out of bed one night & bruised his nose.\'a0 I put him on the outside, that I might be between Anna & himself. & keep Anna covered, but after the fall I took Anna in my bed, as well as Willy, so we all now sleep together.\'a0 The Bedstead must think it a great imposition.\'a0 We have reserved the cot for you.\'a0 I am so well pleased with the present arrangement, I could not be induced to change it.\'a0 Willy one night complained of being sick. & I gave him a dose of oil.\'a0 It did him \ul good\ulnone  & he is now \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 Ann has been very poorly, but the weather has been disagreeable.\'a0 I have not been able to go to see her.\'a0 It rains every night, continues cloudy through the day, & the walking is very bad.\'a0 Mamma sends messages to say I must go whenever I can.\'a0 I intended going today if the weather permitted, but it rained hard last night.\'a0 Susan bought Anna a dress last week [page torn].\'a0 Ann sleeps very little now.\'a0 I will go to see them tomorrow if I can.\'a0 I have not been out of the house ounce since you left.\'a0 I am so busy, I have not even \ul opened\ulnone  Miss Bremer\'92s \'93Neighbours\'94.\'a0 I think it best not, for if I commence it, I cant stop until I have finished it. I know of nothing new to tell you.\'a0 I may not write again for several days, so do not be disappointed or uneasy, when you do not hear.\'a0 And give yourself no trouble about your large family at home.\'a0 They are getting along quite well. I saw the death of Mr. Cunningham bookseller in Columbia.\'a0 I suppose it is the person from whom you have bought books.\'a0 I have heard nothing more of Judge Earle.\'a0 I suppose he is still in the land of the living. No letters have come for you.\'a0 A paper from the commissioner of pensions has come, telling some pensioner that he has been removed from the list in this state to Tennessee I believe.\'a0 Will sends a great many messages about his cocked hat with a feather stuck up in it, his belt. Sword, gun &c. that he had new shoes, that Delia\'92s\'a0 ma has been here\'85.\'a0 And now my dear husband adieu, until tonight. When I expect to have a very pleasant, though short interview with you after the Mail comes it.\'a0 E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you this morning by Col. Townes, & it was only doubly welcome from having received one last night, for like the drunkard & his glass, getting one letter only makes wish for another.\'a0 I have now three letters of yours to answer. If you know what pleasure they give me, you will feel yourself well repaid for writing them. Since writing the above I have been out to shop with Susan.\'a0 I have now eat[en] dinner & will go on with my letter.\'a0 You must not be uneasy when you do not hear from me, but conclude that I have been very busy, & have nothing to write about.\'a0 Anna\'92s arm is getting better.\'a0 It does not seem to have given her much pain.\'a0 It was a \ul bad\ulnone  burn, but not \ul very\ulnone  bad.\'a0 I have been obliged to send Willy out of the bed into the crib.\'a0 We were so crowded, that if we moved in the least we would strike each other, & little Frank was in great danger. Willy is delighted at the presents you have bought him.\'a0 You must do as you think best about the horse.\'a0 I do not know what to advise you.\'a0 The Camera Obscura must be very pretty.\'a0 I am glad you have sent some oranges to Ann.\'a0 She is pleased at being remembered.\'a0 Susan says she liked the \ul Cocoa\ulnone  \ul nut\ulnone  you bought last year very much.\'a0 So you had better bring her two or three & if you see any presents pretty & \ul reasonable\ulnone  for Susan & herself I would like you to bring them, or at any rate one for Ann.\'a0 It is not like the \ul value\ulnone  of the present, but the \ul remembrance\ulnone  that I like, so you need not bring anything costly.\'a0 Mr. Mauldin has some pretty prayer books for $1.25.\'a0 I wish you to give one of them to Susan at Christmas as a present, but if you were to see a \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone  one at that price, you might buy it for me instead of Mr. Mauldins, but not a cent more must you give.\'a0 Susan says Ann wants you to buy her some good \ul Lavender\ulnone  water.\'a0 You know it is to \ul smell\ulnone .\'a0 I hope the watches will keep good time.\'a0 I will be careful of mine in future. I am sorry you have been obliged to sacrifice your Rail Road stock, as it was in reality worth 1500 dollars.\'a0 You have lost 540 dollars.\'a0 I am glad however that you can pay your debts.\'a0 I hope next year as you will be\'85that you will be able to support your family, invest 1000 dollars profitably, & pay a visit to Washington. Mr. Foster has sent 52 barrels of corn.\'a0 I hope you will pay for it as soon as you return.\'a0 I gave John your message this morning.\'a0 He thanked you & seemed pleased to hear of his son.\'a0 I hope you will see Thomas & bring a letter from him when you return.\'a0 I believe John did not live happily with his first wife & you know coloured persons seem to have a right to many wives. If they are separated from one, they console themselves with another.\'a0 I dare say George has found a helpmate in Columbia long since.\'a0 Have you seen him?\'a0 He ought to send a present by you\'a0 to his wife. I received a letter from Pamela last night, who said she had not been able to invite before.\'a0 Her Mother arrived as she was about finishing her letter with Mrs. Yancey\'92s two children.\'a0 She left Mrs. Yancey in a critical situation with a third attack of bleeding at the lungs.\'a0 She is too sick to think of any removal during the winter & too feeble to have her children with her.\'a0 Pamela says she feels her solitude more than ever, that her head & eyes are so weak she is not able to occupy herself as she used to, that she has often wished for me to be with her.\'a0 It was an affectionate letter.\'a0 I will answer it this week.\'a0 I wish you would pass a night with them on your way home.\'a0 You would then see Mrs. Cunningham who you have not seen for such a long time, & Pamela to will be there as I expect she will not go to town until Mrs. Croft goes.\'a0 Mr. Hayne has sent one of Mr. James G. Holmes Therapeutic chairs to Ann which she finds a great comfort.\'a0 Indeed if she had it not, Susan says she would have been obliged to have been held constantly by Mamma or herself.\'a0 It can be rolled all over the house.\'a0 You can lay down in it, or sit up, & has a place for the feet.\'a0 Susan says it is a delightful chair even for a well person, that it cost twenty dollars but looks as if it were worth a great deal more. This is Sale day.\'a0 I have never seen so many persons in the village.\'a0 We have had very bad weather.\'a0 Today is almost the first good day we have had since you left.\'a0 The streets are very muddy.\'a0 Some reviews have come the Westminster & Quarterly, & a letter from Mr. Fabers agent, Mr. Matthews.\'a0 He says Mrs. Faber will take 2000 dollars for the house clear of all expenses, & that you must not forget the \ul Furniture\ulnone ; that you can have it valued by two disinterested persons & sold separately or to the person who buys the house.\'a0 You would think such a rich lady as Mrs. Faber would forget the little Furniture she has in Greenville, but she remembers it & is afraid you will forget it.\'a0 I wish you would have it valued, & take out your fee in furniture, for I would like very much to have the Wardrobe, some chairs, looking glass &c.\'a0 I am glad you bought a new hat.\'a0 You must bring your old one home, & also another that I think you left in Columbia once.\'a0 Your hatter can alter them to fit himself & James.\'a0 You ought to have sent them by Col. Townes or Mr. Ward.\'a0 I hope you did not wear your new cloak in the rain to the Post office.\'a0 My letter was not worth the wetting yourself & cloak & risking a cold likewise, & now that I think of cold, you must gratify me & get something to cover that spot on your \ul head\ulnone , that will feel the cold so much this winter.\'a0\'a0 When persons say you look \ul young\ulnone , they do not see the back of your head & think how young you look, considering you are so old as to be bald headed. Mamma has just sent word by Sarah Gridley, that I must give her love to you.\'a0 I think with Mr. Pettigru that there are a poor set of Candidates for Judge.\'a0 The country little know what I have deprived them of.\'a0 If it had not been for me, you would now be Judge or one of the greatest Statesmen of the day.\'a0 You ought to be President of the United States.\'a0 The best President you would make, we have ever had.\'a0 But I hope you are happy & that it is all ordered for the best.\'a0 Let us be economical & now put up money, & in time you may go to Congress.\'a0 The country would be better if it had your good Judgment to assist in directing its affairs.\'a0I repeat, you must not be uneasy when you do not hear from me.\'a0 Your letters give me great pleasure.\'a0 I must take Frank so adieu my dear husband.\'a0 E.F.P. Willy thanks you for his presents.\'a0 How large is the horse you think of bringing.\'a0 Can you not describe it exactly.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Your very acceptable letter arrived last night.\'a0 Talk of punishing me for not writing!\'a0 Why I think I deserve great credit for writing so often.\'a0 You must consider the difference in our situation.\'a0 You go up to your quiet room & in half an hour write a letter.\'a0 I sit down among children & servants (Willy is now talking to me) & before I have written one page have been interrupted half a dozen times.\'a0 In the first place, Master Franks wants have to be satisfied, then servants come up on Messages; perhaps old Matthias wants his meat weighed, Eggs & Butter are bought, & I have to stop to count or weigh, my table is shaken, but I have mentioned enough reasons for not writing to have satisfied you long ago.\'a0 I have almost a mind not to write you at all, as you will not aspire to the seat on the bench, of which you would be such an ornament.\'a0 I agree with Judge Richardson exactly.\'a0 A Judge with 3000 dollars is better than a Lawyer with 4.\'a0 I am willing to \ul pay\ulnone  for the honour.\'a0 We get along comfortably at home.\'a0 We would not miss you at all.\'a0 Judge Perry sounds remarkably well; but Judge Perry\'92s wife & children sounds \ul better\ulnone .\'a0 I assure you when I married you, I had a \ul distant\ulnone  thought of being a \ul Judge\'92s\ulnone  lady.\'a0 A Judge gets his money without any trouble, but think when you left home you had money owing you to have paid for your servants, & yet you had to borrow it & pay interest, & it is such a \ul respectable\ulnone  office, never mind what part of the world you go to; you would be known to occupy a high standing at home; for the sake of your wife & children you must think of it.\'a0 You are both \ul fortunately\ulnone  & \ul unfortunately\ulnone  situated .\'a0 You would have honours for the asking them, & yet are so situated as not to be \ul able\ulnone  to ask them.\'a0 I believe I would be better satisfied\'a0 if you would not get them for then I would have no aspirations for you, but now it seems to me such a pity. That a man suited for public life, & to be of service to his country, by his \ul character\ulnone , \ul talents\ulnone , & \ul judgment\ulnone  as you are should have his sphere limited to \ul domestic\ulnone  \ul life\ulnone  as well as \ul public\ulnone  too.\'a0 You must not always \'93hide you light under a bushel.\'94\'a0 You ought to have told Judge Richardson you would aspire to his seat when he resigned.\'a0 My dear husband, I know you have said, \'93Pooh! Miss Vanity,\'94 long ago, so leaving this & all other important subjects to be acted on as you think proper, I will commence another.\'a0 Frank cries so I will first attend to his wants. Having satisfied Frank, I will now go on.\'a0 If you had mentioned \ul Ann\ulnone  in your letter last night, I would have sent it today to Mamma\'92s for them to read.\'a0 They would have been interested in what you said of Confirmation.\'a0 Chancellor Harper, Alston Hayne, Washington Ancrum &c.\'a0 but as you did not mention \ul her\ulnone , I could not think of sending it.\'a0 I hope for the sake of the rising generation, Mr. Maturin will be appointed to take charge of the Academy.\'a0 You must use your influence with Col. Dunham & Mr. McLeod.\'a0 But I dare say most of the Trustees not being able to appreciate him, will prefer some more inferior person.\'a0 The Oranges & Pineapples arrived safely yesterday afternoon, three dozen orange & two pineapples.\'a0 I sent a Pineapple & fifteen of the finest oranges to Ann & gave an orange & a peice of pineapple to each of the servants.\'a0 They all seemed pleased & told them very few masters thought of their servants in that way, when from home.\'a0 The servants do very well for me, but they quarrel among themselves.\'a0 Eliza & Minerva were quarreling yesterday, but it is best to leave them to themselves.\'a0 I tell them they were brought together to try their tempers.\'a0 The ground continues so wet Jim has not been able\'a0 to work in the garden much.\'a0 We have had constant rain & most gloomy disagreeable weather.\'a0 I have been out but \ul twice\ulnone  since you left.\'a0 We will have to kill a hog tomorrow.\'a0 The one we killed just before you left will be gone by that time.\'a0 Jim was sent for by Mr. Hoke today to help salt his Pork.\'a0 Mrs. Duboc has been to see me.\'a0 She said Mr. Buist said it was much more economical to \ul buy\ulnone  hogs than to raise them.\'a0 Of course he would do what was most economical.\'a0 Pork is selling at 3 cts.\'a0 Last year I believe it was 2 cts. I am glad you have kept the presents to bring with you.\'a0 Your return is looked for with great pleasure by the children, but of course you will be more welcome accompanied by so many pretty things.\'a0 Willy would be delighted with the horse, for one that can move along I think he would really like.\'a0 I would like him to have it, but you must do as you think about it.\'a0 You must not forget the Lavender water & Cocoa nuts for Ann.\'a0 There is nothing I wish for you to get for me.\'a0 As you expect to be at home the first of next week I will not write you again.\'a0 This letter will reach Columbia Sunday, & you will have left in all probability before Wednesday.\'a0 Ann is still very poorly.\'a0 Susan yesterday had a headache, Anna\'92s arm is getting well, Willy & Frank are quite well.\'a0 I know of no news to tell you.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney is now in Pendleton, so I suppose he will preach next Sunday. You must not think I desire \ul earthly\ulnone  \ul distinction\ulnone  only for you.\'a0 I would rather you be a \ul good\ulnone  \ul Christian\ulnone  above everything else, but it is not inconsistent with your character as a Christian to take advantage of the opportunities thrown in your way by Providence for advancing your temporal interests.\'a0 Genl Whitner seeks preferment, & at the same time is a good Christian.\'a0 I do not think \ul he\ulnone  is entitled to seat on the bench.\'a0 He will make an inferior Judge.\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  would be the best Judge on the bench; your decisions would be so just.\'a0 What I wish[page torn, word missing] you is, that your sphere of usefulness should be increased, that you may prove an ornament to the state.\'a0 But after mentioning my views on the subject, I wish you to act for yourself.\'a0 We must desire Jehovah for our portion & our children above everything else.\'a0 I have a great many good tracts I wish to read to you, & you must \ul promise\ulnone , (now that you are away you will promise anything) when you return, to read a chapter in the bible every morning & afternoon, not that I consider \ul that\ulnone  the \ul whole\ulnone  of our \ul duty\ulnone , but only the \ul commencement\ulnone . Your letters give me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone , & you are \ul very\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone , the \ul very\ulnone  \ul best\ulnone  of husbands, & \ul deserve\ulnone  the \ul very\ulnone  \ul best\ulnone  of \ul wives\ulnone , one guided entirely by your judgement, as I always intend to be, except in a few trifles. I write today as I might be prevented tomorrow, or be hurried as I sometimes am to get the letter in the office before the Mail is closed.\'a0 Perhaps I may add a few lines tomorrow, but as it is uncertain I will now close by wishing you a pleasant journey home.\'a0 E.F.P.\

	I have just been reading the Mountaineer.\'a0 How I wish I could have read a letter from you giving an account of Legislative proceedings.\'a0 You \ul ought\ulnone  to be a member, if it is only to inform the people what is going on.\'a0 I am sure they must miss your letters.\'a0 How blind they are to their \ul own\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone  when they do not \ul insist\ulnone  on your going.\'a0 There is no one now to attend to the interests of the upper country.\'a0 If \ul you \ulnone had been a member last year, you would have prevented your circuit from being arranged as it is at present, & which has injured \ul you\ulnone  so much.\'a0 I feel very uneasy, lest you should be more occupied.\'a0 If you run for solicitor, of course you will remain in Columbia until after the election.\'a0 It seems to be an advantage to let the people know, you are a candidate for an office long before[word obscured] it seems to entitle you to the office.\'a0 So as you will not be a Candidate for Judge this time [you] must inform the Legislature that you will be a Candidate at the next resignation.\'a0 Today for a \'85der, the sun is shining.\'a0 I expect with pleasure a letter tonight.\'a0 I am sorry you will not hear from me.\'a0 I have written every other Mail.\'a0 Willy says I must tell you, he is learning a Hymn & Catechism to say to you, & says his lesson every day.\'a0 I have not answered Pamela\'92s letter yet but must soon, that she can hear before she leaves home.\'a0 I long to see you again.\'a0 I think it is \ul much\ulnone  \ul better\ulnone  to leave home sometimes for it is such a pleasure to \ul meet\ulnone  \ul again\ulnone , &\'a0 it makes us \ul value\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone , to \ul leave\ulnone  it occasionally.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As you do not seem to know exactly when you will be at home & you will be uneasy if you do not hear, I will write a letter, so if you remain in Columbia this week you will hear from me.\'a0 You must not return home \ul one\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  \ul sooner\ulnone  than your \ul business\ulnone  \ul permits\ulnone .\'a0 Stay as long as you \ul ought\ulnone  to; work \ul hard\ulnone  now, for you will have a \ul long\ulnone  \ul rest\ulnone .\'a0 If you run for \ul Solicitor\ulnone , do not think of returning until the election is \ul over\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Croft told me yesterday he heard \ul you\ulnone  were to be Solicitor.\'a0 If you think you \ul would\ulnone  be \ul elected\ulnone , I would like you to be a Candidate.\'a0 The Legislature you have served so \ul well\ulnone , \ul ought\ulnone  to give you any office you ask for.\'a0 But I will not give you any advice on the subject, but leave you to act as you think best.\'a0As you will be uneasy about home, the \ul next\ulnone  time you leave, I will write \ul every\ulnone  Mail.\'a0 I will do anything to \ul satisfy\ulnone  you, to make you \ul happy\ulnone  & \ul easy\ulnone  & \ul willing\ulnone  to \ul stay\ulnone  from home.\'a0 If you like to hear from me you must remain a long time absent, that you may receive a great many letters.\'a0 It almost \ul provokes\ulnone  me that as soon as you leave home you should be thinking of \ul returning\ulnone , & \ul particularly\ulnone  when \ul returning \ulnone would be \ul detrimental\ulnone  to your \ul interest\ulnone .\'a0 I am really shocked at your childishness.\'a0 Why surely you would not run for Solicitor, & then come home before the election is decided, & give such an advantage to your opponents.\'a0 I hope your \ul good\ulnone  \ul judgment \ulnone will not allow you to act so foolishly.\'a0 If you \ul do\ulnone , your influence over me is \ul gone\ulnone , for I do not think of being guided by one who will act so strangely as \ul that\ulnone .\'a0 I will have no further confidence in your understanding.\'a0 I make home \ul too\ulnone  \ul pleasant\ulnone  for you.\'a0 I intend now to \ul grumble\ulnone  & \ul scold\ulnone  & \ul complain\ulnone , & make you so \ul unhappy\ulnone , that you will be \ul glad\ulnone  to get away, & \ul dread\ulnone  returning.\'a0 I regard your \ul interest\ulnone \'a0 so much, that if your writing to me, interfered in any way with your business I would not wish you to write, though I derive so much pleasure from your letters.\'a0 I am writing today merely to keep you \ul quiet\ulnone , for I write with the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul inconvenience \ulnone to myself.\'a0 It is \ul washing\ulnone  day, so that \ul Lindy\ulnone  is Frank\'92s nurse, & of \ul course\ulnone  he is fretting, & I have to stop every now & then to quiet him, & also to interfere with Willy & Anna who are now quarreling on the floor.\'a0 If you are in Columbia Wednesday night & do not hear from I am afraid Thursday morning you would start home, even if you were in the \ul midst\ulnone  of an \ul important\ulnone  case, or the election for Solicitor had not come on.\'a0 For the sake of your \ul clients\ulnone , I must keep your mind easy, to enable you to do justice to their cases,\'a0 Perhaps the constant uneasiness you have been in, from hearing from home \ul only\ulnone  every \ul other\ulnone  Mail has been the cause of your losing so many cases. I am glad the Rail road stock has fallen, otherwise I might be disposed to \ul murmur\ulnone  at your selling your shares for so little.\'a0 You will now \ul just\ulnone  be able to pay your debts & feel \ul free\ulnone  again.\'a0 Aunt Eliza in her last letter to Mamma said, Mr. Hayne was not unmindful of her letter on the subject of giving \ul you\ulnone  \ul my\ulnone  portion of my Fathers estate, that he thought Mamma was \ul able\ulnone  to do it & much approved her intention; that her income is at this time \ul better\ulnone  by 200 dollars than it was some \ul years\ulnone  \ul ago\ulnone .\'a0 This resulted from the increased value of \ul Bank\ulnone  \ul Stock\ulnone , in some investments he made for her by your advice.\'a0 That Mr. Hayne will write soon a \ul full\ulnone  \ul statement\ulnone  of my claim upon my Father\'92s estate, & of Mamma\'92s affairs in general.\'a0 If I do get my portion how delighted I will be, for it will be something to depend on against a \ul rainy\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone , & you can improve it for the children. I went to see Ann yesterday after church.\'a0 She was seated, or rather \ul laying\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone  in her chair which she likes as much, as suffering as she does, she can like anything.\'a0 It supersedes the necessity of Ann being held, & is a great relief to Mamma & Susan.\'a0 It is a noble chair, well worth 20 dollars.\'a0 Ann liked the oranges & Pine Apple \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , & said I must thank you for them.\'a0 We \ul all\ulnone  enjoyed them.\'a0 It was fortunate I wrote you that Ann had a chair.\'a0 If you had bought the other, you would have been obliged to have kept it for yourself. I have written a long letter to Pamela.\'a0 Mrs. Croft has heard lately from her, & she is \ul better\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you would pass a night with them on your return, & comfort them about John.\'a0 I wrote her you thought you would gain his case.\'a0 It would be very unfortunate for Mr. Yancey to be put in Jail when his wife is sick.\'a0 If all challenges were followed by such consequences, duelling would be put a stop to.\'a0 Yesterday was a beautiful day.\'a0 I went to church morning & afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney looks quite well & \ul rather\ulnone  fatter.\'a0 Old Mr. Pinckney & his wife & youngest daughter left for the lower country today. \'a0Mr. Pinckney inquired after you & offered to take \ul any\ulnone  \ul commands\ulnone  to you.\'a0 I would have written by him but feared he would be a long time on the road.\'a0 As he was so polite, if you see him in Columbia you must speak to him.\'a0 This morning the sun shone, but now it is raining hard, & Minerva & Delia are at the spring washing.\'a0 You could not have had worse weather than we have had.\'a0 I bought Saturday some delightful apples from your client Mr. Sherman.\'a0 He gave me the history of them the\'85he brought from New England & grafted.\'a0 His manners were like Mr. Burts, when he said he was well acquainted with you, which caused me to ask his name.\'a0 I thought he would say \ul Burt\ulnone .\'a0 He says they will keep all winter, until apple trees bloom. Aunt Eliza wrote about Fanny\'92s wedding.\'a0 She says she could \ul pronounce\ulnone  Capt. Beall an \ul estimable\ulnone  man from his \ul countenance\ulnone  & \ul deportment\ulnone , which is \ul marked\ulnone  by \ul modest\ulnone  \ul simplicity\ulnone  which seldom[page torn] to a trifling character.\'a0 He is certainly \ul well\ulnone  \ul looking\ulnone  & \ul prepossessing\ulnone , \ul modest\ulnone  & \ul manly\ulnone  in address &[page torn] & quite disposed to regard them in a friendly manner.\'a0 Uncle Arthur thinks very highly of him, but feels \ul much\ulnone  in parting with Fanny to such a \ul destiny\ulnone .\'a0 They are to pass this winter in \ul Washington \ulnone but his \ul station\ulnone  is \ul Louisiana\ulnone .\'a0 He has no \ul resource\ulnone  but his \ul profession\ulnone .\'a0 Fanny only won the \ul consent\ulnone  of her Father, though he very highly estimates Capt. Beall. Aunt Eliza says she heard I was going to town with my little ones; that she thinks it \ul very \ulnone desirable I should & truly \ul wishes\ulnone  she could \ul lead\ulnone  the \ul way\ulnone  in urging it as a visit to \ul herself\ulnone  but that Mamma knows her \ul situation\ulnone  which \ul hampers\ulnone  her wishes on subjects of this kind.\'a0 She thinks it greatly to be desired that I should make my children known to their friends, that \ul intercourse\ulnone  fosters \ul affection\ulnone .\'a0 Aunt Martha McCall she says expressed a \ul great\ulnone  \ul desire\ulnone  to see the children, & Aunt Anna Turnbull said she \ul wished\ulnone  I would come.\'a0 Aunt Martha often refers to their \ul broken\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  condition as a \ul family\ulnone .\'a0 Aunt Eliza says she often thinks how much the sight of Mamma & hers would gratify all of her friends. Aunt Eliza says Mr. Rhett died a \ul Christian\ulnone , & that this was not the result of a \ul death\ulnone  \ul bed \ulnone repentance, for the last two years he had been very serious, & would have made an open profession of religion had Mr. Barnwell encouraged him to do so.\'a0 His illness was short but he was very sensible of his approaching end & perfectly calm & resigned.\'a0 He said to his brother Barnwell, \'93What \ul now\ulnone  is \ul ambition\ulnone ? & lamented that his life had been passed in pursuits which belong to this \ul world\ulnone  \ul only\ulnone .\'a0 His brother Edmund arrived after his death & clung to the \ul mournful\ulnone  \ul relics\ulnone  in the bitterness of grief, but thanked God that his brother died a Christian.\'a0 Mrs. Rhett is with her Mother.\'a0 She is resigned & submissive tho she can only lift her \ul hands & weep\ulnone . Only two letters have come for you, the one from Mr. Fabers agent & one last night from Wesley Robertson, & no one has enquired for you but Mr. Sherman, who said he would get some counsel from you on your return.\'a0 So you see you lose nothing by being absent.\'a0 As you have spent $900 this year in servants, we will visit town if nothing happens next \ul Spring\ulnone  \ul twelve\ulnone  \ul months\ulnone .\'a0 I must \ul see\ulnone  your Gold pen before I can judge if it was a wise purchase.\'a0 You will get tired of it before the half of fifty years, & I rather think it will not be a good pen then the fifth of that time.\'a0 I have just received a note from Susan.\'a0 She says Ann \ul appreciates\ulnone  your kindness in thinking of the chair for her.\'a0 If you see a pretty prayer book for about $1.25 bring it to me to give to Ann or if you chose you can give it as \ul your\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone .\'a0 I hope this letter will find you in Columbia.\'a0 Do not hurry home.\'a0 The longer you stay the more glad we will be to see you.\'a0 Do you think you will get Willy a horse or not?\'a0 Truly yours, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You see I have \ul broken\ulnone  my promise, (not to write to you).\'a0 I am afraid you will be \ul very\ulnone  \ul angry\ulnone  as \ul you\ulnone  think, the mind \ul once\ulnone  made up, \ul right\ulnone  or \ul wrong\ulnone , it must \ul never\ulnone  be changed.\'a0 I \ul hope\ulnone  you will forgive me this \ul once\ulnone .\'a0 I\'92ll try & not offend \ul again\ulnone .\'a0 It is \ul charity\ulnone  to you that induces me to write, for I know how much at a loss you must feel now, having been \ul three\ulnone  days without receiving any \ul advice\ulnone .\'a0 I must write a \ul book\ulnone  for \ul your\ulnone  \ul especial\ulnone  benefit, containing advice on \ul every\ulnone  subject, which you can \ul constantly\ulnone  apply to when \ul absent\ulnone  from \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 I think perhaps it is the \ul want\ulnone  of this that has made you pursue such an \ul inconsistent\ulnone  course, partly a Union man, partly a Nullifier, partly a Whig, & partly a Democrat.\'a0 You think a \ul little\ulnone  with \ul each\ulnone  party, & belong to \ul no\ulnone  party whatever, & no party \ul owns\ulnone  you, or \ul supports\ulnone  you.\'a0 This is owing to your making up your mind on different subjects when away from \ul me\ulnone ,\'a0 After consulting \ul me\ulnone , you find you are \ul wrong\ulnone , but having \ul made\ulnone  up your \ul mind\ulnone , you can\'92t \ul change\ulnone  it, & therefore pursue a course which you know is \ul against\ulnone  \ul your\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone , & \ul perfectly\ulnone  calculated to advance the interest of \ul others\ulnone .\'a0 However advice is to \ul end\ulnone  my letter not \ul commence \ulnone it, so I will now tell you all the incidents that have occurred since you left, & as what is \ul last\ulnone  said produces the \ul greatest\ulnone  impression, \ul close\ulnone  with the \ul advice\ulnone . When you requested me to write the \ul same\ulnone  day you left, I told you I would have \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 I \ul might\ulnone  have had something very \ul serious\ulnone , for you had been scarce gone \ul ten\ulnone  \ul minutes\ulnone  when the Market bell rung, & there was a cry of \ul fire\ulnone .\'a0 \ul Nothing\ulnone  alarms me so much \ul except\ulnone  an \ul election\ulnone  in which \ul you\ulnone  are concerned, as the cry of \ul fire\ulnone .\'a0 Everybody seemed rushing round \ul our\ulnone  \ul corner\ulnone , so I knew it was near \ul us\ulnone .\'a0 It was Mr. Murphy\'92s house.\'a0 A spark from the chimney set the roof on fire; fortunately it was put out \ul immediately\ulnone  (long before the Engine arrived), or there might have been an extensive conflagration for the wind was blowing high at the time in the direction of the village & everything as dry as tinder. As soon as the alarm of fire was over, I dressed & walked to see Mrs. Faber.\'a0 I thought she would \ul expect\ulnone  it.\'a0 Miss Lynah & herself were very glad to see me.\'a0 They said I looked \ul well\ulnone , & not like the Mother of \ul three\ulnone  children.\'a0 Of course to seem \ul still\ulnone  \ul younger\ulnone , I told them that I had had \ul four\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Faber said \ul you\ulnone  looked \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 Miss Lynah will stay with her Aunt at Flat Rock until her Father\'92s family come up & then return here & pass the summer at Pattons.\'a0 Mrs. Faber has not \ul hired\ulnone  her house.\'a0 Mr. Lowndes changed his mind.\'a0 The afternoon I spent at home & sent Willy & Anna to Mamma.\'a0 They were very glad to see them; said they \ul looked\ulnone  & \ul behaved\ulnone  \ul sweetly\ulnone , assisted in fanning \ul Ann\ulnone , & Willy has commenced planting a little garden under the drawing room window, which every day he wishes to go to water.\'a0 Just before supper Mr. Barclay came to see me & spent the evening.\'a0 He told me Mr. B\'85 had sent for him to sketch his child, & as soon as he returns he is to paint what he sketched, so I am glad he has \ul another\ulnone  engagement.\'a0 He went Saturday on Plough boy.\'a0 A letter came for you Friday night from Mr. Leitner, though it must have been in the office \ul before\ulnone  you left.\'a0 On the back was the request, that if you had left, it might be \ul sent\ulnone  to you.\'a0 I sent it to Col. Townes.\'a0 He said it was too late \ul that\ulnone  night to put it in the Mail. But he would the next \ul day\ulnone .\'a0 A Hamburgh Journal also came, sent I suppose by Mr. Yancey, as it announces him as a candidate for the Legislature.\

	I staid at home & worked in the afternoon.\'a0 I carried my jewelry to Mr. Pickerel, & went to see Mrs. Markley, Mrs. Elford & Mrs. Town[e]s.\'a0 At night I went early to bed.\'a0 Sunday morning Willy & myself went to church & heard a missionary sermon.\'a0 Miss Stuart & two of the children sat in the pew.\'a0 I would not be surprised if they had taken possession for the summer.\'a0 In the afternoon, I went with \ul all\ulnone  of the children to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 She was very glad to see us; Ann just the same.\'a0 They inquired after you.\'a0 We walked in the garden, & Mamma waked with me to the gate.\'a0 We got home just at dark.\'a0 After supper I told some Bible stories to Willy & then went to bed.\'a0 In the night it thundered and the wind blew.\'a0 I predicted a storm, but it passed over in a few minutes, & no rain yet. This morning just after breakfast, I went over to Mr. Watson to pay my respects to your \ul second\ulnone  \ul self\ulnone .\'a0 It is indeed an \ul admirable\ulnone  portrait.\'a0 If I only looked my \ul best\ulnone , I might be \ul persuaded\ulnone , to have \ul mine\ulnone  taken.\'a0 Butler Thompson came in to look at it.\'a0 He said it was the best Portrait he ever saw in his life.\'a0 It was \ul precisely\ulnone  you, \ul except\ulnone  a little \ul younger\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Wells was looking at it.\'a0 His only objection was the \ul shadow\ulnone  of the \ul spectacles\ulnone , Which Mr. Watson says is the most \ul ridiculous\ulnone  criticism on a picture he has ever heard, & though he does not wish Mr. Wells to \ul have\ulnone  it, shows he is too ignorant on the subject to be a competent judge.\'a0 The picture looks so much better at a \ul distance\ulnone , than \ul near\ulnone .\'a0 When I \ul first\ulnone  went in the store, it was \ul directly\ulnone  behind the counter, I was hardly more pleased with it than I was in Mr. Barclay\'92s room.\'a0 I begged Mr. Watson to put it at the \ul end\ulnone  of his store, & at that \ul distance \ulnone & in the \ul shade\ulnone , I was \ul delighted\ulnone  with it.\'a0 I imagined you \ul standing\ulnone  in the store, & was surprised you did not \ul speak\ulnone  to me.\'a0 You must get a \ul very\ulnone  \ul handsome\ulnone  frame for it.\'a0 If you cannot get one in \ul Charleston\ulnone , send to the \ul North\ulnone .\'a0 That picture will remain in the family \ul always\ulnone , generation after generation,, perhaps \ul hundreds\ulnone  of years, & sure to show to your posterity, how the \ul founder\ulnone  of their family looked.\'a0 Do my dear husband render your name so \ul distinguished\ulnone  that it will be regarded with \ul pride\ulnone , by all your descendants.\'a0 Don\'92t let them say \'93My Grandfather was beaten by Dr. Sullivan.\'94 Mrs. Marion\'85lingers, but I believe she is very low.\'a0 I have no news at all to write about.\'a0 I heard Miss McBee was going to the North with Mrs. Dr. Butler, but I hardly believe that; I do not believe she would leave the Dt. to electioneer alone.\'a0 I heard Miss McLeod was engaged to Mr. Mood, but I do not believe that either.\'a0 I see in the paper the death of cousin Edward Finley who you recollect as a member of the Legislature.\'a0 Aunt Finley of our \ul five\ulnone  grown children has \ul one\ulnone  left. I have so much work to do, that I will not be able to write you again.\'a0 It takes up too much time.\'a0 I will now mention my commissions.\'a0 Do not forget to buy for Willy a \ul Leghorn\ulnone  \ul hat\ulnone  with a \ul wide\ulnone  \ul rime\ulnone .\'a0 Measure the \ul crown\ulnone  by the \ul string\ulnone  I gave you.\'a0 For Frank buy a \ul common\ulnone  \ul straw\ulnone \'85not costing more than 25 cts.\'a0 For Susan & Ann I would like you to bring a little \ul trifle\ulnone , not costing more than 50 cts.at the \ul utmost\ulnone .\'a0 The pincushions you brought them last winter 3 1/4 cts a peice showed them yesterday to me on the \ul Mantle\ulnone  \ul peice\ulnone , & seemed to value them \ul greatly\ulnone .\'a0 Any little \ul trifle\ulnone  would do, such for instance as those little glass figurines you brought me once.\'a0 It is merely to show that you have \ul thought\ulnone  of them.\'a0 Ann says she does not care for any \ul oranges\ulnone ,\ul  \ulnone but I think you had better bring her a \ul few\ulnone . And now my dear for the \ul advice\ulnone , which I know you are \ul anxiously\ulnone  expecting.\'a0 I do hope you are for \ul annexation\ulnone .\'a0 If you are not my misery will be \ul complete\ulnone , for \ul now\ulnone  I \ul doubt\ulnone  if you will be elected, \ul then\ulnone  I am \ul certain\ulnone  you will not be, for it seems \ul treason\ulnone  in a \ul southerner\ulnone  to be \ul against\ulnone  Texas. Unless he is a \ul Whig\ulnone , & \ul nobody\ulnone  will vote for you.\'a0 Dont be so foolish as to do everything to \ul injure\ulnone  \ul yourself\ulnone , & \ul benefit\ulnone  your \ul opponent\ulnone .\'a0 You \ul wont\ulnone  \ul electioneer\ulnone , when you know it is so particularly important for \ul you\ulnone , who have so \ul many\ulnone  things against you, & so many \ul persons\ulnone  doing all they \ul can\ulnone  against you.\'a0 I believe you \ul want\ulnone  to be defeated, though you know how \ul mortified\ulnone  I will be.\'a0 I am \ul certain\ulnone  that if you were to take an \ul interest\ulnone  in the matter & do \ul all\ulnone  you \ul could\ulnone  to \ul ensure\ulnone  \ul success\ulnone , you \ul would\ulnone  \ul be\ulnone  successful, but instead of that, you take \ul no\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone  in the matter, & do \ul all\ulnone  you can to be defeated.\'a0 Your conduct \ul certainly\ulnone  indicates that, & I don\'92t know \ul why\ulnone  you are a Candidate, unless it is to be\'a0 the \ul death\ulnone  of \ul me\ulnone , for \ul uneasiness\ulnone  of \ul mind\ulnone  is \ul wearing\ulnone  out my \ul body\ulnone , & I cant \ul endure\ulnone  it \ul much\ulnone  \ul longer\ulnone .\'a0 All of the Candidates wives feel easy except \ul myself\ulnone , for they know\'a0 their husbands will \ul exert\ulnone  themselves to be elected, but I who am sensitive, know that my husband who has so many enemies working against him, will leave his election to \ul chance\ulnone , & \ul chance\ulnone  never elected anyone to the \ul Legislature\ulnone .\'a0 I have read the arguments for & against Texas & \ul I\ulnone  am for Texas, & you may as well be \ul apparently\ulnone  \ul for\ulnone  it, if in \ul reality\ulnone  you are against it, for I do not believe it will be admitted into the Union.\'a0 You must make haste & come back to electioneer.\'a0 In the meantime \ul all\ulnone  I can do for you.\'a0 Write me. If you are defeated I will tear up your picture.\'a0 Your descendants shant see it.\

\'85.me by your inertness, laziness, obstinacy &c.\'a0 I do not intend to write to you again unless I have something very important to write about.\'a0 I will now tell you news that I know will \ul shock\ulnone  & \ul grieve\ulnone  you.\'a0 Judge [Baylis John] Earle is \ul dead\ulnone .\'a0 He died this morning.\'a0 He returned to Greenville a few days ago looking very badly, though his friends told him he looked \ul better\ulnone , as it \ul pleased\ulnone  him.\'a0 Yesterday after dinner, he went into Mrs. Colemans room to chat.\'a0 Suddenly he said his tongue felt thick, he could not speak well, & he would go in the drawing room & laid down, he got up to walk.\'a0 When he was taken insensible, he was laid on Mrs. Colemans bed & continued so until this morning when he died.\'a0 It was a fit I suppose.\'a0 He was perfectly unconscious. Just a few moments before he died, he was turned on his side.\'a0 When he was put again on his back. He opened his eyes for a moment & looked perfectly natural, but instantly a spasm convulsed his body & he died.\'a0 Mr. Sam Earle was sent for after he was taken sick & was the only one of his family with him.\'a0 Mr. Edward Earle had been here yesterday morning & left.\'a0 He was sent for & arrived 10 or 15 minutes after his brother had breathed his last.\'a0 Delia tells me she has just seem Mrs. Mays carri[a]ge come in from Pendleton.\'a0 After nursing her brother so long, she must regret not being with him at the last.\'a0 He is to be carried to Pendleton to be buried as soon as arrangements can be made.\'a0 He is now at the Mansion house.\'a0 There is to be\'a0 a meeting of the citizens this afternoon.\'a0 I suppose to[page torn]resolutions.\'a0 Da\'85[page torn]Judge Earle eat a plate of cherries which made him feel badly.\'a0 Yesterday he f[elt] better & eat a [hea]rty dinner.\'a0 Mr. Lester was at the door a few minutes ago.\'a0 He said Mr. Choice said when Judge Earle went to Florida (I do not know whether the last time or not) he left a \ul will\ulnone  with him, but it was not now in his possession, & he did not know whether it was destroyed or not, & Mr. Cloice said from an estimation they made not long ago his property was 60,000 dollars.\'a0 I had thought he was worth twice as much.\'a0 Mr. Edward Earle when he came this morning, Mr. Lester says, took on a great deal.\'a0 How I wish you had sent for those Busts when Judge Earle offered them to you, we would now have had them to remember him by.\'a0 Mrs. Marion was buried yesterday.\'a0 It was while her funeral was taking place, that it was reported Judge Earle was dying.\'a0 How strange another world must be.\'a0 I wonder if persons recognize each other.\'a0 What a mystery, and how gradually it is made known to all, one after another.\'a0 Judge Earle has often of course thought of what kind of existence he would enjoy after his soul separated from his body.\'a0 He was certain how it would be; well this morning the secret was revealed to him.\'a0 I hope it has been to him a happy change.\'a0 I will now change this sad subject for a happier one, at least to the parties concerned.\'a0 Mr. Elford & Miss Sloan are to be married next Thursday.\'a0 Mr. Barclay returned from Spartanburgh yesterday.\'a0 He brought you a gold pencil case from Mr. Seay.\'a0 The bill in NY mentions the Pencil case 14 dollars & cutting the Initials 3 dollars, 17 dollars altogether.\'a0 The initials are in German text, which I do not like as well as plain letters, as they are not so easily distinguished.\'a0 It is a beautiful pencil case very heavy.\'a0 I do not know the cost of them so cannot tell if it was dear.\'a0 I went with Susan one afternoon to look at your picture.\'a0 Both her & me think Mr. Barclay has not done you justice.\'a0 I do not think he has given you as noble a countenance as you deserve, & there is an unusual look about the mouth you have not, & we do not like.\'a0 Still it is very much like you & could be recognized anywhere.\'a0 You are a remarkable looking man, & so easily taken, that it would be hard not to take a likeness of you that would not be known, for your features are marked, but what I wished was your countenance & expression when you look most benevolent.\'a0 The mass of the people do not observe your countenance particularly & therefore do not miss in your picture & what I miss, as Susan says it certainly looks like you, but there is something in it that is \ul not\ulnone  you.\'a0 Justice has not been done you.\'a0 But the picture is so much like you, that someone standing at Mr. Watsons store, looked in & said \'93I thought Maj. Perry had gone to Columbia.\'a0 I am afraid for Mr. Barclay to take mine.\'a0 I know he would not succeed as well as he has with yours.\'a0 He could not have had a better subject than yourself.\'a0 I hope he may meet with success, for I am sorry for him, & he seems a worthy young man. These sheets of paper are not large enough for correspondence between husbands & wives, particularly when a husband acts so badly as to require half of the letter to be filled up with scolding.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You have made me so \ul uneasy\ulnone  by not hearing from you last night.\'a0\'a0 If I were not \ul uneasy\ulnone , I would be \ul provoked\ulnone , & would not \ul think \ulnone of writing to you, as it is, I am only induced to write, to tell you about Willy\'92s \ul hat\ulnone .\'a0 In this letter I will send you the measure of his \ul head\ulnone , which you will see is much smaller than the measure of his \ul hat\ulnone , which I gave you.\'a0 You may get a hat the size of the tape I enclose in this letter, but not any smaller, if you \ul can\ulnone , get it \ul larger\ulnone , but if not, I will be satisfied with one the size of this tape, which is the exact measure of his head.\'a0 I asked Willy when I commenced writing what I should tell you to bring him, he said, \'93tell Pa to bring me a pretty hat & don\'92t tell him I have been \ul bad\ulnone , tell him, I am going to try & be a good boy,\'94 & Anna immediately said, \'93tell Pa to bring me a doll, & I\'92ll be a good girl.\'94\'a0 Frank I am sure will be pleased with the \ul rattle\ulnone , for he was delighted with my box of Hooks & Eyes this morning.\'a0 The Book of Pictures, for which you must thank Mr. McCarter, is \ul quite\ulnone  \ul enough\ulnone  for me, so now you must just get a \ul trifle \ulnone for Susan & Ann, & then that will do.\'a0 An invitation to Miss Sloan\'92s wedding came this morning, also one for Susan.\'a0 
\f2\i \'a0
\f0\i0 I expect everybody is invited.\'a0 It is Thursday.\'a0 I wish you were here to go.\'a0 If I can know of anyone to go with, I think I will go.\'a0 Susan came in to church yesterday.\'a0 John got Mr. Pinckney\'92s horse to draw with his.\'a0 It is a great inconvenience having such a horse as Plough boy.\'a0 Half of the time he is perfectly useless.\'a0 Only when Barrister is here can he be used, & Barrister is more than half the time away.\'a0 I think Barrister\'92s \ul master\ulnone  is \ul very\ulnone  \ul fond\ulnone  of being from \ul home\ulnone , notwithstanding what he says to the contrary, for not, at this \ul important\ulnone  time for \ul electioneering\ulnone , when Dr. Sullivan is getting \ul far\ulnone  \ul ahead\ulnone \'a0 of him, he is at \ul Columbia\ulnone , wasting his \ul time\ulnone  & his \ul money\ulnone .\'a0 I have not heard a \ul word\ulnone  of the election since you left, but I know Dr. Sullivan is (as is perfectly natural) making the most of your absences from the musters, to secure \ul his\ulnone  election.\'a0 How \ul grateful \ulnone he must be to you.\'a0 You are the \ul first\ulnone  person I \ul ever\ulnone  heard of, who \ul tried\ulnone  not to be elected.\'a0 I cant conceive why you are a Candidate.\'a0 What pleasure does it give to be \ul defeated\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Ware told you, you would have to \ul electioneer\ulnone .\'a0 That it was \ul particularly\ulnone  important for you, & instead of that you are \ul glad\ulnone  not to be here to electioneer.\'a0 Next \ul Sale\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  such an \ul important\ulnone  time for electioneering you will not be here.\'a0 I see in Columbia the \ul Whigs\ulnone  as well as the \ul Democrats\ulnone  are in favour of Texas, as every \ul Southerner\ulnone  should be.\'a0 Have you read Genl Cass\'92 letter?\'a0 If frightens me.\'a0 I hope \ul you\ulnone  would not be one to bring about the state of things he mentions.\'a0 I see Genl Jackson is in favor of annexation.\'a0 You are a real Jackson man, so I know you agree with him there too.\'a0 Oh my husband you\'92ll \ul not\ulnone  give me any uneasiness on this point, & if you have any regard for \ul my\ulnone  \ul feelings\ulnone , though not for your \ul own\ulnone , try all you can to be elected,\'a0 I assure you if I was \ul certain\ulnone  of this, I would be \ul quite\ulnone  \ul happy\ulnone .\'a0 For with the love of such a husband as \ul I\ulnone  have, with my children who are not worse than others, with my pleasant house & many comforts, I should have \ul quite\ulnone  enough to make me happy, if your \ul election\ulnone  was \ul only\ulnone  \ul certain\ulnone .\'a0 But \ul that\ulnone  is enough to make me forget \ul all\ulnone  my sources of comfort, & I do feel \ul very\ulnone  \ul unhappy\ulnone , when I think you are not even \ul trying\ulnone  to be elected.\'a0 I am \ul anxious\ulnone  you should be Senator, & if you had \ul tried\ulnone  \ul hard\ulnone , I know you would have been elected.\'a0 I write you now all I \ul think\ulnone  when you come back, I\'92ll not \ul worry\ulnone  you about this subject.\'a0 I miss you a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone .\'a0 I have \ul no\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  to talk to.\'a0 I am too busy\'a0 to visit now.\'a0 When you come back I will go to see anyone you think I had better.\'a0 Margaret has been here several times, which has been some company for me.\'a0 Mr. Lester has been to the \ul door\ulnone  several times.\'a0 Mr. Barclay was here a \ul short\ulnone  time when he brought the pencil case.\'a0 Mr. Holcombe came to see me last Saturday.\'a0 Miss McBee sent word she was coming Saturday morning, but she was not able to.\'a0 She & one of her cousins leave for the North tomorrow with Pinckney McBee. It rained last night & a little this morning but not enough to prevent the servants washing.\'a0 I hope it will do good to the garden; we are now having Snap beans.\'a0 Our dinner generally consists of Hominy & Ham.\'a0 When you return I will add to it Cherry pie & Maccaroni.\'a0 Victoria gives so little milk.\'a0 Often we have not a \ul drop\ulnone  for Franks tea.\'a0 When you return, you must buy a Cow, & not feed Victoria & let her go dry.\'a0 How useless Exception has been & what an expense, the Interest of the money she cost, & her feed would amount to a good deal now.\'a0 She certainly is an \ul Exception\ulnone  to cows generally. I have not been to see your picture again since I wrote.\'a0 I am anxious to know what impression it will make on me the next time.\'a0 I saw Mr. Barlay as I was going to church yesterday.\'a0 I have not heard if he has any other engagement.\'a0 A letter came the other night from those same merchants in Spartanburgh.\'a0 At the top is a peice signed by Mr. Leitner as Notary Public, saying Mr. Folger appeared before him & testified Mr. Barclay owed him 37 dollars not a cent of which he had paid.\'a0 Mr. Folger in his letter says Mr. Barclay has returned to Spartanburgh \ul very\ulnone  \ul angry\ulnone  & declares he will \ul never\ulnone  pay a \ul cent\ulnone  of the bill, & that they cannot \ul force\ulnone  anything from him.\'a0 They say since \ul contracting\ulnone  this debt, they\'a0 have been \ul cautioned\ulnone  by [a] gentleman in Columbia not to \ul trust\ulnone  Mr. Barclay, & they beg you to hold him to bail, or assign to them the first painting he has.\'a0 Mr. Barclay I am afraid is not as prudent as he ought to be, for Mr. Watson showed me a \ul beautiful\ulnone  peice of muslin off of which Mr. Barclay has bought a \ul dress\ulnone  for his wife.\'a0 It is was \ul 62 1/2\ulnone  cts a yd, more than \ul I\ulnone  could afford to give for a Muslin.\'a0 \ul If\ulnone  he \ul paid\ulnone  for it, I suppose he paid for it with some of the money \ul you\ulnone  gave him, & which \ul instead\ulnone , he should have carried to Spartanburgh & paid as much as he could of the debts he owed there.\'a0 He had no right, though he might have \ul wished\ulnone  it, to get a \ul costly\ulnone  dress for his wife, & she has no business to \ul wear\ulnone  it, when she knows her husband has not paid his just debts.\'a0 I hope you will never make me presents in that way. I am surprised at your buying books in Columbia.\'a0 I hope you have not gone in debt. A letter also came from Wesley Robinson, about telling the Sheriff to levy on some negroes of Hinmans & a Mr. Satterfield I \ul think\ulnone , brought a receipt for some money he paid in Pickens for you.\'a0 Mamma received a letter from Aunt Anna Hayne last night.\'a0 She says cousin Edward Finley was quite serious before he died.\'a0 He had been sick so long, he was prepared for it.\'a0 He read a great many pious books, & intended when well enough to make a profession of religion.\'a0 Aunt Anna says Capt. Beall has left Fanny, for his \ul station\ulnone , & she does not expect to see him before \ul November\ulnone .\'a0 She is now at Carlisle, where her grandmother lives, waiting the arrival of her parents.\'a0 So Aunt Anna says her \ul cares\ulnone  have \ul commenced\ulnone . Poor Judge Earle was carried over to Pendleton the afternoon of the day he died.\'a0 His coffin was put in a box, & the box was on wheels.\'a0 I saw it as it passed. & felt \ul sad\ulnone  to think that \ul all\ulnone  that remains of him was contained in that box.\'a0 There were only two Carri[a]ges following. Mr. Mays & Mr. Henning\'92s\'a0 hack with Sam & Edward Earle & Mr. Maxwell I believe.\'a0 Mr. R. Duncan & Mr. J. Choice were on horseback, but I don\'92t know whether they went or not.\'a0 They set off after dinner & were to travel all night (it was moonlight) until they got to Mr. Mays.\'a0 Susan says when they passed her house, the horses were going \ul fast\ulnone , that she thought it seemed \ul shocking\ulnone , to pay so little respect to his \ul remains\ulnone .\'a0 I feel sorry for Judge Earle.\'a0 They say now he looked \ul shocking\ulnone  on his return, \ul worse\ulnone  than when he left, but everyone \ul flattered\ulnone  him & told him they knew he would get \ul well\ulnone , when they \ul knew\ulnone  he would die.\'a0 Those who saw him when he was sick, say it was a most awful sight.\'a0 Mrs. Holcombe says when she saw him, He was as white as chalk, perfectly cold, his eyes shut fast, his mouth half open, & blood coming out.\'a0 He was uttering \ul groans\ulnone .\'a0 There was a \'85tting in his throat, & he could scarcely get his breath.\'a0\'a0 He was unconscious of his sufferings.\'a0 I am sorry for your \ul sake\ulnone  he is dead.\'a0 He was one of those, who you would take pleasure in associating with.\'a0 He will be a \ul loss\ulnone  to his family.\'a0 Though in \ul one\ulnone  respect I suppose they will be the gainers. I cannot but be uneasy at not hearing from you.\'a0 You have no excuse for not writing, for even when \ul busy\ulnone  you can spare 5 minutes to write to me.\'a0 It is my only comfort when you are away.\'a0 Until Wednesday night, I will be uneasy, & then if I do not hear I will be miserable.\'a0 All this you could have spared me by a few lines, & besides you are not \ul busy\ulnone , for your cases are not to be tried.\'a0 Perhaps you are\'a0 on your way home.\'a0 You have served me shabbily, & the next time you go to Columbia, unless it is as \ul Senator\ulnone , I\'92ll not write at all.\'a0 I ruled these last lines with your gold pencil, & I will seal the letter with your seal, so you can judge of the Initials.\'a0 Anna is looking better than when you left.\'a0 The servants have not worried me much.\'a0 I intend to ask Eloise Butler next Saturday to dine with me.\'a0 I have seen her once riding.\'a0 She looked well.\'a0 She goes to school.\'a0 I shook hands with Mrs. Dr. Butler at church yesterday.\'a0 I would write more if I had room.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I \'85I seat to write you by Col. Town[e]s.\'a0 He left this morning with Mr. Cox, but to prevent your being disappointed, I will send a few lines by Mail.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s\'92 children are now here playing with Willy & Anna.\'a0 I am seated in the library, & they are playing in the balconies.\'a0 The most important incident that has occurred since you left, is the arrival of a barrel of Flour from Dr. Robinson.\'a0 It came last night. Susan came in yesterday afternoon & carried the children to shop.\'a0 I was too busy to go.\'a0 I received a note from Mamma today.\'a0 She said I must \ul write\ulnone  & \ul tell\ulnone  you to buy \ul two\ulnone  \ul cups\ulnone , one for \ul Anna\ulnone  from \ul Susan\ulnone , the other for \ul Frank\ulnone  from \ul Ann\ulnone , and that she will make up any deficiency.\'a0 You must choose \ul pretty\ulnone  ones, & we will value them as Susan\'92s and Anns presents.\'a0 I thought of you last night when it rained, & was afraid today would be unfavourable, but fortunately it has cleared away.\'a0 I can imagine the pleasant time you will pass this evening at Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 \ul We\ulnone  are all quite well.\'a0 Ann had a bad night, & is very poorly.\'a0 I have nothing to write about; & as I have written this Mail, in all probability I will not write by the next.\'a0 I miss you \ul greatly\ulnone .\'a0 I think I will pay some visits during your absence.\'a0 My time is so occupied, that I am not lonely.\'a0 I think the trip to Columbia will be pleasant for you, & for something to talk about for a long time after you return.\'a0 In future if you do not hear from me, you must know that \ul your\ulnone  \ul household\ulnone  are all well. & that I have nothing interesting to write about, & am very busy sewing.\'a0 I have now a large basket of clothes to mend.\'a0 As it is late I must send my letter to the office.\'a0 Believe me my dear husband, Your affectionate wife, E,F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Although tired as I generally am Sunday night, I will not go to bed until I have written you at least \ul part\ulnone  of a letter, for I may not have time tomorrow to write you a \ul whole\ulnone  one.\'a0 I will keep the letter open and add something tomorrow.\'a0 I have just been reading to Willy in the Sunday book lately given him, & trying to make\'a0 some good impressions on his mind, which if of no apparent benefit to him \ul now\ulnone , I hope at any rate in \ul after\ulnone  \ul years\ulnone  may be recurred to with benefit to himself.\'a0 You know Dr. Johnson says \'93except a man have received some \ul early\ulnone  tincture of piety, he no more knows how to set about being religious, than a man who has never learned figures, can count when he has need of valuation\'94 & I believe men who become \ul religious\ulnone , as well as \ul great\ulnone , generally give the credit of it, to their \ul Mothers\ulnone ;\'a0 even \ul Napoleon\ulnone , ascribed his elevation to his Mother, so how important it is, for men when they \ul marry\ulnone , to think of their \ul children\ulnone  & yet such a thing never enters their heads, certainly not the heads of \ul great\ulnone  \ul men\ulnone , or they would have children more worthy of them.\'a0 I hope \ul you\ulnone  with your good judgment, were not thoughtless on this point, but have been an exception to \ul great\ulnone  \ul men\ulnone . I will tell you how I am now situated.\'a0 Anna is asleep in the cradle, Delia is putting Frank to sleep in her lap, Lindy is near her, & Willy is near them, telling them stories, & every now & then listening to one from Delia.\'a0 I am in the Rocking chair, one side of the chimney (with the desk before me, on the stand) writing to you.\'a0 When I \ul first\ulnone  commenced, Willy was shaking the desk, & I threatened to tell you of it, but he begged me not to.\'a0 He dislikes very much that you should be told of his faults.\'a0 He thinks of his drum with great pleasure, & Anna tells persons you are going to bring her a baby, so I think that must be her present.\'a0 Frank is \ul better\ulnone .\'a0 The Pennyroyal has done him good. I will now write \ul all\ulnone  that has occurred since you left, & yet \ul nothing\ulnone  has occurred worth relating, but letters before have been written by very sensible people about nothing, so I will do the same.\'a0 Beau Brummel[l] has written some perfect specimens of this kind. The morning after you left, I awoke with a headache from having lost so much sleep.\'a0 It went off however quite soon.\'a0 I spent the morning at home working.\'a0 In the afternoon, though very reluctant to use the carri[a]ge in such muddy streets, I rode around to see Mr. Yancey.\'a0 I took Willy & Frank with me, Anna I left asleep.\'a0 I saw Mr. Yancey as well as his wife.\'a0 They both look pretty much the same as they used to.\'a0 She very plain, he fatter & perhaps not \ul quite\ulnone  as handsome as he was I asked him if he liked Alabama \ul better\ulnone  than Greenville.\'a0 He said he was \ul satisfied\ulnone  in Alabama, & would not move back \ul now\ulnone . But there \ul had\ulnone  been times when he regretted ever having left.\'a0 He went this morning to Mr. Cunninghams, & says he will pass one day if he can in Columbia.\'a0 He says cousin Isaac Hayne is doing well, gets a fine practice, & makes money, that his reputation is high, & will in time be higher, that he would this year if he had wished it, been elected a Member of Congress.\'a0 He says cousin Isaac is \ul often\ulnone  taken for him, that someone went to cousin Isaac\'92s office at Montgomery to see him on law business, \ul saw\ulnone  cousin Isaac & \ul called\ulnone  him \ul Yancey\ulnone .\'a0 I saw Miss Whitten, old Mr. Earle, Mr. Elias Earle, & a house full of children, & Mr. Jones also.\'a0 As I returned home, at V\'85 I saw Susan.\'a0 I went in & most unexpectedly did some shopping.\'a0 I bought some servants clothes; nothing for myself but a toothbrush.\'a0 Susan remained with me until after supper, to see the torchlight procession. \'a0I think it was pretty well for Greenville.\'a0 I dare say there wll be a glowing description of it in the Mountaineer.\'a0 They first\'85to have a meeting in Harley\'92s establishment, & \ul speaking\ulnone  I \ul suppose\ulnone , for I heard \ul clapping\ulnone ; then they marched out with their transparencies, & as they passed the Market house, took from a large fire burning there, their lighted torches.\'a0 They then went up the street as far I \ul believe\ulnone  as Genl Thompsons.\'a0 They then turned & came back as far as Avenue at which they went up, & called I \ul expect\ulnone  for Mr. Yancey.\'a0 Then they came down the st[reet] as far as Mr. Hortons, then turned & went as far as the Jail; in compliment I \ul suppose\ulnone  of its being illuminated; then turned again & marched up the st[reet] on our side, & as they passed our house cried out \'93Hurrah for Perry a true Democrat &c.\'94.\'a0 They then crossed over, threw down their torchlights by the Market house, & then went into the building, out of which they had first come.\'a0 I \ul suppose\ulnone  then they had a speech from Mr. Yancey, which to judge from the clapping, took well.\'a0 They had in the procession a few flags, & a dozen or more white boxes illuminated, with words painted on them, & all was accompanied by a band of Music, which was almost drowned by Hurraing, which latter I think was principally by the boys.\'a0This morning I went to church & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Pinckney.\'a0 This afternoon I took a ride with Susan.\'a0 After supper I have read tonights Courier, & of course with deep interest the notice of your address.\'a0 All the Editor says is \ul true\ulnone , but he has not said \ul enough\ulnone .\'a0 He has not written as \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Yeadon\ulnone  would have done; the words \ul talented\ulnone  & \ul able\ulnone  would have been more appropriate than\'85& \ul well\ulnone  \ul written\ulnone .\'a0 I think the letters you received [page torn] were more complimentary.\'a0 What a pity Mr. Yeadon should have left his port at such an important time; you must induce him to resume it again.\'a0 I also read Gov. Hammonds letter to the Jews & think it very good. As I know not what questions, yet will be brought before the Legislature, I will be obliged to [page torn] without giving you the benefit of my advice, except in a \ul general\ulnone  \ul way\ulnone , vote with the upper country on \ul every\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone , & when your constituents are candidates vote for \ul them\ulnone .\'a0 One peice of advice or rather \ul order\ulnone  I will give, & I know you will not object, as it comes within my proper sphere.\'a0 Do you furnish yourself with a \ul watch\ulnone  immediately, if it cannot be procured, send to town for one.\'a0 Perhaps you had better go to town yourself for the purpose.\'a0 As a \ul Senator\ulnone  I do not care for you to look so venerable as you do now; I would rather be taken for your wife which I \ul am\ulnone , than your daughter.\'a0 I have left no room to add anything tomorrow, so will close now.\'a0 I expect to pay visits tomorrow & will give an account of them in my next.\'a0 The roads are drying so I can use the carri[a]ge, which I did \ul not\ulnone  today.\'a0 Susan says you must \ul open\ulnone  the letter she gave you for Mr. Roper, so that you may know how much to pay Mr. Roper.\'a0 Near ten oclock, Good night, the children all asleep, & you too I expect.\'a0 Ever Yours, Liz\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am now to write my \ul second\ulnone  letter, before I have heard from you, & I write \ul without\ulnone  \ul delay\ulnone , because I am going to consult you\'a0 how I shall \ul act\ulnone , with regard to the letter \ul just\ulnone  received from Pamela.\'a0 I will now tell you what I was \ul afraid\ulnone  to mention, until I knew all had turned out \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 When I paid my visit to Mr. Yancey, Mr. Yancey said he would be obliged to \ul give\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  going to see his Aunt, for he could procure no conveyance in the village.\'a0 I instantly offered your horse & buggy to him, & he accepted it with \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone  & said Mr. McKay would go with him to bring it back.\'a0 After he had gone I was uneasy, lest the horse being skittish, some accident should happen, but Mr. McKay has just returned quite safely, & bringing me a most \ul grateful\ulnone  letter from Pamela, \ul thanking \ulnone me for enabling them to see Mr. Yancey, & giving me a most \ul pressing\ulnone  invitation to visit them.\'a0 She says I must go with the children & you must meet us there & \ul all\ulnone  partake of a Christmas dinner.\'a0 She says the first night I can go to Goldsmiths, & the second night reach their house.\'a0 She says I \ul must\ulnone  go, that I know they all love me\'a0 & consider me almost as a relation.\'a0 She says that she is not going to Columbia, that Mrs. Cunningham is prevented by sickness from going with her daughter.\'a0 You she says on your way up can stop at Laurens, & they will have a buggy there to meet you, or I you know send the carri[a]ge; or else you could get in the stage which passes through their plantation, & which meets the Greenville stage.\'a0 Pamela says she will not \ul hear\ulnone  of any \ul obstacles\ulnone  or \ul denials\ulnone ; & she knows \ul you\ulnone  will not object; says she regrets exceedingly you could not have stopped on your way down, but insists on your doing so on your return; says she will accept the offer of you as an escort, during one of the four winters you are certain of being in Columbia.\'a0 Now My dear husband what shall I do?\'a0 I would like to go \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone  & see no objection to it, & it would be so pleasant for you to meet me there & all return to Greenville together.\'a0 I would not go for two weeks at least, so that Jim could kill hogs before we went, & if you prefer it, Jim could return after carrying me to Mrs. Cunninghams, though I do not think that would be necessary.\'a0 I think it would be a pleasant way of passing the time during your absence, so you must write me immediately whether I shall go; for though so anxious to go myself; I will of course give up if \ul you\ulnone  object, but I rather think you will like me to go, & if I do go, I will arrange everything at home, so as to go on \ul well\ulnone  without me.\'a0 I will now drop this subject & tell of all that has occurred since I last wrote.\'a0 Sunday night a letter came from Mr. Bancroft, acknowledging the receipt of your check.\'a0 Monday I paid visits.\'a0 I went to see first Miss Pinckney, who I \ul always\ulnone  like & she gave me a p[ai]r of gloves for one of the children, which she had bought for Charley & were too small for him.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney says the Physicians have advised him to take 2 years rest; otherwise he will have Spinal complaint.\'a0 So I believe \ul certainly\ulnone  at the end of this year he will leave us, for which I am \ul very\ulnone  \ul sorry\ulnone , for I think a family like his, an acquisition to Greenville.\'a0 He says Mr. Sharpe was once in Greenville in Bevens store; then returned to Pendleton, & set up a \ul Confectioners\ulnone  shop, & afterwards entered into business with young Warley; that he has \ul no\ulnone  \ul education\ulnone , which you can perceive by \ul conversing\ulnone  with him; & that he is good looking, which I think must have caused Frances to have fancied him.\'a0 Mr. Croft was at Mr. Pinckney\'92s & asked me if I had seen the compliment paid you in the Charleston Courier, & then said to Mr. Pinckney, that you were now \ul Senator\ulnone , higher that you had ever been before, & elected by such a handsome majority.\'a0 I saw him (Mr. Croft) yesterday afternoon at Mamma\'92s & he said to me Well the Maj now is in all his glory, the next thing I expect to hear of him is, that he is President of the Senate.\'a0 I am thinking now, that I ought to have \ul advised\ulnone  you to appropriate that honour to yourself, & if you had signified your \ul wish\ulnone , perhaps you might have obtained it.\'a0 How delightful \ul that\ulnone  would be, to be a \ul Senators\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone  is good, but Wife of \ul President\ulnone  of the \ul Senate\ulnone , \ul still\ulnone  \ul better\ulnone , & I am \ul sure\ulnone  if you had \ul tried\ulnone  for it, you \ul might\ulnone  have got it.\'a0 My next visit was to Mrs. Thompson.\'a0 I saw Genl Thompson for a moment.\'a0 He was about going for the \ul fourth\ulnone  time to Mr. Carsons to persuade him\'a0 to sell him his place.\'a0 Genl Thompsons miniature I do not think a good likeness, & Mrs. Thompsons can \ul never\ulnone  have looked like her.\'a0 Speaking of the Torchlight procession, Mrs. Thompson mentioned, that Butler, Mr. Holcombe, & some other gentlemen were standing by the Mansion house, & Butler said \'93how will this do?\'92 & Mr. Holcombe said, \'93very well for the occasion,\'94 & Mrs. Walker who was at one of the windows replied, \'93if we had our hands in the \ul public\ulnone  \ul treasury\ulnone  , we would do \ul better\ulnone ,\'94 meaning it of \ul course\ulnone  for \ul Genl\ulnone  \ul Thompson\ulnone .\'a0 Afterwards she went for Butler & apologized to \ul him\ulnone , saying if she had known \ul he\ulnone  was near, she would not have said what she did & she did not mean it for \ul him\ulnone , which made the matter \ul worse\ulnone , for if she did not mean it for \ul him\ulnone , she ought not to have apologized to \ul him\ulnone , more than to \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Holcombe\ulnone , Mrs. Thompson said, Mrs. Walker by her conduct during \ul Nullification\ulnone  times, had\'85\ul her\ulnone  of politics.\'a0 Next I went to Mr. Crofts to see the ladies there.\'a0 Mrs. Pearson mentioned the compliment paid you in the paper, & said she would like to read your address, so I borrowed Mamma\'92s copy, & sent it.\'a0 Mr. Croft illuminated his house Saturday night, also Mr. Choice his office, the printing office at the Jail, those were all.\'a0 Then I went to see Mrs. Beattie.\'a0 She says Mr. Spears has sold his house in Laurens, & with his family will live with Mrs. Rowland.\'a0 He is half of his time from home, & his wife finds it lonely.\'a0 Lastly I went to see Mrs. Duboc.\'a0 She said she had heard glowing descriptions of your party.\'a0 Mrs. Lee said she looked forward to your being a Judge.\'a0 Mrs. Duboc said Mr. Moore had gone down in the stage with you, to be admitted, & that he said you would be one of those\'a0 appointed to examine him.\'a0 I hope you have been, for I like you to examine the students, so there is another lawyer for Greenville.\'a0 I think if some of them do not get offices, they will certainly starve.\'a0 There were five visits I paid in one morning, in consequence of having a carri[a]ge.\'a0 In the afternoon I went to see Mrs. Townes who was out, & then called for Mrs. Barclay to take a ride, instead of paying her a visit.\'a0 She had sent me word that she was to leave the next morning.\'a0\'a0 Mr. Barclay has gone to Newberry, she to Columbia.\'a0 Yesterday morning I went to see Mrs. Gibbes.\'a0 She also mentioned the notice of you in the paper.\'a0 Mr. Gibbes is better.\'a0 He was walking about the farm.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon I rode up to Mr. McBee\'92s.\'a0 They were all out, except Mrs. Carson.\'a0 I then called for Susan to shop.\'a0 The gold peices you\'a0 gave me, pass here, $4.85.\'a0 Today Jim is hauling wood, & in a few days I suppose he will kill hogs.\'a0 I have only two more visits to pay, & then I will stay at home & work.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight, but if I do not, will not be uneasy, for I do not wish you to write to me \ul except\ulnone  when \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul convenient\ulnone .\'a0 If you write to \ul others\ulnone , I will be satisfied.\'a0 I saw Mrs. Duncan in the streets yesterday.\'a0 I suppose she is well.\'a0 The village looks \ul very\ulnone  \ul dull\ulnone .\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 I suppose Mr. Lester has you down to be admitted.\'a0 Do you think Mr. Elford or Butler will be elected?\'a0 I get along \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , though you may suppose how \ul much\ulnone  I miss you.\'a0 But I do so wish, you need not decline going to Congress on \ul my\ulnone  \ul account\ulnone .\'a0 See how good I am to write you every Mail, so you must be \ul happy & contented\ulnone , & \ul enjoy\ulnone  yourself.\'a0 If you do \ul not\ulnone  write me, you are \ul tired\ulnone  & \ul homesick\ulnone .\'a0 I will be so \ul provoked\ulnone , I will \ul stop\ulnone  writing to you, & you need not pretend you are anxious to see \ul me\ulnone , for as soon as you come home, you commence \ul scolding\ulnone  me.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 Willy was anxious to write to you, but I have no room.\'a0 He says he is sorry Papa has gone to Columbia, but he wants his \ul drum\ulnone .\'a0 I wonder what other wife writes to her husband, as often as I do.\'a0 I expect some of them will not hear during the whole session.\'a0 Do the Greenville delegation \ul all\ulnone  board at the same house with you?\'a0 You must excuse all mistakes, for I have written in a hurry.\'a0 I am anxious to know if you will like me to go to Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 I hope you will, for I would like to go very much.\'a0 I do not see anything to prevent my going.\'a0 But if \ul you\ulnone  would \ul rather\ulnone  me not, I \ul will\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  \ul go\ulnone .\'a0 You must write \ul immediately\ulnone  & tell me.\'a0 I have now reached the bottom of my page & will bid you adieu.\'a0 Ever Yours, Liz\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again have I taken my pen in hand to write to you.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson has sent me word, Butler is going tonight to Columbia, & will take a letter for me, so I will send this by him.\'a0 Your letter I received Wednesday night, & it \ul would\ulnone  have given me great \ul pleasure\ulnone , had it not been for the \ul sad\ulnone  \ul intelligence\ulnone  you communicated.\'a0 We had not heard even of the \ul sickness\ulnone  of Uncle Hayne, so that his \ul death\ulnone  was \ul quite\ulnone  a \ul shock\ulnone .\'a0 When Mr. Yancey said he met cousin Isaac coming on to see his father, I supposed he had attended to a sickness he had some time ago of which he had completely recovered.\'a0 What an affliction it is to his \ul immediate\ulnone  family, & a loss to \ul all\ulnone  of the family, for I believe he managed the whole of the business of those who were without gentleman.\'a0 What will Mamma do; I should think as soon as convenient, \ul you\ulnone  would have to go to town to see to the transferring of his business.\'a0 Aunt Eliza some time ago wrote word that \ul Wm. \'85\ulnone  understood the management of it, so that \ul he\ulnone  would attend to it if anything happened to his father, & I hope \ul now\ulnone  he will be able to, but \ul no\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  will supply \ul Uncle\ulnone  \ul Haynes\ulnone  place.\'a0 He improved her money for her; whenever he could & never asked, though \ul poor\ulnone , for any compensation, from \ul Mamma\ulnone  & \ul no\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  \ul else\ulnone .\'a0 He was a \ul good\ulnone  man, had a \ul sad\ulnone  \ul fate\ulnone , & \ul now\ulnone  I am \ul sure\ulnone  is meeting his \ul reward\ulnone .\'a0 His family were \ul entirely\ulnone  dependent on his \ul exertions\ulnone , so I do not know \ul what\ulnone  they will do.\'a0 So little did we know of his sickness, that by Mrs. Mauldin, Mamma sent a present of two beautiful coloured dresses to Eliza & Susan, & I sent two aprons.\'a0 They must have received them immediately after their fathers death.\'a0 Mamma thought as Uncle Hayne asked nothing from her, in return for his trouble, she would make a present to his children that would be useful & a help to them; but as it turned out, it was quite \ul mal\ulnone  \ul apropos\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma I suppose will receive a letter \ul tonight\ulnone  from some of the family.\'a0 They no doubt waited to write until all was over & were in no hurry to communicate such \ul bad\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone .\'a0 There are \ul few\ulnone  whose death will be such a loss to Mamma.\'a0 If you have heard any particulars, write me of them.\'a0 I dare say it was \ul anxiety\ulnone  of \ul mind\ulnone , which he must have suffered for a \ul long\ulnone  \ul long\ulnone  time\'a0 brought on Paralysis.\'a0 I am glad cousin Isaac arrived in time.\'a0 His other children I suppose were with him. I read your letter this morning in the Mountaineer.\'a0 You will see a glowing description of the Torch light procession in the Mountaineer.\'a0 I scarcely recognize it.\'a0 It appears so much better on paper. So certain am I that you will wish me to go to Mrs. Cunninghams that I have commenced putting my Wardrobe in order for my visit.\'a0 I anticipate \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone & so do the children, & I know it will do us \ul all\ulnone  good.\'a0 A change sometimes is very pleasant.\'a0 The only objection you could have, would be that Jim would be taken from his work, but that is \ul none\ulnone ; for after carrying us, he can return home.\'a0 I wish you would see Pamelas letter.\'a0 She is so \ul urgent\ulnone  & \ul pressing\ulnone  in her invitation.\'a0 If you would prefer seeing your Constituents immediately after the adjournment of the Legislature, you might return \ul home\ulnone  from Columbia, & \ul then\ulnone  come to Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 You might come at any time after the adjournment, that suited you best.\'a0 I know you cannot object\'a0 top myself & the children paying them a visit, & it would be \ul very\ulnone  \ul pleasant\ulnone  if you would come & bring us home.\'a0 Whichever time suits you best, I will arrange everything to go on \ul with\ulnone  or without me.\'a0 I would like to go the 10
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of December & stay until after Christmas.\'a0 Pamela says I must pay a \ul long\ulnone  \ul sociable\ulnone  visit & that would be allowing myself only a fortnight.\'a0 I mention the \ul 10
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub \ulnone  because I do not think I could get ready before then.\'a0 Jim I suppose had better return home with the carri[a]ge & horses.\'a0 You must \ul write\ulnone  me about \ul that\ulnone , & \ul which time \ulnone will be most convenient for you to come, on your \ul way\ulnone  from \ul Columbia\ulnone , or \ul after\ulnone  you get \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 I will take Delia with me, & Minerva will superintend the yard & be careful of everything.\'a0 Jim will kill the hogs more probably before we go & will have plenty of wood.\'a0 I will arrange everything as well as I did for your party.\'a0 The change will be particularly beneficial to the children, who associate at home too much with the servants.\'a0 Anna asks now, Why we don\'92t go to Miss Pamela\'92s that it has stopped raining.\'a0I will get materials for working your shoes & carry with me, that Pamela may show me.\'a0 Mamma & Susan say they think it will be very pleasant for me to go.  I must mention \ul two\ulnone  \ul important\ulnone  peices of \ul domestic\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone .\'a0 The Cow you bought from Mr. Goodwin, yesterday had a calf, & the Sou Mr. Hoke lent you last night had \ul ten\ulnone  pigs, \ul real\ulnone  \ul Berkshire\ulnone .\'a0 Jim says all are doing well.\'a0 You need not now have taken Flora. For \ul one\ulnone  Cow is quite sufficient for our family, & the Goodwin Cow I dare say will give a great deal of Milk.\'a0 This morning Minerva milked her & she gave a gallon.\'a0 We will now make a good deal of Butter, which however is more expensive than buying.\'a0 With Flora I churned \ul twice\ulnone  a week.\'a0 Mr. Thomas came here this morning, (the person from Buncombe we buy Butter from) & asked if I would like any Herdsgrass seed, that several gentlemen had asked him to bring them some, that he would sell good seed sifted at 1 dollar a bushel.\'a0 I told him I would write & ask you, so you must let me know. In all probability Mr. Roper will give you a bundle for Susan.\'a0 If he \ul does\ulnone , send it to Greenville by the first opportunity, for it contains articles she wishes to wear now.\'a0 You must not forget to open the letter Mamma gave directed to Mr. Roper, take out the money, & pay Mr. Roper whatever the articles Mr. Roper got amounted to.\'a0You are fortunate in getting a nice room to yourself.\'a0 It gives me pleasure to think of your being in Columbia, & that your talents will now be brought into use for the good of your country. I hope you will exercise a good \ul judgement\ulnone  in your course this winter, so that no fault may be found with you at home.\'a0\'a0You must write me all the news.\'a0 I have none to tell, except that Mrs. Dr. Earles eldest daughter is to be married to a Mr. Williams of Laurens.\'a0 But you must not \ul tell\ulnone  \ul anyone\ulnone , for Mrs. Earle informed Mamma in \ul confidence\ulnone , through a servant, who she sent to borrow a dress from Susan.\'a0Perhaps I may hear from you tonight, at any rate I will anticipate it, but as you are so busy will not expect certainly.\'a0 I look anxiously to your letter Wednesday night, as from that I will have \ul certainly\ulnone , if I can go to Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 Ever Yours, Liz\

\cf0 I have just received a letter from you, which I will answer, along with the one received last Friday.\'a0 Do not begin talking already about \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 I should think the scolding wife, bad children, & worthless servants you always find there would make you regard home with anything but \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  think \ul going\ulnone  \ul from\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone  very pleasant, & am writing anxiously to have your permission, to \ul leave\ulnone  it for a short time.\'a0 The next Mail I expect to receive permission, & then I will make preparations to go as soon as possible.\'a0 I wish to go \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , & the children are very \ul anxious\ulnone .\'a0 I think after carrying me, Jim had better return home, to attend to things.\'a0 I will see that everything goes on \ul well\ulnone  during my absence.\'a0 Indeed there is \ul no\ulnone  objection to my going, & I \ul hope\ulnone  you will not be so unreasonable as to object.\'a0 If you \ul have\ulnone , think the matter over & decide \ul differently\ulnone , & write me word I \ul may\ulnone  \ul go\ulnone .\'a0 I think I can get off by the 11
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 You must stop on your way from Columbia, or if you prefer it, return home \ul first\ulnone  & \ul then\ulnone  come for me.\'a0 I would like to pass Christmas there, so you might come a day or two before Christmas.\'a0 If I set off here the 11
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  I would get to Mrs. Cunninghams the 13
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  so if I staid until Christmas, it would be only allowing 12 days for my visit. Mamma has received \ul no\ulnone  letter \ul yet\ulnone  from her friends.\'a0 I wish \ul you\ulnone  would write us \ul all\ulnone  the particulars of Uncle Haynes death, \ul when\ulnone  he was taken sick, how \ul long\ulnone  he was sick, if his \ul children\ulnone  were \ul all\ulnone  with him, & so on.\'a0 You can ask Mr. Martin.\'a0 Mamma is uneasy about her business, & does not know \ul who\ulnone  will attend to it, or \ul how\ulnone  it will be managed.\'a0 \ul She\ulnone  wishes, & so do \ul I\ulnone  that after the Session is \ul over\ulnone , \ul you\ulnone  should go to town, if it is only \ul one\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  to attend to it for her.\'a0 As it is so convenient now to go on the Rail road, & a \ul short\ulnone  visit, would not be \ul very\ulnone  \ul expensive\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you will oblige us by going.\'a0 I think it \ul absolutely necessary\ulnone , you should, to prevent confusion in Mamma\'92s affairs.\'a0 Mr. Hayne is indeed a \ul loss\ulnone  to her.\'a0 I know often she would have lost property, if it had not been for his \ul watchfulness\ulnone .\'a0 Once negroes that were mortgaged to her, were about to be sold, when he discovered it & prevented it, & he had trouble in securing to her Roumillato house.\'a0 I hope when Mamma receives a letter, some mention will be made of her affairs, but I rather think you will have to go & see about them, & it would be more convenient to go from Columbia, & less expensive than from Greenville, & if it is \ul necessary\ulnone , you will certainly \ul not\ulnone  \ul refuse\ulnone  to give Mamma this proof of your friendship.\'a0 So our minds will rest easy on \ul that\ulnone  \ul point\ulnone .\'a0 I am surprised Mr. Roper has given you no package for Susan.\'a0 He was to have given you her watch & something else, & you were to \ul open\ulnone  the letter directed to Mr. or Mrs. Roper.\'a0 I do not know which, & \ul pay\ulnone  whatever the articles amounted to that Mrs. Roper bought.\'a0 I believe Mamma sent \ul more\ulnone  than enough money to pay for them, & it would have been convenient to her, if you could have brought any money that was over, back with you.\'a0 I am not anxious about Mr. Earle\'92s election.\'a0 He is rich enough to do without office.\'a0 Someone poorer deserves it.\'a0 Mr. Butlers I \ul am\ulnone  anxious about.\'a0 He I expect is \ul very\ulnone  \ul poor\ulnone , has a large family, & has been an attentive Lawyer for some years, & \ul entitled\ulnone  to the office he seeks.\'a0 I do not think Mr. Elford as a \ul Christian\ulnone  even, ought to have opposed him, for he has just commenced practicing Law, has one office already, no children to support yet. Has got property by his wife.\'a0 I \ul hope\ulnone  Mr. Butler will be elected. I am glad you are seated by \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Young\ulnone , for it is well for you to associate with Upper country gentlemen.\'a0\'a0 It is from \ul them\ulnone  all you have to \ul hope\ulnone  for in this world depends, unless you are thinking of being \ul Governor\ulnone , or \ul United\ulnone  \ul States\ulnone  \ul Senator\ulnone .\'a0 But for the \ul present\ulnone , I am satisfied with you as \ul State\ulnone  \ul Senator\ulnone , & if you only keep the \ul honour\ulnone , will not aspire to \ul more\ulnone , though when you see fit to become a \ul Member\ulnone  of \ul Congress\ulnone , I will certainly not \ul object\ulnone .\'a0 Do in writing letters for the Mountaineer, be \ul careful\ulnone  in \ul expressing\ulnone  \ul your\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone ., so as not to give \ul offence\ulnone  to anyone, & be \ul sure\ulnone  & not say \ul anything\ulnone  \ul against\ulnone  \ul Texas\ulnone .\'a0 If you cannot say anything in her \ul favour\ulnone , also do not \ul mention\ulnone  her.\'a0 I wish you to please in \ul every\ulnone  \ul respect\ulnone  a people who have been so \ul good\ulnone  to \ul you\ulnone , & not make yourself \ul enemies\ulnone  by \ul imprudent\ulnone  \ul remarks\ulnone .\'a0 You must take this advice in \ul good\ulnone  \ul part\ulnone , & \ul profit\ulnone  by it.\'a0 I am glad you have gained a case.\'a0 I suppose there are so many candidates because times are hard, & persons can find no way of supporting themselves.\'a0 How can you say you have \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about, when you are in \ul Columbia\ulnone , & see so \ul many\ulnone  \ul people\ulnone .\'a0 Your trunk \ul not\ulnone  \ul enough\ulnone .\'a0 I begrudge money spent in Columbia.\'a0 For I believe you give almost twice as much for anything as in Charleston.\'a0 Mr. McKay said he believed Mr. Yancey would not be able to go to Columbia, & regretted it, as he was anxious to see you.\'a0 Mr. McKay is said to be engaged to Miss Atwood & Miss Austin is engaged to Mr. Hill, Mrs. Duncan\'92s brother, \ul perhaps\ulnone  the one we saw at the Chick Springs.\'a0The servants have given me no trouble, & if they do I will take it \ul calmly\ulnone  & not be worried.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 Willy has improved in his reading.\'a0 He takes more \ul interest\ulnone  in it, & will know a good many stories to read to you.\'a0 The animals are all well, except a [page torn] one of Cows stepped on.\'a0 John says, Mr. Hoke said, you must give him two of the Berkshires just born, but Mr. Hoke cannot give away your pigs, although he lent you the sou for as long as you support it, it is yours, so if you give the pigs to John , twill be as your \ul own\ulnone .\'a0 I went to church this morning & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Pinckney.\'a0 This afternoon took a ride with Susan & Mamma.\'a0I think Frances by this late act of hers, has proved herself \ul worthy\ulnone  of her uncle Mr. H.L. Pinckney.\'a0 She must be low indeed to connect herself with such a person as Mr. \ul Elam\ulnone  Sharpe.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney \ul here\ulnone  says he is not even \ul intelligent\ulnone .\'a0 Frances must have been \ul anxious\ulnone  to be married and lost to all \ul pride\ulnone  of \ul feeling\ulnone , which every lady ought to have. Your letters give me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone , but you must not let them interfere with your \ul other\ulnone  \ul engagements\ulnone .\'a0 As all are so glad you are back in the Legislature, you must try & perform your duty there \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  am very glad you are there.\'a0 It is something \ul pleasant\ulnone  to think of.\'a0 You ought to be there if only for \ul my\ulnone  sake.\'a0 Greenville is so \ul dull\ulnone .\'a0 If you were here, you would wish yourself \ul away\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad you are away this dull season.\'a0 I get along \ul well\ulnone  without you, so do not be uneasy, & I hope you will let me recreate a little.\'a0 Yours, Liz\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
	Again have I seated myself at the desk to write to you, & this time \ul literally\ulnone  \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 But as I know you will be disappointed if you do not hear \ul every\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone , I must even try & make out a letter.\'a0 I write to you at \ul night\ulnone , because in the day, it would be \ul impossible\ulnone  for me to write, & at night too.\'a0 The children are \ul all\ulnone  \ul asleep\ulnone , & I am undisturbed by them.\'a0 Ever since I received Pamela\'92s letter, I have been engaged preparing for my visit, mending clothes, & putting our own clothes in order, so that I have been \ul completely\ulnone  \ul occupied\ulnone .\'a0 I sit up working until \ul 10 oclock\ulnone  \ul every\ulnone  night, \ul sometimes\ulnone  until \ul eleven\ulnone .\'a0 I have felt in an uncertain state all the time, not knowing \ul really\ulnone  whether I was to go, but tomorrow night my suspense will be ended, as I indeed hope, my preparations will not have been in vain.\'a0 If you say I must \ul not\ulnone  go, of \ul course\ulnone  I \ul will\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone , but it will be a \ul sore\ulnone  \ul disappointment\ulnone  to me, & I think when you know how \ul anxious\ulnone  I am to go, that you will \ul consent\ulnone .\'a0 The change will do us \ul all\ulnone  good, & I hope you will not object.\'a0 I will arrange everything at home, to go on as if I were here, & I feel that when I come back, I can take a new start, & do better in housekeeping, managing servants, children & everything else.\'a0 A little freedom from care for a while would do me good, me especially, who have so few changes.\'a0 So do write word that you gladly consent to my going.\'a0 You must not be \ul contradictory\ulnone  & refuse my going, because you find my heart is set on it.\'a0 Which you know is what I often accuse you of.\'a0 I would like to go tomorrow week, the 11
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 I will set off after dinner, stop at Goldsmiths the first night, & go to Mrs. Cunninghams the next day.\'a0 I will go slowly, so as not to hurt the horses, & Jim can [go] back with them, unless you would prefer his returning without them.\'a0 If your letter tomorrow night says that I had better not go,\'a0 think over the matter well & in a subsequent one, reverse the decree, \ul still\ulnone  I will not leave home without \ul your\ulnone  \ul consent\ulnone , & will now drop a subject which I am sorry I have dwelt on so long, but when you consider I have no one to talk to all day, & when I \ul write\ulnone  to you, I think I am \ul talking\ulnone  to you, you must\ul  excuse\ulnone  me. Mr. McKay came day before yesterday for your office key, that he might get some papers, connected with the Dunham & McBee case, which he thought you had to enable him to collect \ul Costs\ulnone .\'a0 When he returned the key. He said he could not find the papers.\'a0 He supposed they were in your trunk which was locked.\'a0 So I suppose you will get that money soon.\'a0 You must not write you are \ul tired \ulnone of Columbia.\'a0 You ought to be \ul glad\ulnone  to be there, & must be \ul contented\ulnone , & think of \ul nothing\ulnone  but your \ul duties\ulnone , until the \ul Session\ulnone  is \ul over\ulnone , & remain at your post, until the very last \ul moment\ulnone .\'a0 As you have always complained of having so \ul much\ulnone  to do, I should think that you would be \ul pleased\ulnone  that in the Senate, there is so \ul little\ulnone  \ul done\ulnone .\'a0 The Senate may not be so \ul interesting\ulnone  & \ul amusing\ulnone  as the house, but it is certainly a more \ul dignified\ulnone  \ul station\ulnone  & I should suppose you would \ul rather\ulnone  be there, but as regards \ul enjoyment\ulnone  & \ul ease\ulnone , I should think there would be the same difference between the \ul Senate\ulnone  & \ul house\ulnone , as between a \ul large\ulnone  \ul crowded\ulnone  \ul party\ulnone , & a \ul small\ulnone  \ul select\ulnone  one.\'a0 In the \ul former\ulnone , we always find the \ul most\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 In the house too, a person who is fond of \ul speaking\ulnone , has greater advantages, for anything he would say there, would appear \ul well\ulnone , while in the Senate he must be more \ul particular\ulnone , & only speak when he has something \ul important\ulnone  to say.\'a0 He has therefore \ul few\ulnone  opportunities of distinguishing himself.\'a0 So what opportunities\'a0 \ul do\ulnone  occur, you most \ul embrace\ulnone .\'a0 You were a distinguished member of the Lower house & I know will be of the other.\'a0 I feel that the state will do better, with \ul you\ulnone  in its Councils.\'a0 \ul Your\ulnone  \ul abilities\ulnone  ought not to be concentrated on your \ul family\ulnone  \ul only\ulnone , they ought to be used for the benefit of your \ul country\ulnone , as they \ul now\ulnone  are, & so my dear husband, do not \ul think\ulnone  of your Wife, children, servants, horses, Cows & pigs \ul now\ulnone , but think for \ul what\ulnone  you were sent to \ul Columbia\ulnone  \ul for\ulnone  & for \ul three\ulnone  \ul little\ulnone  \ul weeks\ulnone , \ul forget\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 Home will take care of itself, & goes on quite well without you. I suppose Mr. Duncan, Ware & Walker like \ul sensible\ulnone  men are \ul enjoying\ulnone  \ul themselves\ulnone .\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  \ul do\ulnone  the \ul same\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you become acquainted with Mr. Wm. H. Heyward as he is my cousin, & the son of Mamma\'92s intimate friend. You must feel strange at first in the Senate, & miss your old associates in the house.\'a0 My dear husband, as this is somewhat of a \ul lecturing\ulnone  & \ul advising\ulnone  letter I will tell you of the \ul only\ulnone  \ul virtue\ulnone  which I do not think you \ul possess\ulnone , which is \ul ambition\ulnone .\'a0 I think you are the \ul least\ulnone  \ul ambitious\ulnone  person I ever saw, but I hope in this respect you will \ul improve\ulnone , & if you do not \ul naturally\ulnone  possess, you will \ul cultivate\ulnone  that virtue, for \ul virtue\ulnone  it \ul is\ulnone , when directed in a \ul right\ulnone  course, & possessed by a \ul good\ulnone  \ul person\ulnone .\'a0 Genl Thompson came to me, when he heard of Uncle Haynes death, to know the particulars.\'a0 He seemed particularly anxious to know, in what \ul circumstances\ulnone  he left his family, & was glad to hear Aunt Eliza had friends who if \ul willing\ulnone , were \ul able\ulnone  to assist her.\'a0 I have \ul nothing \ulnone as you \ul see\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 I wonder at your \ul wishing\ulnone  me to write so \ul often\ulnone , but as you \ul say\ulnone  you \ul wish\ulnone  it.\'a0 I am \ul willing\ulnone  to \ul write\ulnone .\'a0 I am in hopes the [page torn] so \ul constantly\ulnone  from home, will make you \ul happy\ulnone  & \ul contented\ulnone .\'a0 One winter I would like to go with you to Columbia, take \ul Willy\ulnone  with us & go in one carri[a]ge so that I would ride out constantly.\'a0 It will be \ul delightful\ulnone , perhaps \ul next\ulnone  winter I can go.\'a0 So in anticipation of my company next winter, you must remain satisfied now alone & then when you come home, you will have so much to tell me.\'a0 It is worth \ul leaving\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone , to \ul come\ulnone  \ul back\ulnone .\'a0 I feel sorry for Col. Townes whenever I see him.\'a0 He looks so dull.\'a0 He must wish himself with you all.\'a0 Your family are \ul all\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 From your \ul Wife\ulnone  down to the youngest pig, with the exception of the mashed pig.\'a0 We churn so often with Flora\'92s milk \ul alone\ulnone , that when we use the \ul other\ulnone  Cows Milk, we will not have to buy Butter.\'a0 The servants have given me no trouble.\'a0 Mamma\'92s family are as usual.\'a0 I have been there, & Susan comes in as often as she can.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney described Anns case to Dr. Brewster, & he says he is afraid mothing can be done for her.\'a0 Ann yesterday received a letter from a lady in Philadelphia who has spinal affection, & who Mr. Pinckney saw & requested her to write to Ann.\'a0 No letters have arrived for you, except Mr. Bancrofts. The Power of Attorney for Mrs. Baker has not come yet.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your \ul long\ulnone  letter last night, & as I read it, I \ul regretted\ulnone  that I had expressed so much anxiety about going to Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 I feel \ul frightened\ulnone  when I think you will receive \ul two\ulnone  letters more on the same subject, & \ul dread\ulnone  the \ul next\ulnone  \ul letters\ulnone  I will get from you.\'a0 However as the \ul reprimand\ulnone  they contain, I \ul deserve\ulnone , I will even take it in \ul good part\ulnone , & \ul profit\ulnone  by it.\'a0 I feel \ul sorry \ulnone now that I did not merely \ul mention\ulnone  the invitation, & ask you what I should do.\'a0 I would then have known your \ul real\ulnone  \ul opinion.\ulnone \'a0 Now though you say you have \ul no\ulnone  \ul objection\ulnone  to my going, I do not know that you are \ul willing\ulnone  I should go, & I would not go on \ul any\ulnone  \ul account\ulnone , unless you were \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul willing\ulnone .\'a0 I do not care to go before next Tuesday the 11
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  instant.\'a0 So by \ul return\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone  you must write me word \ul exactly\ulnone  what I must do.\'a0 If you say you would just as\'85I should go, you have not the \ul least\ulnone  \ul objection\ulnone  to it, I \ul will\ulnone  \ul go\ulnone , but if you say you would \ul prefer\ulnone  my \ul remaining\ulnone  at \ul home\ulnone , I will \ul cheerfully\ulnone  remain.\'a0 I did not consider last nights letter even a \ul permission\ulnone  to go, for you thought I was so anxious to go, that you were \ul obliged\ulnone  to consent, even \ul against\ulnone  your will.\'a0 Now that you see my feelings have \ul cooled\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone , you will feel more at liberty to give your \ul real\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone .\'a0 If by your advice, I go, & you prefer not stopping, I can return home \ul before\ulnone  the \ul Session adjourns\ulnone , so that you may find me here, or if you do not \ul object\ulnone  to stopping, you need not unless you \ul wish\ulnone  it, stay more than a night.\'a0 You must write (that is if I go) \ul exactly\ulnone  the arrangements about Jim, & what \ul day\ulnone  he must meet you, but I repeat again, that I would not even \ul wish\ulnone  to go, unless I thought \ul you\ulnone  wished it, & I am \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul willing\ulnone  to \ul give\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  my visit.\'a0 Your letter has completely \ul cooled\ulnone  me, & I am far less anxious to go than I was, & unless I hear \ul Wednesday\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone , that you have not the \ul least\ulnone  \ul objection\ulnone  to my going, I \ul will\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 I am \ul always\ulnone  \ul ready\ulnone  to \ul listen\ulnone  to \ul reason\ulnone , & would not have been so \ul unreasonable\ulnone ,\'a0 if \ul you\ulnone  had been \ul near\ulnone , & \ul never\ulnone  will be \ul again\ulnone  though you may be \ul away\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry to have made so \ul small\ulnone  a matter of so much importance.\'a0 Having \ul no\ulnone  \ul one \ulnone to \ul express\ulnone  my thoughts to, I \ul dwell\ulnone  on a matter, until it seems more important than it otherwise would.\'a0 But I\'92ll not do so in future.\'a0 If I had known you had no confidence in my letters, & took no interest in them, I am sure I would not have sat up until \ul 10 or 11 oclock\ulnone  \ul every\ulnone  \ul other\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone  to write to you.\'a0 The reason I did not mention my sickness to you, was that though \ul painful\ulnone , it was not in the least of a \ul dangerous\ulnone  kind, there was no \ul necessity\ulnone  for your coming home, as you \ul would\ulnone  have done, if you had \ul known\ulnone  it, for you would have been glad of the \ul excuse\ulnone , as you were \ul once\ulnone  before when you came home because I had the Toothache.\'a0 I did not wish to be the means of making your constituents complain \ul again\ulnone , that you \ul neglected\ulnone  your \ul duty\ulnone .\'a0 Your father I knew you \ul loved\ulnone , & to hear of his death would \ul distress\ulnone  you & as you are always so unhappy as it is in Columbia, I did not think it necessary\'a0 to add to your unhappiness.\'a0 I was afraid that \ul too\ulnone  might \ul bring\ulnone  you \ul home\ulnone .\'a0\'a0 If like the other members, you had remained at your post \ul always\ulnone  to the\ul  last\ulnone  moment, I would not have been \ul afraid \ulnone any little cause of anxiety at home, but I kept them from you, to \ul prevent\ulnone  you from \ul deserting\ulnone .\'a0 Now that you have \ul promised\ulnone  me, you will perform your duty \ul faithfully\ulnone  & not leave until the Session is \ul actually\ulnone  \ul over\ulnone , I will keep you faithfully informed of home.\'a0 You ought to remain \ul two\ulnone  or\ul  three\ulnone  days \ul after\ulnone  the Session, rather than leave \ul one\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  \ul before\ulnone .\'a0 As regards lending Mr. Yancey the buggy, I would have felt that I had been perhaps wrong in lending it, as I am in such \ul fear\ulnone  of you, that I preferred not mentioning what I had done, until I knew all was safe, though of course never mind what accident had happened, I would have known it was my duty to have mentioned it to you.\'a0 In the future do not be uneasy.\'a0 I will let you know \ul everything\ulnone . Last night a letter came from Dwight Lathrop for you, also the Temperance Advocate, whose note in your address, I like very \ul much.\ulnone \'a0 It expresses a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone , in a \ul few\ulnone  \ul words\ulnone , & is very \ul appropriate.\'a0 \ulnone The Greenville Torchlight procession, is \ul very\ulnone  \ul magnificent\ulnone  on \ul paper\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma on reading it, said to Susan, \'93Why did you not tell me you saw all this\'94.\'a0 Everybody (in shopping) asks me about the elections.\'a0 A great many were \ul surprised\ulnone  that Mr. \ul Aiken\ulnone  is likely to be Governor & say they thought Mr. \ul Alston\ulnone  would have been.\'a0 I heard Mr. Aiken was \ul electioneering\ulnone  a great deal.\'a0 Most have thought too that \ul Tom\ulnone  \ul Butler\ulnone  would have been \ul easily\ulnone  \ul elected\ulnone .\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  have always thought Elford would be.\'a0 He seems so expert at electioneering.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson who I met today in a store said she heard Judge O\'92 Neal[l] was very active for Elford, & that Judge Butler was taking no part for Tom, or any of the Judges indeed.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson said she heard Mr. Summer would get the Treasurers office.\'a0 I had thought he was \ul poor\ulnone , but Mrs. Coleman, who came to see me this afternoon, says his father is a rich old Dutchman.\'a0 I do not think \ul rich\ulnone  persons, should apply for office. \'a0You must write \ul all\ulnone  the \ul news\ulnone  that I may tell it to persons who ask me.\'a0 I met Mrs. Duncan this morning.\'a0 She said, in writing, I must get you to tell Mr. Duncan his family were all well, the baby had entirely recovered.\'a0 She said she came to see me with Mrs. Sumney & I was out.\'a0 I did not know it, until she told me today.\'a0 Susan & myself both intend going to Miss Earle\'92s wedding next Tuesday night.\'a0 She is to be married to Mr. Williams, who teaches school in Laurens.\'a0 I am glad Susan will go, as Ann does not sleep at night; her going out, will not disturb her.\'a0 Mr. Foster one day sent to borrow a vehicle to carry his children to a wedding at Mr. Martin Hunts.\'a0 He returned it the next day, with a thousand thanks, & sent word the children had gone & returned quite comfortably.\'a0 Jim has hauled some Shucks & Fodder & intends to haul Corn.\'a0 He has not killed hogs yet.\'a0 He said he thought he had better wait until Mr. Hoke did, who was a good judge of [sui]table weather.\'a0 We have had scarcely any cold weather since you left.\'a0 Today & yesterday quite warm, & the sun shining brightly.\'a0 Jim hauled some wood today, & intends to haul more.\'a0 I got up by Candle light.\'a0 I sleep between Frank & Anna, so\'a0 if I\'a0 \ul forget\ulnone  them, when writing to their \ul Father\ulnone , they will not \ul let\ulnone  me \ul forget\ulnone  them at \ul night\ulnone , for they are so close I can scarcely turn.\'a0\'a0 They have been a great deal in the house with me, & then I can manage them quite well, but now in this charming weather, Willy & Anna run about, & are more unmanageable.\'a0 Willy takes a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone  more interest in his reading & has read several stories since you left.\'a0 He looks remarkably well, & talks with great pleasure of his drum.\'a0 Anna is also quite well, & speaks of the baby Papa is to bring her, & you can get one \ul cheaper\ulnone  & \ul undressed\ulnone , & I can dress it for her.\'a0 Frank does not look quite as well as he did before the complaint, but I hope before you come back, he will be as fat as he used to be.\'a0 He has not forgotten you, but looks anxiously, when I tell him to go see horse.\'a0 I do not think there is any news to tell you.\'a0 The village is very quiet.\'a0 Mamma has not heard yet from her friends.\'a0 I hope she will tomorrow night.\'a0 I am glad you dined at Dr. Gibbes.\'a0 I will read your letter in the Mountaineer tomorrow, & if I can will add a few lines.\'a0 It is now time to go to bed.\'a0 The children are all asleep.\'a0\

	I read your letter this morning in the Mountaineer.\'a0 My objection to it is that it is not \ul long\ulnone  enough.\'a0 The invitation to Miss Earles wedding came this morning for us both.\'a0 It is to be a very large one.\'a0 You must be sure & write me by return Mail whether I leave home or not.\'a0 I will continue writing to you, so that you may hear my Mail.\'a0 When you return I will be a \ul good\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone .\'a0 If you had been brought up more among ladies, you would not think me as strange as you sometimes do.\'a0 I do not think you understand, or know how to treat the \ul fair\ulnone  \ul sex, \ulnone but I will not \ul scold\ulnone  you, for I love you \ul dearly\ulnone , never mind what you think of me.\'a0You must write \ul interesting\ulnone  letters for the Mountaineer, & tell the people all you [word obscured] would interest them. but I will not give you \ul advice\ulnone  about what you know better than I do.\'a0 I expect with \ul pleasure\ulnone  to hear from you tonight, though you letter may contain\'a0 [word obscured].\'a0 I am sorry when I think of the one you will receive from me.\'a0 You will be provoked at my dwelling so long on one subject.\'a0 I never will again.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter by Mr. Mauldin.\'a0 If you are not an \ul abolitionist\ulnone , you certainly \ul act\ulnone  as if you were one, & I am \ul surprised\ulnone  that \ul you\ulnone  opposed to the \ul whole\ulnone  \ul Senate\ulnone .\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  certainly must be the \ul wrong\ulnone  one.\'a0 You have \ul already\ulnone  been called an abolitionist, & should be \ul particularly\ulnone  careful how you act on \ul that\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone .\'a0 I believe by yourconduct now as regards Mr.\'a0 [Samuel] Hoar you have \ul ruined\ulnone  yourself for life.\'a0 It will be a good tale to circulate about you.\'a0 You seem to be \ul taking\ulnone  the \ul part\ulnone  of the \ul abolitionists\ulnone .\'a0 I am really \ul shocked\ulnone  at your conduct, & am ashamed \ul my\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone  should act so.\'a0 It must have been for the sake of \ul notoriety\ulnone , for which I thought you had \ul no\ulnone  \ul desire\ulnone .\'a0 You see if trouble does not come to you on account of this. \'a0I only hope you will not mention it in the \ul Mountaineer\ulnone , so that it will not be \ul known\ulnone .\'a0 I had hopes that this session, you would act so \ul circumspectly\ulnone , that \ul no\ulnone  \ul fault\ulnone  would be found with you.\'a0 Abolition is such an \ul exciting\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone , that the \ul least\ulnone  \ul appearance\ulnone  of \ul favoring\ulnone  it should be \ul avoided\ulnone , & your conduct seems to \ul look\ulnone  like \ul taking\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  for the \ul Abolitionists\ulnone , though in \ul reality\ulnone  I \ul suppose\ulnone  you do not, but I begin to \ul suspect\ulnone  you \ul myself\ulnone . I have \ul tonight\ulnone  received a letter from Pamela, saying she hoped the death of Mr. Wm Ed[ward] Hayne would not prevent my visit; that I would be in no gayety; that they did not feel inclined for it themselves, & I \ul must\ulnone  go to see old friends; that if I put off the visit for the \ul Spring\ulnone , she \ul knew\ulnone  I would not be \ul able\ulnone  to go.\'a0 She says I must tell you \ul not\ulnone  to vote against Mr. \ul Laurens\ulnone , (who I see is elected).\'a0 I should think it probable you voted for Mr. \ul Harl[e]ston\ulnone .\'a0\'a0 \ul Tonight\ulnone  you will receive a letter from me, saying if you \ul object\ulnone  to my leaving home, I will \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 You were so \ul severe\ulnone  to me in the \ul first\ulnone  letter you wrote to me on \ul that\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone , that I really would not leave you with a \ul light\ulnone  \ul heart\ulnone , & I thought it \ul necessary\ulnone  to write \ul again \ulnone to say if you \ul objected\ulnone , I would not go.\'a0 I expect to receive your answer Wednesday night, & if you say, you are \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul willing\ulnone  I shall go.\'a0 I will leave the \ul next\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone , Thursday the 12
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 I will write you if I am not \ul too\ulnone  \ul busy\ulnone  \ul twice\ulnone  again before I leave.\'a0 Wednesday before the Mail closes, & again Thursday before I start, & as soon as I get to Mrs. Cunninghams & will continue to write so that you may hear every Mail.\'a0 If I \ul do\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  \ul write\ulnone , you must not be \ul uneasy\ulnone , but know that I have \ul not\ulnone  the \ul time\ulnone .\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  must \ul write\ulnone  to \ul me\ulnone , for it would be \ul pleasant\ulnone  to receive your letters at Mrs. Cunninghams, & write \ul all\ulnone  the \ul news\ulnone , so that I may have something to tell them, which is always expected when one receives a letter.\'a0 I hope you will stop & spend Christmas there.\'a0 From your saying Jim must not \ul leave\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone  till the \ul day\ulnone  \ul before\ulnone  \ul Christmas\ulnone , you do not mean him to go to Laurens C.H. for you, but will let Mr. \ul Cunningham\ulnone  & \ul his\ulnone  \ul buggy\ulnone  for you, which \ul Pamela\ulnone  said he would \ul do\ulnone .\'a0 But you will give me particular directions in your next letter.\'a0 The weather is now cold enough to \ul kill\ulnone  \ul hogs\ulnone , which Jim intends to do \ul tomorrow\ulnone .\'a0 So I am glad that will be over before I go.\'a0 He thinks if Mr. Goodlet[t] pays some Corn he owes, it will not be necessary to \ul go\ulnone  for a \ul load\ulnone , but if \ul necessary\ulnone  he will \ul go\ulnone .\'a0 I write, as if I were certainly going to Mrs. Cunninghams, because I do not believe you will \ul object\ulnone .\'a0 I received your letter by Mr. Butler yesterday, & a \ul book\ulnone , which I \ul first\ulnone  thought was for your \ul loving\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone , until I saw \ul your\ulnone  \ul name\ulnone  in it.\'a0 It is a \ul handsome\ulnone  book & I \ul expect\ulnone  cost a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone .\'a0 I was \ul pleased\ulnone  at Mr. Butlers election; he very kindly offered his services to me during your absence.\'a0 Mr. Bee stopped for a few moments yesterday on his way to Pendleton, & said he left you \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 The Pendleton stage had not come this evening before, & he was going in Genl Thompsons buggy.\'a0 He is so \ul kind\ulnone  \ul hearted\ulnone  & \ul affectionate\ulnone , & so is Col. Keith , who I knew would inquire after us,\'a0 & his wife is a sweet lady.\'a0 Mamma has received a letter from both Mr. & Mrs. Roper. Mrs. Coleman says the Shaefer family are connected with hers.\'a0 Genl Haynes \ul grandchildren\ulnone  will be connected with a good many families, who never dreamed of such an alliance.\'a0 If all his connections are as worthy & respectable as Mr. Elford & Mrs. Coleman, I will be glad.\'a0 Uncle Haynes death taking place at this time, has prevented our having an account of Mr. Sharpe from our friends.\'a0 I suppose they have not seen much of him , particularly about Aunt Eliza, whose opinion I would like to have heard.\'a0 She has such a good judgment.\'a0 Col. Bee says he is a fine young man.\'a0 I have just seen John.\'a0 He seemed pleased to hear of Thomas, says he was always a good boy.\'a0 I am quite well [and] so are the children.\'a0 Willy & Anna are remarkably well, & Frank begins to look better.\'a0 He is so affectionate.\'a0 He can say \ul Ma\ulnone , & is satisfied at night, if he is in my arms with his hand on my neck.\'a0 I must keep him as my bedfellow all winter.\'a0 Anna because she is in the bed with me, sleeps \ul soundly\ulnone  all night.\'a0 Willy will have to accommodate \ul you\ulnone  when you came back.\'a0 He says I must tell you he can read some stories without missing a \ul word\ulnone .\'a0 In their prayers, they beg that \ul Pa\ulnone  may come back \ul safe\ulnone \'a0 \ul home\ulnone ; sometimes Anna \ul forgets\ulnone  It & she comes back & says \'93I forgot to say , bring Pa safe home\'94, & then kneels down & says it.\'a0 Today Willy was pla\'85 her, & she said she was going to look for Pa\'92s horsewhip for me to whip him.\'a0 I think they are \ul all\ulnone  fine children, & if it were not for their playing so much with servants, I could easily manage them.\'a0 You must when you return have a fence made to separate the yards, so that the servants may play in one, & my children in the other.\'a0 So much associations with \ul servants\ulnone  only gives them \ul low\ulnone  \ul ideas\ulnone  & \ul habits\ulnone , which they will never be able to correct.\'a0 These early impressions are lasting, & having a small family & seeing no company, our children have not the advantage some others have. How disappointed Mr. Earle must be.\'a0 I am sorry for him, but he did not \ul need\ulnone  an office.\'a0 Mamma received a letter from Aunt Eliza Friday night, the \ul first\ulnone  she has received since Uncle Haynes death.\'a0 She says all of Mamma\'92s bonds are \ul separate\ulnone  in a little \ul tin\ulnone  \ul box\ulnone  made for the purpose last year, that Mr. Hayne seemed to think Mamma\'92s business very \ul simple\ulnone  to \ul manage\ulnone , & that \ul Alston\ulnone  \ul Hayne\ulnone , who has the \ul warm\ulnone  \ul heart\ulnone  & \ul noble\ulnone  \ul nature\ulnone  of his \ul father\ulnone , will do anything in the way of business for her, that [page torn] him in preference to her son Wm Ed[ward], who is a minor & has not a moment to spare.\'a0 She says Mamma must advise with \ul you\ulnone  & \ul you\ulnone  communicate with \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Martin\ulnone  in Columbia.\'a0 Mamma does not know anything that \ul she\ulnone  can do, & so leaves it to \ul you\ulnone , & if you find it not necessary\'a0 to go to town, you need not.\'a0 She mentions Uncle Haynes reason for going to Washington.\'a0 She says 2 years ago, Mr. Grayson the Collector, suggested to Mr. Hayne, that through the Southern delegation he should receive an appointment from the President in the Custom house; that Mr. Hayne would take no steps for the purpose, & therefore she herself wrote to Mr. Pickens who had always been a warm friend of the family, & to Mr. I[saac] E. Holmes, who had always been a particular friend of Uncle Wm & whose family she was intimate with.\'a0 Mr. Pickens made a personal application to the President, who said that the son of a Revolutionary Martyr, & the sister of one whose death had been a calamity to the common country, should \ul certainly\ulnone  be provided for, & that an office should be given him in the Custom house, but Uncle Hayne with his usual benevolence, was not so selfish as to deprive anyone of an office on his account, but thought a vacancy would soon occur as there were 3 \ul aged\ulnone  incumbents (one of them Uncle Perronneau).\'a0\'a0 In the simplicity of her heart, Aunt Eliza mentioned to Mr. Holmes the Presidents kindness.\'a0 She received a \ul glowing\ulnone  letter from him, promising to do \ul all\ulnone  he \ul could\ulnone  &c.\'a0 2 months ago, Mr. H\'85 died of Apoplexy, in the Custom house.\'a0 Mr. Hayne immediately walked round to Mr. Holmes, to know what measures to take & found he had gone to Washington.\'a0 The next day he heard for what purpose.\'a0 He was advised to go to Washington, & when he got there was overwhelmed with disappointment.\'a0 Mr. Tyler thought Mr. Hayne had been \ul provided\ulnone  \ul for\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Holmes represented to him that his \ul brother\ulnone  had been deprived of office by Genl Jackson, & leaving it to be \ul understood\ulnone , that it was for \ul that\ulnone  brother he wished the office, when it was for another.\'a0 Mr. Holmes \ul knew\ulnone  Mr. Hayne was waiting to receive the \ul first\ulnone  \ul vacant\ulnone  \ul office\ulnone , & hurried on before even the letter announcing Mr. H\'85s death was written.\'a0 Mr. Barnwell as soon as he heard of the death of Mr. H\'85 rode over from Georgetown to Washington to ask the appointment for Mr. Hayne, but arrived 2 hours after it had been given to Mr. Holmes.\'a0 The excitement disappointment &c. brought on what followed.\'a0 So far from Mr. Hayne having \ul lost\ulnone  his \ul mind\ulnone  as Mr. Pinckney told you.\'a0 Aunt Eliza says during his \ul whole\ulnone  \ul sickness\ulnone , he was \ul sensible\ulnone , \ul resigned\ulnone  \ul affectionate\ulnone , & spoke of \ul us\ulnone  all, particularly Ann, & \ul returned\ulnone  the pressure of her hands \ul almost\ulnone  to the \ul last\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Butler says Mr. Martin says he never witnessed such a death bed, that he was \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul composed\ulnone , looked at his watch, & mentioned the hour when he would die, he \ul fainted\ulnone , & when he recovered, he regretted his time had not come.\'a0 He had a \ul good\ulnone  \ul conscience\ulnone  & could well die peacefully.\'a0 Aunt Eliza says they will continue housekeeping, at any rate this year. I tell you \ul again\ulnone , do not \ul think\ulnone  of \ul home\ulnone , be \ul sociable\ulnone  & \ul affable\ulnone , throw off your \ul reserved\ulnone  \ul familiarity\ulnone , & then you will be \ul happy\ulnone  in Columbia.\'a0 You must enjoy home when you have established a reputation for yourself, for while you are enjoying yourself at home, it will \ul add\ulnone  to the \ul enjoyment\ulnone  to think that your country thinks well of you.\'a0 You have the elements of greatness & must be a great man.\'a0 If your Wednesday night letter says you have no objection to my leaving home, I will go Thursday 12

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again do I write to you at night, because tomorrow I will not have a moment to spare.\'a0 I am now \ul prepared\ulnone  to go to Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 I know in tomorrow nights letter, you will express no unwillingness that I should go, & now I have gone so far, I do not think I can turn back.\'a0 I have written to Pamela, that she may expect me Friday evening, though not \ul certainly\ulnone .\'a0 I have purchased materials to work you a pair of shoes.\'a0 I have bought a beautiful pattern to work them by, so I will be able to work them now, whenever you wish them.\'a0 Jim yesterday killed the hogs, & today he has been setting them up & salting & making the Sausage meat.\'a0 Tomorrow he will stuff the Sausages.\'a0 He killed seven hogs, but one of the hogs does not seem good,\'a0 It has white round spots or pimples all over it.\'a0 Jim says you have some sous you can kill if you wish it.\'a0 Today & yesterday have been the \ul coldest\ulnone  days we have had.\'a0 Miss Earle is married tonight.\'a0 Susan & myself preferred not going to so large a party, so soon after Uncle Haynes death.\'a0 \ul Mrs.\ulnone  \ul Sam\ulnone  \ul Earle\ulnone  was not invited.\'a0 \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Earle\ulnone  & \ul Mrs.\ulnone  \ul Earles\ulnone  \ul sons\ulnone  have had some difference; & on that account she was not invited; \ul her\ulnone  \ul sisters\ulnone  \ul child\ulnone , what a quarrelsome family they seem to be.\'a0 Mr. Lester came to see me this afternoon, to mention that he had left you well.\'a0 Robert Foster paid me a visit the other day.\'a0 I thought he must have come to borrow something, perhaps your horse & buggy, but he only came to pay a visit.\'a0 He says he is going to move to Pickens.\'a0 He says his mother wrote word all were well at Toogaloo [Tougaloo],\'a0What do you think I did this morning?\'a0 Why I had my \ul tooth\ulnone  \ul drawn\ulnone ?\'a0 You know how long it has worried me, & last night I do not think I slept an hour; & \ul fortunately\ulnone  it continued to ache this morning.\'a0 I say \ul fortunately\ulnone , for it was only \ul excessive\ulnone  \ul pain\ulnone  that could have given me \ul courage\ulnone  to have it drawn.\'a0 I sent for Mr. Buice before breakfast, & after taking an hour to dress himself as neatly as possible, he came.\'a0 At first he \ul frightened\ulnone  me, by saying he must be \ul candid\ulnone , & tell me that it was a very bad tooth, & might break in pulling. But I must let him cut the gum \ul deep\ulnone , that he might get a good hold, & then he would try & draw it out safely.\'a0 I said if there was any danger in it I would wait until \ul you\ulnone  came back, but he said no.\'a0 If it did break, he would try & break it \ul low\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone , so that the gum would close over it, & when the air was excluded, it would no longer ache.\'a0 So I summoned up all my courage & sat down.\'a0 He then cut the gum low, & that he said I bore \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 He then drew the tooth, & I did not even make an \ul exclamation\ulnone .\'a0 He said I was the bravest soldier he had seen for a long time.\'a0 It gave me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pain\ulnone , but not as \ul much\ulnone  as \ul I expected\ulnone , & I am really \ul thankful\ulnone  it came out so \ul safely\ulnone .\'a0 I think Mr. Buice must draw teeth \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 He did not give a \ul sudden\ulnone  \ul pull\ulnone , as I thought he would, but he took a \ul firm\ulnone  \ul hold\ulnone , then seemed to \ul loosen\ulnone  the tooth,\'a0 & then \ul draw\ulnone  it out.\'a0 I feel \ul happy\ulnone  tonight.\'a0 I would not pass such \ul another\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone  as the \ul last\ulnone , on any \ul account\ulnone .\'a0 I have another tooth which Mr. Buice says ought to come out, & which I myself know ought to.\'a0 Some day I will summon up courage & have that out too.\'a0 It \ul has\ulnone  ached me dreadfully, but it does not now.\'a0 Such teeth Mr. Buice says\'a0 (& I believe all do) injure the stomach & cause Dyspepsia .\'a0 I have four which he says plugging will save & some that need scraping. I would not have the tooth that was drawn this morning back again, for a thousand dollars, indeed for no sum whatever. Mr. Pinckney came to see me yesterday afternoon.\'a0 Mrs. Coleman has been, Miss Crittenden & Miss Skinner, Miss Pinckney, Mrs. & Miss Jones & Mrs. Duncan, when I was from home.\'a0 We have had a good deal of warm, rainy weather.\'a0 Mamma has written to Aunt Eliza to say, her business may be put in the hands of Alston Hayne, & he must act for her, as for his Mother.\'a0 I do not think there will be any necessity for you to go to town.\'a0 Ann is still very poorly.\'a0 Susan & Mamma came in today.\'a0 They are very kind to me.\'a0 Mamma not long ago gave me $6.50 to buy a Mantle, & she has lately given me a Shawl 5 dollars & a tippet 2 dollars.\'a0 I would like you to bring Susan & Ann a present, something that will cost \ul very\ulnone  \ul little\ulnone , for it is not the \ul value\ulnone  of a present they care for, but the \ul remembrance\ulnone .\'a0 You are \ul wrong\ulnone  to think you must not make a present, unless you can make a valuable one.\'a0 I think the merest trifle from a \ul friend\ulnone  acceptable.\'a0 I would be vexed if you bought them \ul handsome\ulnone  presents, for that you \ul cannot\ulnone  \ul afford\ulnone , but a little trifle, ornament for the table, Mantle peice, or \ul anything\ulnone  that will cost \ul little\ulnone , will do, merely to show them you \ul thought\ulnone  of them. I saw Mr. Thomas Cox the other day.\'a0 He said he supposed you were gaining new Laurels in Columbia.\'a0 I have to remain \ul silent\ulnone  when I hear the Hoar case mentioned.\'a0 I hope you will be able to explain your conduct \ul satisfactorily\ulnone .\'a0 As I have no letter of yours to answer, I have less to write about, than I otherwise would have.\'a0 I never saw the village quieter.\'a0 I am glad you are in Columbia, with something important to occupy you.\'a0 I hope you will act your part well, & increase your reputation.\'a0 I wonder you complain of having \ul nothing\ulnone  to write me.\'a0 It seems to me, you might write a \ul good\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone . The children are well.\'a0 They are all asleep upstairs.\'a0 The servants are doing well.\'a0 I have indeed \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 I will write you again on Thursday if \ul possible\ulnone  before I start.\'a0 There may be something in tomorrow nights Letter I may wish to answer.\'a0 I will write you as soon as I get to Mrs. Cunninghams, but as the Mails are irregular in that part of the country, you must not be uneasy.\'a0 I would like you to spend Christmas there.\'a0 Everybody seems to think it will be a pleasant trip for me.\'a0 I think the children will enjoy it, & it will improve them, & it will be so pleasant to come home again.\'a0 I was agreeably surprised that in your two last letters, you did not scold me, for expressing so much anxiety on the subject.\'a0 I opened them with \ul fear\ulnone  & \ul trembling\ulnone .\'a0 Your two sheet one, made me shed some tears, & lost me some sleep.\'a0 We will meet now in less than a fortnight, remain satisfied in Columbia, & do not \ul think\ulnone  of leaving until the Session is over.\'a0 When you return home you will be long enough there to get tired.\'a0 Joe Powell told Minerva one day at the kitchen window, that he had got a letter from you & you were quite well.\'a0 I hope you have had some friendly correspondence with him, such men it is better to be on good terms with.\'a0 They can injure you so much.\'a0 It was wrong in you at the first to make him your enemy, but I forget, I will not give you advice.\'a0 M\'85 Mauldin today brought Anna a little basket, & Oscar [Mauldin] brought Willy & Frank a tumbler.\'a0 Ever Yours, Liz\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your two letters, one by Mr. Burt, & one by the mail.\'a0 I wrote to you last night, but I write again tonight, so that you may hear Sunday night.\'a0 Tomorrow I will not have time to write you, before I leave.\'a0 I am glad you have expressed no objection to my going, for I am now \ul half\ulnone  \ul packed\ulnone  up.\'a0 I will be sorry the Legislature adjourns so soon, if it prevents your passing Christmas there .\'a0 It does not seem worthwhile to be at the trouble of preparing for such a journey, & to stay less than a fortnight.\'a0 I had thought the Legislature was to adjourn the 20
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  & that I would be away more than two weeks, & have made my preparations accordingly.\'a0 The children were so badly off for clothes, I have been obliged to buy at \ul once\ulnone , what I intended to get at \ul different\ulnone  \ul times\ulnone  during the \ul winter\ulnone .\'a0 The money you left me was not sufficient, so I have borrowed from Mamma, but for the remainder of the winter, I intend \ul really\ulnone  to spend little.\'a0 I have bought the children some thick clothes, to keep them warm, & which they ought to have. If it is only to save the washing.\'a0 I hope in consideration of my being such a good wife, having attended to everything so well during your absence, & having so few opportunities of recreating, that you will oblige me & pass Christmas at Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 It will be keeping you there only four or five days.\'a0 When we were there before,\'a0 I acknowledge I was \ul wrong\ulnone  to urge you, for you had asked leave of absence of the Legislature, to come \ul home\ulnone , this time is different.\'a0 But I will not say \ul any\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone  about it, for I believe the \ul less\ulnone  \ul anxiety\ulnone  I express to do a thing the \ul more\ulnone  \ul inclined\ulnone  you are I should \ul do\ulnone  it, & I promise you not to behave \ul badly\ulnone , but to be \ul reasonable\ulnone .\'a0 The reason I was so anxious to accept Mrs. Cunninghams invitation was, that I think it pleasant to have some place to visit for a little change, particularly pleasant for me, who have so little variety in Greenville, no changes whatever, not even one person with whom I am intimate, or can have heart intercourse with.\'a0 Mrs. Cunningham I really like.\'a0 They all seem such sincere friends of yours, that I cannot but have a regard for them.\'a0 It is a pleasant place I think to visit at, & if ever I accepted their invitation I might as well now.\'a0 Pamela\'92s asking me there, & I asking her \ul here\ulnone  are very different.\'a0 She must have company, without having them to stay at her house, but in Greenville there are plenty of boarding houses, where she can pass her time more pleasantly than with me, & I am a young housekeeper, & her mother an old one, with every convenience for seeing company.\'a0 However if I ought to ask her, I have no objection to doing it.\'a0 As regards passing Christmas there, do not be uneasy, I will leave you to follow the dictates of your \ul kind\ulnone  & \ul generous\ulnone  heart. I am so glad the hogs are killed, the meat is salted, the sausages stuffed, the lard dried\'a0 Mr. Goodlet[t] says he will return what Corn he borrowed, so there will be enough to last until after Christmas, without hauling any more.\'a0 Elisa during my absence, will iron a little, then make hers & her childrens clothes, & if she gets through with that, help Susan work.\'a0 Minerva\'a0 will wash first, then work for herself, milk, superintend ther churning, & clean the yard.\'a0 Edward will churn, go to the spring, & take care of the little dog.\'a0 Lindy will leave with Mamma, James will cut wood & attend to the animals.\'a0 Mrs. Walker must be very \ul incorrect\ulnone  like her \ul dearly\ulnone  \ul beloved\ulnone .\'a0 I have not heard a word of Scarlet fever, & dont believe her son had it.\'a0 I dare say Dr. R\'85 attended him, & thought he would gain credit by having recovered a patient of Scarlet fever, & therefore said it was that.\'a0I am \ul very\ulnone  \ul glad\ulnone  you have gained Mrs. Fields case, & some others.\'a0 I suppose there is a probability you will gain them when they are tried again. I am glad you have been performing your duty to your constituents.\'a0 I am also pleased you are complimented on your good looks.\'a0 I suppose you have followed \ul my\ulnone  \ul advice\ulnone , & now look less \ul venerable\ulnone  than you did when you left home.\'a0 I knew Mr. \ul Quirk\ulnone  had \ul agents\ulnone  in Columbia. I dare say in the letter that has not appeared in the Mountaineer, you said something you ought not to, & Mr. Wells thought it would injure you if published.\'a0 If he proves his regard in this way, I will really like him. I am [have] been so \ul busy \ulnone I have not been able to see Mrs. Mauldin, but several messages have passed between us, & she has been very kind (as I told you) in letting her children give Anna a basket, & Willy & Frank a little Tumbler apeice.\'a0 I like his store better than any in Greenville, & he this year has beautiful goods, & he is more \ul generous\ulnone  than any merchant here.\'a0 He this afternoon \ul gave\ulnone  me a box of \ul Leads\ulnone , but they are too \ul large\ulnone  for my pencil.\'a0 They may do for yours.\'a0 I cannot get \ul any\ulnone  to fit mine, & he gave me a box to keep a cup I bought for Willy in, & in other ways he is \ul generous\ulnone .\'a0 I would like to see Mr. McWillie.\'a0 He must be \ul handsome\ulnone  if he looks like Frank, my little darling.\'a0 Willy has really improved in his reading, & takes so much more interest in it, that I find it much easier to teach him. The weather [page torn] bright & clear, only a little too cold, but we will wrap up warm tomorrow.\'a0 Mr. Lester has drawn me a sketch of the road we must take.\'a0 I will set off on 1 oclock, & the next day \ul very\ulnone  \ul early\ulnone .\'a0Mr. Green, Mr. Lester\'92s uncle in law died this morning of Dropsy which he has had sometime.\'a0 Miss Earle was married last night.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney married her.\'a0 Neither she nor the groom knew anything of the Episcopal ceremony.\'a0 They did not know a \ul ring\ulnone  was necessary, so that part had to be \ul omitted\ulnone , & the parts the couple ought to repeat, Mr. Pinckney repeated for them, & they bowed their assent, & instead of being in \ul front\ulnone  of Mr. Pinckney, they were nearly at his \ul side\ulnone .\'a0 Miss Rinehart came to me this morning & told me about the wedding. I feel \ul thankful\ulnone  whenever I think of my tooth being drawn, that I will be no more troubled with \ul that\ulnone  at least. It is now near eleven oclock.\'a0 I have sat up till near eleven oclock every \ul other\ulnone  night, to write to you.\'a0 Do you not think I am a good wife & ought to be \ul indulged\ulnone  \ul sometimes\ulnone .\'a0 Do not be uneasy if you do not hear from me regularly.\'a0 I may be prevented from writing at Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 May you be blessed my dear husband & return & make your wife happy, Liz\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write you a few lines tonight, as I am more at leisure than I will be tomorrow, & though I have nothing to write you about, I will be performing the promise I made you at parting.\'a0 I am seated upstairs in the chamber, which I prefer, on account of being with the children.\'a0 Anna is asleep in my bed.\'a0 Frank is going to sleep in Delia\'92s lap, Lindy is standing at the fire, drying some clothes for Frank.\'a0 The doors are locked, & will be opened in case James brings letters & papers from the office which I dare say he will forget to go for. After you & my darling Willie went off in the stage, I slept soundly until morning.\'a0 When I awoke, & recollected that my dear little boy was gone. & that I would not see his sweet face all day, or for many days, I felt as if my heart would burst, & all day I could not think of him without weeping.\'a0 I grieved for him as if he had been lost to me forever.\'a0 I did not know I would have missed him so much.\'a0 When he comes back, I think I will love & value him more than ever.\'a0 Yesterday I congratulated myself on the pleasant day you had for traveling, but this morning when I found it was \ul sleeting\ulnone , I was \ul shocked\ulnone .\'a0 How cold you must have found it today, & if the sleet has reached to Columbia, I am afraid you will not be able to continue your journey safely & comfortably, & that you will have good weather during your stay there.\'a0 I am sure you will pass your time agreeably & Willie too you must make him enjoy himself.\'a0 I long to hear of him, how he behaves, & if you find no difficulty in dressing him.\'a0 You must write me words what his friends think of him.\'a0 I am sure if you do justice to him, & see that his clothes are all put on properly, & arranged as I do, when he is with us, they cannot but be pleased with him, & as regards character & disposition, which is the most important, I think he is uncommon.\'a0 He appears even sweeter to me, now [that] he has left me, than when he was with me.\'a0 I will love him better when he comes back.\'a0 Anna repeated several times yesterday, that she wished to see Willie.\'a0 In the morning when Frank woke, I asked him where Willie was, & he got up & looked towards Willie\'92s bed, & now whenever I ask where Papa & Willie are, he slaps me & makes a vexed noise, as if to tell me to \ul hush\ulnone  & not plague him.\'a0 Both Anna & himself I think give me rather less trouble than they did, though Anna teases Frank, almost as much as Willie teased her, but they are quieter, & I am able to pay more attention to two, than to three.\'a0 The weather being bad they have been constantly with me in the house, & I & they both feel the want of you to help caress them.\'a0 Anna constantly comes to me to take her in my lap, & as soon as she is seated, Frank comes & pulls her away, & takes her place, & then I am sure Anna misses you.\'a0 I tell her I held her when she was a baby, & now I must hold Frank while he is a baby.\'a0 They both sleep with me.\'a0 At night whenever Anna wakes, she says, \'93Ma put your hand on me\'94, she wishes to be certain I am near her.\'a0 Frank is quite well, you may tell our friends, that he is even handsomer than Will.\'a0 Anna\'92s colour is again returning.\'a0 You can give a pleasing account of her too, for I think she improves constantly, & is quite pretty, smart, & interesting.\'a0 I have nothing to write about so fill my letter with the children.\'a0 I have seen no one since you left, except Mr. Hendricks yesterday who brought some Corn.\'a0 I have received several messages from Mamma.\'a0 The bad weather prevented my going to church today.\'a0 I have been reading Do\'85\'92s Rise & Progress, one of the Evangelical Library, which I see consists of valuable works, which I intend to read through, & hope you will read some of them to me.\'a0I was yesterday looking over Miss Leslie\'92s House book, & reading about Carpets.\'a0 I observed she said, what I think \ul true\ulnone , that in buying a Carpet, the \ul quality\ulnone  ought to be considered as well as the \ul price\ulnone , & that a \ul cheap\ulnone  Carpet was often in the end the \ul dearest\ulnone .\'a0 This made me think of the Carpet you are to get, & I thought I would tell you, to get a Carpet of a \ul good\ulnone  \ul quality\ulnone , that will last a \ul long\ulnone  time, particularly for our dining room, which is used so much.\'a0 It will be cheaper in the end, than to buy a \ul cheap\ulnone  \ul thin\ulnone  one, which will last only a \ul short\ulnone  time, & have to be replaced again.\'a0 Miss Leslie also said, that a Carpet that is to be much used, should have no \ul white\ulnone  in it, for the white gets immediately soiled, & which gives the whole Carpet a shabby appearance.\'a0 This I think also true, & wish you to consider it, our Carpet.\'a0 I would like a \ul dark\ulnone  Carpet, & \ul bright\ulnone  colours, & \ul good\ulnone  \ul strong\ulnone  quality.\'a0 Our Entry carpet which we have had about a year only. I observe is \ul torn\ulnone  in several places already.\'a0 As soon as you have bought the Carpet, you must forward it to Greenville, that I may make it up, , as the present one is \ul threadbare\ulnone , & great holes in it.\'a0 If the Carpet was not a \ul large\ulnone  bundle, you might bring it up with you, though perhaps it would be dearer than by Hamburgh. I was looking at our Brown Sugar today, & see it will not be enough to last until Spring, so at the same time you are getting the few Groceries Mamma ordered, perhaps you had better get 60 pounds of Brown Sugar, at 6 cts which is the price at which we get it.\'a0 It would be $3.60 so much cheaper than in Greenville.\'a0 Perhaps you had also better get 3 loaves of Loaf Sugar, which would last until Spring.\'a0 3 loaves is what we get for the whole year, so 3 loaves would be sufficient, & cheaper than in Greenville. \'a012 \'bd cts is the price Porter has always asked. Since I commenced writing James has brought a letter containing a paper from Mark Lindsay, from Alabama, & the two Charleston papers.\'a0 The latest paper says it is thought Mr. Yancey & Clingman will certainly fight.\'a0 I suppose some papers tonight have brought definite news.\'a0 I see that your Presidential speech has been published in the Courier, as the Editor refers his readers to it.\'a0 I suppose it was published against his wishes.\'a0 I also am \ul sorry\ulnone  to see Mr. James Rhett is elected. I am sorry my dear husband to send you so uninteresting a letter, unless I have something particular to write about, I do not think I will write again, until I hear from you, so do not be uneasy if you do not hear.\'a0 Remember me to all of my friends, thank them for their kind remembrances to me & the children, & tell Aunt Harriett McCall , the children will value her quilt greatly, as I do now, & that I am having it quilted.\'a0 If she is in the country, & you do not see her, tell Aunt Martha or Aunt Anna Turnbull to tell her.\'a0 I am particular about it, as I believe she has never been thanked for it.\'a0 \ul Kiss Willie for me\ulnone , Lizzy\

Everything appears so much better when the sun is shining.\'a0 I hope the Judges will try your case, as soon as you are ready, & not disappoint you.\'a0 Anna says I must tell Willie, with her 25 cts to buy her a \ul Cradle\ulnone , large enough to put her baby in it.\'a0 You must write me everything.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday night & was \ul delighted\ulnone  to hear from you.\'a0 Your account of Willie was \ul very\ulnone  \ul interesting\ulnone , & pleased me \ul extremely\ulnone .\'a0 I \ul laughed\ulnone  at his \ul sayings\ulnone .\'a0 I was so anxious to hear how he was doing, & am \ul gratified\ulnone  he has behaved so well.\'a0 Susan & Mamma say they have always thought him an uncommon child in every respect.\'a0 I hope tonight to hear again.\'a0 I wish to know how Willie behaves in the \ul city\ulnone , & what his \ul friends\ulnone  think of him.\'a0 I am afraid you have bad weather.\'a0 It rained here yesterday afternoon, & all last night.\'a0 It is not raining now, but is very cloudy, & I suppose will rain again.\'a0 I have just been reading the Mountaineer.\'a0 Gov.Briggs message about the Hoar case is published, & Mr. Wells speaks very indignantly of the Abolitionists as interfering with us first in [one] way, then in another.\'a0 As you did not disapprove of Mr. Hoars mission, it does seem as if you side with the abolitionists, & indeed my dear husband I do think your judgement there was wrong, & I will always regret the part you took.\'a0 I think the Legislature was right in the course it took.\'a0 It was an uncommon case, & called for uncommon action.\'a0 If Mr. Hoar had been allowed quietly to remain, the Northerners would have been encouraged to go further.\'a0 On this account, it was right to send him away.\'a0 I am not satisfied with the peice you have written.\'a0 I do not think it vindicates your course.\'a0 To have avoided the appearance of evil, you should have acted differently.\'a0 I am afraid you will see trouble on account of it yet.\'a0 Your enemies can take hold of it against you.\'a0 However as you got yourself into trouble, I hope you will be able to get out without my help. I yesterday wrote to Pamela, & mentioned you would execute the commission for her.\'a0 I suppose she wrote directions, how the dress was to be dyed.\'a0 If you return by Augusta, in passing through Abbeville, you could send the dress to John Cunningham, who would send it to her, or if you return by Columbia, you can leave it at Laurens for her, but perhaps she has told you how to get it to her. A letter received by the last Mail from Mr. Bailey, making inquiries when you would be in town, & very anxious you should go down, or get someone to attend to the case for you.\'a0 A letter also came from Mr. Elijah Webb thanking you for your able speech on the Presidential Election, says it breathes a true republican spirit, that he believes the people will do right if left to themselves, that the election which has just come off is a fair illustration of it, that if his election had been control[l]ed by the dominant party of the state, & a few aristocrats about Anderson & Pendleton, he would have been turned out of office after all the pains he had taken to make the people a faithful public officer.\'a0 He hopes your speech will find its way to every house in S. Carolina.\'a0 The letter you received from Mr. Gantt the night you left, I hope you have answered, as he seemed so anxious to have his difficulty solved immediately.\'a0 A Museum has arrived.\'a0 Another year I would like to take the \ul Lady\'92s\ulnone  \ul book\ulnone .\'a0 It has such beautiful pictures in it.\'a0 Mrs. Coleman has stopped taking it, so now I have no chance of seeing the pictures. I have not been out since you left.\'a0 The walking is very bad.\'a0 Susan has been in to see me.\'a0 Miss Goodlett & Miss Long have paid me a visit, & Miss Williford & Miss Service.\'a0 Mrs. Pemble lives only a few steps from the Charleston Hotel, in Hasell st, so you must carry Willie to see her, if only for a few minutes.\'a0 They would be pleased if you did.\'a0 Miss Margaret said you must.\'a0 Uncle Joseph lives so \ul out\ulnone  of \ul society\ulnone , that I am certain he will not call to see you, but through Aunt Anna Turnbull, Willie could see him.\'a0 Aunt Anna would carry Willie, or invite uncle Joseph to her house.\'a0 Though he has \ul thrown\ulnone  \ul himself\ulnone  \ul away\ulnone , he has \ul strong\ulnone  \ul feelings\ulnone , & would be gratified to see his little nephew. There are some things I am afraid you will forget, so will remind you again.\'a0 One is to inquire the prices of \ul carri[a]ges\ulnone  for Mamma, & put the prices on \ul paper\ulnone , so you will not forget.\'a0 I am under the impression that carri[a]ges are much cheaper in town, & handsomer than in Greenville, & there of course they have the \ul latest\ulnone  \ul fashions\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Cox I think is exorbitant, & after all our carri[a]ge was not made so well, for it is now at the shop repairing.\'a0 Jim says the springs at first were too slender.\'a0 I am satisfied with our carri[a]ge, but I am willing Mamma should get a better bargain.\'a0 You must price different ones.\'a0 Another \ul important\ulnone  thing you must not forget is to look for a place for Minerva.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson & Coleman, had women with Mrs. Lee or Johnson, the latter I believe keeps Jones.\'a0 Lee it is said keeps the best table in town, so that would be a good place for Minerva to learn cooking.\'a0 I never could spare Minerva better than now.\'a0 Her children are old enough to do without her.\'a0 Delia can sleep in the room & take care of them.\'a0 She can wash & iron, & Eliza cook.\'a0 The terms are, that for the servants \ul services\ulnone , she is taught to cook.\'a0 Minerva is capable of being a good cook, if she was only taught.\'a0 A mistress can read the \ul receipts\ulnone  for making things, but cannot direct the baking, boiling, mixing &c which is the most important part.\'a0 Minerva could go down as soon as you return, & come back in the Spring.\'a0 The expense incurred would be well repaid by having a good cook. I have been planting orange seed.\'a0 I have planted a row on each side of the walk from the steps to the gate, & am not planting all round the fence.\'a0 James & Delia are doing it, directed by me.\'a0 Whenever I commence such improvements I am discouraged, from the difficulty I find in getting what I wish done.\'a0 Jim will \ul commence\ulnone , & suddenly when my back is turned, go off, & I can[not] get him again.\'a0 Then I call James, & while I am attending to something else he will disappear, & lastly I give up in despair.\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  will have to improve your \ul lot\ulnone , & I attend to the \ul house\ulnone .\'a0 I am anxious to have some orange trees, that I hope you will persevere, if I am obliged to give up.\'a0 Jim has been working at the farm.\'a0 It is only before he gets his breakfast, I ask him to help me.\'a0 I have been told the lower country orange seed, take better than the upper.\'a0 If you were to be in the way of getting any, now you are in town, you must bring me some.\'a0 You must buy some Mango seeds, which makes such nice Pickles. I have \ul no\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone  to tell you.\'a0 We are all well, at Mamma\'92s the same as when you left.\'a0 Corn has been brought several times.\'a0 I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0 Tell Willie he must behave so well, that his friends will love him, & then he can go & see them again.\'a0 I may write to you once more, if you remain as long as you expected, but if you do not hear you may not be uneasy.\'a0 Kiss Willie for me, & tell him I long to see him.\'a0 Remember me to my friends, Lizzy\

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was so disappointed at not hearing from you last night.\'a0 I could hardly believe James, when he told me he had no letter.\'a0 However the disappointment was made up, by reading one from Aunt Eliza, Mamma received last night.\'a0 I was \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul delighted\ulnone  at her account of Will.\'a0 She seems \ul enraptured\ulnone  with him.\'a0 She says \'93had not thought to \ul know \ulnone such \ul pure & lively\ulnone  joy again on Earth as she felt at the sight of him\'94, that he is indeed a \ul lovely\ulnone  boy, that Sue has carried him to see some of his friends, & \ul all\ulnone  received him most \ul affectionately\ulnone , that Aunt Brewton was \ul touched \ulnone even at the sight of him.\'a0 I suppose it recalled to her mind his Baptism, the last Sunday she was ever at church with Uncle Robert.\'a0 Sue says Aunt Anna & Martha were \ul overjoyed\ulnone .\'a0 She did not \ul know\ulnone  they would be so \ul glad\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Irvine Keith\'a0 met him, & was delighted to see him, & wanted to claim him too.\'a0 Mrs. Deas a friend of Mamma\'92s called to see Aunt Eliza; and when she told him Willie had been to deliver letters of \ul introduction\ulnone , she said. \'93\ul nature\ulnone  had furnished him with the \ul best\ulnone  in his \ul countenance\ulnone .[\'93]\'a0 Aunt Eliza says Sue\'a0 is perfectly happy playing with Willie.\'a0 She really seems to \ul love\ulnone  him, & I cannot tell you how \ul much\ulnone  \ul gratified \ulnone I am at his reception.\'a0 Aunt Eliza begs, that I will let him stay with her, until I make my visit in the Spring, that he will then have time to \ul know \ulnone & be \ul known \ulnone to his friends, & it would be quite a \ul charity \ulnone to \ul her\ulnone .\'a0 My dear husband, I would have \ul no\ulnone  \ul objection\ulnone  to let Willie remain.\'a0 Though I miss him \ul sadly\ulnone , I am willing to part with him for the sake of the benefit he would derive, from intercourse with his friends.\'a0 It may improve his character, his disposition, his manners; the good impression made on him would be lasting & of benefit to him for Life.\'a0 In Greenville, he is always at \ul home\ulnone , associating with \ul servants\ulnone , & no \ul social \ulnone intercourse at all.\'a0 Aunt Eliza brings up children \ul so\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , I would commit Willie to her care with \ul perfect confidence\ulnone .\'a0 However this is just as you think.\'a0 In the Spring if I do not go down, you can carry him again to see his friends, when you go to Columbia, but I hope I will be able to go in the Spring. Aunt Eliza says you were kind & friendly.\'a0 You must go & see her the night before you leave, thank her for her kindness to Willie, & tell her if she goes to Edgefield she must come & see us, & offer your services if ever you can be of use to her.\'a0 She says she would like Wm Ed[ward] her son to make your \ul acquaintance\ulnone  & secure an \ul interest \ulnone in your \ul feelings\ulnone .\'a0 She says she would \ul gladly \ulnone have invited \ul you\ulnone  to \ul stay \ulnone with her, but they were in daily expectation of Dr. & Mrs. Thomas.\'a0 Mr. Martin was with them, & I believe Judge Butler also.\'a0 I hope you have been to see \ul all \ulnone the \ul family \ulnone & been kind & \ul sociable \ulnone in your manners, & made a \ul good\ulnone  \ul impression \ulnone on them.\'a0 I am anxious they should think \ul well \ulnone of \ul my\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone .\'a0 If I can I will write to Aunt Eliza by the same Mail that carries your letter, but I may not have time.\'a0 This is the \ul last \ulnone letter I will write you if you leave Friday the 31
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super st
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  as you intended.\'a0 I have \ul nothing \ulnone to write about.\'a0 The children & myself are quite well.\'a0 Mamma has been unwell.\'a0 Ann is the same as when you left. Aunt Eliza said she wishes I could have seen Willie as he was feeding the pigeons, & \ul gazing \ulnone in astonishment at the Chimney sweeper who was performing his office, that the Canary bird & everything delighted him so that his sense of bashfulness gave way to wonder & pleasure, & that he sallied forth as trustingly with Sue, to deliver his letters of introduction, as if he had always lived with her.\'a0 She says she was not prepared to see so \ul lively \ulnone a child, but she is \ul rejoiced \ulnone at it, that his motions are \ul lively\ulnone  & \ul free\ulnone , \'93best befits the \ul mountain\ulnone  boy.\'94\'a0 Aunt Eliza says Willie \ul knew \ulnone them \ul all\ulnone , & he asked to see the room where I was \ul born\ulnone .\'a0 You recollect I told you to see the \ul house \ulnone where I was born.\'a0 He said he would stay with them \ul every\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone , but must \ul go \ulnone to \ul sleep\ulnone  with \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 The whole letter is about \ul Willie\ulnone , & the most \ul interesting\ulnone  I ever read. Aunt McCall\'92s thought at first Willie looked like his \ul Grandfather\ulnone  \ul McCall\ulnone , but after a time, said he resembled \ul both\ulnone  \ul parents\ulnone  & several\'85on each side.\'a0 I knew my friends would be \ul glad \ulnone to see him, but they have expressed \ul even\ulnone  \ul more \ulnone pleasure than I expected.\'a0 From Aunt Eliza\'92s account they seem to have the \ul sincerest\ulnone  \ul love \ulnone for him already.\'a0 She says each kind Aunt he went to see wished to \ul keep \ulnone him.\'a0 She could hardly get leave to bring him back, & Anna Turnbull thought she had quite an advantage over them, in the opportunity of being acquainted with him.\'a0 Willie made his \ul mark \ulnone in the letter for \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 Tell him it was made \ul beautifully\ulnone  & \ul delighted\ulnone  me.\'a0 Delia & Edward say I must tell him Howdys, & Anna\'92s toy he must not forget.\'a0 Anna tells everyone, he has gone to town to buy her a toy.\'a0 I do indeed long to see my darling boy, & hear tell all the wonders he has seen.\'a0 Today is \ul clearing\ulnone .\'a0 You have had much better weather than I anticipated you would have.\'a0 I suppose you will be back Sunday night, but I certainly expect to hear from you before you return.\'a0\'a0\'a0 You must not forget to buy the carpet.\'a0 The present one is not decent.\'a0 Susan begged me yesterday to tell you to inquire about the carri[a]ges.\'a0 Mr. Cox you know said he would not build them one for less than \ul 350 \ulnone dollars.\'a0 Mrs. Stone says Tom Butlers brother bought a handsome one for \ul 275 \ulnone & Col. Lynah\'92s Mrs. Coleman says was only \ul 245 \ulnone & Mrs. Tom Lowndes was \ul 245\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Cox I dare say was \ul exaggerated \ulnone when he said Mr. Lowndes was \ul 375\ulnone .\'a0 Your affectionate wife, Lizzy You must execute all my commissions.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As I \ul promised\ulnone , I must write, but I am so busy I can hardly spare the time.\'a0 The whole family are well, except Minerva who is today sick in bed, with cold & pain in her stomach.\'a0 I have given her castor oil & Ginger tea.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon we had a delightful rain, & this morning Jim & James planted out cabbages & Tomatoes, & replanted seeds.\'a0 They have now gone to the farm, to make the Potato hills.\'a0 I have rode out once only since you left, Sunday afternoon.\'a0 The afternoons are generally so doubtful, that I am afraid to venture the carri[a]ge, not myself.\'a0 I am well enough to do a good days work.\'a0 I yesterday made a frock for Minerva, & a pr of pantaloons for James.\'a0 You may know how much work I must have, to require me to work so steadily & imagine how inconvenient it must be to me to write.\'a0 Monday, Jim carried wood to the Saw Mill.\'a0 Tuesday he hauled rock from Mr. Pikes.\'a0 He would have hauled the remainder today\'a0 if he had not been obliged to stop to plant.\'a0 Mr. Pike sent word, the rock was finished, & was in his way, that he would like it sent for.\'a0 The Miss Willifords, & Mrs. Perry Duncan have been to see me.\'a0 The latter heard I had been sick, & came to inquire after me.\'a0 I miss you \ul greatly\ulnone .\'a0 I often go in the drawing room with the children & look at your picture, which as it bears \ul resemblance\ulnone  to \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I regret it does not look \ul more\ulnone  like you.\'a0 I ask Frank where Papa is, he points to the picture & wishes to shake hands with it.\'a0 \ul When\ulnone  I go to town, if there is a \ul good\ulnone  artist there I \ul must\ulnone  have my likeness taken, for I am sure as long as it was in your possession, you could not forget me, even if I was \ul gone\ulnone , & you had so far forgotten me, as to have taken to yourself \ul another\ulnone  in my place.\'a0 I would like it to be hung up somewhere, to recall to your mind now & then some of the happy days we have passed together, particularly our first wedded ones, but most especially would I wish it for the children.\'a0 I am sure as long as I have your picture before me, I could not forget you, or love anyone in your place, , or even if I were (impossible)\'a0 to love another, I would still love that picture, imperfect as it is.\'a0 Willy, the morning after you left when he woke up & found you \ul gone\ulnone , said \ul bitterly\ulnone , I told him you kissed him & bid him good bye, he said, you did not.\'a0 He seems really attached to you, & I think it would improve him to be more with you.\'a0 I hope his \ul wish\ulnone  to \ul be\ulnone  like you, will \ul make\ulnone  him like you.\'a0 He last night took off his \'85coat & shirt in the way Pa took his off.\'a0 I think our children would be much better if they did not associate so much with \ul young\ulnone  \ul servants\ulnone .\'a0 Our servants are too young to know how to behave themselves, or care to teach their children how to behave.\'a0 Old servants would injure them much less.\'a0 They would not be so trifling, or teach them so many bad things, but on the contrary assist in making them behave properly.\'a0 However I do not complain, we are obliged to have servants, but I am sorry associating with them is so injurious, & I wish them to make companions of them as little as possible.\'a0 My worriments \ul now\ulnone , are not \ul servants\ulnone , but \ul War\ulnone  & my \ul box\ulnone .\'a0 I hope if Mr. Earle has gone to town you have requested him to bring it to Columbia.\'a0 If you can you must convey a message to Mr. Thompson\'85to beg him to send it to you by some opportunity, only one days journey from Charleston to Columbia.\'a0 It certainly could get there safely.\'a0 Last year you recollect writing to you at this time my theme was \ul Texas\ulnone  & the \ul election\ulnone .\'a0 I feel much happier now for I am in hopes we will have no War, & that you will bring my box & what I wished then for you, you have attained. I have bought no flour, all the \ul good\ulnone  flour like \ul ours\ulnone  was sold.\'a0 Mr. Roberts had some \ul not\ulnone  so \ul good\ulnone , but which I did not get, as Mamma could not have made eatable bread out of it, Hardly can with my good Flour.\'a0 It is so \ul scarce\ulnone  I have been obliged to lend Mamma half of my barrel.\'a0 When we send for Groceries,\'a0 I expect we will have to send for Flour.\'a0 Mamma\'92s Groceries a few she sent for arrived last week, were only 5 days on the road.\'a0 That is the quickest way of getting anything from town. You have my list of purchases, so I need not mention them again.\'a0 In all probability you will not see Sarah Taylor, but if you were to tell her I ask her to send me some patterns of her childrens clothes, that I may see the \ul fashions\ulnone .\'a0 She has sent me patterns before, & I know she would have pretty ones.\'a0 Willy has outgrown his last years clothes, & I will have to make him a \ul few\ulnone  for \ul dress\ulnone . No one has come to the house to inquire for you, & no letters came last Sundays mail.\'a0 Mr. Simpson sent you a large package of public documents.\'a0 My pen, paper, & ink are so bad I take no pleasure in writing.\'a0 I sent to your office for paper but there was none, & I thought it not worthwhile to buy for one letter, for I do not expect to write again.\'a0 Margaret will be here today & tomorrow.\'a0 I have a great deal of work on hand, particularly servants clothes, which I wish to do during your absence, that on your return I may have more time to devote to you, so if you do not hear again, you must not be uneasy.\'a0 You must if you get summer clothes, buy pretty ones.\'a0 Take care of yourself, & as the children say in their prayers, come back safe home. I have told Willy he may carry my letter to the office, and Frank who is near me, says in \ul his\ulnone  \ul language\ulnone , that he wishes to go too.\'a0 Anna is asleep.\'a0\'a0 She has called to me while writing to put her to sleep, & as I did not notice her, she lay down on the bed & went to sleep.\'a0 Willy went to the Sunday school last Sunday.\'a0 He was anxious to go, so I thought I would let him try it.\'a0 He was very much pleased.\'a0 Anna\'92s hand is almost well.\'a0 A poultice took out the inflammation.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you.\'a0 I am so glad you wrote, for it is such a disappointment when I do not hear, more so to me than to you, for \ul without\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  I am \ul lonely\ulnone , & a letter from you, even a few lines is a treat.\'a0 If you were not so \ul very\ulnone  \ul busy\ulnone  I would write oftener, when you know how \ul much\ulnone  \ul work\ulnone  I have on hand, you will see I have not the time.\'a0 I write tonight, because I am more at leisure than I will be tomorrow.\'a0 I will tell you the work I have to do at once a dress for Minerva, Delia, Mary, Lindy & Clara each; Pantaloons for Jim & James; Shirts also & aprons for them; Night\'a0 dresses, Chemise, Petticoats, Nightcaps, Aprons & Collars for myself.\'a0 Shoes for you & clothes for the children, & more besides; now have I a \ul moment\ulnone  to \ul spare\ulnone . Mamma is very glad to hear Uncle Arthur will pay her a visit.\'a0 From Aunt Elizabeths letter, she was in hopes he would.\'a0 I dare say he will come during your absence.\'a0 I am \ul sorry\ulnone , as I would like you to have seen him, & he you.\'a0 It is a pity the arrangement of the Court was changed so as to bring the lower country Lawyers to Columbia.\'a0 You were not formerly \ul delayed\ulnone  in your business as you now are, & it is so \ul expensive\ulnone  to remain so long a time in Columbia, particularly when you are doing nothing.\'a0 You must in the Legislature next winter propose altering it, & having it as it formerly was. Mr. Butler went Friday night to Columbia.\'a0 He sent me word that he would take a letter but Margaret was with me, so I could not write.\'a0 I wonder why he goes down.\'a0 Mrs. Stone says on business connected with the Commissioners office.\'a0 You say you have engaged a suit of clothes.\'a0 I suppose they are a \ul dress\ulnone  \ul suit\ulnone .\'a0 If they are, you ought to get another suit for every day, as you so much need them.\'a0 Nice clothes are needed for the week, as much as on Sunday.\'a0 I hope you have bought us \ul pretty\ulnone  beads.\'a0 I suppose they are different from mine, as you got a set for me.\'a0 Willy says you must bring him something \ul pretty\ulnone , that he will not tell you \ul what\ulnone , because perhaps you will get something \ul prettier\ulnone  than he would tell you.\'a0 If there are any horses such as you saw in Charleston, & are suitable for a boy of \ul his\ulnone  \ul size\ulnone , & do not \ul cost\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , you might think of one of those for him, but I expect there are none of the kind there, you mentioned seeing in Charleston, & if they are, now when we wish to \ul save\ulnone , it would be extravagant to get it.\'a0 The \ul Valocipedes\ulnone  I do not like \ul at\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 I wish Columbia was as good & economical a place for shopping as Charleston.\'a0 There are several things I would like you to get for me.\'a0 I am very glad when you do buy pretty things, that they should be such as will do to put in the Drawing room, & add to the beauty of the room. You must tell Mr. Barclay if he is coming to Greenville \ul only\ulnone  for the purpose of taking \ul my\ulnone  \ul likeness\ulnone , he may stay away, if he did not succeed to my satisfaction in \ul yours\ulnone , he will certainly not in \ul mine\ulnone .\'a0 I wish mine taken, but it shall be by one, who I am \ul confident\ulnone  will \ul not\ulnone  \ul fail\ulnone .\'a0 Yours to the generality of people would be a striking likeness, but \ul I\ulnone  see it is \ul far\ulnone  from being \ul correct\ulnone , though your features are large, they are \ul delicately\ulnone  formed, your nose is \ul thin\ulnone , your lips are thin,, & you have no double chin, & full cheeks which Mr. Barclay has given you along with a \ul Roman\ulnone  \ul nose\ulnone , & \ul puffed\ulnone  up \ul lips\ulnone .\'a0 It always looks to me like Mr. Henry & Col. Brockman than you.\'a0 If the Daguerreotype painter that Mr. Summer mentioned in his paper, is still in \ul Columbia\ulnone , do you have your likeness taken, in the \ul prettiest\ulnone  way that he takes them.\'a0 If you wish to bring me a \ul valuable\ulnone  present, & one that will please me above everything else, bring me your miniature.\'a0 I wish to \ul own\ulnone  an \ul exact\ulnone  likeness of yourself, & taken as Mr. Summer described, it was far superior to all Daguerreotypes we have ever seen & must certainly give an exact likeness, so if the Dr I think he was a Doctor is still in Columbia, \ul gratify\ulnone  me & bring me what I so much wish, a \ul faithful\ulnone  \ul likeness\ulnone  of yourself to comfort me during your many absences.\'a0 This is if the likenesses taken are \ul really\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone .\'a0 The paper mentioned the price was reasonable. Mrs. Chick is dead.\'a0 She & Dr. Chick have been at the Springs since last summer..\'a0 She was quite well & went into the garden after the rain & was walking about, & she fell down.\'a0 She cried for help. & when someone went to her, one side of her body was paralyzed.\'a0 When she was carried into the house, the other side became affected.\'a0 After that I think it was the last consciousness, & after remaining so for a time & suffering greatly, died. You say I must tell you how everything goes on.\'a0 I am sorry to tell you that \ul faithful\ulnone  \ul Bob\ulnone  is not well.\'a0 Yesterday morning Jim came in & said Mr. Longs Dudley said Bob & Buck were taking the Distemper.\'a0 I told him to go ask Mr. Hoke to come & see them.\'a0 Mr. Hoke came & said they had \ul not\ulnone  the Distemper, that they were injured by James riding them so \ul hard\ulnone  to water, their filling their stomachs with water, & then being rode \ul hard\ulnone  back again, that if \ul that\ulnone  was continued, you would never have horses, or they would be of no account if you had, that he had often spoken [page torn] about [page torn] he said also their food was \ul too\ulnone  \ul dry\ulnone , that their fodder must be [page torn] in salt & water, & they would then improve.\'a0 Today Buck who was the \ul least\ulnone  \ul sick\ulnone  seems quite well, & Bob is \ul better\ulnone , & will soon I suppose [be] watered & fed properly [&] be \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 I suppose when James \ul kills\ulnone  a pr pf horses for you, you will think it time to part with him.\'a0 Mr. Westfield, Mr. Cauble, & I expect many others have spoken to him about his manner of riding.\'a0 If you cannot make him \ul obey\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone , it is high time to \ul sell\ulnone  him.\'a0 The other evening, a horse galloped by so \ul fast\ulnone  I thought & Will too that it was running away.\'a0 I looked & it was James on Skylark.\'a0 You need not be uneasy about them now, for this warning for the \ul present\ulnone  at \ul least\ulnone , will make him more careful. \ul Troubles\ulnone  I expect to have as long as the \ul Goddess\ulnone  of \ul Wisdom\ulnone  presides over my kitchen.\'a0 For several days she was sick, so I have not been troubled as much as usual.\'a0 This morning however she did something to provoke me, so when she came in to take out dinner, I told her not to do so again, & told her I hoped she would do better, that if she did not behave differently from what she had done, we would not keep her.\'a0 Instead of saying, she would \ul try\ulnone  & do \ul better\ulnone , she said she had done nothing wrong, \{&] if I was not pleased with her, she would \ul rather\ulnone  be sold, [&] if I would only let her have her two children, that she had never been so unhappy as since she had been in this yard, that she had \ul scars\ulnone  on her now, given her by \ul you\ulnone  &c. &c.\'a0 The other morning Charlotte was walking round the garden, & would stop & pull something.\'a0 I sent Edward to bring her out.\'a0 I was in the piazza , & Minerva came to the kitchen door, & before me called to Edward to leave Charlotte alone, that she had feet of her own to walk out of the garden with.\'a0 I do not tell you these things to worry you, for I have not been worried.\'a0 I am contented, as you say you will part with her, & get another if she does not do better.\'a0 I am going to \ul try\ulnone  & get along as \ul easy\ulnone  as possible, & not worry myself & scold the servants as little as possible.\'a0 Still I do not think everything should be put up with.\'a0 Margaret the other day observed the behaviour of some of them & said to me, if you let your servants go on so, they will soon walk over you.\'a0 I did not mean to say so much about them.\'a0 I went to church twice today.\'a0 The children & myself are well.\'a0 Ann says if Lemons are not \ul dear\ulnone , she would like you to bring her a few.\'a0 No letters came for you tonight.\'a0 If money is \ul scarce\ulnone  bring only a \ul trifling\ulnone  present for Will.\'a0 I am glad you bought perfumery.\'a0 Write me as often as you can.\'a0 I will write every other mail, if am not \ul busy\ulnone .\'a0 It is now past 9.\'a0 The children are asleep.\'a0 Mamma\'92s horse is dreadfully hurt, the hip either out of place, or fractured, can hardly walk.\'a0 Bob I think will soon be well.\'a0 Goodnight, E.F.P. I received a letter from Pamela last Mail, do not think I am worried about servants & hope Minerva will do better.\'a0 I am worried about \ul War\ulnone .\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I met Genl Thompson on the road yesterday as I was walking to Mamma\'92s, & he asked me what message he should give you at Pickens, if he should say we were all well.\'a0 I told him perhaps I would write a few lines, & he said he would call for them tomorrow.\'a0 The children are gone up to bed, & instead of passing the evening, reading or working, I will converse with you, & you must promise not to \ul scold\ulnone  me \ul once\ulnone .\'a0Sunday morning Susan & myself went to church.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney preached on the subject of building a new church.\'a0 He gave all the reasons why it was \ul necessary\ulnone , & answered \ul all\ulnone  \ul objections\ulnone  that \ul could\ulnone  be made against it.\'a0 The sermon was so satisfactory, that many who objected before are reconciled now.\'a0 He regretted you were not there to hear it.\'a0 The reasons in favour are too many for me to mention in a letter.\'a0 I will let you know them all when you return.\'a0 I will only inform you of a few now. It is a \ul fact\ulnone  that the sleepers under the floor are decaying, some have already given way, & that part of the church would have to be repaired at an expense of several hundred dollars,\'a0 The church would not be enlarged for cutting away the wall, would make it unsafe.\'a0 More pews are needed, for persons have applied for pews, & not been able to obtain them.\'a0 The Society in Charleston which has given one half of the salary to our Minister, been assisting for 20 years & in that time given 5000 dollars has informed the Vestry, that it must now withdraw its assistance, appropriate it to build up other churches.\'a0 This year they have decreased the sum one fourth, & will continue gradually to lessen it, until they stop entirely. The support of the Minister will then devolve on 30 pew holders, & they will consequently have to pay more than they do at present.\'a0 It is therefore important that there should be more pews, so that the support of the Minister, should fall upon many.\'a0 This last I think the strongest reason, but there are others too numerous to mention.\'a0 Yesterday Mr. Pinckney, Mr. Cox, Dr. Irvine went about obtaining subscriptions, & Mr. Sutter, Mr. Bee\'85himself among the young men.\'a0 Persons have been uncommonly liberal even those badly off have given.\'a0 1600 dollars have been subscribed.\'a0 The work goes on prosperously.\'a0 I have heard of but one person who objected to it, the bearer of this letter, but he does not know the motives for undertaking it, neither do \ul you\ulnone , so you must not say anything against it.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney came to me for your subscription, thinking you had told me how much you would give.\'a0 I told him you had not said what \ul sum\ulnone , but that you would give \ul something\ulnone , & if he thought it not proper in me, & not taking too great a liberty with you, I would put down for you what I thought you would be willing to give.\'a0 He said yes certainly I must put it down, so I \ul did\ulnone , & he said it was the sum all expected from you.\'a0 It was however on the condition that you were not \ul bound\ulnone  to \ul pay\ulnone  it, as it was done without your \ul knowledge\ulnone .\'a0 He said there was no danger of that, that you were a gentleman of \ul taste\ulnone , & would contribute towards raising a beautiful building, such an ornament to the village, even if you had no higher motive.\'a0 I am afraid you may be displeased at what I have done, & I have been rather uneasy at my boldness, but Mrs. Poinsett this afternoon said I was perfectly right, & she would have done the same.\'a0 The money is not to be paid for some time, & I intend to \ul save\ulnone  out of the 5 dollars you allow me every week, so when the time comes to pay the money I will be able to assist you.\'a0 You have no curiosity so you will not care to know, how much I subscribed for you until you come home.\'a0 I have dwelt so long on the church, I will not be able to tell you all I had to say on other matters.\'a0 Sunday morning stupid James sat down by one of the horses in the stable.\'a0 I rather think \ul under\ulnone  it, & had a finger mashed by the horses foot, so that the nail has or will come off.\'a0 I suppose he was asleep.\'a0 I almost thought he must have done it on purpose to keep from working.\'a0 I was afraid he would not be able to plough, but from Jims not asking for Mary today, who I told him he might have, I suppose he has been able to.\'a0 John drove the horses Sunday quite well.\'a0 Jim came home early Monday morning in a good humour.\'a0 Perhaps it will be better for his wife to live at the farm.\'a0 It will be a treat to him to go to see her, & he will be grateful to you for allowing him the privilege.\'a0 Yesterday I paid 6 visits.\'a0 Mrs. Irvine, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Dubose, Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Wm Roberts, & Miss Crittenden.\'a0 In the afternoon I walked to Mamma\'92s with the children, & Susan came back with me part of the way.\'a0 This morning I paid 6 more to Miss Lynah, Mrs. Mauldin, Mrs. Wells, Mrs. Theodore Thompson, Mrs. Bradshaw, & Mrs. Baker.\'a0 I was congratulating myself at the prospect of \ul getting\ulnone  \ul through\ulnone  & lo! 3 have been returned alteady.\'a0 One I paid yesterday was returned today, Miss Crawford.\'a0 Col. Lynah this morning inquired after you.\'a0 I told him you were away, & you would have gone over with me to see him.\'a0 I thought I might say so without \ul fibbing\ulnone , for of course after his coming to your house last summer, you would call to see him this.\'a0 They left Mr. Roper at the point of death with country fever, & Mrs. Andrew Turnbull with the inflammation of the Bowels.\'a0 You saw her at Aunt Turnbulls & was pleased with her.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett called this afternoon & were quite pleasant.\'a0 I like them so much.\'a0 Nobody knows there is Court at Anderson.\'a0 I don\'92t believe the Lawyers wives (with a few exceptions.)\'a0 Minerva I let go to Mamma\'92s today, to make another trial at cooking, & will continue to do so, until you return.\'a0 I suppose tonight you are at Pendleton.\'a0 I have scarcely room to inquire after my little Willie.\'a0 Tell him I hope he has been a good boy & given you no trouble; that Mrs. Mauldin thinks of naming her baby Willie or Frank, & little Mary says she must name it \ul Willie\ulnone  \ul Perry\ulnone .\'a0 Anna & Frank went to see it this afternoon.\'a0 I \ul kissed\ulnone  it this morning, & Mrs. Mauldin said I was the first person who had, that it was so ugly no one would.\'a0 It is a large child, weighed 11 pounds when it was born.\'a0 Tell Willie the kitten is very playful, that his chicken is well & takes care of Anna\'92s chicken.\'a0 They are always together & seem so fond of each other.\'a0 Frank begins to talk.\'a0 He is so smart & interesting.\'a0 Sunday he was at the window & John passed on horseback towards the stable.\'a0 Anna said there goes Uncle John.\'a0 I asked if he was on a horse, & Frank called out; Skylark, Skylark.\'a0 Today I was in the Library writing a note to Susan & Frank was playing with a half a dollar of hers.\'a0 When I had finished writing I left the Library & went to my room.\'a0 After a while I thought of the half a dollar.\'a0 I took Frank back into the Library & told him to find the money.\'a0 He instantly went to a book that was loose at the back where he had slipped the money down & showed it to me.\'a0 This morning his tea was hot, & he said to Lindy blow, blow.\'a0 As you rode off Sunday he said, \'93I want go.\'94\'a0 Anna & himself behave quite well, so I hope Willie will too when he comes back.\'a0 Mr. Hoke has returned.\'a0 Hooker this\'85 he might eventually\'a0 live in N.C. but he believed not at present.\'a0 Mrs. Stone last Sunday said Tom Butler was going to write to Richard Stone to come up to be a candidate for Sheriff, as it was thought Mr. Hoke would resign.\'a0 He had better not be so \ul quick\ulnone , but wait till he \ul actually\ulnone  \ul does\ulnone .\'a0 I would be sorry for Mr. Hoke to move away & hope he will not.\'a0 No more Balloons have been sent up.\'a0 Hooker said he heard it fell in our yard, & he believed the Council had talked about it, & determined to allow no more to ascend.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 I hope you will be pleased to hear from me.\'a0 Except salt, I have not bought anything since you left.\'a0 10 oclock, E.F.P. The church last Sunday was crowded, more so than I have ever seen it & Mr. D\'85mion preached the best sermon I have heard from him\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mrs. Palmer leaves tomorrow, & I will write a few lines by her.\'a0 I hope you will be glad to receive them.\'a0 Though only two days have elapsed since you left, I have a good deal to tell you.\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Palmer this morning.\'a0 She said to \ul me\ulnone , as she did to Susan that she was very sorry not to have made \ul your\ulnone  acquaintance, that she would like to have done so, for she heard you spoken of in such \ul high\ulnone  \ul terms\ulnone , but she would take it for granted that all she heard was \ul true\ulnone .\'a0 I told her you were at Laurens.\'a0 She said perhaps she would see you there, as she was to pass a night there, so if you come in contact with her, you must be very polite, & if needs be, you must give up your chamber as you once did to Mrs. Alston.\'a0 Mrs. Alston leaves tomorrow also but I believe she generally goes as far as Goldsmiths only, the first day.\'a0 I supplied both Mrs. Palmer & Alston with cake to eat on the road.\'a0 I saw Mrs. Alston yesterday for a little while after church at Mrs. Longs door.\'a0 She inquired after you [&] said she would never forget your kindness at Laurens in giving up your comfortable room to her.\'a0 I told her you would be happy to oblige her again, & perhaps she may need the room this time, so if she does you must let her have it.\'a0 The Middletons leave tonight, & the Lynahs tomorrow, so that this week everybody will be gone.\'a0 I went this morning to see Miss Crittenden, Mrs. Townes who was out, & Mrs. Hoke.\'a0 Mr. Hoke came in while I was there, & said he had just made a bargain for you & himself that he had sold your land in the Mountains for 95 dollars \ul Cash\ulnone , & received nine dollars for rent.\'a0 He thought he had done \ul well\ulnone , so I hope you\'a0 \ul will\ulnone  think the \ul same\ulnone ; so you will have 52 dollars waiting for you on your return.\'a0 You ought to be very grateful, whenever your purse is emptied it is filled again.\'a0 Mrs. Palmer told Susan that Mrs. Gibbes wishes to sell her place, that Mr. Gibes health is worse, & that after Mrs. Poinsett leaves there is no one she could depend upon for being with her in sickness, so she would rather go back to Columbia.\'a0 I think she is mistaken, for in Greenville persons are particularly kind in sickness. I saw Mr. Poinsett at the Mansion house this morning.\'a0 He said he had hoped to see you, about the Railroad business.\'a0 He had forgotten you would be at Laurens, but supposed you would be back Saturday.\'a0 He thinks there is no doubt but the stock will be taken.\'a0 Genl Thompson went to see Mamma Saturday in the \ul pouring\ulnone  \ul rain\ulnone , said he was on his way to see Mr. Poinsett & as it was raining, thought he would stop & see her, particularly as he expected to be absent a great deal during the \ul winter\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma asked him \ul where\ulnone  he was going.\'a0 He said he would be \ul attending\ulnone  \ul Courts\ulnone . I went to the Methodist church yesterday morning & afternoon.\'a0 Heard the presiding elder Mr. Walker in the morning, & Dr. Palmer in the afternoon.\'a0 Miss Ann Gadsden dined with Mamma.\'a0 She asked me if I knew the reason Miss Crawford did not take tea with me.\'a0 I told her I thought she was \ul rich\ulnone .\'a0 She said no, she was not, that she asked her if she was coming, & she said, \'93no indeed!\'a0 She would not accept a 3 oclock invitation\'94.\'a0 Mrs. Coleman says she is the most offensively\'85person she ever saw, & I hear, all the gentlemen at Longs are going to present a petition to Mr. Long to turn her away.\'a0 March Jim & James all worked at Mamma\'92s today.\'a0 James says they have got through.\'a0 Charles said yesterday he wants to finish their room now as his time was up & Jim told him he was anxious to have him, to help with the Cotton lands.\'a0 Jim drove the Cows home last night after I had gone to bed, & tonight long after supper.\'a0 In future he must be earlier. No one has inquired for you & no letters have come.\'a0 We are all pretty well.\'a0 Willie has written you a note which he says I must be sure & not forget to send you.\'a0 Miss Crittenden says Mr. Adam Summer has gone on to Portland, Maine, to be married, that the other one of whom Cornelier Crittenden has been joked, she Cornelier has seen very seldom & does not like, he has never been attentive to her, but has spoken well of her. And now my dear husband, you will think you are reading one of Aunt Harriets letters such a \ul medley\ulnone , but I thought all events I would fill my sheet.\'a0 I hope you will be grateful to me for passing the evening writing to you\'85be grateful instead of working on my Quilt, which I was strongly tempted to do.\'a0 I told Mrs. Poinsett today that Pamela was very glad to see that \ul she\ulnone  was a subscriber to her book.\'a0 She said she had \ul not\ulnone  \ul subscribed\ulnone  & that she would \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 Good night, Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As I promised to write to you I \ul must\ulnone , & I write tonight, because \ul tomorrow\ulnone  I am going to Mamma\'92s to help Susan work.\'a0 I was there part of yesterday & today.\'a0 You are perhaps uneasy about Willie.\'a0 All Sunday he complained of pain in his stomach, said he felt weak, & as if he would throw up.\'a0 At night I went for Dr. Earle.\'a0 Just before he came, Willie threw up some acid stuff.\'a0 It seemed to relieve him.\'a0 The Doctor said I must give him a dose of Castor Oil, & 10 drops of Laudanum.\'a0 It operated, & Willie was well enough Monday to go to school.\'a0 I dare say he will be better for that dose of Medicine. Sunday morning I went to the Methodist church.\'a0 In the afternoon I rode with the children to Mrs. Gibbs to inquire how Mr. Gibbs was.\'a0 He is very poorly, eats principally Custard.\'a0 At the Methodist church door, I saw the servant Ben who wishes you to purchase him.\'a0 He is a \ul fine\ulnone , \ul pleasant\ulnone  looking servant.\'a0 I told him I wished to exchange James for him.\'a0 He said he would be very glad of it.\'a0 I mentioned to Mrs. Gibbs that I would like to change one boy for Ben.\'a0 She said James was good looking, but did not say whether she would like the exchange.\'a0 I asked Mr. Gibbs price for Ben.\'a0 She said 700, & I do not think that is high for so good a servant as he looks to be.\'a0 I should think he was under 20.\'a0 As for James I have no patience with him.\'a0 I will not rest until you have parted with him.\'a0 I have no comfort in his driving.\'a0 I intend to give up riding altogether.\'a0 He has not \ul sense\ulnone  enough to be a good driver.\'a0 This afternoon he almost upset us.\'a0 He turned the carri[a]ge short, & carried us up a high bank. You must thank Providence your Wife & children are spared you, for you might have returned & sought for them in vain.\'a0 When we are on a good road we go at a snails pace, with every now & then a jerk forward which nearly throws us off of our seats, then when we come to a hill either up or down, we go at a gallop, & we are always at the side of the road half way down in a gully, or up on the bank, with the tree brushing or scratching the carri[a]ge.\'a0 Our carri[a]ge which has always been thought so easy, is now the most jolting concern I know of, so do you think I will lose anything in giving up riding.\'a0 The Springs I think must be injured from driving fast over bridges, gullys & stumps.\'a0 Last Sunday the carri[a]ge would not have been ready in time, if Jim had not been here to fix the horses, while James was dressing, & I had to go to the stable myself to call him to come & dress, & when dressed he was not fit to be seen, his coat collar turned inside, his shirt collar standing up & a dirty Jacket.\'a0 This Afternoon he drove us to the show.\'a0 I let him unharness the horses & go in.\'a0 When the show was over he was nowhere to be found.\'a0 Fortunately March was near, & he drove us home.\'a0 When we passed near Dr. R\'85\'92s shop, there was James quietly standing up.\'a0 He is a \ul perfect\ulnone  \ul fool\ulnone , & if you will keep him, he must be in \ul your\ulnone  \ul service\ulnone  & not \ul mine\ulnone .\'a0 I would rather have March as my wa[t]chman than him.\'a0 The carri[a]ge & horses are both beginning to look shockingly & I expect will last one twentieth the time, that they would have done with a good servant. We went to the Menagerie.\'a0 It is the \ul poorest\ulnone  \ul collection\ulnone  of animals I have ever seen, but still worth seeing, as all animals are.\'a0 So I advise you to go if they are in Anderson.\'a0 The Hippopotamus is stuffed, the snakes are quite small, a Monkey rides round on a pony, a little boy & man perform feats of agility & strength & some men dressed as negroes sing.\'a0 They perform again [page torn]\'a0 night [page torn]\'a0 if you had been here I would like to have gone.\'a0 I like all shows.\'a0 I now hear the music & wish I was there.\'a0 Everybody I may say was there this afternoon. Mr. Pringle went last night, & Mrs. Pringle goes Saturday.\'a0 She was here this afternoon after the show.\'a0 I drove up while she was in the house.\'a0 I was going to shop with Susan.\'a0 She said I must not get out, that she had come for a book, & would come again to see me.\'a0 I told her to go up in the Library & choose one.\'a0 I can tell you nothing of your farm, but hope all is going on well.\'a0 Neither Jim or Maria came in to go to the show.\'a0 Charles I met on Mamma\'92s road.\'a0 I gave him the money but do not think he went.\'a0 I expect he preferred keeping the money.\'a0 3 letters have come for you, one acknowledging the receipt of T. Butlers money, another from \'85 Foster enclosing a note on a Richards, another from N. Carolina relating to Hodges.\'a0 I am ashamed of my shabby letter.\'a0 You must excuse it.\'a0 Your dear wife, Liz.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I must write you a few lines to prevent your being uneasy, but I can promise you neither a long or interesting letter, for my material for composing one, is very scant indeed.\'a0 All Saturday I staid at home.\'a0 I had a visit from Mr. Luther McBee & Mr. Erwin his cousin.\'a0 Sunday morning we enjoyed a treat in going to the Episcopal church & hearing Mr. Pinckney.\'a0 He is to preach again next Sunday, & then the church will be shut up, until a new minister comes, which I fear will be for a long time.\'a0 After\'85Mamma, Susan & myself rode out to Mrs. Gibbs to bid her good bye.\'a0 She leaves this afternoon, & expect[s] to reach Columbia in five days.\'a0 The place is sold to Mr. Whitefoord Smith, father of the minister of that name\'a0 2500 dollars he gave for it; including I believe, a little of the furniture.\'a0 After returning from Mrs. Gibbs, I remained at Mamma\'92s & spent the day.\'a0 I sent for the children.\'a0 Mrs. McBee, Miss Malinda, & Miss Reinhardt were there.\'a0 The wedding takes place Thursday evening at church.\'a0 Only a few persons will be invited.\'a0 Miss Reinhardt only will return home with Susan, so that it will be to them like any other evening.\'a0 I will not have my party for a fortnight.\'a0 The McBee\'92s wish it put off until then, when they expect more friends from N. Carolina, & will themselves then give a party.\'a0 A great many persons are now absent, who we wish to invite, & will have returned by that time.\'a0 I am quite satisfied, & \ul prefer\ulnone  putting it off.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney in a visit to Mamma, spoke well of Mr. McBee, & seemed pleased at Susans marrying him.\'a0 I hope she will be happy, she \ul deserves\ulnone  to be. Today is quite cold, & Jim intends killing the hogs.\'a0 Mr. Hooker brought the oats Saturday, & I paid for them.\'a0 This morning the old free black male, your client, came to see you.\'a0 He is in trouble about the money you paid him some time ago; says Willis Robinson says; you paid him too much, & wants some of it, , that he had seen you about it, & you told him to go to him.\'a0 He reminds me of Durham.\'a0 He dreads advantages being taken of him.\'a0 Only a newspaper came last night.\'a0 I have no news to tell you, & as only two days have passed since you left home, of course nothing has occurred for me to relate.\'a0 We are quite well, Willie is at school, the other children playing in the yard.\'a0 This is a pleasant day.\'a0 I hope you have the same weather in Columbia.\'a0 I miss you very much, but am so unselfish, as to prefer your being where you will be of service to your District & State than with me.\'a0 It would be a pity that the best qualified man to represent the people, should remain in seclusion at home, recollect, write me nothing about \ul homesickness\ulnone .\'a0 In the first place I don\'92t believe it, & in the second place do not wish my husband to be so childish this time next year.\'a0 I hope I will be with you on my way to Charleston.\'a0 I am still busy helping Susans work.\'a0 Yesterday she had a bad headache, & I am afraid she has it today.\'a0 I look forward with pleasure to hearing from you Wednesday.\'a0 I must conclude with one peice of advice.\'a0 Do not forget to send Legislative documents to your friends.\'a0 Write me of everything, take care of yourself, & be happy.\'a0 The children all sleep with me.\'a0 I will keep you informed of all going on at home, but if I miss writing by one off the Mails, know that I have nothing to write about, & I do not wish you to pay postage for a letter\'a0 containing one sentence, \'93we are well\'94.\'a0 Your affectionate, Liz\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote to you yesterday, & as you are so anxious to hear every Mail, I must write again tonight, for tomorrow I will be very busy working for Susan.\'a0 I was at Mamma\'92s today.\'a0 Some boxes arrived from town for her, among them one containing presents for Susan.\'a0 Aunt Brewton has sent her a handsome shawl; Aunt Elizabeth (Uncle Arthurs wife) a \ul beautiful\ulnone  \ul bracelet\ulnone ; Aunt Martha a Prayer book\'a0 Aunt Turnbull a pr of glass bottles; Aunt Harriet a China cup & saucer; Aunt Sarah Matthews a China candlestick; Aunt Eliza a China Lamp; Aunt Mary Hayne a Shawl & Gloves; Aunt a book; Elizabeth Jones a lace collar; Mrs. Lowndes a \ul beautiful\ulnone  Broach an Amethyst, which you know is a Red or rather Claret coloured stone, not in gold.\'a0 They are the kind worn & Mrs. Lowndes has sent Ann a handsome Silver cup.\'a0 I mention the presents, because as I have so little to write about, it helps to fill up the letter.\'a0 The wedding is to be very private.\'a0 Susan has invited only Dr. Crook, Mrs. Duboc & Maria Pinckney.\'a0 Mr. McBee has invited Mr. Croft & Mrs. Pearson who said they intended giving a party on the occasion.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson & Eliza, Mr. & Mrs. Bradshaw & his own family.\'a0 Mamma was having some cake made today, to send to her friends in town, & to some persons here.\'a0 She will send you a peice.\'a0 There will be a good many opportunities to Columbia.\'a0 Wm Rowland is going down Thursday, perhaps I will send this letter by him, if he goes in the Columbia stage.\'a0 Mr. Elford is going to Charleston, & I suppose goes by the way of Columbia.\'a0 Mamma got him to attend to the witnessing & signing the papers Alston sent.\'a0 He said he would send them up & send them back to Alston, & at the same time, write a peice & put it in . saying \ul he\ulnone  had attended to the business for her. The hogs are killed.\'a0 I hope now the weather will continue cold.\'a0 I am glad the corn will not diminish as rapidly as it has done.\'a0 You must not be uneasy about home.\'a0 I expect everything will go on as well as if you were here. Anna & Frank are in bed.\'a0 Willie has been staying downstairs with me.\'a0 They all speak of you, & Frank when offended with us, says \'93I\'92ll tell Pa\'94 & ask him where Pa is, he says, Pa gone to Lumbia.\'a0 Last night was very cold, & I am squeezed in bed.\'a0 I can scarcely move.\'a0 All of the children wish to sleep with me, & I do not know which to refuse, so have to let them all.\'a0 The contest now is, which shall be next to me. I hope Mr. Elias Earle will be elected.\'a0 You must do all you can for him.\'a0 Mr. Wigfall I think I would like also elected, & would like you to vote for him, if there is no other person who has a greater claim on you.\'a0 Mr. McBee says he met Col. Townes today, & he said to him, \'93you don\'92t go down to Columbia\'94, he said, \'93no, but I hope you will help to send me down \ul next\ulnone  \ul winter\ulnone !\'94  Mr. Gibbs left today.\'a0 I am sorry he has been obliged to leave, for I like Mrs. Gibbs, their boy Ben, I believe has been purchased by the gentleman who bought the place. After hearing from you, I will have more to write about.\'a0 At present I can scarcely make out a letter. Genl Thompson leaves tomorrow.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson & Eliza are not going as they intended to Edgefield.\'a0 I suppose you do not know yet, whether the Governor will pardon Mr. Wells. A Mr. Humphreys came yesterday to get some advice from you.\'a0 No letters have come, only the Charleston papers. Good night, my dear husband; act for the best interest of Greenville; gain all you can in the Appeals Court is the advice of Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 The great event is over, & Susan is married.\'a0 We went to the church last night between 6 & 7.\'a0 Mamma invited a few more persons than at first she intended.\'a0 Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Dr. Earle.\'a0 Mr. McBee also invited more.\'a0 Mrs. Irvine, Mr. Swandale, Mr. Cline & some others.\'a0 Dr. Crook was there & Mr. Croft had to take your place & give away Susan after the ceremony was over.\'a0 Mrs. McBee\'92s family, Mr. Pinckney & his sister, Dr. Crook & myself returned to Mamma\'92s & spent the evening very pleasantly, in cutting up cake, wrapping it up, & directing it to our friends away, & also many in the village.\'a0 Susan has sent some by Mr. Elford this morning to Columbia to you, & also a peice to Mr. & Mrs. Martin, Mr. & Mrs. Taylor & Pinckney McBee which you must give to them.\'a0 You will not be able to eat the whole of your peice yourself, but you can divide it with your particular friends, particularly those from Greenville.\'a0 And oh! How I wish I could promise Susan so much happiness in the married state, as \ul I \ulnone have enjoyed.\'a0 I must say I have my \ul fear\ulnone , but I hope they will \ul never\ulnone  be \ul realized\ulnone .\'a0 I only wish she could be as happy as she deserves to be.\'a0 No one ever \ul deserved\ulnone  happiness more than she does. I read your letter in the Mountaineer this morning.\'a0 I liked it, except your comparison of Mr. Edwards manners to those of a womans.\'a0 I am sure women are not always \ul mild\ulnone  & \ul amiable\ulnone , but I suppose you judge of all, by your wife.\'a0 You must be careful & make no statement in your letter, but what is \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul correct\ulnone .\'a0 You must write \ul good\ulnone  \ul letters\ulnone , & give all the information possible.\'a0 I am sure in Greenville, we would not know what was going on in Columbia, if it were not for you.\'a0 So you must do \ul well\ulnone  for your district this session.\'a0 The resolution of Mr. Henry\'92s about Seduction, is the one I have wished you to introduce.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney says he went to see Mr. Obed Wells yesterday, that he looks badly.\'a0 He had a relapse last Sunday.\'a0 Mr. Cleveland is very low, & it is thought cannot live very long.\'a0 I was very glad to hear from you Wednesday.\'a0 I hope to have that pleasure again tonight.\'a0 The Judges trunk had quite an amusing fate.\'a0 You may tell Mr. Martin that next winter certainly, I hope to visit Columbia & Charleston.\'a0 I am impatient to see my friends.\'a0 The hogs you will be glad to have heard are safely housed for the winter.\'a0 They were very small ones.\'a0 You may judge of their size by knowing, that their fat only made half a Can of good Lard & half a can of bad Lard.\'a0 Mr. Holcombe has not sent what you engaged from him.\'a0 I dare say he will soon.\'a0 Mrs. Griffin brought a few days ago, some Cider, which she said you engaged from her.\'a0 She had not enough apples to make the quantity you desired.\'a0 She brought only 15 gallons.\'a0 It seems good.\'a0 I have bought a \ul new\ulnone  spinning wheel for Maria at 1.50 & a pr of Cards 62 \'bd .\'a0 I begged Alexander McBee to send me a dollars worth of Cotton.\'a0 He says they are buying it at 7 cents a pound.\'a0 Jim says one of the worst bargains, you have lately made is March [&] that of the two he would rather have James, & that James is good for nothing.\'a0 He said if March works hard for 15 minutes, he complains of being sick, & seems overcome.\'a0 He says his sickness is \ul reality\ulnone  not \ul pretence\ulnone , that March says he has always been weakly.\'a0 Yesterday he was obliged to stay at home on account of pain in his stomach.\'a0 He told me this morning he was subject to it, since he was a child.\'a0 He looks weak, I am sorry for him, but still wish you to better yourself as soon as you can; exchange him if you can do no better for little negroes, as Mr. McNeely proposed.\'a0 I believe Rabe has \ul wilfully\ulnone  \ul cheated\ulnone  you, & if he was here you ought to see him.\'a0 After all the trouble you had about his case, you will have gained nothing.\'a0 I am provoked that you did not make him \ul pay\ulnone  you.\'a0 He has money, for he had sold property.\'a0 He is a \ul deceitful\ulnone  \ul creature\ulnone .\'a0 If you keep March he will be an expense to you, so you had better try & dispose of him & James as soon as possible.\'a0 I tell you this not to worry you, but as a peice of news, & you said I must tell you \ul everything\ulnone .\'a0 The children & myself are quite well.\'a0 Willie says he is learning fast so that he will be sure to have his knife.\'a0 I hope Mr. Elias Earle will be elected.\'a0 I am sorry for Mr. Ancrum too.\'a0 I do not think rich men ought to apply for office.\'a0 There should be a law against it.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 There is one peice of business which I would like you to attend to for me.\'a0 I would like you just to inquire the \ul price\ulnone  of some fruit, & let me know.\'a0 Perhaps I might like you\'a0 to send me up a little for my party, if it is \ul good\ulnone , & \ul cheap\ulnone , but if it was dear, I would not \ul think\ulnone  of getting it so don\'92t you get any, but in your next letter tell me the \ul price\ulnone , & also of Cocoa nuts.\'a0 I would be \ul provoked\ulnone  at your getting fruit at a high price.\'a0 What was sent Mamma from Charleston, was \ul cheap\ulnone , but is all decayed.\'a0 I thought perhaps in Columbia it might be cheap also.\'a0 I only wish for the present to know the \ul price\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma intends sending to Columbia perhaps tonight a box, containing cake for our friends, which you must send by the first opportunity to Charleston.\'a0 Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter by Mr. Cox, & it has given me great pleasure.\'a0 I am surprised at your not hearing from me last Friday.\'a0 I have written \ul every\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone  since your left.\'a0 The Post Master in Columbia must be careless, or there is carelessness somewhere.\'a0 You had better always go yourself.\'a0 If you do not receive my letters it is not worthwhile for me to write, & I do not like them to fall in any other hands, but the one for whom they were intended.\'a0 Though very busy, I did not \ul neglect\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone . I am glad you spent a pleasant day at Dr. Gibb[e]s.\'a0 You must accept all your invitations.\'a0 I wish I had given you the other pr of Shoes to carry down also to exhbibit.\'a0 The next time I will have something very [page smudged] to send.\'a0 I am going to work two beautiful patterns on velvet for Ottomans or stools.\'a0 Mr. Cox it is said is engaged, but not to be married for a year.\'a0 I suppose you have heard of the death of Mr. Wm Blassingame.\'a0 I \ul believe\ulnone  he died of Delirium Tremens.\'a0 Mr. Murphy told me, it was the \ul horrors\ulnone , or Tremens or some such thing he \ul heard\ulnone .\'a0 You did not think when you saw him Court week, he would die so soon.\'a0 I am sorry he is dead, for he was such a friend of yours.\'a0 I think persons acting as he did, are more to be pitied, than \ul blamed\ulnone , for he certainly could not control himself.\'a0 You say I must tell you everything, so I will mention every incident.\'a0 Maria has been sick with cold, fever & pain in her head & shoulders.\'a0 Jim came for Dr. Crook to go see her.\'a0 She is now better.\'a0 March still complains of pain in his stomach, & is not able to do anything.\'a0 I expect he needs medicine; He says he ought to take Calomel; so tomorrow I will send him to Dr. Earle or Crook to know what he ought to take.\'a0 James is as bad as ever.\'a0 Whenever I tell him to cut wood, he says March cuts it when he knows March has not been able to cut it.\'a0 James will be in the kitchen doing nothing, & I not able to have any wood.\'a0 It is best to have only one man in the yard, for when there are two, each leaves the work for the other to do. \'a0If you keep March he is so weakly, he will have to stay at home, to attend to the lot, drive the carri[a]ge & haul wood, & James must stay entirely at the farm.\'a0 I cannot bear him any longer.\'a0 If you keep him, he \ul shall\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  be within my sight or call.\'a0 If he is, I will \ul sell\ulnone  him \ul without\ulnone  \ul your\ulnone  \ul leave\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you will meet with an opportunity in Columbia of disposing of him, but I rather think you will not, & it would be difficult getting him down, unless he went in the stage.\'a0 Jim & Charles have been cutting rails.\'a0 They will sow the Oats as soon as the ground can be ploughed.\'a0 It is now \ul frozen\ulnone .\'a0 We have had most \ul severe\ulnone  weather, & still have.\'a0 Yesterday Mr. Holcombe sent the hogs, 5 of them weighing altogether 983 pounds.\'a0 They are cut up, salted & put away.\'a0 There is no danger of their spoiling in this weather.\'a0 The Cider Mrs. Griffin brought is \ul very\ulnone  \ul nice\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Pinckney preached today.\'a0 He leaves with his family tomorrow.\'a0 Susan & her \ul husband\ulnone  were at church.\'a0 As I looked at him at the foot of the pew, I could but contrast \ul his\ulnone  \ul appearance\ulnone  with \ul yours\ulnone , he looking like but I wont say it.\'a0 It is wrong to speak against my sisters husband.\'a0 I only hope \ul she\ulnone  will never think of him, as \ul I\ulnone  do, that she will remain blind to his failings, she \ul must\ulnone  think \ul well\ulnone  of him, or she would not have \ul married\ulnone  him, for she is an \ul upright\ulnone , \ul honorable\ulnone , \ul conscientious\ulnone  person, \ul confiding\ulnone , & \ul generous\ulnone , & \ul deserves\ulnone  as \ul good\ulnone  a \ul husband\ulnone  as \ul I\ulnone  \ul have\ulnone .\'a0 He has done well for himself, gained a comfortable home, & himself & his wife &\'85supported.\'a0 All he has to do is to pay his Tailors bill.\'a0 But do not my dear husband, ever \ul breathe\ulnone  a \ul word\ulnone  of what I say to you about him, & I wish \ul you\ulnone  \ul always\ulnone  to think \ul well\ulnone  of him.\'a0 Sometimes I am so unhappy when I think, that perhaps \ul Susan\ulnone  will be \ul unhappy\ulnone , but there is no appearance of unhappiness yet, & I \ul hope\ulnone  & \ul trust\ulnone  she will \ul never\ulnone  repent her choice, so do not mention ever what I have said.\'a0 Susan has been very liberal in distributing cake.\'a0 She has sent to a great many in Charleston, & all of her acquaintances here.\'a0 I hope you will receive your peice tonight.\'a0 I suppose Mr. Elford will have reached Columbia this evening.\'a0 Mr. Duncan is really obstinate.\'a0 Does \ul he\ulnone  wish Mr. Wells hung? Or think \ul public\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  wishes it?\'a0 You ought to have introduced the resolution about the Chancelors decrees, for I have often heard you \ul express\ulnone  that opinion, so you ought to have had the credit of it.\'a0 Any law that you think would be of advantage, you should introduce \ul yourself\ulnone , & not wait for others to.\'a0 I see the Hoar question will be brought forward again, now my dear, I \ul beseech\ulnone  you not to take the part of \ul Massachuset[t]s\ulnone .\'a0 I have always been ashamed of the part you acted last winter, so do not do so again; rather agree with your state & give up your \ul one\ulnone  opinion to her, than wish to bring her round to you.\'a0 The minority should yield, & it seemed so strange for you to be differing from the whole Legislature.\'a0 Massachset[t]s has no good motive in sending her agents here, & she ought not to be encouraged in it, & if turning them away is \ul unconstitutional\ulnone , it ought to be \ul constitutional\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry I did not know this question would be brought forward & advised you before you left, & so saved my paper.\'a0 However I hope the advice will not come \ul too\ulnone  \ul late\ulnone .\'a0 If you will act badly, do not \ul \'85ron\ulnone  in the \ul Mountaineer\ulnone , but keep it to yourself.\'a0 Your bad acts I wish concealed, not published to the world.\'a0 If you wish the reputation of being \ul independent\ulnone , you have acquired that already; so need not make yourself singular for that purpose.\'a0 Above all never do anything that has the \ul appearance\ulnone  of siding with the North against the South.\'a0 The people are so suspicious on that subject, & they judge from appearance, do not always understand the motive, therefore avoid the appearance of evil, acquiesce without any \ul fuss\ulnone  to what the legislature determines on.\'a0 If you \ul will\ulnone  object, object quietly & without any noise, but I hope you will agree with me.\'a0 I think I must have convinced you. if your good sense had not before.\'a0 You must take my advice in good part, for you know it is given for the purpose of making you act wisely & for the good of your constituents, & I being one of them, wish you to act for my good.\'a0 I do not wish for agents to be coming here from the North meddling with our concerns.\'a0 The children are well, & so am I.\'a0 Willie will write a postscript in my next letter; he is now asleep.\'a0 Frank speaks \ul constantly\ulnone  of you; they all love you \ul dearly\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to have told Mr. Henry his love for his wife, was not to be compared to yours for me, for that \ul I\ulnone  was a most \ul uncommon\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone , very few to be compared to me.\'a0 I am glad you asked me about the Silk dress, before buying it, for it would have been useless.\'a0 I sent to town for it when Susan did.\'a0 It is beautiful, & only 1 dollar a yd.\'a0 I am to pay Mamma \ul gradually\ulnone  for it.\'a0 Instead of bringing me a dress, I would rather you give me the money to pay her at once.\'a0 I wrote to you to inquire about fruit.\'a0 I do not wish you to buy it.\'a0 I would be vexed if you did. I only wish to know the \ul price\ulnone , so if it is \ul cheap\ulnone ,\'a0 & I \ul wish\ulnone  it, I can send for it.\'a0 Last night I slept on a feather bed.\'a0 It is the first time I have been warm for a week.\'a0 I missed my stove, but with the feather bed I am very comfortable.\'a0 Good night, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have been waiting near two hours for Willie to copy the postscript which you will see at the end of this letter.\'a0 It is his own composition as you will perceive.\'a0 I write at night, because in the day, I meet with so many interruptions.\'a0 In all probability I would seldom\'a0 be able to finish a letter before the Mail closed.\'a0 I have very little to write about.\'a0 Maria is still sick, but is better.\'a0 Jim says it is cold; that at one time she will wear Shoes stockings; & another time go barefooted; & that she is so headstrong, she will not mind him.\'a0 He went for her Grandmother to come & nurse her.\'a0 She said she would come.\'a0 I sent Lindy out yesterday to stay with her.\'a0 In a few days I suppose she will be well.\'a0 I think colds are prevalent.\'a0 March is better.\'a0 He went to the farm today.\'a0 Jim thinks he is of \ul no\ulnone  \ul account\ulnone , even when well.\'a0 As long as he is so delicate, he had better stay at home & do the light work, & I will have more comfort in him as a Coachman than James.\'a0 James can stay at the farm; & under Charles & Jims superintendence he will do more work than he does here; & rid you of a great worriment.\'a0 It rained Sunday night & was thawing all yesterday; so Jim thought today he would be able to plant the oats.\'a0 He carried the seed to the farm, but the weather became so severely cold again, that the ground is frozen, & he has not been able to.\'a0 He will plant them as soon as the ground will admit of ploughing.\'a0 He & Charles say the wheat, rye & barley have come up beautifully.\'a0 The sows they turned out, & they went back with their pigs to Mr. Watson\'92s.\'a0 Jim went for them today.\'a0 He says he will make a pen for them outside the farm near Charles house, & let the pigs run about in the woods.\'a0 He & Charles both think when the Sows get fat they had better be killed.\'a0 For that they will continue going back to Mr. Watsons, & get lost or be stolen.\'a0 Charles says this was the case with some Mr. Rowland once bought, so you can think about it, & then determine.\'a0 This is the coldest weather I have almost ever felt.\'a0 I can do hardly anything but sit by the fire & warm myself.\'a0 Mr. Cleveland died this morning.\'a0 I have not been to Mamma\'92s since Friday.\'a0 I had the pleasure today of a visit from Mr. Luther.\'a0 Miss McBee sent Sunday night to know if I had heard from you, & how you & Pinckney were.\'a0 She thought of \ul course\ulnone  you had mentioned \ul him\ulnone ; so you had better in future say something about him; that I may be able to answer the inquiries of the family satisfactorily.\'a0Have you not the least idea whether the Governor will pardon Mr. Wells.\'a0 I hope all those who promised to speak to him on the subject will not forget it.\'a0 You must do what you can.\'a0 I think Dr. Gibb[e]s has been quite attentive to you.\'a0 I do not know what is going on in the Legislature at this particular time. So will not be able to give you my usual quota of advice.\'a0 I hope you are sensible of your great loss.\'a0 I did not understand what you alluded to, in, \'93Mr. Calhoun\'92s course at the Memphis Convention.\'94\'a0 I have not read the proceedings of that meeting, nor Mr. Calhoun\'92s speech, knowing it would be very uninteresting.\'a0 Does the Legislature disapprove of his course?\'a0 I believe there is no news at all in Greenville except Mr. Clevelands death which I have mentioned.\'a0 I think the village looks very dull.\'a0 You ought to be thankful to be away at this dull season & enjoying the society of \ul congenial\ulnone  \ul spirits\ulnone , a pleasure you so seldom have.\'a0 Yes my dear, I am \ul thankful\ulnone  that \ul sometimes\ulnone  you can associate with your \ul equals\ulnone .\'a0 Your letters give me great pleasure.\'a0 They are my \ul comfort\ulnone  in your absence.\'a0 It is well they are not so few & far between as Mrs. Henry\'92s.\'a0 Suisan has not sent the box of cake yet that I mentioned to you.\'a0 She must soon or it will be \ul stale\ulnone .\'a0 The Miss Andersons have gone to Alabama.\'a0 They have a brother and sister in law living there, both in very bad health.\'a0 The brother wrote word that he did not think either his Wife or himself would live long, & if they died, wished his sisters to take charge of their only child, so they have gone on, to take the child if the parents die, & I suppose stay with them in the meantime.\'a0 I hope you will receive my letters more regularly.\'a0 I have written every Mail, & intend to unless I am absolutely prevented by business.\'a0 Ann has borne Susans marriage well.\'a0 Caroline Reinhardt stays with her a great deal, & she finds her a great comfort.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 Willie was at Mammas last Sunday.\'a0 Mr. Ervin was there.\'a0 He took Willie on his knee, & said he was the best boy in school.\'a0 Frank talks sweetly.\'a0 Edward says Mr. Town[e]s is having the holes dug for the fence between our lots.\'a0 I am afraid he will dig the holes a \ul little\ulnone  \ul too\ulnone  \ul near\ulnone  \ul this\ulnone  \ul way\ulnone  a few feet or so.\'a0 I expect that is the reason he is doing it while you are away.\'a0 A Museum & two English Reviews came last Mail, no letters, & no one has been to see you, but your black client & Mrs. Humphreys.\'a0 I have put down the old dining room carpet in my chamber, & it looks quite comfortable; at any rate \ul feels\ulnone  so.\'a0 It is\'85in about 50 places.\'a0 If chance throws you in his way, or you can make the chance, you must become acquainted with my cousin Wm H. Heyward.\'a0 Uncle Arthur thinks him a remarkably fine young man, & his Mother Mrs. Keith is such an affectionate relative.\'a0 Mr. McBee told me he heard the state would take stock in the rail road, one \ul third\ulnone  I \ul believe\ulnone .\'a0 You have doubtless seen many from Greenville before now.\'a0 Tom Butler, Wm Rowland, Mr. Elford , Genl Thompson & others, tell the two former & any other young men you see, to come back to attend the parties here.\'a0 Good night, Your \ul attached\ulnone  wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again I am seated at the desk writing to you.\'a0 I have written, I believe every other night, since you left.\'a0 If you were to peep in at me, you would find me all alone; the children have gone upstairs to bed.\'a0 I received your letter last night & was very thankful to hear from you.\'a0 I am sorry you are so homesick.\'a0 Many in your situation would be quite happy.\'a0 I wish you could enjoy the mixing with society more than you do.\'a0 I think it would be an advantage to you if you associated more with the world in general, & the more you feel disinclined to it, the more you ought to try to overcome that feeling.\'a0 I wish my dear you were more ambitious; your fault is want of ambition.\'a0 If you had had that quality, you would have been far more successful than you now have been.\'a0 I am thankful for the degree of success you have met with, but I am ambitious, & aspire to far higher ambitions, than any you have yet attained.\'a0 Still if these aspirations are not gratified, I am grateful that my wishes have in some measure been satisfied, & will be happy as long as you retain your present honors, even if they are never greater.\'a0 I admire talented & distinguished men more than any others.\'a0 I would rather be married to one of that description than a sick one.\'a0 While you are from home enjoy yourself; you know you can just as well as any others.\'a0 So instead of making yourself unhappy, why do you not determine to pass your time agreeably.\'a0 If you have nothing else to do, make new acquaintances.\'a0 You are too still & reserved & occasionally you ought to be affable & agreeable.\'a0 As for the pleasures of home & wife & children, you exag[g]erate\'a0 them.\'a0 When you are away from Home, you remember only the pleasures of it; but when you return you find it a very disagreeable place.\'a0 You Wife is cross & scolds you.\'a0 Your children behave so badly that they almost distract you.\'a0 Your servants are lazy & worry you to death.\'a0 These are the pleasures of Home.\'a0 It is well you are away half the time, for you can enjoy home in imagination, very differently from what it is in reality.\'a0 I only wish I could go from home sometimes.\'a0 I stay there until I get quite tired of it.\'a0 If I left it sometimes perhaps I would value it more.\'a0 Let me hear no more of Homesickness.\'a0 If you do, I will not write to you.\'a0 I saw Jim this morning.\'a0 He has not been able yet to plant the Oats, on account of the ground being frozen.\'a0 It rained a little last night, & it is rather mild today, so I hope tomorrow he will be able to plant them.\'a0 We have had a severe spell of weather.\'a0 Two or three thousand rails Jim says are cut.\'a0 They have not made any fence yet.\'a0 He thought it best to cut all the rails first.\'a0 March being sick, & James worthless.\'a0 Charles & Jim have been the only ones to work at the farm.\'a0 James hauls wood principally.\'a0 March is better now, & goes to the farm to work.\'a0 Maria is better; Lindy is still there.\'a0 I miss her very little, am satisfied she should be there.\'a0 I wrote you about the hogs you got from Mr. Watson.\'a0 Eliza is still at Mamma\'92s, & find it such a relief to be without her.\'a0 I will be sorry when she has to come back.\'a0 There is so little sewing for her to do this winter, that I would be willing for her to iron, & hire out.\'a0 Mary, Delia, Lindy & Edward are enough to wait in the house & mind the children, & one day in each week, Delia wash.\'a0 I have been to Mamma\'92s but twice since Susan was married, the night & the night after, so I cannot judge how they are coming on.\'a0 They have had a good deal of company calling, Mrs. McBee\'92s family, Mr. Erwin, Bradshaw, Croft, Henry Thompson, Sam Earle & others.\'a0 I get a note from Susan every day.\'a0 Mrs. McBee gives her party next Wednesday.\'a0 I the Friday following, tomorrow week.\'a0 As you say the Fruit is \ul not\ulnone  \ul dear\ulnone , I would like you to get me a small keg of Pineapples, if they are \ul round\ulnone , & not decayed, & if the Cocoa nuts are not more than 6 \'bc cts\'a0 apeice send me 12.\'a0 If they are \ul dearer\ulnone  send me \ul fewer\ulnone .\'a0 I will consider this as my present; you need bring \ul no\ulnone  \ul other\ulnone .\'a0 Send them up in the very next stage, so that they may arrive here Wednesday, & give me time to make the Cocoa nuts into something nice.\'a0 I asked Willie what you must bring for him.\'a0 He is very reasonable.\'a0 He says a knife & puppy.\'a0 I said suppose Papa cannot get the puppy.\'a0 Then he said he can bring it the next time.\'a0 I asked Anna, she says, a baby house, chairs, sofa, table, bedstead & baby.\'a0 She is exorbitant in her demand, so you must bring what you see fit.\'a0 I asked Frank; he says, a drum & a ip, that is drum & whip.\'a0 This evening Mr. McBee when he went out, took up his whip.\'a0 Frank saw him [&] it brought something\'a0 to his mind, & he said to bring me drum; Pa bring me ip.\'a0 He understands everything.\'a0 I want you to bring a present for \ul Susan\ulnone , & buy something for \ul me\ulnone  to give her, & I want you also to bring a present for Ann.\'a0 It is not the \ul value\ulnone  of the present they care for, but the \ul remembrance\ulnone .\'a0 You have not mentioned any purchases you have made, anything you see & wish for yourself, & have the money to git it with you must buy.\'a0 You have not told me how your clothes\'85.\'a0 You must be careful & have your Wig straight.\'a0 You do not know how much your appearance depends upon having that fixed right.\'a0 How anxious Mr. Wells must be; this is now his \ul last\ulnone  \ul hope\ulnone .\'a0 I hope the Governor will pardon him.\'a0 I am certain if all who promised spoke to him that he would.\'a0 I have not a particle of news to tell you.\'a0 It is so cold to stay at home entirely with the children.\'a0 You must be sure to answer Willie\'92s note or he will be mortified.\'a0 He takes great interest in his book, is always asking me, what words certain letters spell, & of his own accord tries to read.\'a0 You ought to be reconciled to being from home, when you remember, when you return you will stay at home long enough to get tired of it.\'a0 If you mention Homesickness again I will scold you well & then stop writing.\'a0\'a0 Be happy like Mr. Duncan, Ware, Walker & Henry.\'a0 They have happy homes, & yet are not pining for them.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you, & as usual it has given me great pleasure.\'a0 You ought to have attended the Governors ball.\'a0 If it was only for a little while, it would have given you so much to talk about to me.\'a0 If all the persons who promised to speak to the Governor \ul had\ulnone  done \ul so\ulnone , I am certain he would have \ul no\ulnone  \ul hesitation\ulnone  in pardoning Wells.\'a0 I am afraid they have not performed their promises.\'a0 If you would only get the Judge to say as he did to you, that he \ul ought\ulnone  to be pardoned, I am sure he would.\'a0 Do tell Mr. Duncan what the Judge said & ask him if he is not ashamed, & tell him if he thinks it will increase his popularity, the refusing to sign he is mistaken, & even if it did, would he for the sake of \ul popularity\ulnone , hang a \ul man\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry he is one of the Delegation.\'a0 I hope the Governor will not be influenced by him.\'a0 Do bring back Mr. Wells pardon in your packet.\'a0 Margaret told me Col. Dawkins wife expected to increase her family.\'a0 If so how \ul pleased\ulnone  he must be.\'a0 He must feel as if he had just commenced life.\'a0 I thank you for your liberality in sending so much fruit.\'a0 I am anxious to receive it.\'a0 It will add greatly to my supper, in appearance, & value.\'a0 Miss McBee gives her party next Wednesday.\'a0 I intend giving mine the Friday following.\'a0 As the Legislature adjourns so soon, I am hesitating whether to put it off until Thursday the night after you return.\'a0 I think it would be respectful to you, & a proper welcome for you.\'a0 If I thought it would give you pleasure to be at it, I would not hesitate a moment.\'a0 My only motive for having it during your absence, is that you dislike parties, & would prefer being away.\'a0 Oh for a magnetic telegraph that I might this instant consult you & know which you prefer.\'a0 I would \ul rather \ulnone you should be present, & yet I am afraid that \ul you\ulnone  will \ul dislike\ulnone  it.\'a0 My only resource will be to consult Mamma & Susan.\'a0 When you left, I expected to have it \ul immediately\ulnone .\'a0 Miss McBee requested me to put it off, until her friend came, as it has been put off so long it will make no difference to put it off a little longer.\'a0 My only hesitation is whether you will like it or not. Willie is disappointed at not hearing from you.\'a0 I told him he would hear tonight.\'a0 Frank is so interesting.\'a0 Willie said to him the other day, Frank I am going to whip Lindy.\'a0 Frank replied, \'93 you shant ip my \'85.\'94\'a0 This morning in bed he pressed his arm hard on my face.\'a0 I called to him loudly to move his arm.\'a0 He commenced crying & said, \'93I tell Pa, Pa ip Ma.\'94\'a0 I would tell you many sweet sayings of his, but have not room.\'a0 They all look healthy.\'a0 Willie is a fine boy.\'a0 Anna is very affectionate.\'a0 If our children only turn out well, we will have great cause for thankfulness.\'a0 I dined at Mamma\'92s today.\'a0 Mr. McBee appeared quite well.\'a0 I hope marriage will improve him.\'a0 I liked him better than usual today.\'a0 Susan was sick in bed yesterday with a bad headache.\'a0 She was up today.\'a0 There was no preaching in any church, so I rode with the children to the farm after breakfast, to see Maria, who is still sick, but better than she was.\'a0 Dr. Crook is attending her.\'a0 March seems quite well again.\'a0 They have been planting Oats.\'a0 Lindy has returned home, & I have sent Mary to the farm to attend on Maria.\'a0 A drove of Negroes passed through today.\'a0 I wish you had been here to exchange James.\'a0 I saw the Drover in the road\'a0 & asked him what he would exchange him for.\'a0 He said a woman & two children, & you pay something to boot.\'a0 He will be back in the Spring.\'a0 I received a note from Pamela yesterday by Maj. Eddins.\'a0 She has given me no invitation this winter to visit her.\'a0 I am glad of it, for on account of my party being put off so long, I could not have accepted it, & now I will not be obliged to ask her to stay with me next summer.\'a0 What shall I say to your extravagance.\'a0 315 dollars in books.\'a0 I can only say it would have been wiser to have extinguished one debt, before you contracted another.\'a0 At this rate there is no hopes of my going to town next winter.\'a0 There ought to be a general rejoicing among the Lawyers in Greenville, as they all have access to your books.\'a0 However I am willing they should, I like to be obliging; only I am sorry after incurring so great an expense, you are not compensated for it by enjoying any superior advantage.\'a0As you are a member of the Legislature, you ought to become acquainted with all the members.\'a0 Mrs. Keith has spoken highly of you in all her letters, so I would like you to become acquainted with her son Mr. Heyward.\'a0 Be sociable.\'a0 It would much improve you.\'a0 Behave your \ul most\ulnone  \ul agreeable\ulnone , when you go to see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.\'a0 Tell them I will go down next winter.\'a0 I am glad you are so busy.\'a0 From your being \ul homesick\ulnone , I was afraid you were \ul idle\ulnone , & had very little to employ you.\'a0 Do not forget to go to the person from whom you got the Candle[page torn] & get the Snuffers.\'a0 I expect it was Veal, Glaze or Mordecai, but I should think you would recollect.\'a0 Butler Thompson ought to be ashamed to go to Columbia, where he owes so much money.\'a0 I wonder they do not hold him to bail.\'a0 I am glad you were appointed to examine the Law students, for I think it quite a \ul compliment\ulnone .\'a0 Another English Review has come for you but no letters, & no one has come to see you.\'a0 Greenville looks very dull.\'a0 I know of no news.\'a0 Mrs. Jones sent for Mrs. Fabers keys.\'a0 I suppose they have bought the place.\'a0 Mr. Jones is in Georgia.\'a0 I would like to know if Mr. Earle is elected.\'a0 I see his brother in law has been.\'a0 Alston seems to manage Mamma\'92s business now, remarkably well.\'a0 Aunt Mary Hayne writes word, that she is in such bad health, that she would not be surprised at any moment that she died.\'a0 I hope you will be successful in your appeal cases.\'a0 You ought to make arrangements with Mr. Bauskett to pay you.\'a0 March drove me today, & did quite well.\'a0 If you keep him, he must be the coachman.\'a0 James had better work entirely at the farm, under Jim & Charles.\'a0 He will do more than any other way.\'a0 He wont do the work on the lot, & it is useless to have both March & him here.\'a0 The Cows are not driven off now, because there is no good pasture for them.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P. Do not come home until the Legislature adjourns, or I wont be glad to see you, after that I will.\

	I wrote to Mamma & Susan this morning to consult them whether it were best to put off the party.\'a0 They & Mr. McBee think of course it ought to be.\'a0 As we pay you the compliment, I hope you will be pleased.\'a0 I believe no wife would give a party only a few days before her husband\'92s return instead of waiting for his arrival.\'a0 So we will welcome you home cheerfully.\'a0 All the preparations will be made during your absence.\'a0 You will not be troubled with them, & the night after your arrival it shall be.\'a0 You will have an opportunity of meeting many of your constituents & telling them the news.\'a0 So I hope my dear husband you will appreciate our motive & feel the compliment.\'a0 As so many gentleman have their wives with them in Columbia, it cannot be very troublesome attending to them, so next Winter you must have Willie with you.\'a0 He will be worth showing.\'a0 Susan wrote me such a kind note about you that I enclose it for you to read.\'a0 It will be worth the postage 5 cts.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was not able to write you last night, & this morning I am so busy, I will be able to write you but a few lines.\'a0 Miss McBee\'92s party is this evening.\'a0 I am glad mine is put off, for it will take all this week to prepare for the cooking next week, & I think it would have been very strange to have had it \ul just\ulnone  \ul before\ulnone  your return.\'a0 I hope this evening to hear from you that Mr. Wells is \ul pardoned\ulnone , & to carry the good news with me to the party.\'a0 In the consultation with the Delegates last Saturday, I suppose the Governor decided what to do, & I can hardly think he has \ul refused\ulnone  to pardon him.\'a0 If he has we must get up some stronger petitions, & all of us \ul write\ulnone  to him, & even send a Committee to intercede with him.\'a0 Mr. Earle I should think would be here tonight.\'a0 I hope he has not had the fate of Mr. Wigfall, who I \ul regret\ulnone  \ul exceedingly\ulnone  to here [hear] has been beaten by Mr. Black.\'a0 I suppose it is dreadful to be opposed by a Black.\'a0 They get everything they wish. The fruit & nuts arrived last Monday, & in good order.\'a0 It will be quite an accession to my supper.\'a0 Mr. Luther McBee had promised me two pigs.\'a0 He finds he has none young enough, so instead has sent me\'85pounds of Flour.\'a0 I am going to fatten two of yours, & also two Turkeys.\'a0 Vardry McBee & Mrs. Alexander sister in law of Mrs. McBee\'92s arrived yesterday from N. Carolina.\'a0 Mrs. Alexander is a sister of Mr. Clark in Columbia, who is the step father of Miss Scott.\'a0 Vardry McBee & her son were at Mamma\'92s last night.\'a0 Alexander McBee has been there twice, which is something wonderful for him.\'a0\'a0 I think they seem a fine family, & I begin to like Mr. Luther very much.\'a0 Last Sunday afternoon Susan & myself rode by to Mrs. McBee\'92s & we did not get out.\'a0 We only went to ask a question.\'a0 Old Mr. McBee came to the carri[a]ge.\'a0 He looked smiling & pleased.\'a0 He said he must have an introduction, for he did not know us apart.\'a0 I told him \ul I\ulnone  was his daughter in law, so he shook hands with me & said \'94howdy do Susan\'94, I am glad to see you, & Miss Malinda said he would have kissed me, if I had been nearer.\'a0 Afterwards Susan told him, that she was the one. We are quite well.\'a0 Maria is a great deal better, getting well.\'a0 We will all be glad to see you, next Wednesday.\'a0 I believe I have told you all you are to get.\'a0 Two presents for Susan, for you & me to give her, a present for Ann, Knife for Willie, Drum & Whip for Frank.\'a0 He speaks often of his Drum & Ip, & anything you choose for Anna.\'a0 I will write but once more to you & hear three times more from you.\'a0 I must now close my letter.\'a0 There is no news to write about.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have taken up my pen to write you my last letter.\'a0 I will hear twice more from you, & then I hope to see you, as the Legislature adjourns Monday.\'a0 I received a letter from you last night, just before I went to Miss McBee\'92s party.\'a0 Everybody who spoke to me, asked if I had heard from you lately.\'a0 I told them I had just heard, & then informed them of the news.\'a0 Dr. Crook said I was the \ul only\ulnone  one you let hear from you, for you had not written to him or anyone else, & that Mr. Wells was complaining of you.\'a0 How my dear husband have you been so neglectful.\'a0 I believe I told you before you went to write to persons, particularly when so interesting a subject as the Rail road, they wished to be informed on, for all the gentlemen last night seemed to take a deep interest in the Rail Road.\'a0 I you had written \ul long\ulnone  letters for the Mountaineer, there would have been some excuse for your not writing to others, but you have not done that.\'a0 You have not informed the people of all that was going on, for I have never known you to write such short & inferior letters as you have this time.\'a0 It is well you took my advice, & have written a longer one for tomorrows paper, & now \ul take\ulnone  \ul my\ulnone  \ul advice\ulnone  \ul again\ulnone , & as soon as you have read this letter, sit down & employ yourself Sunday night, & as much of Monday as you can spare, in writing another \ul long\ulnone  \ul letter\ulnone  for the Mountaineer.\'a0 Try & make up by the \ul two\ulnone  \ul last\ulnone  \ul letters\ulnone , for the inferiority of the two first.\'a0 Tell all that has been done in the Legislature that you think the people would like to know.\'a0 I am sure you can find enough to write about.\'a0 I bet you Mr. Henry has.\'a0 I have been extremely mortified on this subject.\'a0 You generally have written such good letters, so now take my advice, & write one more good letter, but do not say anything in favor of Mr. Hoar.\'a0 The Miss Harrisons were here this afternoon.\'a0 They said from what Mr. Reinhardt said, they did not think much Rail Road stock would be taken in Charleston, on account of some of the Greenville members not have taken an active part in it, that Mr. Walker & Mrs. Duncan had not, that they heard Mr. Duncan was afraid of his popularity.\'a0 I now think Mr. Duncan one of the \ul meanest\ulnone  men I know of.\'a0 What a pity he ever quitted the shades of private life, where his meanness he might have concealed.\'a0 He is on a footing with my next door neighbor.\'a0 If he only knew it he has injured himself more by refusing to sign Mr. Wells petition than he has gained.\'a0 Mr. McBee says he will never vote for him again, & I expect many others will not.\'a0 Dr. Crook spoke of him last night; said he told you he knew he would not sign it.\'a0 I am so sorry you have not written letters to Dr. Crook & others as I told you.\'a0 I wish I were near you constantly to give you advice.\'a0 You would do much better.\'a0 You need me, instead of being like Mr. Duncan, politic.\'a0 You are the most \ul impolitic\ulnone  person I ever knew.\'a0 Do in future do better.\'a0 The Governor has really taken \ul long\ulnone  to consider Mr. Wells case.\'a0 Of course he cannot refuse pardoning him.\'a0 You must bring the pardon home with you.\'a0 Ask him for it.\'a0 You said in your letter last night, you wish you could return with Mr. Earle, in time to be at my party.\'a0 I am doubly pleased at having put it off.\'a0 I do not think Mr. Earle has returned.\'a0 I have not heard from him or my bundle, which if he had come, I think he would have sent.\'a0 I am sorry for his disappointment.\'a0 Everybody is astonished, that a man so well off as Mr. Maxwell should have run.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson says she is \ul glad\ulnone  Mr. [Louis Trezevant] Wigfall is not elected, because he had no business to live so extravagantly.\'a0 I expect she is not glad on \ul that\ulnone  \ul account\ulnone , but because he killed Mr. [Thomas]\'a0 Bird.\'a0 I enjoyed my self very much at the party.\'a0 It was one of the pleasantest I have been at.\'a0 In the first place I was dressed very nicely, which made me feel \ul comfortable\ulnone .\'a0 I had on a beautiful silk which I told you I had sent to town for, also a \ul beautiful\ulnone  \ul sash\ulnone , which \ul Susan\ulnone  had sent to town for.\'a0 It was not becoming to her, & as it was to \ul me\ulnone , I took it from her.\'a0 It was the admiration of the room.\'a0 It is such an uncommon looking one, that it strikes attention.\'a0 When I first went in, I sat by Mrs. Pearson.\'a0 She is a \ul great\ulnone  \ul flatterer\ulnone .\'a0 She told me if you were to hear the compliments that were constantly paid me, you would be very jealous.\'a0 She told Susan last summer, that \ul I\ulnone  was the \ul belle\ulnone  of Greenville.\'a0 Certainly I am the most \ul unconscious\ulnone  belle.\'a0 I am the belle at any rate of the only one I care to be, my husband.\'a0 You will be astonished at the nice party I am going to give.\'a0 When it was first proposed, Mamma was to pay the expenses, & that will consist\'a0 in the purchase of Butter & Eggs, which I have paid for, & paying the servants who assist.\'a0 Almost everything I have in the house, the expenses we now incur will not be much.\'a0 20 or 30 dollars at least will cover them.\'a0 Willie wishes to add a postscript.\'a0 He was very much pleased with his letter.\'a0 We are all well, & I will be delighted to see you.\'a0 Do not forget the snuffers for the candle sticks, the presents for Susan & Ann.\'a0 I would like you to bring me one dozen Lemons to make Lemonade for my party.\'a0 It is so much better than Lemon Syrup, which I would have to buy.\'a0 I am obliged to you for the fruit you have sent me.\'a0 Pinckney McBee, Butler & Harriet did not arrive in time for the party, & I do not know whether they have yet.\'a0 Mr. Luther is very much provoked at Pinckneys not having come.\'a0 Pinckney thought they would have waited for him,\'a0 but as the preparations were made they did not.\'a0 I got a long letter from Pamela last night.\'a0 She does not invite me to see her.\'a0 Says she hopes I will go when she is better.\'a0 I expect she is in reality too sick for company.\'a0 She says children & talking disturb her.\'a0 I have no pencil to write Willies letter for him, so will write for him what he tells me.\'a0 E.F.P.\'a0 \

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter last night, & was very much pleased to hear from you.\'a0 I can scarcely afford the time to write you even a few lines.\'a0 I am in the midst of housecleaning, & you cannot imagine the confusion that reigns all over the house.\'a0 It is worse even than usual for generally I have had only \ul two\ulnone  rooms & the Entries whitewashed but this time I am having the whole house, but Mr. Wallace being obliged to go on & do one room immediately after the other, allowing me no time to fix, every part of the house is in the utmost confusion.\'a0 Tonight we sleep in the large chamber.\'a0 I am glad you are away, & if you are only careful, take care of yourself & come back safe, I will be thankful that your absence is prolonged longer than usual, for I believe in a fortnight, we will only have \ul commenced\ulnone  getting in order, & I have very little assistance, only Delia & Mary today.\'a0 When I told Minerva I wanted her to help, she said she could not leave her child in the kitchen.\'a0 Charlotte & John would kill it, & this evening when I told her, I could not have believed she would have sat in the kitchen all the afternoon doing nothing, when even her mistress was in the house working hard.\'a0 She said, cleaning the house was not her business.\'a0 Her place was in the kitchen.\'a0 Eliza I have been obliged to let iron, so that Delia might assist me.\'a0 March tonight helped move some of the Furniture.\'a0 He is most obliging.\'a0 I like him very much.\'a0 I much prefer him to Jim, because he has such a good temper, but Jim is a valuable servant, but is so often ill natured.\'a0 Monday morning Jim planted the Yam potatoes.\'a0 After that it rained so much & the next day they were not able to do anything.\'a0 It rained almost incessantly Monday & Tuesday.\'a0 Yesterday Jim & March ploughed the lot where your office is, & planted the Lucerne, & also ploughed the middle lot.\'a0 Today at the farm, they were building the fence.\'a0 March said it was too wet to plant the Corn.\'a0 I dare say they will do their duty, while you are away.\'a0 Mamma & myself hear constantly from Susan.\'a0 She seems satisfied & contented & Mr. McBee she thinks a great deal happier there, than he was at Mamma\'92s, & I do not wonder at I;, & his associates also she thinks much better than those here, for though plain, they are all worthy persons.\'a0 Alexander is almost constantly with him, & Pinckney very often.\'a0 Mr. Bigham is so kind & generous.\'a0 Susan wrote today, that he had made her a present of a gold pen.\'a0 He insisted upon her taking it.\'a0 Susan says the\'85with such good worthy persons, is preferable to the heartless intercourse of the village.\'a0 She seems to appreciate the quiet retreat she has found, so I hope she will remain.\'a0 In her letter to me today, she said she felt to you as she would to an own brother.\'a0 I think she & Mamma value you a great deal more than they did, since they have come in contact with \ul others\ulnone  of the\'a0 Male sex & seen how far superior \ul you\ulnone  were to them.\'a0 They now have more confidence in your judgement, & are more willing to be guided by you.\'a0 Perhaps it would be well if you were to write a letter to Susan, a \ul kind\ulnone  one, giving her all the advice you think she needs, encouraging her to perform the duties devolved on her to persevere in remaining where she is, speaking well of Mr. McBee, & I think she would consider it as a mark of friendship, take it kindly, & be benefitted by it.\'a0 Let \ul me\ulnone  have the reading of it \ul first\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. McBee thinks \ul me\ulnone  \ul perfection\ulnone , \ul looks\ulnone , \ul manners\ulnone  & everything, & that therefore I ought to like him.\'a0 Mamma in one of her notes to me, speaking of Susan & Mr. M said Susan did not expect to marry one like \ul you\ulnone , for \ul you\ulnone  were an \ul exception\ulnone , so for the \ul first\ulnone  time, I told her, (in answering the note) my \ul real\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  of you.\'a0 I said you \ul were\ulnone  an \ul exception\ulnone , that we might look\'85in vain to find your equal, that I knew of no fault you had, & though by Christians, you would not be called a Christian, you were more perfect than any Christian I knew of.\'a0 So now what do you say to that,\'a0 The children are well, but are obliged to be rather neglected now.\'a0 As I look at them covered with dirt, I think the housecleaning is no advantage to them, they will require some cleaning & putting in order too.\'a0 Willie has been learning today a peice of poetry to speak tomorrow.\'a0 Frank today, said to me, \'93I want horse to go to Factory.\'94\'a0 I said, very well get me.\'a0 I thought he was joking.\'a0 He went out of the room, & after awhile, he came back & said \'93there\'92s no horse.\'94\'a0 I said where have you been.\'a0 He said, \'93to stable,\'94 & the little fellow had really been all the way to the stable to see if there was a hose there.\'a0 Do not be uneasy about us.\'a0 We are getting on quite well.\'a0 I hope you will be able to go & see your Mother before you return, for you are so much nearer to her now, than you are in Greenville, that you may not find it convenient to leave home to go see her, for a long time.\'a0 It has been very inconvenient to me to write tonight.\'a0 I do not think I will be able to write by anyone going to Pickens, unless someone goes Monday, & then I would write to you Sunday, so do not be disappointed if you do not hear.\'a0 I will have Tuesday, to get the house fixed somewhat in order before Sunday.\'a0 I have not a particle of news to tell you.\'a0 There is none in the Mountaineer which came this evening.\'a0 It is past 10 oclock, the children are all asleep.\'a0 Only one more letter has come for you, from Mr. Miller\'85candidate for Bursar, the Literary Messenger & the Union have come.\'a0 Mr. Luther gave me at the Factory \'bd a ream of Letter paper.\'a0 I\'a0 had no idea it was such an extensive establishment.\'a0 Old Mr. McBee is about building there a Woolen Factory.\'a0 Yours &c, Liz\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have taken my seat in the library, to perform my promise of writing to you by tonights Mail.\'a0 You have left here so recently that of course I have nothing to tell you.\'a0 I have not been anywhere, & have seen no one.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Mary worked all day in the garden yesterday, & hoed all of the beds.\'a0 She made great havoc among the strawberries, Edward & herself, for in the morning, I observed a great many almost ripe, & in the evening, I could discover not one.\'a0 Today I have sent her to the farm, & will let her remain there the rest of the week, without coming home at night, so that she can commence working early in the morning.\'a0 Today Delia will finish ironing, & tomorrow go on with the garden.\'a0 Eliza is still at Mamma\'92s .\'a0 This is the third day she has been there.\'a0 March took the Mare to the farm yesterday, but left it at home today, said they had no use for it there.\'a0 I was downstairs this morning by half past 5 oclock.\'a0 I was in the garden, & worked an hour until 6, when we had breakfast.\'a0 The house was all fixed & dinner given out by 8 oclock.\'a0 So you see how industrious I am.\'a0 I think I will earn the use of the horses on Saturday\'a0 I sent the money to Mamma yesterday.\'a0 She wrote word she was very glad to have it.\'a0 Susan\'92s headache was better, & she says she will stay with me before she goes back to the Factory.\'a0 As I told you, I have nothing to write about, & I am very busy, have a whole basket of clothes to mend, besides other work.\'a0 I do not expect to write to you again until Monday, when I will answer the letter, I hope to receive from you Sunday night; so unless I have something in particular to write about, you will not hear from me again until Wednesday.\'a0 I hope & trust you will reach Columbia in safety this evening.\'a0 Take care of yourself, for the sake of your wife & children, to whom you are justly so dear, so important., gain as many cases as possible in the appeals Court, particularly try your best for Dr. Croft.\'a0 You have the measure of Willie\'92s head.\'a0 You know what kind of hat can be got for him in Greenville, so you can judge whether they are cheaper in Columbia.\'a0 I should think they would have a much better assortment there than here.\'a0 In general I like wide rims to keep off the wind, but I will leave it to your taste, to do as you think best.\'a0 The hat, the ball,\'85 & books for Willie, & the India rubber for me, is all that I wish you to purchase at present.\'a0 The India rubber may be elastic, so as to cut in strips, to stretch & put between the teeth.\'a0 If you can \ul afford\ulnone  it, perhaps you had better purchase a dozen small knives; our large ones are quite good, & we can do without a carving knife.\'a0 We have a good carving fork, so the dozen small knives is all that I care for, or that is necessary for you to get.\'a0 If you were to happen to see Mrs. Taylor, I really would be obliged to you if you would ask her to cut out for me & send me a picture of a suit of clothes such as boys of Willie\'92s age wear.\'a0 I believe I have told you all my wishes now.\'a0 I hope you may be able to get the money Mr. Chaplin owes you.\'a0 I wish you could pay your bookstore bill, but that I suppose is impossible.\'a0 I must now bid you adieu my dear husband, believe me as ever, Your truly attached wife, Liz\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I do not know whether to be most provoked or uneasy at your silence.\'a0 How would you serve me so, as not to let me hear from you last night, unless you are sick, which I hope & trust you are not.\'a0 You have no excuse, for never mind how engaged; you would be spared a few moments to tell me you had arrived safely, & were quite well.\'a0 You do not deserve that I should write to you by this Mail, not having heard from you, & were it not, that I dread your feeling the same anxiety that I do now, I would not.\'a0 If I do not hear by Wednesday\'92s Mail, I will be miserable indeed.\'a0 It is \ul cruel\ulnone  in you to keep me in such suspense.\'a0 I did not think you would be so unkind.\'a0 I do not even know if you have reached Columbia in safety.\'a0 However I must hope for the best.\'a0 I will now tell you all that has occurred since I last wrote.\'a0 We have a great deal of rain, so that not much ploughing has been done at your farm, but they have been replanting & hoeing.\'a0 The Rye looks well, and the Corn better.\'a0 No Cattle have been jumping the fences.\'a0 Mary was at the farm the greater part of last week.\'a0 Today she is with Delia washing, but tomorrow I will send her out, to remain for the rest of the week.\'a0 Very little has been done in our garden on account of the rain, which keeps the ground constantly wet.\'a0 It has been weeded once.\'a0 The walks have not yet been cleaned.\'a0 As soon this week as Delia gets through her ironing, she shall work in it.\'a0 I am sorry to tell you that Jim & Maria are getting along very badly.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon Maria\'92s mother Winny came to me crying, & said she heard Jim had been abusing Maria, had beat her, broke her head, & her face, & the flies had blown it, & she said her Master would take Maria back any time.\'a0 I told her I did not believe all that, but I was going to the farm then, & would see about it.\'a0 So when I went I found Jims abuse of her had been exaggerated.\'a0 Maria was alone in the house, everything about her filthy, the floor not even swept, the\'85pails &c. all dirty.\'a0 She showed me a scar on her neck, where Jim had struck her.\'a0 I talked to her, & gave her some good advice, about doing better.\'a0 I then went on to Charles house & there saw Jim, & told him Maria\'92s mother had been to me.\'a0 He said he had struck Maria about 3 blows, that it was not half she deserved, that she was the worst creature that was & that her mother, father, Mr. Cauble & everybody knew it, that he knew Mr. Cauble would not take her back, for they were delighted to get rid of her, that Mrs. Cauble said she could not make her do anything at all, that people told him about her before he married her, that he felt when he married her, that he was doing wrong, but somehow was forced to do it, that she behaved so audaciously just after she was married, that her father stripped her & gave her 100 lashes so Maria told him, that she is obstinate & mulish, & lazy & dirty, that she wont clean the house, & wash his clothes or mend them, nor even wash hers, that their meals she would give them in dirty plates that they had eaten peas in days before, the peas all sticking to them, that often he had to neglect his work in the field, to clean the house & wash the dishes, that he was sorry when you bought Maria, that at that time he had taken all of his clothes away from her room & had them in the carri[a]ge house, & given or almost given her up, that as you wished to purchase her, he made no objection, & was in hopes when he got her to the farm away from her family she might do better, that she was worse than James, if you watched James he would work, but Maria you could not make work. & the more you coaxed & tried to please her the worse she was, she would not hoe or do anything.\'a0 Charles corroborated all he said.\'a0 I told Jim as Winny said Mr. Cauble would take Maria back, to ask Mr. Cauble to come & speak to me, for though I would not act in your absence, I would like to know if he would.\'a0 So Mr. Cauble came this morning, & to my great sorrow said, Winny has no authority for saying what she did, that nothing would induce him to take Maria back, not if he were given 5 negroes along with her, & he described her character \ul precisely\ulnone  as Jim had done, says Mrs. Cauble would not have her on any account, that she has\'85learn her \ul nothing\ulnone , that she is mulish, lazy obstinate & so on, that he would not have her in the yard, that he told you what she was when you bought her, that she could do \ul nothing\ulnone , not even spin.\'a0 If he did tell you all this I think it was \ul astonishing\ulnone  you should think of buying her, & such a high price for a worthless negro.\'a0 I want her sold to the first drover who passes.\'a0 Jim says through he loves & respects you & would rather belong to you than anyone else, rather than be with Maria he would like you to sell him.\'a0 He says Maria can work if she \ul chooses\ulnone , but she wont & that you are not strict enough with your servants.\'a0 You don\'92t make them work, & Mr. Cauble says you are not a good manager of servants, & \ul I\ulnone  have always said that.\'a0 Now I have done with Maria, hoping you will sell her as soon as possible.\'a0 I have \ul never\ulnone  \ul liked\ulnone  her.\'a0 Elias, Mr. Cauble says you would be pleased with, & if Col. Dunham is willing he will sell him for 600 dollars, but about this I will give no advice.\

York, & they are the finest vegetables I have ever seen.\'a0 Susan went back to the Factory last Friday & returns today, to remain a few days & go on with her work.\'a0 She has not staid with me yet.\'a0 I stopped at Mamma\'92s yesterday & carried herself & Ann to ride a little way.\'a0 It was the first time I had seen them since you were away.\'a0 I am so busy I will not be able to write to you again.\'a0 In my last letter I told you what to get.\'a0 India rubber for me.\'a0 Hat, ball, picture books for Willie.\'a0 Anna says you must bring her a doll, & Frank says an ip (whip) but I don\'92t say so.\'a0 I would like you to bring some little trifle for him, if it were only a 25 cts present.\'a0 Do not forget to draw the pattern of a \ul fence\ulnone .\'a0 The Mountaineer mentions Col.

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is the first day I have sat up, & though \ul weak\ulnone , I will write you a few lines, so that you may certainly hear from me before you leave Washington.\'a0 I wish to reiterate again two peices of advice I gave you.\'a0 I have been uneasy about your \ul gold\ulnone  ever since you left.\'a0 Do take it out of your trunk, & carry it about your person.\'a0 It seems to me it \ul must\ulnone  be safer under your \ul immediate\ulnone  care.\'a0 In your trunk it will be impossible\'a0 for your eye to be \ul constantly\ulnone  upon it.\'a0 The other peice of advice is that you must \ul not\ulnone  go to \ul Columbia\ulnone  to attend the Court of Appeals.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson came to see me yesterday, & after what she said, I am more uneasy than before.\'a0 She says Judge Butler was very much provoked when he heard of the arrangement.\'a0 He knew nothing of it at the time, & thinks the Judges who wished to hold Court in \ul August\ulnone , ought at any rate to have held it at some \ul healthy\ulnone  \ul place\ulnone .\'a0 Columbia is the hottest place in the world Mrs. Thompson says, & that whoever does attend the Court, will have for safety to go to the Sand Hills \ul every\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone , & it would be particularly unsafe for one just from the North.\'a0 So I hope my dear husband you will consult my \ul feelings\ulnone , if not your own, & give up all idea of Columbia.\'a0 You have too many dependent on you at home,\'a0 Your life is too precious to run any risk.\'a0 As you have had but one day from home, of course I have little to write about.\'a0 Yesterday morning, Susan was so sick Mamma had to go to her, but she returned last night, is here now, & says she will take good care of me.\'a0 We had a shower yesterday afternoon which lasted about a quarter of an hour, & one at night of about 5 minutes.\'a0 Though so short, I hope they did a little good, & as a commencement has been made, that we will soon have more.\'a0 Willie came home delighted yesterday at having got \ul head\ulnone  of his class, & says I must tell you of it.\'a0 Frank the morning after you left, when breakfast was ready, put on his bonnet to go to your office to call you.\'a0 He cried when he was told you were not there.\'a0 He often says, \'93I want Pa to come now,\'94\'a0 The beds today have been taken down, you know for what purpose.\'a0 I feel my dear husband that I cannot write a letter important enough to send to \ul Washington\ulnone , where you are surrounded with such \ul great\ulnone  \ul men\ulnone , & have your mind occupied with such \ul great\ulnone  \ul subjects\ulnone , what I say must appear so trifling & unimportant, as my letter though will contain the intelligence that your \ul wife\ulnone  is \ul better\ulnone  & your \ul children\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 I hope that alone will be sufficient to gratify you.\'a0 Mrs. Butler spoilt my only good pen, so that I am not able to write as I would wish a letter going such a distance.\'a0 Do not forget to ask Mr. Yancey what he meant by I.W. Hayne being involved in Mr. Joyce\'92s law case, & the reason \ul he\ulnone  \ul thinks\ulnone  that induced him to leave Alabama.\'a0 Write me of everything that you know will interest me.\'a0 Tell me where to direct my next letter to.\'a0 You must see everything worth seeing, stay as long as you choose, & spend just as much money as you have it in your power to spend.\'a0 I would advise you to make your purchases at the close of your travels, just before you start for home, so as to allow yourself the \ul means\ulnone  of going anywhere your fancy dictates.\'a0 I will try & manage everything \ul well\ulnone  in your absence, so you must give yourself no uneasiness about home affairs.\'a0 When able I will ride to the farm, & read your written directions, & add some of my own, for I think of \ul farmer\ulnone  as well as \ul Lawyer\ulnone , that I would do \ul exceedingly well\ulnone , but of course I attribute all my knowledge, to having been\'a0 the companion for years of a \ul man\ulnone  of \ul superior\ulnone  \ul knowledge\ulnone  & \ul information\ulnone  & when \ul living\ulnone  \ul with\ulnone , one could scarce be ignorant on \ul any\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone .\'a0 I would close with this compliment, but I have a few more remarks to make.\'a0 I read all day yesterday the Museum & nearly read it \ul through\ulnone .\'a0 The first peice was a review of the, \'93Collected Writings of Walter Savage Landor.\'94\'a0 It was very interesting & spoken of in \ul high\ulnone  \ul terms\ulnone .\'a0 If you go into a Book Store, look at the work, & see how you like it.\'a0 If one had time to read a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone , how much information they would obtain.\'a0 If I were to \ul write\ulnone  down, \ul after\ulnone  \ul reading\ulnone , what I had been reading along, I would \ul never\ulnone  forget it, but as it is, it easily escapes my memory [page smudged] must pursue that course when she grows up, write her [page smudged]\'85of the book & what she recollects of it.\'a0 Books that I read years ago in that way, I recollect now.\'a0 My few lines have amounted to a long letter, so I must now recollect that it is the 11
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  days only & the first time I have sat up, & rest on the bed a little.\'a0 You must not be uneasy about me.\'a0 I intend to take good care of myself, & be well & blooming when you return.\'a0 I wish to be remarked as formerly for my youthful look, & not have it said of me as of others, \'93how faded she is,\'94 & this, not for my sake, but for my dearest husband\'92s.\'a0 You know how much I always miss you, therefore of that I need not tell you, but I am comforted by knowing, that you are enjoying yourself, & if you only return to me \ul safe\ulnone  & \ul well\ulnone , I will be rejoiced at the opportunity my husband has had, of seeing the world & being seen by it.\'a0 I intend to make the children so orderly in their behavior you will not know them on your return, not by \ul whipping\ulnone  if I can avoid it, but by \'93speaking gently.\'94\'a0 Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\cf0 I received your letter written at Columbia last night, & it gave me \ul unfeigned\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 I was in hopes you would write, yet feared you might not have the time.\'a0 Do write to me whenever you can. But still do not let it interfere with your writing to \ul others\ulnone , or any other engagement you may have.\'a0 When I read to Willie & Anna what you said of them, the tears came into Willie\'92s eyes, & Anna cried & said, \'93I want Pa.\'94\'a0 Frank not long before, while laying by my side, had said, \'93I want Pa to come now.\'94\'a0 So you see they all cherish for you a \ul deep\ulnone  \ul affection\ulnone , & it would be long indeed before they would forget you.\'a0 You have told one peice of news I am sorry for, that is that Col. Fair, Mr. Caldwell, and Mr. Vance are going to the North.\'a0 Now though at one time I thought it would be pleasant for you to have a travelling companion, I now \ul decidedly\ulnone  think it would be pleasanter to be \ul without\ulnone  one.\'a0 You will interfere with each other, one will wish to go one way & one another, \ul alone\ulnone , you can do just as you please.\'a0 Besides you have so many letters of introduction, the others I suppose have \ul none\ulnone , & you being \ul with\ulnone  \ul them\ulnone , you may be induced \ul not\ulnone  to deliver them.\'a0 You say you wish to look at the country, more than to become acquainted with people.\'a0 Now I have sent you to the North to become \ul acquainted\ulnone  with \ul people\ulnone , as well as to \ul look\ulnone  at the \ul country\ulnone , & all of these \ul persons\ulnone  to whom you carry letters will assist you to see the country to better advantage.\'a0 Mamma expects you to deliver \ul all\ulnone  of hers. So does Mrs. Butler.\'a0 She will be gratified at your seeing her friends, who are even of the same name with yourself, & as soon as you do see them, you must write me word that I may have the pleasure of telling her.\'a0 At any rate some of them you must see.\'a0 You must be sure to deliver \ul all\ulnone  of Mr. Poinsetts.\'a0 It will not put you to inconvenience to do so, for you intend visiting all the places where his friends are.\'a0 This is perhaps the only time you will ever be able to go to the North it is just as important you should see the great \ul men\ulnone  as the \ul country\ulnone .\'a0 Therefore I wish you to become acquainted with them, & they with you.\'a0 In my opinion you are greater than any of them & I wish them to see you.\'a0 It will be a pleasure to you I know to see persons of whom you have heard of for so long a time , & I will be \ul mortified\ulnone , & \ul never\ulnone  \ul forgive\ulnone  you, & \ul scold\ulnone  you \ul well\ulnone , if you return home without availing yourself of the opportunity afforded you of becoming acquainted with persons.\'a0 Therefore, that you may have it in your power to go where, & do as you please, travel \ul alone\ulnone , & not bind yourself to the company of anyone.\'a0 You can see & be with Col. Fair as much as you wish next winter in Columbia.\'a0 Another thing I wish to tell you is, not to return home too soon, as you are not going to Columbia, there is no reason you should hurry, travel at your \ul leisure\ulnone , & see \ul everything\ulnone  worth seeing.\'a0 Be \ul sure\ulnone  to go as far as \ul Niagara\ulnone .\'a0 I must [page smudged] description of it from you.\'a0 The Catskill mountain house 3000 feet [page smudged].\'a0 Hudson, where there is one of the finest views in the world, must be worth visiting, in short go \ul everywhere\ulnone .\'a0 I am sure your money is enough.\'a0 If not \ul contract\ulnone  your \ul purchases\ulnone , & then you will certainly have enough.\'a0 I will not expect you home, till the middle of September.\'a0 Mamma says you need not be uneasy about me, she will take good care of me.\'a0 She has been with me constantly since you left.\'a0 She was gratified at your remembrance of Susan, Ann & herself.\'a0 You must \ul always\ulnone  \ul mention\ulnone  them.\'a0 They think so highly of you.\'a0 They value your remembrance.\'a0 Mamma desires the best love.\'a0 I must tell you John\'92s opinion of you.\'a0 He said as he drove from the door the last evening you were here , \'93Major Perry is the finest gentleman I ever knew, although he is not a Christian.\'94\'a0 I am happy to tell you we have had \ul rain\ulnone .\'a0 It commenced raining yesterday afternoon , & continued raining all night in a gentle manner, which must have done good, without washing the land.\'a0 March says they expected to finish ploughing today, but the ground is too wet.\'a0 He says a great deal of the corn is tasseling, & that it is \ul clean\ulnone , & free of grass.\'a0 As the horses are at leisure, I intend riding out this afternoon for the first time.\'a0 I will go to the farm & send your directions.\'a0 Today is a fortnight since I lay in bed sick & suffering, & at night met with such a disappointment.\'a0 You do not know how great it was.\'a0 I feel it still.\'a0 Yesterday I went down stairs for a little while, & I could not think how differently I had gone down from what I expected.\'a0 But I am thankful I am now almost well, & have no sufferings to look forward to.\'a0 I feel now for Susan, who can have no idea what she is to go through.\'a0 Willie this morning said, I must beg you to bring him some \ul books\ulnone  \ul particularly\ulnone  one called \'93\ul Mother\ulnone  \ul Goose\'92s\ulnone  \ul Melodies\ulnone ,\'94 which he once owned, but it is torn up, so bring that, & a few simple books with pictures.\'a0 Frank wants a whip [page torn] a doll, & other things innumerable.\'a0 I told her you will not have room to bring [page torn] said you must get someone else to bring them for you.\'a0 With regard to the Music box, I would like one if you can get it reasonable, a \ul large\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone , & it is not beyond your means.\'a0 It must play \ul beautiful\ulnone  \ul tunes\ulnone .\'a0 You must get a \ul better\ulnone  \ul judge\ulnone  of Music than \ul you\ulnone  \ul are\ulnone  to select it.\'a0 But if on enquiry you find they are \ul dear\ulnone , more than you can afford, you must not \ul think\ulnone  of bringing me one.\'a0 Another time when\'a0 you can \ul better\ulnone  \ul afford\ulnone  it, I would get one.\'a0 Now I wish you to spend as much money as you choose in \ul travelling\ulnone , & not deny yourself in that way at all.\'a0 The next thing I would like after a Musical box is a \ul Bracelet\ulnone  if they are \ul worn\ulnone  & I believe they still are.\'a0 Alex McBee brought Caroline Reinhardt one.\'a0 It was very showy with stones in it , & cost $6.50.\'a0 That is \ul not\ulnone  the kind \ul I\ulnone  wish.\'a0 I wish a plain \ul genteel\ulnone  one suitable to wear to \ul church\ulnone  & \ul visiting\ulnone .\'a0 Inquire of a Jeweller which kind are \ul fashionable\ulnone  & select a \ul plain\ulnone  \ul genteel\ulnone  but pretty one.\'a0 I suppose such a one would not at the utmost cost more than 5 dollars, & I would like you to buy me two \ul gold\ulnone  \ul pins\ulnone , to pin my Mantle on at each shoulder.\'a0 All of these things are only mentioned, supposing your money \ul holds\ulnone  \ul out\ulnone , a \ul Large\ulnone  \ul Music box\ulnone  in Charleston costs 20 dollars.\'a0 In New York I suppose they would be much less.\'a0\'a0 Mamma wishes you to buy for her Masselon\'92s sermons.\'a0 She thinks them the best she has ever read.\'a0 If they are not too dear, you might bring them to her as a present.\'a0 Bring also a present for Susan & Ann, however \ul trifling\ulnone .\'a0 They would value it as coming from \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I will direct this letter to Washington, & hope it will reach there, before you leave.\'a0 4

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was delighted last night to receive \ul two\ulnone  \ul letters\ulnone  from you.\'a0 I wish you would write to me every day.\'a0 Your letters are the brightest spot in my existence now.\'a0 Still I do not wish the writing to me, to interfere with any other engagement, particularly the writing for the Mountaineer, which I hope you continue to do.\'a0 At Washington there is so much to write about, that you ought to have written several letters from there.\'a0 You could have given such an interesting account of the distinguished men you saw,\'a0 Mr. Webster, Mr. Adams &c., & descriptions of men are always interesting.\'a0 Instead of lying on the bed all day Sunday, you ought first to have written a long letter for the Mountaineer.\'a0 I am glad you staid longer in Washington than you first proposed.\'a0 3 weeks would not have been too long, to allow you to become acquainted with all worthy of your acquaintance.\'a0 I am pleased at your seeing Commander Shubrick.\'a0 He used to be very handsome.\'a0 Mrs. Butler is so anxious you should see her brother.\'a0 She said he is in Washington, & she sent yesterday to know if I had heard from you, & if you had mentioned him.\'a0 You must certainly go to N London where you will see Mrs. Rogers, & at N Port where you will certainly go.\'a0 You must see her nephew Dr. Perry & her sister in law the widow of Commodore Perry & in writing to me mention them, for she comes often to see me, & thinks of course I have news of her friends to tell her, & I am sorry to disappoint her.\'a0 I hope the travelling with Col. Fair will not prevent your delivering your letters of introduction.\'a0 I wish you had followed the advice I gave you in my second letter & travelled \ul alone\ulnone .\'a0 A companion will certainly interfere with your movements, but as you have been so unwise to take one, you must not let him interfere, but go wherever you wish.\'a0 You must certainly see Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Wright &c., as Mr. Poinsett was so good to you.\'a0 Perhaps before you come back you had better write to him, & tell him of his friends.\'a0 My dear husband, how I wish you would always be in such good society as that at Washington, though I miss you so much.\'a0 My love for you is \ul disinterested\ulnone , that I am willing to bear the pain of separation, so that you are in a situation suited to a man of your talents & character & among friends who can appreciate you.\'a0 I am more anxious than ever that you should represent the people at Washington, for if such inferior men are sent there, how much more important it is, that there should be some among them capable of judging & acting for the best interest of the country.\'a0 You can then become a \ul great\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone , or at least be known as a great man, for you have all the ingredients of one already.\'a0 Hoping my ambition is not sinful, as it is for my country, & that one day it will be gratified.\'a0 I will drop the subject.\'a0 How much you will have to tell me when you return.\'a0 It is worthwhile travelling on that account.\'a0 I wrote two letters to you at Washington, both of which you ought to have received a few days after you arrived there.\'a0 I have written to you at N York, & sent one also by Mr. Swandale, which he was to leave at the Atlantic Hotel if he found you had put up there, with Mr. Anderson, if not deposit it in the post office.\'a0 It is unpleasant writing not knowing where to direct, & I have to tell you with mentioning the purchases in every letter, for fear you may not receive any of them.\'a0 You must write me how your funds hold out, & whether travelling has been more or less expensive than you anticipated.\'a0 If I had a clue to how much money you could spare, I would regulate my commissions accordingly, as it is I mention all I wish, & leave you to get what you can \ul afford\ulnone , & also think \ul best\ulnone .\'a0 Mamma wishes you to get for her Masselons sermons, & The lady of the Manor by Mrs. Sherwood plainly bound.\'a0 She does not care for Percy Anecdotes which I mentioned in my last letter.\'a0 I wish a \ul black\ulnone  or \ul blue\ulnone  \ul black\ulnone  \ul silk\ulnone  dress.\'a0 You must get what the merchant says is \ul fashionable\ulnone , for now a particular style may be worn.\'a0 Sometimes they are striped, sometimes plain &c.\'a0 Get what is worn now, & as many yds as are sold for a dress & cape.\'a0 I mention the black silk, because I wish one, & suppose they can be got cheaper in N York than anywhere else.\'a0 I wish also a \ul bag\ulnone  to put my pocket handkerchief in, & I would like you if you see pretty ones, to get a \ul thin\ulnone  \ul large\ulnone  \ul shawl\ulnone , what are called Barage shawls are worn here, & I believe cost 5 dollars, so in N York they would be cheaper.\'a0 I would not give \ul more\ulnone  than 5 dollars.\'a0 They are generally white, with coloured or white stripes crossing each way.\'a0 I leave it to your taste to , we select a pretty one, except pink which is too fine.\'a0 You may select any other, Lilac or Blue stripes, or white stripes would be pretty.\'a0 I wish 2 pins gold or some other kind that is \ul plain\ulnone , to pin my shawl or mantle on the shoulders.\'a0 I am shamed now to go on with the \ul Musical\ulnone  \ul box\ulnone  & the \ul Bracelet\ulnone , which you must not get, unless you have the money & can afford, & the price is reasonable.\'a0 I would like you to bring a bag for Susan, & something for Ann, & if the money still holds out, buy a \ul set\ulnone  of \ul Coral\ulnone  such as baby\'92s wear.\'a0 It consists of a necklace for the neck, & a pr for the sleeves.\'a0 I would like to make them a present for Susan.\'a0 I have never made her a present since she was married.\'a0 Ask for \'93Coral beads for the neck & dress.\'94\'a0 Willie says bring him plenty of pretty \ul little\ulnone  \ul books\ulnone  with pictures.\'a0 Anna\'92s wishes are innumerable, like mine.\'a0 Frank wants a whip & trumpet, & they \ul all\ulnone  want some \ul candy\ulnone .\'a0 Write\'85what is the state of your funds, that I may \ul enlarge\ulnone  or \ul contract\ulnone  my wishes accordingly.\'a0 My advice is after travelling, to spend the rest of your money in gratifying your taste, & buy all you can afford.\'a0 Even a Sofa, & if you see a Sofa that you would really wish to get, you may get it instead of all the things I have mentioned above, if you have not enough money to get the Sofa too.\'a0 I have now mentioned what I wish you to buy so often I am \ul tired\ulnone , & am sure you are of the subject, & after mentioning my wishes I leave it to you to make what purchases you think best.\'a0 I rode to the farm yesterday.\'a0 The Corn looked well.\'a0 They are now working the bottom corn which they expect to make something of.\'a0 They have had rain though not much.\'a0 Today it drizzles every now & then.\'a0 The weather has been excessively hot here, until within a few days it has been so cold, we have been obliged to have fires.\'a0 I hope it has been the same with you.\'a0 For my part, I prefer the hot weather to the cool change.\'a0 It is so unreasonable.\'a0 Mamma is with me & sends her love.\'a0 I have no news to tell, & no space to refer to your letter as I would wish.\'a0 I hope all you find out about your \ul name\ulnone  will be in its \ul favor\ulnone .\'a0 Do write interesting letters for the Mountaineer.\'a0 Be sure to not go to Columbia.\'a0 Mr. Coleman says & everybody it would be \ul imprudent\ulnone .\'a0 I would not consent for 1000 dollars.\'a0 Bring the children something pretty & something useful.\'a0 Take care of yourself.\'a0 I am quite well.\'a0 Do not be uneasy if you do not hear.\'a0 E.F.P. The letters I write in future I will direct to N York.\'a0 I think one more thing if you can \ul afford\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you to buy me is a little \ul worsted\ulnone  \ul muslin\ulnone  \ul collar\ulnone , with an \ul under\ulnone  \ul tippet\ulnone  \ul to\ulnone  \ul it\ulnone , costing not more than 2 dollars.\'a0 You will think me unreasonable but it is only if you have the money that you must get what I mention. Do not forget to buy the\'85in Fulton St. N York & go to Thorburn & make arrangements about getting\'85.\'a0 If you cannot buy for me \ul all \ulnone I have mentioned would rather you get a Musical box in preference to the black silk dress.\'a0 I suppose a Musical box will not cost more than 15 or 20 dollars, & if you get one you must be sure & get one that plays beautiful tunes.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again have I taken my seat at your desk in the Library to write to you.\'a0 I read yesterday evening your letter in the Mountaineer.\'a0 It gave me pleasure, but I think it was written in a more careless manner than you generally write.\'a0 I suppose it was written in a \ul hurry\ulnone , but when you write to be \ul published\ulnone , you ought to write with \ul great\ulnone  \ul care\ulnone .\'a0 You did not dwell \ul long\ulnone  \ul enough\ulnone  on the different subjects, & one thing I was surprised at, was your laying so much stress on \ul dress\ulnone .\'a0 It would make the impression that you thought \ul dress\ulnone  of so much \ul importance\ulnone , when \ul I\ulnone  know you \ul do\ulnone  not \ul value\ulnone  it in the \ul least\ulnone , & I am sorry an impression so much against you\'a0 should be made.\'a0 If the Members of Congress had \ul behaved\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone  & performed their \ul duty\ulnone , it would have been of no \ul consequence \ulnone if they had \ul dressed\ulnone  badly, though it would have showed more \ul refinement\ulnone , if their dress had been\'85.\'a0 Another thing I did not like was your \ul court\ulnone  to Genl T\'85..n.\'a0 His \ul character\ulnone  I do \ul not\ulnone  \ul admire\ulnone , & I do not like to see one so far above him\'a0 in everything that is worthy of praise as \ul you\ulnone  are, paying what \ul seems\ulnone  in the \ul eyes\ulnone  of \ul others\ulnone , \ul flattery\ulnone  & \ul court\ulnone .\'a0 Where one possesses \ul vanity\ulnone , it should be \ul pulled\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone , not \ul puffed\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone .\'a0 There was an ungrammatical expression in your letter also.\'a0 You see with how much \ul interest\ulnone  I must have read your letter to criticize it so, but I assure you it gave me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone , & the remarks I make, are for you to \ul proifit\ulnone  from in \ul future\ulnone  for I \ul love\ulnone  my husband \ul so\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone  that I wish his letters to be faultless, so as to escape criticism from \ul others\ulnone .\'a0 So continue to write, for all you tell is \ul so\ulnone  \ul interesting\ulnone , that I always wish you would \ul tell\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone .\'a0 Your letters to me are \ul very\ulnone  \ul interesting\ulnone , & I think might even do to be published.\'a0 Mrs. Butler was here yesterday & says she is coming again tomorrow as she thinks I may hear from you tonight.\'a0 She is so anxious to hear something of her family who she thinks you will of course see.\'a0 She says you \ul must\ulnone  go to N London if it is only for \ul two\ulnone  \ul hours\ulnone .\'a0 Her sister Mrs. Rogers is there, & her niece Miss Rogers wishes to come to Greenville, & she thinks it would be a good opportunity for her to come on with you.\'a0 You might arrange it when you return to N. York or Washington on your way home, she might meet you, & come on with you.\'a0 I hope you are willing to put yourself \ul even \ulnone out of the \ul way\ulnone  to oblige others, so that you will make some arrangements of this kind.\'a0 Mrs. Butler is very anxious for a \ul French\ulnone  \ul cap\ulnone .\'a0 She has written to her sister to get her one & send by you.\'a0 She says I ought to have told you to bring \ul me\ulnone  one so now she has put it in my head.\'a0 I \ul would\ulnone  like one.\'a0 You must bring me one.\'a0 I would like you also to bring me as a \ul present\ulnone  to Mrs. Butler, for in all probability she will not get the one she has written for, & she has been so long talking about a French cap, & you can get directed to a Milliner in N. York.\'a0 I wrote you in my last, that I wished you to buy a set of Coral beads for Susan.\'a0 She did not know I had written, & asked me the other day. if you would be a good person to get her a set, that she \ul wished\ulnone  one.\'a0 So you see it would be an \ul acceptable\ulnone  present to her.\'a0 Get a set of small coral beads for the neck, & two smaller strings for the arms, that is called a \ul set\ulnone , the Jeweller will tell you.\'a0 Mamma & Susan are with me washing, so I am not lonely, though nothing can make up for \ul your\ulnone  \ul absence\ulnone .\'a0 I think one reason we love each other so, must be that we are often separated.\'a0 When \ul apart\ulnone , we feel the loss of each other so much, that when we \ul meet\ulnone , we value each other \ul more\ulnone  than ever.\'a0 Mamma sends her affectionate love to you, & says she believes they love you as much as I do.\'a0 They have learnt to value you.\'a0 Willie has holiday now for 4 weeks, & enjoys it greatly.\'a0 Not a day passes but all the children speak of you.\'a0 Frank is a sweet boy, a universal favorite.\'a0 He greets everyone with such a smile, that he wins their hearts immediately.\'a0 My mantle was up yesterday, & I took my meals for the first time down stairs (since you left) & commenced keeping house again.\'a0 After dinner\'97We have just dined.\'a0 Mr. McBee dined with us.\'a0 Susan is here.\'a0 He sends his love & says you must do all you can for the Rail Road.\'a0 Very few persons have come to Greenville as yet.\'a0 Sunday I am going to church, & next week I wish to go by to see Mrs. Dickson & Mrs. Poinsett.\'a0 You must certainly go to N. Haven & deliver all the letters Mamma gave you.\'a0 You must not omit going to the Graveyard, that beautiful spot, where you will see in the plot owned by Mr. Ingersoll, the grave of my little sister.\'a0 You will then realize that we indeed lived in N. Haven.\'a0 Now that you are at the North, you ought to go everywhere, & I think it is such an advantage to have introductory letters.\'a0 It makes you acquainted with the people, & enables you to see the country better.\'a0 You must deliver them all.\'a0 I am sure in Washington you must have felt the benefit of them.\'a0 I am afraid from the Presidents overhearing your remarks on Oregon that it\'85him against you.\'a0 I am sorry, for I wished you to gain the favor of the President.\'a0 Your descrying of Mrs. Polks vanity was not at all \ul pleasing\ulnone .\'a0 The more elevated one is in the world, the more humble they ought to try to appeal.\'a0 Of course she must be pleased at the distinction of\'85& husband, but she ought to have sense enough to conceal it.\'a0 \ul I \ulnone value\'a0\'a0 \ul you\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone  as much as if you were \ul President\ulnone , & the reason I am pleased at any \ul honor\ulnone  paid you, is that it is a proof that \ul others\ulnone  value you, as well as myself, & for this reason I would be pleased if you were made President, if not Judge, at any rate Senator as you now are.\'a0 I am not \ul vain\ulnone  at being the \ul Senators\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone , but \ul grateful\ulnone  to the \ul people\ulnone  who \ul appreciate\ulnone  you.\'a0 By the by, are you not afraid that the remarks you make about the \ul house\ulnone  may get you into \ul trouble\ulnone .\'a0 Every member may call you to account, thinking it a personal insult.\'a0 If they do, \ul apologize\ulnone .\'a0 I cannot consent to your settling it in any other way.\'a0 I am \ul serious\ulnone , & you must be more careful.\'a0 You must \ul continue\ulnone  to write for the Mountaineer, but write \ul well \ulnone as you know you \ul can\ulnone  \ul write\ulnone , for your letters are \ul always\ulnone  \ul interesting\ulnone , & your travels now afford such a good subject for your pen, & you see so many persons also.\'a0 Mrs. Butler said she hoped you would write about Genl Towson, that he distinguished himself in the last war, so I suppose you know all about him.\'a0 She mentioned someone who went from N. York to Boston for 50 cts in an opposition line.\'a0 I want you to buy \'93Walker on Beauty\'94, & if you cannot get all of Mrs. Sherwoods works, you might get the \'93Lady of the Manor\'94, if it is reasonable.\'a0 Would you not like to get for yourself, \'93Horace Walpoles last letters,\'94 that you could [write] a review of.\'a0 You must bring some clothes or articles of clothing for Willie. Frank & Anna ready made if you see them, so I may know the \ul fashion\ulnone .\'a0 Hat or Dress or something of the kind.\'a0 I have in my different letters given you various commissions, but you must consult your \ul purse\ulnone , & your \ul judgement\ulnone .\'a0 I long to see you, but at the same time wish you to remain away long enough to see everything worth seeing.\'a0 Perhaps on your return you can stop at Bordentown, Wilmington & Carlisle, & at Philadelphia be well to deliver your letters.\'a0 You must see Mr. Van Buren, & write an interesting description of him for the paper.\'a0 You had better remain some days in Washington on your return , for I am sure you did not stay long enough before.\'a0 You must certainly go to N. Port, & engage lodging there for me next \ul summer\ulnone , & go to Burton River [where] her brother lives.\'a0 She says you pass it, & it is a beautiful place.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P. I have written you 6 letters, two at Washington, two at N. York, two at Boston.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 Take care of yourself.\'a0 The weather here is now \ul hot\ulnone .\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was very much disappointed last night at not hearing from you, but I suppose you had not time to write, & the Mails are also irregular, for Col. Townes received last night the letter you wrote from Philadelphia, & which he ought, I should \ul think\ulnone , to have received the Mail before.\'a0 I sent to know if he had \ul heard\ulnone , & he sent me the letter to read.\'a0 I cannot help being uneasy, for fear General Houston, who you called a \ul Humbug\ulnone , or some of the Members who you said were \ul no\ulnone  \ul gentlemen\ulnone , may call you to account.\'a0 My dear husband I would not for \ul the\ulnone  \ul world\ulnone , that anything should happen to you while you are away, as I beseech you if any difficulty does occur, for the sake of your \ul wife\ulnone  & \ul children\ulnone , settle it in a peaceable way.\'a0 The Mountaineer I suppose is sent on to Washington in exchange for the papers there, & so of course will be seen.\'a0 I like you to write letters, but be careful not to say anything to hurt the feelings of others, & do not insult anyone.\'a0 I see in your letter last night, you again mention Genl Thompson.\'a0 You make him of so much importance.\'a0 I wish you had mentioned Mr. Poinsett, who was so good in giving you letters, & you might have brought him in so naturally, so in one of your future letters, \ul you\ulnone  \ul must\ulnone  \ul do\ulnone  \ul it\ulnone .\'a0 It is a compliment due to him, & he is so \ul good\ulnone  a \ul man\ulnone , flattery will not injure him, he is \ul worthy\ulnone  of \ul praise\ulnone .\'a0 He & Mrs. Poinsett came to see me yesterday.\'a0 They seemed very much interested in all I told them of your travels, & their friends.\'a0 Mr. Poinsett asked if you had mentioned Maj. Cooper, that he was one of their\'85friends.\'a0 He spoke of your letter in the Mountaineer. They excite \ul great\ulnone  \ul interest \ulnone & that is the reason I wish you to \ul continue\ulnone  to write, but to be careful \ul how\ulnone  you write, & write \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 How could you leave Washington in the midst of the Tariff debate, when you would have heard Mr. McDuffie & so many great men speak.\'a0 I am provoked you should have lost the opportunity.\'a0 I suppose it was owing to Col. Fair, who is making such a hurried tour, that he has no time to stay anywhere, & you who ought to take things \ul leisurely\ulnone  are just hurrying along with him.\'a0 I \ul knew\ulnone  this would be the case if you took a \ul companion\ulnone , & therefore \ul regretted\ulnone  it, as soon as you told me Col. Fair was going on.\'a0 Instead in Philadelphia of delivering the letters Mamma took so much trouble to write, that she even hurt her eyes, you just put them in the Post office.\'a0 Mrs. Jones is a hospitable lady.\'a0 She has sons, who would have been of service to you in showing the city, & to know a place it is requisite to know the people.\'a0 In Washington you should have staid a week longer.\'a0 Mrs. Poinsett asked if you have not mentioned the \ul Post\ulnone  \ul office\ulnone .\'a0 On your way back you can stay long enough to see everything.\'a0 All say you ought not to return too soon.\'a0 Though so \ul anxious\ulnone  to \ul see\ulnone  you, I am willing you should remain a \ul long\ulnone  \ul time\ulnone , as I know not, when you will be able to go back again.\'a0 You know not how I miss you & the thought of anything happening to you, makes me miserable, & fills my eyes with tears as they now are, & two have dropped on the paper.\'a0 From your description of Adam & Eve it must be a most \ul indelicate\ulnone  picture, scarcely fit for a drawing room, & to think you described it rather indelicately, still if you had the money which I know you have not, I would be willing you should buy it.\'a0 Perhaps you could afford to buy one much smaller & costing a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone  \ul less\ulnone  as a specimen, but what I would prefer \ul above\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone  \ul things\ulnone , is that you should let Sully or some other distinguished artist take your \ul portrait\ulnone .\'a0 Oh how I would \ul value\ulnone  it, & you need bring me \ul no\ulnone  \ul other\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone .\'a0 We can give the one Mr. Barclay took to Mamma.\'a0 I am so sorry you even had that taken.\'a0 It is so \ul unlike\ulnone  you.\'a0 I never look at it, for it makes me forget how you \ul really\ulnone  \ul look\ulnone , so if you wish to please me, instead of\'85pictures or anything else, bring me \ul yourself\ulnone  on \ul Canvass\ulnone .\'a0 Adam & Eve must be a picture not proper for a \ul private\ulnone  \ul room\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry you expressed a wish to have it.\'a0 Furniture & everything else I expect is the \ul cheapest\ulnone  in New York.\'a0 I would like to have a neat sofa for our \ul dining\ulnone  \ul room\ulnone .\'a0 I dare say in New York would get one for 20 dollars.\'a0 If you have not enough money, you need not get the dress I mentioned you must get for me, or the Shawl.\'a0 Indeed anything \ul you\ulnone  see, you may wish to buy, you must buy in \ul preference\ulnone , to what \ul I\ulnone  have requested you to get.\'a0 I went to church yesterday for the first time for months.\'a0 Mr. Arthur preached two very good sermons\'85such as \ul you\ulnone  would have liked, & better than any I ever heard from Mr. Dennison.\'a0 He preaches \ul practice\ulnone  as well as \ul faith\ulnone , so he will not be liked as much as Mr. Dennison & some ministers who preach faith alone.\'a0 He has a very pretty wife, & seems he is good.\'a0 It is strange, he is thought to look so much like you.\'a0 Jim yesterday said\'85looked like his master, & Mary McLeod today said Willie looked like Mr. Arthur.\'a0 I told Jim I was going to write to you.\'a0 He said, I must give you his \ul compliments\ulnone , & [page torn] you to make yourself \ul contented\ulnone .\'a0 They were doing as well [as if] \ul you\ulnone  were here.\'a0 They are now hoeing the Cotton\'85, which they expect to make something of & are \ul pleased\ulnone , for they say \ul you \ulnone thought it was \ul ruined\ulnone .\'a0 The Corn looks quite well.\'a0 It rained yesterday, & rain was very much needed.\'a0 We have not yet had as much as is necessary.\'a0 Willie is enjoying his holiday.\'a0 He even\'85& then says a lesson to me of his own accord.\'a0 He is afraid Willie Choice is continuing his studies, & will get ahead of him.\'a0 He left school head of his class.\'a0 He now looks quite well.\'a0 Mrs. Duloc yesterday gave him a Prayer book.\'a0 He went to church in the afternoon with me, & carried it.\'a0 He read all of the services, & found it so interesting, that he now says, he will go to church, \ul both\ulnone  \ul morning\ulnone  & \ul afternoon\ulnone , that he found it tiresome before, because he stood up doing \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 Frank one evening heard the Augusta stage pass, & went to the window, he said to see if Pa had come.\'a0 Anna is as affectionate as ever, & when anyone troubles her, says she will tell Pa when he comes.\'a0 Mamma sends her best love & says I may truly tell you I have never been alone.\'a0 She says she finds it a relief to be here.\'a0 Mr. McBee stays at the Factory, but comes up constantly.\'a0 He was here yesterday & desired his respects to you, hoped you would have a pleasant trip, & that you would stay long enough to see everything.\'a0 I do hope you will see some of Mrs. Butlers friends.\'a0 In visiting Mr. Van Buren you may mention Mr. Poinsett, if it is only that he gave you the letter of introduction.\'a0 You must be sure to deliver all of the letters you have now & not put them in the post office.\'a0 I think you are greatly indebted to Mr. Poinsett & I wish you to make some return to him & it is due to him that he should be mentioned in one of your letters.\'a0This is my seventh letter.\'a0 I have written two to Washington, two to N. York, & two to Boston, & this is my seventh which I will also direct to N. York.\'a0 I hope you will receive them all.\'a0 I wish you would write to me on Foolscap paper.\'a0 I am always sorry when I get to the end.\'a0 You ought to \ul pay\ulnone  \ul postage\ulnone  on Col. Townes letters, & continue to write.\'a0 All who see me speak of your letters, & seem to find them interesting.\'a0 You would write an interesting account of Mr. Van Buren, Mr. W\'85 & others.\'a0 Niagara, Saratoga &c.\'a0 I wish I were with you.\'a0 You must not hurry too much.\'a0 I am provoked you left Washington so soon.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 The village seems quite dull.\'a0 You need not regret your absence.\'a0\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\'a0 Take care of yourself. If you have money enough, buy a Sofa a \ul neat\ulnone  \ul cheap\ulnone  one, though even in this do as you think best.\'a0 Dr. Randall Croft has lost his youngest child a boy seven months old.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I do not know how it is, but I feel so \ul cool\ulnone  today whenever I think of \ul you\ulnone , that my heart feels as if it would \ul burst\ulnone .\'a0 Oh! If I could but see you \ul safe\ulnone  at \ul home\ulnone  again, how \ul happy\ulnone  I would be.\'a0 It seems to me, I only now feel how much I love you, & how essential you are to my happiness.\'a0 My love now is mingled with anxiety, & the latter feeling has increased the former.\'a0 I have been unhappy ever since your \ul first \ulnone letter appeared in the Mountaineer.\'a0 I have been fearful lest the \ul free\ulnone  manner in which you spoke of the \ul Members\ulnone  should get you into \ul trouble\ulnone , & until I hear from \ul you\ulnone , that you are in no \ul danger\ulnone , I will be \ul uneasy\ulnone .\'a0 I dreamt last night you had been challenged by Dr. Austin for saying something about his daughters dancing.\'a0 A wretched night I passed.\'a0 When I woke up, my thoughts were on the same subject, & when I went to sleep, the dream was \ul continued\ulnone .\'a0\'a0 Oh my dear husband, for the love you bear your wife & children, & that they bear you, come back \ul safe\ulnone  to them.\'a0 We cannot do without you.\'a0 What would existence be to us \ul without\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 So if you get into any difficulty, you must get out of it \ul peacefully\ulnone  & \ul quietly\ulnone .\'a0 If I had only been by you while you were writing that first letter I would have told you to leave out the second paragraph describing the members.\'a0 A womans instinct often tells her what is \ul right\ulnone , & it is a good rule & one which you ought to follow in \ul writing\ulnone , that if you cannot write well of a person, it is better not to mention them, at any rate not \ul abuse\ulnone  them.\'a0 I took up my journal this morning.\'a0 I was laying on the bed & wanted something to read & suddenly thought of that as I read what you wrote in the first part, my heart overflowed.\'a0 I could not resist getting up & writing to you.\'a0 I thought I would feel better if I did.\'a0 I did not object to your \ul mentioning\ulnone  & \ul disapproving\ulnone  of the conduct of the Members, but I disliked the \ul terms\ulnone  in which you mentioned it,\'a0 You might have written in a way , that would not have given \ul offence\ulnone .\'a0 I hope [lined through] & you ought not to make yourself \ul disliked\ulnone  even at the North, & the \ul uncomplimentary\ulnone  manner in which you speak of some of the \ul distinguished\ulnone  men must make them \ul dislike\ulnone  you.\'a0 I hope however, that my fears are \ul groundless\ulnone , & that nothing will happen to you.\'a0 The wish uppermost in my head now, is to see your \ul face\ulnone  \ul once\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone .\'a0 I value you more than ever, your long absence has made me appreciate you \ul more\ulnone .\'a0 If that were \ul possible\ulnone , the tears come so fast in my eyes, I have to stop to wipe then away.\'a0 The children long to see you.\'a0 They speak of you \ul constantly\ulnone , Frank particularly who I thought would have forgotten you.\'a0 I wrote to you only day before yesterday.\'a0 I am afraid I write too often.\'a0 My letters are a drug.\'a0 I expect to hear from you tonight, & ought to postpone writing until tomorrow, when I may have a letter from you to answer, but I cannot help sending you this.\'a0 I wish you \ul soon\ulnone  to know my anxiety, that you may be doubly careful of yourself.\'a0 I wish also to tell you, that any purchases you wish to make, you \ul must\ulnone  \ul make\ulnone , in \ul preference\ulnone  to what I have written you to get.\'a0 I would \ul much\ulnone  \ul rather\ulnone  you should get what \ul you\ulnone  think \ul best,\ulnone  & I dare say you would prefer getting things more \ul valuable\ulnone  than a dress, shawl &c. so you are at perfect liberty to do as you choose.\'a0 If you see a neat reasonable Sofa, & think you had better get it for our Dining room, I would \ul like\ulnone  it \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone , for the one now there is so ugly, & particularly \ul uncomfortable\ulnone , but if you had rather not get it, you need not.\'a0 So on, with regard to the Musical box , bracelet, & everything I have mentioned, but one thing I do wish is a \ul bag\ulnone , which I really need & would like you to bring Susan one too, & I wish you to bring a present for \ul Ann\ulnone .\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 There are very few strangers in the village at present.\'a0 I know of no one but old Maj. Porcher & a Mr. Gaillard & family, & Dr. Tyddiman.\'a0 I ride out almost every afternoon.\'a0 I have not visited yet.\'a0 A good many persons have been to see me.\'a0 I \ul feel\ulnone  quite well, & \ul look\ulnone  as well as usual, but do not feel as \ul happy\ulnone  as I will, when my dear husband returns.\'a0 Mamma & Susan have been quite a comfort to me, & Ann being willing, they should leave her.\'a0 They feel thankful to have a place to come to, where they can have quiet & tranquillity.\'a0 Ann prefers having but one at a time with her.\'a0 She is the same as when you left.\'a0 Mr. Brooks & his family have returned.\'a0 I do not know whether Ann Brooks has come.\'a0 The weather is now excessively hot, & we feel it more after the cool weather we have had.\'a0 I hope you will return \ul gratified\ulnone  by your trip, & having seen \ul all\ulnone  that was worth seeing.\'a0 Mr. Poinsett says he has no doubt, you have gained information, that will be profitable to you all your life.\'a0 On your way back if possible, & I know it will be possible, you must stop & see the persons in Philadelphia.\'a0 Mrs. \ul Jones\ulnone  & Mrs. & Miss \ul Hazle\'85\ulnone  that Mamma gave you letters to, & if convenient go to Carlisle, Wilmington.\'a0 How [page torn] you will have to talk about to me when you return.\'a0 Mrs. Bea\'85 [page torn] has gone to the North.\'a0 Do you think you will return by the Virginia Springs?\'a0 If the mode of conveyance in that direction is \ul safe\ulnone , you will find it \ul pleasant\ulnone , & from all accounts they must be worth seeing.\'a0 I have heard it was like Fairy land.\'a0 Do not, above all things, return by \ul Salisbury\ulnone  & \ul Charlotte\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Poinsett said it would have been a risk \ul going\ulnone  that way, & of course now later in the \ul season\ulnone  the risk would be \ul greater\ulnone .\'a0 He said you were right to \ul go\ulnone  by the way of Charleston.\'a0 How uneasy I would have been if I had known what a storm you were in.\'a0 For several days past, it has rained every afternoon, so I hope the Corn has benefitted by it, & that we will not now have \ul too\ulnone  much rain.\'a0 Adieu my dear husband, my constant prayer is, that you may return to me \ul safe\ulnone  & \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 I have written more than I expected to.\'a0 I do hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 Ever yours true, loving, faithful wife, E.F.P. Do not forget to price & perhaps buy some Tea in \ul Fulton\ulnone  st N. York, & perhaps it would be well to look at Thorburn\'92s seed establishment, & make an engagement\'a0 for his sending you on seed every year.\'a0 You might also make arrangements for buying others things, such as Books, Groceries &c.\'a0 We are buying tea now at Nicols, so you might as well bring on now, that is if you have money.\'a0 One thing I have always forgotten to tell you to buy, is \ul two\ulnone  or \ul three\ulnone  \ul bunches\ulnone  of \ul Quills\ulnone  for Willie.\'a0 He is learning to write & needs them & here they are too dear \ul 75 cts\ulnone \'a0 a bunch.\'a0 I wish half a yd of fine \ul blue\ulnone  \ul black\ulnone  Broadcloth, if you can get it \ul much\ulnone  cheaper in N. York than \ul Greenville\ulnone , & have the money to \ul spare\ulnone .\'a0 I would not object to your getting one half a yd, but if it is \ul not\ulnone  \ul cheaper\ulnone  & you have not enough money, or wish to spend the money in something else, you must by \ul no\ulnone  \ul means\ulnone  get it.\'a0 Broadcloth here, I believe, is 8 dollars a yd.\'a0 I am afraid my letters & commissions confuse you, but I do not wish them executed unless \ul perfectly\ulnone  \ul convenient\ulnone . You ought to direct that letters that arrive in N. York after you leave should be sent on to you \ul here\ulnone .\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is the \ul ninth\ulnone  letter I am writing to you, & I am provoked to think you have received but \ul two\ulnone .\'a0 In N. York you ought certainly to have heard, & I have written \ul four\ulnone  letters there.\'a0 I hope you will receive them on your return.\'a0 In Boston you should receive \ul three\ulnone , including this.\'a0 You ought to go to the Post office yourself; perhaps then you might get them.\'a0 You must direct all letters that arrive for you after you leave, to be sent back to Greenville.\'a0 I wrote you yesterday telling you how uneasy I was for fear something might happen to you.\'a0 I am sorry now I expressed these fears, for you will think me \ul foolish\ulnone , but you must excuse me & lay it all to my \ul love\ulnone .\'a0 I directed my letter to N. York.\'a0 I heard from you last night, so today am free from anxiety, & I write to tell you so, & also write in consequence of a visit from Mrs. Butler this morning.\'a0 She wishes you if possible, to make arrangements to bring on her niece Miss Rogers with you, who she says can meet you in N. York, or any other place.\'a0 She lived in New London, which place Mrs. Butler hopes you will visit.\'a0 She says it will not be out of your way, & is well worth visiting.\'a0 She gave you a letter to her sister Mrs. Rogers.\'a0 If the young lady comes on with you, of course she will stop at the Springs & other places as you wish, so if you find it \ul convenient\ulnone , I know you will be obliging, but if \ul inconvenient\ulnone , they cannot expect you to bring her.\'a0 In N. Port you must deliver the letter to \ul Dr.\ulnone  \ul Perry\ulnone , Mrs. Butlers nephew.\'a0 She will be mortified if you do not, & if you go to Bristol which will not be out of your way she says, & is well worth visiting.\'a0 You must deliver the letter to her other nephews.\'a0 Her brother went to Washington after you left which she regrets.\'a0 He lives on the North river an hour & a half\'92s sail from New York, so if you feel inclined you can pay him & his family a visit.\'a0 Mrs. Butler is anxious for a French cap.\'a0 I wrote you to get her one, for though you have not much taste in such matters, the \ul Milliner\ulnone  can select for you.\'a0 You can be directed or\'85yourself find a Milliner.\'a0 In every letter I have told you of different things I wish you to buy, at the same time leaving you at liberty to invest your money to better purpose if you choose.\'a0 As I hope you will yet receive those letters, I will not repeat what they contain.\'a0 You must be certain to get those letters before you leave N. York for it would be such a long journey for them to take back to Greenville.\'a0 Col. Town[e]s did not hear from you last night.\'a0 You must write regularly.\'a0 Your letters excite \ul great\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone .\'a0 All speak of them to me, & are glad you write.\'a0 You must be sure & not come home \ul too\ulnone  \ul soon\ulnone , before you have seen \ul everything\ulnone , though I know you must be anxious to be at home once more.\'a0 Yet on this point, you must practice self denial, & avail yourself of all the advantages the present opportunity affords you.\'a0 I think it so much better to have letters of introduction.\'a0 It makes you enjoy yourself so much better, & become acquainted with a place.\'a0 In N. York where you had none, or what you had, did not deliver, you seem to have not much to write about.\'a0 It required someone who \ul knows\ulnone  a place, to direct you about it.\'a0 I am very sorry you have travelling companions.\'a0 I am certain that has prevented you delivering your letters, & you even left Washington at the most interesting time on this account, for you wrote me you intended to remain during the Tariff debate.\'a0 You ought to visit some of the Penitentiaries while you are away.\'a0 Mrs. Butler says she is sorry she did not give you a letter to Commodore Reed in Philadelphia.\'a0 In New Haven be sure to deliver all of your letters & do not omit visiting the Grave yard, where my sister lies, in the spot owned by Mr. Ingersoll, & by the side of Commodore Shubricks child.\'a0 In my letters you will find a great sameness, for fear you may not receive\'85of them.\'a0 I report the same thing in all, so when you get \ul four\ulnone  at once, the repetition will be tiresome.\'a0 I sent on a letter by Mr. Swandale.\'a0 He was to leave it with Mr. Anderson if you stopped at the Atlantic Hotel,\'a0 It is said to be in a delightful part of the city, near the Battery, & I should think you would find it much pleasanter than the Astor House, & the society so much better.\'a0 Mrs. Dickson & Mrs. Lowndes, made pleasant visits.\'a0 Mrs. Butler went with me.\'a0 I wish you to go as soon as you return.\'a0 Mrs. Butler\'92s health seems very bad.\'a0 She is so swollen, I should think she has dropsy.\'a0 I feel sorry for her such a large family as she has what a charge upon her.\'a0 She is anxious to go to the North, & I do not wonder at it.\'a0 Instead of your never wishing to leave home again, you must leave, but carry \ul me\ulnone  with you, a second visit I should think even pleasanter than the first, the same as reading a book the second time, you observe & notice what you did not at first.\'a0 I would like you if in your power to travel \ul every\ulnone  \ul year\ulnone .\'a0 Living in such a small place as Greenville, it is more necessary to leave home to see something of the world.\'a0 Greenville I always feel is too small a place to learn much in.\'a0 Jim says the Corn is doing very well, all say the best Corn they have ever seen on that land.\'a0 He expects to make from 150 to 200 barrels.\'a0 The Rye & Oats are put away, & he says you will not need to buy before it is made again.\'a0 The horses begin to look well.\'a0 The ploughing has reduced them a great deal.\'a0 They now feed in the pasture, & also the Cows so at present, they are no expense.\'a0 James also does well, & Maria is doing better.\'a0 Mr. Bailey of Laurens is dead.\'a0 He was thrown from his buggy & killed almost immediately.\'a0 I never can finish without mentioning what you are to buy.\'a0 Mrs. Butler says at Stuarts in N. York they make sugar candy, sugar Dogs, & all sorts of things.\'a0 Willie wants you to lay out a half a dollar his Grandmama gave him in something of that kind.\'a0 Says you must bring him some picture books.\'a0 I want the Musical box if they are \ul reasonable\ulnone  & the Bracelet plain & genteel \ul reasonable\ulnone  also, two pins gold or some kind to pin my shawl on the shoulder, & a \ul bag\ulnone , \'85present for Ann & something for Susan a bag perhaps.\'a0 I have mentioned other things in my letters, a thin fancy shawl, white with white or coloured bars.\'a0 I mentioned also a black silk dress, but I know you wont have money for all, so you may leave out the dress unless you can get it reasonable.\'a0 Things I believe are very \ul cheap\ulnone  in N. York.\'a0 So you had better make all your purchases there.\'a0 If you see a nice reasonable Soga get it.\'a0 Adam & Eve is so indelicate a picture, that if you had the money I would not wish you get it,, bring presents for the children, some books such as \ul I\ulnone  like to read.\'a0 Do not forget the Tea in Fulton st., & to make arrangements about getting seeds at Thorburns.\'a0 You must fit yourself up well in clothes I think.\'a0 The clothes you bought in Washington were quite cheap.\'a0 I hope you will continue to write descriptions of all you see for the Mountaineer.\'a0 Your letters are too short.\'a0 You ought to pay the postage on them.\'a0 Uncle Arthur & his Wife are somewhere at the North, at some Springs I believe.\'a0 If you hear of them, do make it a point to see them.\'a0 I hope at Boston you will receive 3 letters, at N. York 4 & if I write again I will direct to N. York, unless you order me differently.\'a0 Boston I should think you will be pleased with.\'a0 I should think you would be delighted with your travels.\'a0 Adieu my dear husband, according to your directions, I have not whipped the children, & fear they will be as bad as ever when you return.\'a0 E.F.P. You must read all my letters when you get them Y recollect I repeated the same things not knowing which you would receive.\'a0 I would like you to bring a present of\'85for Mrs. Butler.\

My dear dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to promise I write you how Frank is.\'a0 The Doctor this morning said he was \ul better\ulnone , & thinks if the medicine would only operate \ul freely\ulnone  he would soon be well.\'a0 The medicine operating so slowly is the reason he is so long sick.\'a0 His throat is better, & his tongue cleaner.\'a0 This morning as he awoke, he asked if I was going to make cake today.\'a0 He then asked if Pa had come back.\'a0 I told him no.\'a0 He said he was afraid somebody would steal Pa.\'a0 I told him Pa would not let them.\'a0 He said they would steal Skylock.\'a0 He then asked to see his cap, then he wished to put it on.\'a0 Your uneasiness about him\'a0 must not bring you back sooner than you ought to come.\'a0 If there is any prospect of business, remain for it.\'a0 In these hard times the least prospect of business you can get is of importance.\'a0 Frank is doing just as well as if you were here, & as he is getting better, you must feel easy.\'a0 I have just written a letter to Aunt Eliza for my Aunts to carry.\'a0 It is now raining, so I think it probable they will not be able to go tomorrow.\'a0 It will be a disappointment to them, that I would rather the rain should have put off a few days longer.\'a0 They are to pass the night here, so as to set off early tomorrow.\'a0 They were here yesterday after church.\'a0 They asked me when they would see me in town.\'a0 I told them I did not expect to go, that travelling was expensive & that your journey had taken all the money you could afford.\'a0 They both said that the only expence would be the journey down & up, for of course I must stay with them, that they would always be glad to see me; they really are in earnest. I hope you will made a bargain with Col. Irby for Maria & James.\'a0 They are perfectly useless servants, at any rate sell James to him, & try to get 550.\'a0 March is so good tempered I am loth to part with him.\'a0 He is a pleasant servant for a lady, more so than Jim.\'a0 I would be willing to hire out Mary this winter.\'a0 She is such a pleasant servant I never wish to sell her.\'a0 Eliza could very easily\'85us wages by taking in work.\'a0 All these means we must resort to if your business fails, & what a Providence it will be if you can make Chancellor.\'a0 If not you will have to go to Congress, as the last resort.\'a0 It was only your Law practice that prevented your thinking of that & now if you have no law business, that objection is removed.\'a0 What bad news we have from Mexico, so much for War.\'a0 The spirits of the Volunteers will be\'85.\'a0 Poor Capt. Williams, you know who used to be with us in the Mansion house, he has been killed.\'a0 It is well his wife is dead, for what an affliction she is saved, but the orphan children are to be pitied & I dare say he had a second wife.\'a0 You know I have a painting over the Dining room Mantle peice which he gave me.\'a0 I shall always value it for his sake.\'a0 I liked him so much, that I am grieved at his death.\'a0 I am writing with such a bad pen, that you must excuse this ill looking letter, & I have been writing all the morning so that I am quite tired, & have also been obliged to stop frequently to attend to Frank.\'a0 Willie has staid at home this afternoon on account of the rain.\'a0 I today bought him a pr of shoes with his money & have given the others to Edward, as they fit him exactly.\'a0 I have tried to get some news of the election, & send you Mr. McHays statement.\'a0 I sent to Mr. N\'85 & Mr. Watson who lives next the Court house, but would hear nothing satisfactory from them.\'a0 I then sent to Mr. Mc\'85 & send you what he wrote me.\'a0 I see Dr. Crook\'92s name is not even mentioned.\'a0 He must have come out too la[te].\'a0 He is in Greenville village today.\'a0 I have not heard of any of th[e] other candidates being here. \'a0Mr. Hoke I expect went to some other box to electioneer for I sent to know [fro]m him about the elections, but Mrs. Hoke said [he] would not be back until this evening.\'a0 I must now send my letter to the office.\'a0 Yours truly & sincerely & devotedly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just done dinner, & I will write you a few lines merely to gratify you in case you are still at Anderson, as in all probability you will not be there, it is not worthwhile writing a long letter which you may not receive.\'a0 I scarcely have the time to write.\'a0 All of the morning I have been visiting my neighbors,\'a0 I paid 8 visits.\'a0 I owe now almost everyone a visit.\'a0 Yesterday I returned some visits at a distance, so rode, but this morning I walked.\'a0 March has been hauling lumber to the Mill.\'a0 I intend to let him haul for sometime.\'a0 This afternoon I am going over to the Mansion house to bid Mrs. Middleton good bye.\'a0 She goes tonight, & after that I going over to see Mamma, who is quite sick with Sore throat & fever.\'a0 Susan is not going to\'a0 Mrs. Thompsons or Mr. McBee either.\'a0 Neither of them wish to go.\'a0 I would like to go, & if I do go will go with Mr. & Mrs. Town[e]s.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s asked me to this morning.\'a0 You might very well have come back, & then gone to Josiahs afterwards.\'a0 Saturday night would have done just as well for you to attend to the business.\'a0 If you were going with me I would be certain of enjoying myself.\'a0 With regard to selling the servants, we will talk about it when you return, as to which shall be sold.\'a0 March is so pleasant a servant I would rather keep him.\'a0 His temper is so good, & as you must have a servant about the yard, he is a good one to have.\'a0 Your Farm ought to be attended to.\'a0 Therefore Charles & Jim will do for that.\'a0 James I would sell by all means, & Maria wish sold.\'a0 She is not good enough to regard her feelings, therefore sell her to Col. Irby or Mr. Cureton.\'a0 Mrs. Cauble I went to see this morning.\'a0 She said Maria\'92s mother has spoiled her, that she is only fit for a corn field, & at that will do well, that she can never be made a good house servant, that she is filthy, & that she has been more impertinent to her, than she imagined a servant would be, that the impertinence she gave me was just like her.\'a0 So unless you keep her at the farm, you will have to sell her, & at the farm she is of no use.\'a0 If it is necessary I can send Mary there to stay, let Eliza \'85 & Delia stay in the house.\'a0 All of this we can talk over together when you return.\'a0 I wish you to take the money James is sold for & pay what you owe.\'a0 Willie, Anna & myself are quite well.\'a0 Frank I hope will soon be so.\'a0 He wishes to eat all the time.\'a0 I am obliged to restrain him.\'a0 Mamma has a dreadful sore throat.\'a0 It is very much swol[l]en.\'a0 She told me she had sent for you to stop there, & that you were quite kind. A letter came to you last night from John Cunningham about Mr. Simms.\'a0 It is a good letter.\'a0 He says he has always thought that his ancestors & Bill Cunningham ought to be disconnected, that he disapproved of his sisters publications, but he thinks Mr. Simms language most insulting to her, & that he would notice it, but he hopes you or Judge O\'92Neal[l]\'a0 will this winter\'a0 write a peice about his ancestors, disconnected with William Cunningham, & if so he will not do anything, says he regards you as a personal & family friend, & wishes you & Judge O\'92Neal[l]\'a0 to give him your opinions, & talk together on the subject.\'a0 He begs you to interest yourself in the selection of Aldrich for Barnwell, & Cochran for Abbeville.\'a0 I wrote to Pamela last night.\'a0 I had nothing else to do, & thought she would like to hear from me.\'a0 I did not mention Johns letter, as perhaps he would think I ought not to have opened it, but there were no secrets in it.\'a0 I have now written you a long letter.\'a0 I will write or send a message by someone going to Pickens, & you must write me when you think you will be back.\'a0 Stay as long as it is necessary.\'a0 If you can you must go & see Frances.\'a0 I would like to hear of her & her children, & she would regard it as an attention.\'a0 A North American Review has come containing a Review of Mr. Simms works, in which he is spoken of most disparagingly.\'a0 I long to see you.\'a0 I met Mr. Perry Duncan yesterday going to Georgia after his Wife.\'a0 Susan asked Mrs. Spears if Mr. Spears had any thoughts of accepting the Academy.\'a0 She said, no indeed, that after taking so much pains to acquire the arduous profession of the Law he was not going to give it up\'a0 to keep school, & besides he had refused much better offers than this one &\'85said seemed almost offended\'a0 at the question., but don\'92t mention this.\'a0 I have written in a great hurry, so good bye my husband & believe me as ever, Yours, Liz\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will now write you a letter & send it by Mr. Elford who goes to Pickens tomorrow.\'a0 It is more convenient to send it to him than to Mr. Spears, being so much nearer.\'a0 We are all quite well.\'a0 Frank is now I think as well as ever.\'a0 He eats a good deal, but seems to experience no bad effect from it, & as he only eats wholesome things, I do not think it will injure him.\'a0 He talks a good deal of you, & is impatient for your return, as all of us are, but though missing you so much, I am glad you should be detained by \ul business\ulnone , so do not return one\'85before you ought to.\'a0 Never leave while there is the \ul least\ulnone  \ul probability\ulnone  of your getting business, as that is our support.\'a0 I am anxious you should have as much of it as possible.\'a0 Among some visits I paid yesterday, I went to see Mrs. Elford & I saw Mr. Elford.\'a0 I liked him very much. He says the lawyers here are very anxious you should be made Judge, as it would be to their interest, throwing your business into their hands.\'a0 My dear husband there is nothing that would please me more, than that you should be elevated to the bench, & if there is the least probability of your succeeding you must try for it, & a Chancellor would be the very thing for you.\'a0 There will be a good many vacancies on the bench soon.\'a0 Judge Johnson, Richardson & Harper, so I should think you stand as good a chance as any one else of succeeding one of them.\'a0 So you must let yourself be talked of in reference to it.\'a0 You are now as much from home as a Judge is, & have much more disagreeable duties to perform, & not so well paid, particularly now, when Law business is scarce, & a Judge is more respectable than anyone.\'a0 I prefer it to being a Member of Congress.\'a0 You must make exertions yourself to get the office.\'a0 You must not expect to have it given to you without your trying for it, but don\'92t mention any of this & we will talk about it when you come home.\'a0 I went to the wedding with Mr. & Mrs. Town[e]s.\'a0 Susan or Mr. McBee did not go.\'a0 They were neither of them well, & even otherwise, she could not have left the baby, Mamma being sick also.\'a0 The room was crowded, only one being opened to receive the company.\'a0 I could not see half the persons who were there, but it was not such a general invitation.\'a0 As to Butlers wedding party, you know the whole village were at that, but at this one only the persons I expect that Mrs. Thompson invited.\'a0 I spent a pleasant evening, but not as pleasant as if you had been with me.\'a0 I did not feel so independent as I would have felt with you.\'a0 I was near Mrs. Poinsett almost the whole evening, & Mr. Poinsett & Genl Thompson handed me in to supper,\'a0 Many inquiries were made after you.\'a0 I told them you were attending to your business, while they were pleasuring it.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson said you ought to have come.\'a0 I thought she looked\'85, & she looks badly very thin.\'a0 I think she has been sick.\'a0 I expect she felt sadly at giving up to another her only daughter.\'a0 Genl Thompson said his head felt turned the whole evening.\'a0 The bride looked pretty, but very thin.\'a0 Mr. Edward Earle & Miss Calhoun seem to like each other very much.\'a0 I dare say that will be a match.\'a0 Mr. Sam Earle was not there.\'a0 He was invited, but Mrs. Harrison did not send him his invitation, so he did not know he had received one.\'a0 If he had received it, he would have gone, for he wished to go.\'a0 Mrs. Mays & the Miss Maxwells who were staying at his house went; was it not strange in Mrs. Harrison.\'a0 There were 6 bridesmaids & Groomsmen.\'a0 Mrs. Butler Thompson does not look as if she intended to increase her family.\'a0 Some say it is a mistake, but I suppose not, as those who ought to know, say that she does.\'a0 You say Genl Thompson told you she did.\'a0 She has only taken a long time about it.\'a0 I have told you as much about the wedding as I have room to. Last night it commenced raining, & has been raining hard all day.\'a0\'a0 It has now stopped, so I hope tomorrow will be clear, to allow me to go to Church. & you to travel, for you cannot have travelled today.\'a0 I am glad you have taken some notes, but would much rather the money.\'a0 Perhaps if you had \ul urged\ulnone , you could have got the money.\'a0 The servants I suppose at the farm are doing what you told them.\'a0 Mine here are doing well.\'a0 Elizas John is much better.\'a0\'a0 She says she will\'a0 soon come home, \'85really I have no money, & now as I am economizing have so little work for her to do, that I will be sorry when she comes.\'a0 If it is any conven[ience] to you this winter, Mary can stay at the farm, Eliza iron & do what little work we have, & Delia attend to the house.\'a0\'a0 I am now really e[cono]mizing. The bill you left me would at the end of this week have been almost unbroken, if it had not been for paying Mr. Pickwell for mending Watch & Jewelry.\'a0 I did not spend the usual sum in Butter,\'a0 Mr. Roberts not having brought any.\'a0 When you are \ul Judge\ulnone , we will spend 1000 & put up 1000 every year, so that by the time our children grow up, we will be able to give them every advantage, I will not be left destitute.\'a0 Now it is always uncertain what you will make, & you have to beg the people to pay you, but then you will have a certain income, receive it without begging, & be independent of the people, but I need not urge the advantages to induce you to win the place, for you cant be so indifferent to your own interest & your family, as not to wish & try for it if you thought there was a possibility of your getting it.\'a0 Four letters came last night, & all electioneering letters, except one from Mr. Thompson of Washington about the Shirts.\'a0 He says he is mortified at his having received the money when you had not received the shirts, that he thought they reached you safely, that he will remit you the money, & asks in what manner he shall do it.\'a0 The postage on the letters were paid.\'a0 A\'85came & other papers.\'a0 The mail before a\'85letter came from Mr. Pettigru, begging you to interest yourself in Col. Keiths reappointment as City Register.\'a0 Col. Keith had requested him to write to you.\'a0 You can write him.\'a0 Col. Keith is connected with you, so of course you would interest yourself in him.\'a0 Mamma received a letter from Alston about her business.\'a0 He gave her some good advice such as you have often told me about her breaking in upon her Capital, but she did not like his advice at all, was hurt that he should not think her economical.\'a0 She will soon receive money enough from her income to pay Mr. Hoke.\'a0 Her house was invested in Mr. Tuppers bond, & she will receive that interest.\'a0 Poor Mamma has had a dreadful sore throat & fever with it.\'a0 She is now getting better.\'a0 Mrs. Duboc is staying with them to help nurse her.\'a0 Fam[ily] is quite well.\'a0 Mr. Luther has been there the greater part of the week.\'a0 I have no room to write more.\'a0 The children are asleep.\'a0Willie is still head. He makes no fuss now learning his lesson.\'a0 Mr. McNutt says he ought to miss & let the other boys get up & he skips all about to try to make him miss & tries to cheat him & tell him he has spelt the words wrong, but Willie says Mr.McNutt says he cant cheat him.\'a0 The Miss Ramseurs used to make me go\'85, said I allowed the girls no chance of getting up.\'a0 Take care of yourself.\'a0 Come back safe, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have but a few moments to write to you.\'a0 I have not heard from you yet, & would have been\'85hearing an accident had happened to the Rail Road Cars, Sunday, but this morning saw your name mentioned in the paper as having presented some petition in the Legislature, so I know you must have arrived safely.\'a0 I have no conveniences for writing, & have but this one blotted sheet, perhaps not for a week to come to write on, so you may expect to hear from me very seldom.\'a0 Monday I dined at Aunt Haynes, & spent a very pleasant day.\'a0 Last night I took tea at Mrs. Henry Pinckney\'92s.\'a0 There were about 30 persons there.\'a0 It was quite pleasant.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney said he saw you at the City Hall, & tried to speak to you but it was so crowded, he could not get near enough to shake hands.\'a0 I was also invited to Mrs. Ancrums, but I was engaged to Mrs. Pinckney\'92s.\'a0 Tonight I was invited to take tea at the Elliotts , but it is so cold & the wind blowing so high, that I have excused myself.\'a0 Tomorrow I am to dine at Aunt Brewtons.\'a0 My present plan is to stay here about 2 weeks, then go to Columbia & stay 2 days, & then return to Greenville unless E\'85 goes to her brother Isaac, & Aunt Eliza asks me to stay with her, & then I will stay longer in Charleston.\'a0 I sent a message to Miss Rodgers, & wished I could have gone to have seen her but it was out of my power, she stayed so far up.\'a0 She was to leave today.\'a0 I have been at a great deal more expense as regards clothing than I expected to.\'a0 Charleston is now so fashionable a place, that coming from the country, one has to brush up a good deal.\'a0 I will never come again except with a plenty of money, & as that perhaps will never be the case, I hardly think I will see Charleston again.\'a0 I am sure my dear husband you have been very liberal to me, when you were so straightened & I am much indebted to you.\'a0 The children are quite well.\'a0 Willie behaves the worst of all.\'a0 He is a boy that does not care what is thought of him, so he behaves just as badly among strangers as he does at home, but I hope he will improve.\'a0 The weather is now very disagreeable, cold & windy.\'a0 I have written to Mamma but once.\'a0 It is only when I am perfectly at leisure, that I can write with care, & I have been obliged to shop every day, which is very fatiguing.\'a0 Aunt Anna has made me comfortable, but I would have enjoyed myself much more at Aunt Eliza\'92s, for she possesses a spirit congenial with my own, & if ever I come again, I will stay with her.\'a0 Still Aunt Anna has been quite kind, & I do not feel as if I was imposing on her.\'a0 I am now writing in the same room with my Aunts, & the children running about shaking the table, so I hardly know what I am writing.\'a0 You must be careful how you express yourself in peices to be published.\'a0 Today I read your Rail Road speech, & you said in it, that the best part of the population emigrated & left behind the paupers & drones.\'a0 You ought to be very careful [page torn]\'85dieu now my dear husband.\'a0 It is getting [word obscured; page torn].\'a0 I have written in a great hurry [word obscured] not know when I can write again.\'a0 Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P. I told Willie what I had written about him.\'a0 He says I must rub it out.\'a0 I told him I would let it stay in, but tell you he was going to be a good boy.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have heard from you but once, & this is the third letter I am writing to you, & I literally have no time to write.\'a0\'a0 I am now seated in the Dining room with my Aunts & the children who are playing about, & making a great noise.\'a0 Day before yesterday I dined at Aunt Brewtons, yesterday at Aunt Eliza\'92s, & today I dine at Aunt Emily\'92s.\'a0 I returned some of my visits yesterday, so what with visiting, Shopping & Dining out, I have no time to myself.\'a0 When Aunt Eliza thought I was to stay at the Hotel, she felt so sorry about it, that El\'85 proposed to cousin Isaac that she should stay with him at once, & then I would have stayed with Aunt Eliza, but cousin Isaac received a letter from Richard Trapier saying he & his family were coming on, so on that account Elo\'85 was obliged\'a0 to continue at Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 They were glad I came to Aunt Anna\'92s instead of staying at the Hotel.\'a0 Aunt E\'85 is so hospitable.\'a0 As you are the Chairman of Finance & Banks, I hope you will act as regards the Bank as the Upper Country people\'a0 wish.\'a0 I do not see your name as a Candidate for Judge.\'a0 Even though not a Candidate, you ought to have your name brought forward, for you have more right to it I am sure than Mr. Wardlaw of Edgefield.\'a0 I would rather you be a judge than anything.\'a0 I would have been delighted if you had been made President of the Senate.\'a0 My present plan is to leave here Monday week, go to Columbia & remain there Tuesday & Wednesday & then go on to Greenville & arrive there Friday.\'a0 By that time the Legislature will have sat nearly 3 weeks, so I will get home only a few days before you do.\'a0 I will write you again positively what day you must meet me at the Columbia Depository. & if you cannot afford for us to stay in Columbia, we will go on immediately to Greenville.\'a0 I am enjoying myself very much, & have been even more friendly treated by my friends, than I expected, but as I am staying with Aunt Anna, & not \ul boarding\ulnone , perhaps I had better not stay longer than Monday week.\'a0 I have been with her the two weeks, & may remain a day or two longer, but I will write you again positively what day to meet me at the cars.\'a0 If you can arrange any better plan for me than I have mentioned you must write me.\'a0 The children are quite well.\'a0 We have had some very cold weather, which I do not like at all.\'a0 I went yesterday to see Mrs. Dehon.\'a0 Mr. Trapier had some difficulty with his congregation about Confirmation.\'a0 They would not give up to him, so he sent in his resignation & they have accepted it.\'a0 He wished the old members who have been communing 20 & 30 years, & who have never been confirmed, to come forward now & have it done or he would not let them commune.\'a0 They thought it unnecessary to be confirmed at this late day, so would not consent, 20 or 30 years ago there was no Bin\'85 in S. Carolina, so very few of the old members have been confirmed.\'a0 I am\'a0 going this morning to Klinck\'92s to select the Groceries.\'a0 I have not yet had a chance to do so.\'a0 I have had two dresses made up instead of one which I intended when you left.\'a0 My friends persuaded me to; thought I needed both, & wished me to look very fashionable.\'a0 My bonnet also I have been obliged to have done up, & some clothes made for Anna & Frank.\'a0 These things have taken the greatest part of my money, so that I am now quite straightened.\'a0 However I can get along, only I will not be able to carry as many presents back to Greenville as I hoped to, & would desire.\'a0 I feel grateful to you my dear husband for all your kindness to me & will try & return it by being a good wife & very economical when I go back.\'a0 All I ask of you is, to be very careful in your course in the Legislature, & do nothing to make yourself unpopular among your Constituents, & try to be a Judge\'92s wife, & you have as many claims to the bench as anyone else, only you must not be too modest & keep back but present your claims openly.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P. I write in a great hurry, with a bad pen, & expecting Aunt Emily\'92s carri[a]ge every moment.\'a0 I have been able to write but once to Mamma so you must excuse this uninteresting letter.\

	I have now returned from church.\'a0 I went to St. Michael with my Aunts.\'a0 I heard Mr. Trapier Keith.\'a0 Mr. Trapier who has resigned sat in one of the pews.\'a0 He must have felt strange to be there instead of in the pulpit preaching.\'a0 Dr. Croft has just been here to pay a visit.\'a0 He is on his way to St. Helena.\'a0 He asked if you had written anything about his case.\'a0 This afternoon I am going to the Hugonot church with Aunt M\'85 McCall.\'a0 I spent a very pleasant day yesterday at Aunt Emily\'92s.\'a0 She Gave each of the children a toy, & Aunt Sarah Hayne who you know lives with her, gave me a China cup & saucer.\'a0 Aunt Susan Hayne (Mrs. Wm Hayne) has given Anna a dress & me a Jar of Sweat meats.\'a0 I wrote you I would leave here Monday week.\'a0 I think perhaps I will remain here a day or two longer, but some day week after the following week, I will leave, & will write you that you may meet me at the Depository.\'a0 With regard to my funds I will tell you how they stand.\'a0 My dresses being made up, hat trimmed, childrens clothes made, & some necessaries bought left me with so little I foiund I would not be able to pay for the making up of the stools & the shoes, of which I had 3 pr, 1 for Ann & 2 for myself.\'a0 So I went to Mr. Enston the cabinet maker & told him I could not pay for the stools now, but would when we sent money for our Groceries, & if he preferred not waiting for the money, I would not have the stools made up at present.\'a0 He said he would wait for it.\'a0 I also went to the Shoe makers & took back the shoes, & will have them made up another time.\'a0 I would like to have had more money, there are so many things I see that I would like to get, that it would take a great deal of money to supply my wants.\'a0 I hope I will be able to get a few presents for Greenville friends, & something for the children.\'a0 I would like also to have made a present to the Aunts with whom I am staying, but if I am not able, the pincushions & the stool I have given them lately will answer.\'a0 All the money you can get now, you will have to keep to pay your Grocery bill, so you must be very economical.\'a0 I yesterday selected the groceries, & I expect it will be a high bill.\'a0 As for having my bust taken, I will not consent.\'a0 A portrait is what I wish, & for a little more I could have that taken.\'a0 Besides you have not the money to pay for it.\'a0 I am glad you have had yours taken, but I do not wish mine.\'a0 All the money you can spare, you may spend in paying\'a0 our board in Columbia, for I would like to stay there several days, as long as you could afford.\'a0 Should I may never be there again, & wish to see everything.\'a0 You must wait & go to the Theatre with me.\'a0 I would like very much to go to the Theatre.\'a0 Write me at what house you think I will stay. You can stay at the Congaree as your room is engaged there & I at some other house, if you do not wish to leave the Congaree.\'a0 Mrs. Martin has much more time to write than I have.\'a0 She is not engaged as I am, visiting, shopping. & dining out.\'a0 Write good letters for the Mountaineer.\'a0 At any rate you must not be lower than District Senator, but Judge I prefer, & if you can be elected you must be.\'a0 Dr. Croft says you could be.\'a0 I believe I would be almost too happy.\'a0 Then I wish I were with you in Columbia to electioneer for you.\'a0 The Mantle would not fall on a worthier than yourself.\'a0 Your good judgement must direct you.\'a0 My Aunts send their love. The children are well.\'a0 I write in a great hurry.\'a0 I should think you could find out before the election comes on whether you could be elected or not,.\'a0 You must act as \ul you\ulnone  \ul think\ulnone  \ul best\ulnone .\'a0 E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you last night\'85third one, & having a few moments to spare, I will spend the time in writing to you.\'a0 I am in the Dining room with my Aunts, the children also are playing about.\'a0 We have just done breakfast,\'a0 I am today to dine at Aunt Susan Hayne\'92s.\'a0 We will then have dined with all I expected to dine with.\'a0 On my way there, I intend stopping to see Mrs. Dickson, & Mrs. Ramsay, who both live high up.\'a0 I yesterday \'85ed some visits with Aunt Anna & Martha.\'a0 I paid 8, 4 persons \'85 at home, & 4 persons out.\'a0 While I was visiting, a great many came to see me, though so many come, I see very few, for I am out when they come to see me, & they are out when I return the visits, so I do not expect to see half of my friends.\'a0 We yesterday went to see Mrs. Poinsett, & at same time she came to see us, so we missed of each other.\'a0 I have spent my time much more pleasantly than I expected, have been treated very kindly, & like Charleston exceedingly.\'a0 There are few who come so well situated as I am, for I abound in relations, friends, & acquaintances.\'a0 I mean to try & persuade Mamma to come down next Spring.\'a0 She has so many \ul intimate\ulnone  friends, that she would find it \'85 pleasant than I do.\'a0 I regret that she ever left Charleston, for though she does not think so, I think she would have been much happier here among her friends who she has known from childhood, & among her relations \'85 I believe are really attached to her.\'a0 My interest & duty fixes me in Greenville, & I am perfectly satisfied to live there, & If I can only pay a visit now & then to Charleston, I will be quite contented.\'a0 I will \'85 all the year, so as to afford to come.\'a0 Aunt Anna has made me more welcome than I expected, so in future when she invites me, I will not hesitate to accept.\'a0 Aunt Eliza is so hospitable, that I would not mind staying with her at any time, & if Eloisa had not been with her I would have divided my time with her, so the next time I come, Eloisa will not be with her.\'a0 Eloisa is now more cheerful than she was \'85 \ul first\ulnone  & more affectionate.\'a0 At first she was so very grave, that it \'85 appear cold, but her affection was so great & so sudden, she must have felt it keenly.\'a0 I went Sunday afternoon to the Huguenot church.\'a0 It is a beautiful church built in the Gothic style.\'a0 Aunt Mary McCall asked me to drink tea with her, but as Aunt Anna would have been expecting me, I did not stay.\'a0 Next Sunday I will go to the Circular church, the church in which we were all baptized, & I would like also to go to St. Philips where my paternal relations are buried.\'a0 I saw in St. Michaels church yard Uncle Roberts Tombstone, the handsomest one there.\'a0 The children are well, & behave better than they did.\'a0 I have been quite well.\'a0 Sarah the Milliner told me, she had sent some bonnets to Columbia for Mrs. Walker & her daughter, so I suppose Mrs. Walker wishes to try her captivating charms there.\'a0 Eliza Thompson leads a more sober life now than before she was married.\'a0 If she was single, she would have been in Columbia.\'a0 Several persons here have asked me if Genl. Thompson\'a0 was not opposed to the match, that they heard he disliked both of his childrens matches.\'a0 I am decidedly of the opinion that if a lady cannot marry \ul well\ulnone , she had better not marry at all.\'a0 In Charleston I see so many respectable single ladies, that it may be much more respectable to remain single than to marry one unworthy of you, for a lady rises or sinks to the level of her husband.\'a0 With regard to leaving Charleston, I have not yet determined when next week to leave.\'a0 I would like to reach Greenville one Mail before the Members go up.\'a0 If I knew what day the Legislature adjourns, I would then exactly determine.\'a0 As it is, I think I will leave one day next week, but I will write you what day it is as I know you cannot afford I should stay long in Columbia, & I do not care to stay more than one or two days.\'a0 I merely wish to see you in the Senate, & take a peek at the House of Representatives, so as to see how things are conducted.\'a0 I would rather have the money that it would take to pay our board there, to spend in things here.\'a0 I do not wish my bust taken at all, & do not intend to have it.\'a0 I would like my portrait taken, when you can afford it.\'a0 Aunt Emily had hers taken by Sully.\'a0 It looks like her, & yet is a beautiful picture, much prettier than she is.\'a0 I believe he takes good likenesses, but also \'85tters.\'a0 So he is just the painter I would like.\'a0 His painting is [page torn] is so soft & fine. The one Mr. Barclay took of you was so course. I have not been able to buy any clothes for the servants, my money having given out.\'a0 If you think I had better buy them here, you must send me some money, & I will buy them.\'a0 We will have to get them as soon as we go to Greenville. So it would be\'85to get them here at a wholesale store.\'a0 If you have not the money I would have a bill made of them, & you would send the money when you get home in Greenville.\'a0 I expect Mr. Lawton where I would get them, would be perfectly willing to do so . so write me \ul immediately\ulnone , if I may get them.\'a0 If you would send me 10 or 15 dollars for \ul my\ulnone  \ul own\ulnone  use, I would be very grateful, but if you have it not, you must not send it.\'a0 To make up for all the expense I have put you at I will try & be a most devoted wife.\'a0 I hope some time or other we will have something left us by our kind friends.\'a0 Aunt Harriet told me yesterday that a maid [page torn] some years ago, & who if she had lived, would be [page torn], always intended for me, that everything she had should be mine, & I suppose she meant my sisters also, for I would not wish a difference made between me & them.\'a0 She has a woman now at the point of death, & the woman has 2 children 4 & 2 years old.\'a0 I yesterday went to Klincks for a Jar of preserved Ginger, & gave it to Aunt Anne.\'a0 As I was staying with her, I thought I ought to give her something.\'a0 She seemed pleased with it.\'a0 Before I go away I will give her something else a box of Prunes, Raisins or something of that kind & I also wish to give Aunt Martha & Aunt Harriet my other Aunts I have given Pincushions to, which is sufficient.\'a0 It is only because I am staying with these Aunts that I give them anything.\'a0 You must excuse this\'85letter.\'a0 It is the first time I have written on paper not ruled.\'a0 I will be willing to stay only \ul one\ulnone  day in Columbia, as it is so expensive boarding there.\'a0 I hope one of the Judges will be elected Senator so as to leave another vacancy on the bench, & then you must certainly be elected Judge.\'a0 If your prospects are favorable, I do not wish Mr. Rhett, Davie or Pickens elected Senator or Hammond either.\'a0 I hope you [final line llegible]. I have not seen either of the Greenville Representatives mentioned once in the papers.\'a0 Be careful & not be too independent & say things to injure you.\'a0 I am sure Greenville ought to be indebted to you for being willing to serve them.\'a0 What could such a Senator as Dr. Sullivan do to benefit her.\'a0 With such members the Upper country would be trampled on.\'a0 The Volunteers I believe now are very lukewarm.\'a0 Is Mr. Jones ready for service.\'a0 I believe he was a volunteer.\'a0 I must now dress & get ready to go out.\'a0 I have not heard from Greenville once, & know of nothing that is going on there.\'a0 Adieu my dear husband & believe that your Wife loves you more & more, E.F.P. P.S. I am ashamed t send this letter, but you must take such or\'85.\'a0 I will write whenever I can.\'a0 When I do not write, know that I have not the time.\'a0 I think it would be just as well to go in debt for servants clothes & send the money when you send Klincks, & send me 10 or 15 dollars for my use, & if you are able to send it send it in your next letter, but if you have it not, I do not expect it [page torn] I hope you will be able to send 5 dollars [final line illegible] If they did not charge for Frank, I would have 3 or 4 dollars more for my use, but I will give it to you.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote to you yesterday, but having a few moments to spare this morning, I will write again, for I expect you will not think you can hear too often.\'a0 It is before breakfast.\'a0 My Aunts have not come down yet.\'a0 Frank is upstairs with Delia, & Willie & Anna are playing about the room.\'a0 I have just been reading the Newspaper.\'a0 I see a bill has been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Manning appropriating 20000 dollars for the Volunteers.\'a0 You were one of that Committee.\'a0 I am certain your Clients will think you most extravagant, for 20,000 is too large a sum for that purpose; 5 or 10,000 would have been enough.\'a0 You must not be prodigal in spending the peoples money.\'a0 I see also a resolution has been introduced by Mr. Felder relating to the Bank.\'a0 I approve entirely of them, & recollect \ul you\ulnone  said the bank ought to be divided.\'a0 I do not undertake to advise you on the subject, but I can give you a little information regarding it.\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Colcock yesterday, & speaking of Banks, she said, that her husband, though a President of the bank used to say, that Banks were a \ul curse\ulnone  to the country.\'a0 I think Mr. Felder is right.\'a0 All the affairs of the Bank ought to be inquired into, who is indebted to it, & so on.\'a0 Mrs. Colcock says persons who borrow from the bank think they ought not to pay, because it is a \ul bank\ulnone , & if their property is sold to pay the debt, they get vexed.\'a0 You are Chairman of the Committee on Banks, so you must weigh well all these considerations & determine what to do.\'a0 I do not presume to advise you, but my \ul instinct\ulnone  tells me Mr. Felders resolutions on will, & as womans instinct is worth a good deal.\'a0 There is nothing[page torn]present I know of\'a0 to benefit you with my counsel, so I will co\'85.\'a0 My situation has changed.\'a0 The children are now around me pressing me & making so much noise I will soon have to stop writing.\'a0 My Aunts also have come down, & breakfast will soon be ready.\'a0 Just after breakfast, I am going out.\'a0 So this is the only time I will have today to write.\'a0 I dined yesterday at Aunt Susan Haynes & spent a pleasant day.\'a0 In the evening Aunt Eliza & Eloisa & Sue came up & took tea with her.\'a0 Eliza dined there.\'a0 Tomorrow or the next day I dine at Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 I have not yet determined what day to leave, but in all probability one day next week.\'a0 Cousin Isaac ought to have been in Columbia yesterday, but his wife is sick, & he does not know when he can go.\'a0 She is within 2 months of her confinement, & has been taken prematurely sick, & perhaps she may be confined shortly, so in this situation he cannot leave here.\'a0 I am sorry your bust is an ugly one, but I hope before it is finished, it will improve.\'a0 If you bust is a correct likeness, I will be glad you have had it taken, for your portrait is a poor one, but I do not admire busts, & have no wish to have mine taken.\'a0 A portrait of myself I would like to have taken very much.\'a0 I hope to hear soon from you, & must now close this letter.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your welcome letter containing the 25 dollars.\'a0 It was several days since I heard from you, so I was very glad to hear from you again.\'a0 I dined yesterday at Aunt Mary\'92s & spent a very pleasant day.\'a0 Aunt Anna & herself gave each of the children a present, & Aunt Sarah gave Mamma, Susan, Ann & myself a basket apeice. Aunt Brewton has also made us presents, & Mrs. O Driscoll, & Aunt Emily each of the children, & Aunt Sarah has given me a cup, & Aunt Susan Anna a dress.\'a0 Aunt Mary wishes to keep Mary all winter, & Aunt S\'85 wishes her also.\'a0 It would be a great advantage for her to be with her Aunts, who would take so much pain with her & if she were willing I would leave her, but she says she will not stay.\'a0 My friends have all been very kind to me, & I have passed my time even more pleasantly than I expected.\'a0 I would like to stay here part of next week so will not be in Columbia to attend Commencement, the Inauguration of the Governor &c.\'a0 I will leave here some day next week, perhaps not until Saturday, then I will stay in Columbia Sunday & Monday, & leave for Greenville Tuesday.\'a0 I will reach there the 16
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of December, & about that time I suppose the legislature will adjourn, & you will soon follow me.\'a0 You need not be uneasy about the children on the Rail Road.\'a0 It will be so cold, that the doors & windows will all be shut.\'a0 I do not care to go under the protection of anyone, for gentlemen always find it troublesome attending to ladies, unless they are particularly interested in them.\'a0 Arthur Hayne goes up tomorrow.\'a0 He attends Commencement day, taking his Degree of Master of Arts.\'a0 Col. Isaac Hayne does not know when he will go, his wife is sick,\'a0 Alston Hayne has gone to the West, to attend to some property his father owned there.\'a0 The fire bell is now ringing., & the Planters Hotel, corner of Church & Queen st is on fire.\'a0 Today I am to pay visit with Aunt Anna.\'a0 She has been very kind to us; indeed all of our friends have been, & Charleston has appeared even better than I expected.\'a0 It is pleasant to be among so many relations & friends.\'a0 Last night when I returned from Aunt Mary\'92s, I found the table covered with cards of persons who had been to see me, Miss Rutledge, Mrs. Fraser who is Mrs. Davie\'92s mother, Mrs. Dubose, Rev. Mr. Trapier, Julia Horry &c.\'a0 Anna thinks everybody is her cousin.\'a0 I met Mrs. Fraser in the streets yesterday, & after we had parted, Anna said is that a cousin?\'a0 I said yes, then I told her I was going to see Mrs. O Driscoll, she said, is she a friend, Aunt, or cousin?\'a0 I also met Mrs. Seabrook who staid at the Mansion house with us.\'a0 She has just returned from Europe.\'a0 She asked me to go & see her.\'a0 We have had warm pleasant weather, but today is rather cold.\'a0 I received a letter from Susan yesterday.\'a0 It was not directed to the care of Wm Ed, so had not been put in his box, & had been about a week in the Post Office.\'a0 I sent Delia to the Office, thinking there must have been a mistake, & that there was a letter for me, & she accordingly brought it.\'a0 It contained cheerless news.\'a0 Mamma was sick in bed with Rheumatism , & not able to put her feet to the ground, her feet & ankles being particularly affected.\'a0 Ninny had to lift her in & out of bed.\'a0 Mamma is really afflicted more so than any member of her family, & it seems as if her afflictions are to have no end.\'a0 Our household Susan said were well.\'a0 Mrs. Erwin Jones was really a mischief maker to tell Genl Thompson what Col. Herndon said, & from Genl Thompson\'92s noticing the remark, it seems as if he felt it, & knew it to be true.\'a0 It would have been just as well not to have noticed it.\'a0 I do not particularly like either Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Walker or Jane, & if you have no objections, it is not more expensive, I will stay at Clarks.\'a0 You know Mrs. Walker I do not fancy at all, & do not care to be with her.\'a0 You say nothing in your last letter about Judge.\'a0 I hope you have not given up your claims for that office.\'a0 If Judge Butler is elected Senator, there will be two vacancies on the bench, & \ul you\ulnone  I should think would [page torn] get one, so I hope if your prospects are the least favorable & I would think they were as good as anyone else\'92s. you would [word obscured] for it, set about it in good earnest, & ascertain if you cannot be elected, get someone to write a peice in the Carolinian nominating you, & I am sure you would be elected, & how much pleasure it would give me.\'a0 My utmost wish for you would be answered, & I would remain perfectly satisfied for the future, so if you think my dear, you could be elected you must be.\'a0 I see the Courier every morning, & the Patriot every evening, & see you mentioned very often.\'a0 This morning I read an account of your R[ail] Road speech.\'a0 I think you are a very important member of the Senate & therefore it is I think you could be elected Judge as soon as anyone.\'a0 You might even aspire to be State Senator, but Judge which is an office for life, & with a good Salary, I even prefer.\'a0 Unless Judge Butler is well off, I wonder at his caring to leave the bench.\'a0 The children are well, & behave better than they. Anna is a particular favorite among her Aunts on the Hayne side.\'a0 I think Mamma\'92s sisters are remarkably fine ladies, & have uncommon manners & characters also.\'a0 Indeed her whole connexion on that side is distinguished for worth & excellence in every respect.\'a0 My other Aunts are also excellent, but their minds are not as good as the Hayne family, but I love them very much.\'a0 Aunt Susan Hayne (Uncle William\'92s wife[)], says I look exactly as Mamma did at my age.\'a0 She & Mamma used to be intimate when young.\'a0 Everybody says I look well, & have not altered in the least.\'a0 Aunt Mary was saying yesterday you had taken good care of me.\'a0 They say I must come down often to see them, but it [is] so expensive I do not expect to come often.\'a0 I hear the whole of the inside of the Planters Hotel is burnt.\'a0 It is just opposite the Hugonot church.\'a0 Tomorrow I go to the Circular church with Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P. I am very much obliged to you for the money.\'a0 I do not think it will be enough to buy [page torn] clothes, & you do not say whether I shall get them & have the [page torn] sent to you & you send the money when you have it, so I will [page torn] until I hear from you, unless I find the money will buy [page torn].\'a0 I wish to get a present...for Susan & Ann Warley &c. & my [page torn] whom I am staying.\'a0 You are as kind to me my dear h[usband] [page torn] you are too generous.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you last night, in which you mention that Scarlet fever is prevailing in Columbia.\'a0 If you are uneasy about the children, I will pass immediately through Columbia, & to do so I must leave here Friday, so as to go in the Saturday stage to Greenville.\'a0 Frank has had the Scarlet fever, & yet the other children did not take it from him so that it is not always contagious, & if the children are kept in the house while I am in Columbia, I think they would be safe.\'a0 Still if you are uneasy, & write me by todays Mail, that you wish me to pass only the night of my arrival in Columbia, I will leave here Friday, & go on Saturday to Greenville.\'a0 So either Friday or Saturday evening I will be in Columbia.\'a0 It will depend on what I hear from you this evening.\'a0 So the election for Chancellor came off yesterday.\'a0 I expect this evening to hear of your defeat, but I cannot be surprised at it when, you say you did not mention even to the members that you were a Candidate.\'a0 You were wrong then & foolish too, for though you need not electioneer in an \ul ungentlemanly\ulnone  way, still if you are a Candidate, you are justifiable\'a0 in using every honorable means for your election.\'a0 If you do not intend to \ul try\ulnone  to \ul succeed\ulnone , you ought not to be a Candidate.\'a0 The world will only know of your defeat, & not know that you \ul tried\ulnone  to be defeated.\'a0 Still another chance remains, the best chance you have ever had.\'a0 I hope you do not continue in the \ul foolish\ulnone  \ul notion\ulnone  that you are not to oppose Genl Whitner.\'a0 I don\'92t think either he or Col. Dawkins [are] fit to be Judges, & the Legislature will be doing injustice to the people to elect such.\'a0 Law business all say has diminished & that lawyers will never make what they have done.\'a0 It therefore behooves you to move earnestly to try & secure a way of providing for your family, so if you think you chance is \ul better\ulnone  than Genl Whitners or Col. Dawkins, do try your chance.\'a0 My dear you have always acted wrong in preferring the interest of others to your own, constituted as this world is, no one can get along who does so.\'a0 If you do not try to advance yourself & family, no one else is going to.\'a0 You ought to have told all the Members you were a Candidate< & received their pledges, for you say they would have voted for you, if they had known of it in time, I am more & more provoked when I think of it, for perhaps this would have been a very good chance if you had only done as you ought to.\'a0 Mrs. Crawford says she is certain you will one day be a Judge.\'a0 So if unsuccessful now, when Chancellor Harper & Judge Richardson resign, you must get one of their places, & as it is such an advantage to be a Candidsate a long time ahead, you must present your claims now. & tell all them you are a Candidate for the next vacancy.\'a0 But I hope then to hear this week that you have beaten Genl Whitner & Mr. Dawkins.\'a0 I am prepared to hear this evening, that Mr. DeSaussure is elected.\'a0 I am provoked at the way you have acted, not even to mention you were a Candidate.\'a0 I think you carry your high notions a little \ul too\ulnone  \ul high\ulnone .\'a0 You can never get along as long as you do so.\'a0 You could have been anything you pleased, if you had only acted wisely.\'a0 I have now seen all of my friends & relatives, spent all my money, & am willing to leave Charleston, so I do not care to remain longer than the time I have fixed upon.\'a0 If you write me, you think it safer \ul not\ulnone  to \ul remain\ulnone  in \ul Columbia\ulnone , then meet me at the Depository Friday evening, but if you say I may do as I choose, & remain two days then meet me Saturday evening.\'a0 I will go to Mrs. Lawtons today & if his goods are cheap, will get some servants clothes, & carry the bill to you.\'a0 Klinck sent his bill yesterday.\'a0 I was surprised when I saw the amount &356, but as I looked over it, I saw you had supplied yourself with Brandy, Wine, Champagne, Ale & Porter which added considerably to the amount.\'a0 The next year we can be very economical.\'a0 This year has been peculiarly expensive owing to two journeys.\'a0 This morning I am going to return 5 visits, then bid my different Aunts goodbye, then shop, & afterwards spend the day at Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 You must learn from experience, & particularly in elections, you must do as others do, & electioneer for yourself as the others do for themselves.\'a0 No one will think the less of the person elected for the means he used to gain his election.\'a0 The world will only know he \ul is\ulnone  \ul elected\ulnone , & honor him for it.\'a0 Yours affectionately, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you tonight, & though I wrote to you today, I will write again to tell you, that I will go up Friday.\'a0 Col. Isaac Hayne goes that day, & I will go under his protection, & it will then be optional with us whether to go on to Greenville Saturday morning, or remain in Columbia until Tuesday morning.\'a0 If I go Saturday I will be obliged to wait in Columbia until Tuesday, but going Friday will allow me to do as I choose, & if you think there is the least risk of the Scarlet fever, I will go on at once.\'a0 I am prepared to hear of your defeat.\'a0 I cannot but be provoked that you should have suffered your name to be used, & then done not the least thing to be elected.\'a0 I must say it was foolish conduct, & in future I hope you will never apply for an office, unless you intend to try to get it.\'a0 I think it is perfectly right to use honorable means to ensure success.\'a0 You suffered your name to be used, & yet acted in the very best way not to get votes.\'a0 Why whoever heard of such a thing. I could not help scolding, for indeed you deserve it.\'a0 The world will think we are mortified not knowing how you acted.\'a0 But you must not give up, another time I dare say you will succeed.\'a0 I spent today after shopping & visiting at Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 My most pleasant days have been spent with her & Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna, & also a delightful day I spent with Aunt Emily & Aunt Sarah.\'a0 The other days I spent out were also quite pleasant.\'a0 Mamma\'92s Sisters are uncommonly fine ladies; they have noble qualities.\'a0 When I returned home tonight, I found that Aunt Mary McCall had been to see me & left me a beautiful China Ink stand.\'a0 E\'85 gave us some presents today.\'a0 I assure you I have been most kindly treated by my friends.\'a0 Aunt Eliza was regretting today that I would not have staid with her.\'a0 She is a cheering lady, & more congenial with me than those with whom I have been staying, but my Aunts have been\'85& considering the close disposition that one of them has, I have been made more welcome that I thought I would be, but still knowing that failing, it makes me feel badly as myself & family being here, must be a \ul little\ulnone  \ul extra\ulnone  expense & that little expense, I know must be regretted.\'a0 I have been glad whenever I had an invitation out, so as to be as little expense as possible.\'a0 If I had been at Aunt Eliza\'92s, I would have staid until the adjournment, & let you come down for me, but Aunt Anna is not prepared to entertain gentlemen, & you would not have found it pleasant.\'a0 I think I have now staid long enough with her, & I will be delighted to see you, & happy to be at \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 Though my visit has \ul exceeded\ulnone  my expectations, I have had real heartfelt pleasure in being with my friends, a feeling I have not had for years, for in Greenville there is nobody with the exception of Mamma\'92s family who \ul love\ulnone  me, but here there are many.\'a0 I assure you no body in Charleston has more sincere friends than \ul Mamma\ulnone , & loving her, makes them take an interest in me.\'a0 I am sorry Mamma ever left Charleston.\'a0 She would have been saved many troubles if she had not, & it is more respectable for persons to be among their relations.\'a0 Mrs. Whitefoord Smith who in Greenville seems to be thought nothing of, in Charleston would be respected if it was only [on] account of her son, who is said to be the most distinguished preacher in the city.\'a0 Persons \ul advanced\ulnone  in life at an age that you are not apt to contract friendships, ought to remain where they are brought up.\'a0 Aunt Mary really wishes me to leave Anna with her, but Anna will not consent, or I would do it.\'a0 Aunt Mary loves little girls.\'a0 Aunt Eliza says she would be a little treasure among [word obscured] all.\'a0 You must not be mortified\'a0 at your [two words obscured] , & I suppose you are not, for from the way you acted you must have wished to be mortified.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 Your affectionate & \ul wise\ulnone  \ul better\ulnone  \ul half\ulnone , E.F.P. P.S. I would like to stay at the Congaree House, & I should think you would prefer it, for otherwise you will have to leave your lodgings, or be away from me.\'a0 I am not mortified at your defeat, & I am sure it has done you no harm, & perhaps good, as you may be thought of in future for the bench.\'a0 Still I wish you had thought soon of coming forward & been on a footing with the others & tried as hard as they did, then you might have succeeded, & I am \ul certain\ulnone  you would have beat \'85.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write you, if it is only a few lines tonight to send by Mr. Town[e]s tomorrow\'85.\'a0 I know you will be disappointed if you do not hear again.\'a0 I expected certainly to hear from you last night, & would scarcely believe the mail had come, when March returned without a letter.\'a0 My disappointment is always mingled with uneasiness, for when from home, I am always anxious to know \ul certainly\ulnone  that you are well.\'a0 Your life is so important to your family, that you must be as careful as possible of it.\'a0 I am still busy housecleaning, even now.\'a0 March is in the room, putting a peice of Furniture in its place.\'a0 We have not half got through, the white washing is finished, & the room somewhat fixed, but next week the Entries, the Staircase, the Piazza\'85all to be cleaned, the Curtains washed & put up, & other things done too numerous to mention.\'a0 There are enough dirty things to occupy a week. \'a0Monday, Delia & Mary will have to stop to wash some of the clothes, the house, all over, was shockingly dirty, the dirt seemed to me several inches thick under the Carpets.\'a0 To show you in what confusion we have been, last night when Frank fell asleep in my lap, there was not a single bed ready for him, & we had to put him in the basket of dirty clothes, where he took a comfortable nap.\'a0 I am thankful, & you ought to be, that you have not been here.\'a0 You would not have stood it.\'a0 I feel tonight, tired.\'a0 I have to work, so will be able to write you but a short letter.\'a0 You must write to me by someone returning home, any directions about your farm you can give.\'a0 I expect they are all doing as you would wish them, for I believe Jim & Charles are good fa\'85.\'a0 I sent work to Jim, that you wished him to go on planting rapidly.\'a0 Susans letters now are quite satisfactory.\'a0 She mentioned in one of her notes to Mamma, that Pinckney McBee had paid them a pleasant visit, that he kissed her, which she certainly thought a proof of regard, & on going away, he said, if he was only certain of having such a wife as she was, he would be perfectly happy.\'a0 Mr. Luther said, he had never known propriety, until he married \ul her\ulnone , & they determined her to do all in her power\'a0 to make him happy.\'a0 So I hope everything will go on smoothly.\'a0 As soon after your return as is convenient, I wish all of us to go & spend a day at the Factory.\'a0 I have seen no one, been no where, & have no news to tell you.\'a0 The only new thing I have heard is, what Mr. Hooker told me when he came to fix up the bedstead (which March could not do).\'a0 He said there were to be several more stores set up here, one by Mr. R. Duncan & Charles Elford, another by Col. Irvine & Joe Elford, & another by Mr. McBee & Frank Cox, so I think they must be anticipating the Rail Road.\'a0 The children are quite well.\'a0 Today Frank said, I rode on horse.\'a0 I said when? He said, this morning.\'a0 I said, who let you ride?\'a0 He said Pa.\'a0 I said where is Pa?\'a0 He said, up street.\'a0 He is as sweet as ever.\'a0 Mr. Luther says they are the prettiest & finest children he has ever seen.\'a0 Unfortunately a looking glass has got broken, the one that was on my table & that you had before we were married.\'a0 It was put in the Portico yesterday along with the other chamber furniture.\'a0 The wind was very high & blew it down.\'a0 I am more superstitious about that than anything else.\'a0 It makes me uneasy about you while you are away, & after you return I will be uneasy about myself.\'a0 So do be careful of yourself my dear.\'a0 It is now past 9, so good night\'a0\'a0 Yours ever, Liz P.S. Mr. Luther sent me yesterday a present of some candle wick.\'a0 As I do not make Candles, I will put it into stockings for yourself & the children.\'a0 It seems very strong.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I feel very anxious to write at once to you, to tell all that has passed \ul outwardly\ulnone  & in my \ul mind\ulnone  to you, since we parted.\'a0 We rode on after you left us, until today when we stopped near a well & eat our dinner.\'a0 Then we continued our journey & arrived at Mr. Conner\'92s at 4 oclock.\'a0 We stopped & a servant came to the gate, & on asking her if we could stay there that night, she replied, her master & mistress were both from home & she expected them back that evening, that the house was locked up, & that we would have to sit in the \ul kitchen\ulnone  until they came, so we got out & went into the \ul kitchen\ulnone , but I had not been there a \ul moment\ulnone , before I thought how \ul uncomfortable\ulnone  & \ul ridiculous\ulnone  for us to sit several hours in a kitchen, full of servants, & perhaps after all, the Master & Mistress might not return, & then what were we to do.\'a0 So before the Trunk was taken off, I asked the girl what was the next house we would stop at.\'a0 She said, either Mr. Boyd\'92s, which was 10 or 12 miles beyond, or Mr. Barksdale\'92s which was two miles from Laurens C.H.\'a0 So as the horses were tired, I determined to go to the \ul latter\ulnone  place, & right glad was I at my determination, for when we drove up to Mr. Barksdale\'92s, the house looked so comfortable, I was certain we would be well accommodated..\'a0 We asked a boy we saw, if we could stay there, & he called his Master.\'a0 As soon as I saw him, I thought of Mr. \ul Richardson\ulnone  & \ul your\ulnone  \ul cases\ulnone , but the old gentleman, a very \ul respectable\ulnone  looking person, handed us out, & carried us into the house, into a comfortable room where there were 3 ladies seated by the fire.\'a0 He said to the oldest one, a \ul motherly\ulnone  looking person, that he did not know by what \ul name\ulnone  to introduce the lady to her.\'a0 I told her my name, though I was almost afraid to.\'a0 After awhile, he said, there was a \ul Perrin\ulnone  that lived in Abbeville.\'a0 I told him I was from Greenville.\'a0 In a little while he went out of the room, & when he came back, he noticed the children, & looking at \ul Frank\ulnone , said he was the image of his \'85. & said Willie\'92s forehead was exactly like his \'85.\'a0 I expect he had found out from Jim who we were.\'a0 I sat with them, until a fire was made in another room; when they asked me to go into that room, where I staid until Supper was ready.\'a0 After supper I [word obscured] back into that room, thinking they preferred I should, but Mrs. Barksdale asked me to remain in the room with them, which I did & made myself as agreeable as I could.\'a0 We passed the most \ul comfortable\ulnone  night, I have ever passed on the \ul road\ulnone .\'a0 Everything was \ul clean\ulnone  & the cooking better than usual.\'a0 The next morning Mr. Barksdale sat with us before & after breakfast.\'a0 I thought all the time it was your \ul particular\ulnone  enemy.\'a0 I felt awkward to ask him if he was that gentleman, but on speaking of our return, & Laurens Court & soon, I took the opportunity to ask, if he was the gentleman that had the difficulty with Mr. Richardson.\'a0 He said \ul no\ulnone , it was his \ul brother\ulnone , who lived six miles above.\'a0 I said I was very sorry it had occurred.\'a0 He said he was very sorry Mr. Richardson applied to \ul you\ulnone  to defend him.\'a0 I did not say anything more, not knowing that I ought to.\'a0 After a most pleasant time spent with the family, we prepared to resume our journey.\'a0 I asked him what he charged; he said 2 dollars.\'a0 I told him that was too little; he said no, he only charged for the provisions we had used.\'a0 So after being treated kindly & behaving kindly myself we left.\'a0 We passed through Laurens village, & arrived at Mr. Cunningham\'92s Monday before dinner.\'a0 We were affectionately received, & this is the first opportunity I have had of writing to tell you so since I arrived.\'a0 Mr. McLees, the Presbyterian minister of the church in the neighborhood, was here.\'a0 He left yesterday morning.\'a0 Mrs. Beman & little Cara Yancey & Mrs. John Cunningham & children are here now.\'a0 Pamela seems as usual.\'a0 She came downstairs last evening & spent it in the dining room & today she is riding out.\'a0 I sit with her a great deal & the children run about & have not given me much trouble.\'a0 Fanny\'92s voice is hardly ever heard.\'a0 Willy sometimes seems at a loss what to do.\'a0 I have not heard them any lessons yet & intend to.\'a0 And now my dear I would be happy & contented, & pass my time pleasantly, if it were not for \ul one\ulnone  \ul thing\ulnone , &\'a0 that one thing \ul absorbs\ulnone  my \ul thoughts\ulnone  in the \ul day\ulnone , & keeps me \ul awake\ulnone  at \ul night\ulnone .\'a0 I will tell you what it is.\'a0 Soon after I got here, Mr. Cunningham asked me where I had passed the last night.\'a0 I told him at Mr. Barksdale\'92s.\'a0 He laughed & asked how I had happened to get in at the Barksdales, & then the difficulty with Mr. Richardson was mentioned.\'a0 He said he had forgotten the subject until a few days before, he was speaking with \ul Mr.\ulnone \'a0 \ul Coleman\ulnone  of this District, & he asked Mr. Coleman what he thought your prospects were in this District, & Mr. Coleman said you would have had no trouble at all, not met with \ul any\ulnone  \ul obstacle\ulnone  in the District, if it had not been for that \ul unfortunate\ulnone  \ul Richardson\ulnone  \ul affair\ulnone , but that \ul your\ulnone  appearing \ul against\ulnone  Mr. Barksdale, , had completely turned him against you & Mr. Barksdale & his family commanded \ul 500\ulnone  \ul votes\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Cunningham said he was at first surprised when he heard their influence extend[ed] to 500 votes, but when he began to think of the \ul respectability\ulnone  of the family, the \ul number\ulnone  of the \ul influential\ulnone  families with whom they were connected, many of them having been members of the Legislature, the Allens & others, & the \ul popularity\ulnone  of \ul Mr. Barksdale\ulnone , Mr. Richardson insulted, he was not surprised at it.\'a0 \ul He\ulnone  & \ul all\ulnone  \ul here\ulnone  think that Mr. Barksdale has \ul justice\ulnone  on his side, that Mr. Richardson acted with the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul impudence\ulnone , that striking his \ul negro\ulnone ; he ought to have \ul whipped\ulnone  his negro \ul himself\ulnone , & \ul apologized\ulnone  to Mr. Barksdale.\'a0 I cannot but be surprised that \ul you\ulnone  should bring a case of this kind, you might have been in honor bound to \ul defend\ulnone  Mr. Richardson in the case brought \ul against\ulnone  him, but it seems to me you ought not to have \ul indicted\ulnone  Mr. Barksdsale, you ought to have \ul declined\ulnone  this, & could have done it with perfect propriety.\'a0 I had not heard you say anything of the cases lately & had quite forgotten them.\'a0 I only hope they will be dropped, that you will drop the one you brought, & Mr. Barksdale will drop his.\'a0 But if they \ul are\ulnone  tried, I \ul pray\ulnone  & \ul beseech\ulnone  you to conduct the cases so as not to hurt Mr. Barksdale\'92s feelings.\'a0 You can be \ul just\ulnone  to your Client without being \ul unjust\ulnone  & \ul harsh\ulnone  to your \ul opponent\ulnone .\'a0 You have the \ul unjust\ulnone  side, & I am afraid your only recourse will be \ul abuse\ulnone  \ul lavished\ulnone  on the opposite party, for you deal in abuse I believe more than any other Lawyer.\'a0 You make more enemies than any Lawyer I ever heard of.\'a0 There seems to be no reason why a Lawyer should not conduct a case with zeal & ability for his \ul Client\ulnone , & yet so \ul honorably\ulnone  & \ul justly \ulnone as to satisfy even the other party.\'a0 Do my dear be on your guard in these cases, so important to your interests, the fate of the election perhaps depends on it.\'a0 I beg you not, just to show your \ul independence\ulnone \'a0 & \ul disregard\ulnone  of \ul votes\ulnone  to \ul abuse\ulnone  Mr. Barksdale & be \ul violent\ulnone  against him.\'a0 I regard it as most \ul unfortunate\ulnone  that Mr. Richardson should have applied to \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 If it had not been for this affair, Mr. John Cunningham says would have got but very few votes.\'a0 Now you have been the cause of giving him \ul 500\ulnone .\'a0 He is certainly most fortunate, electioneering \ul himself\ulnone  & \ul you\ulnone  electioneering for him.\'a0 I am so provoked with Mr. Richardson.\'a0 I wish he could be \ul well\ulnone \'a0 \ul punished\ulnone  for the trouble he has given me.\'a0 The Lower Country persons regard the Upper Country persons with contempt, & this is an instance of it.\'a0 He treated Mr. Barksdale with contempt, made his horses run away, & then ran after him with a pistol & long knife, & then indicted him .\'a0 You know Mrs. Span said their servants had been ruined at the Virginia Springs, & they behaved impudently at Mr. Simmons, & to think that all this impudent conduct, in which you had no success, & you yourself would have acted so differently, persons who had no interest in you, should have injured you in so vital a manner; you ought to have told Mr. Richardson that he had acted \ul impudently\ulnone , that he had not \ul justice\ulnone  on his side, & advised him to apologize to Mr. Barksdale. & make up the latter as well as he could.\'a0 If he had given you a fee of \ul 500\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone  to have the \ul unjust\ulnone  side, you may have been obliged to \ul defend\ulnone  Mr. Richardson, though you might as you were advised by others have declined it, but I cannot see that you were obliged to \ul bring\ulnone  an \ul unjust\ulnone  case \ul for\ulnone  him, as the indicting Mr. Barksdale for striking an impudent negro, certainly was.\'a0 Oh my dear I can only beg you for the \ul love\ulnone  you \ul bear\ulnone  your \ul Wife\ulnone , to be \ul prudent\ulnone , in the management of these cases, in which you are so \ul unfortunately \ulnone concerned, if they are \ul tried\ulnone , but I hope they will \ul never\ulnone  be tried.\'a0 My mind is relieved after expressing all these thoughts to you, but I cannot tell you how \ul provoked\ulnone  I feel with Mr. Richardson.\'a0 Little did I think, a person who I \ul never\ulnone  \ul saw\ulnone , was to become such an \ul injurious\ulnone  \ul influence\ulnone  on your fate in life, perhaps make your career in this world so entirely different, from what it otherwise would have been.\'a0 At any rate if he does not occasion your \ul defeat\ulnone , your election if it had not been for him would have been attended with so \ul little\ulnone  \ul difficulty\ulnone , the Barksdales with their 500 votes, would have gone for you.\'a0 They are connected with the Parks, Allens & I do not know who all.\'a0 The gentleman I passed the night with has 9 \ul children\ulnone  \ul gwown\ulnone , one a doctor at Laurens village, another living near him, a son in law named Parks, another named Bird.\'a0 I sincerely believe this Mr. Richardson will be the cause of your defeat, for otherwise the majority in Laurens would have elected you, for it is that District which will turn the Election.\'a0 Do write me \ul immediately\ulnone .\'a0 I long to see you, though I am vexed with you for all the trouble you cause me, for you ought to have followed the advice of your \ul friends\ulnone , & not taken the cases.\'a0 I envy Mr. Orr\'92s good fortune in having his opponent electioneering for him.\'a0 Do read this letter \ul over\ulnone , & think \ul deeply\ulnone  on it.\'a0 Write me when you will come here.\'a0 When you get to Laurens you will be able to tell how long you will be detained there.\'a0 If you can [word obscured] sooner than you thought, write to Mr. Hoke to tell Jim to come sooner than we told him, so I can go back with you.\'a0 If I go home alone, & you have no objections, perhaps I will stop at the Mr. Barksdale you have the case against & pass the night.\'a0 Perhaps I will make him your friend.\'a0 If not, I will stop at the same one I stopped at in coming here.\'a0 When \'85 find me warm on a subject, you always take the opposite side, from obstinacy, but in all the \'85 do not disregard it [portions of final line illegible], E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you a long letter yesterday, & gave you a great deal of advice, all for you own good, which I hope you will follow the reason of my writing to you again is that Mr. Cunningham this evening, said he wanted me to give you a message.\'a0 That in the management of these cases against Mr.\'a0 Barksdale you must be very\'85that you can act \ul justly\ulnone  towards your Client, but at the same time not be \ul harsh\ulnone  & \ul severe\ulnone  to your opponent, that if you have any \ul severity\ulnone  in your manner towards Mr. Barksdale. It will excite his feelings against you, to your injury, while it will be of no advantage to your Clint.\'a0 You must be \ul fair\ulnone  & \ul just\ulnone , but not \ul severe\ulnone  & \ul harsh\ulnone , & if you set them, the cases in the end may not operate against you.\'a0 So perform your \ul duty\ulnone , but do not have any harshness or severity in your\'85.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham if he can, , will go to Laurens C.H. but does not feel well, & is not certain he can go.\'a0 I like Mr. Cunningham, & particularly because he is such a friend of yours, he is a man of honor, which is saying a great deal.\'a0 I wish I had some good news to tell you, but as I have none, I will tell you some bad.\'a0 Mr. Quin came here this afternoon, & told Mr. Cunningham that he met a son of the Genl Jones who has volunteered to raise a regiment, & he told him Mr. Orr would get \ul half \ulnone of the votes in the village of Laurens.\'a0 I know he is an enemy of yours, but I am sorry to hear that this Genl Jones is a man of \ul great\ulnone  \ul influence\ulnone , a dangerous man Mr. Cunningham says.\'a0 You will think I am Jobs comforter, but really this news, & the 500 votes you are to lose on account of taking Mr. Richardsons part has so depressed me, that I feel as if I must unburden myself to you.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham thinks Mr. Orr a most insinuating person in his \ul manners\ulnone  & knowing as I do, that he will exert himself to the utmost, & that all you do, is to give votes to him 500 at a time, I cannot but be very uneasy.\'a0 Do write to me.\'a0 I have written all my thoughts now, so I will not have much more to say to you when I see you.\'a0 I am passing my time very pleasantly, & if it were not for these unfortunate cases against Mr. Barksdale, who Mr. Cunningham says has \ul immense\ulnone  \ul influence\ulnone , connected with the most \ul respectable\ulnone  families, I would be very happy.\'a0 Fanny gives me \ul no\ulnone  \ul trouble\ulnone , the other children amuse themselves running about & playing.\'a0 It is late at night.\'a0 I will conclude with one more peice of bad news.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham asked me who Genl Thompson was for, I told him he professed to be for \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 He said the reason he asked me was, that he had lately seen a Mr. Ward from Greenville a Whig who was going to support Mr. Orr.\'a0 So he wanted to know if it was owing to Genl Thompsons influence or not,\'a0 He said when he argued with Mr. Ward & told him he was astounded he should support a man from \ul Anderson\ulnone  in preference to one from his own district whose character, talents, firmness & so on were so well known as \ul yourself\ulnone  that Mr. Ward seemed warped.\'a0 So my dear all this bad news is to make up for the good news we heard before we left Greenville.\'a0 I thought I was duty bound to tell you, so as to put you on the \ul alert\ulnone , & not let you \ul deceive\ulnone  yourself.\'a0 I will close by begging you once more, to be \ul prudent\ulnone  in the management of these cases, but I cannot tell you how \ul grieved\ulnone  & \ul provoked\ulnone  I am that you are engaged in them.\'a0 Drop Mr. Richardsons the one you bought, for there is no \ul justice\ulnone  in it, & I am surprised any Lawyer but Joe Powel should bring it.\'a0 Wishing that you may have better news to tell me than I have told you.\'a0 I remain Your devoted Wife, E.F.P. I hope Mr. Cunningham will go to Court.\'a0 He is your real friend.\'a0 You will think me warm & will be inclined to go just contrary to all I have said, but, assure you this letter is written so as to give you the message Mr. Cunningham sends you on the first page.\'a0 He begged me to delete it, for he may not be able to go to Court.\'a0 I believe you are often \ul unnecessarily\ulnone  \ul severe\ulnone  in your speeches in Court, but in these cases do not be so.\'a0 You must be\'85than it is the custom for any other Lawyer to be, for I know of any other Lawyer who makes enemies of the opposite party, in \ul every\ulnone  \ul case\ulnone  he has, as you do.\

	You must be sure & pass one night here.\'a0 If you cannot come for me to go home, you must come one night during the week.\'a0 You know I am to leave here tomorrow week.\'a0 I am not going to \ul worry\ulnone  you about the election, if you will only do your \ul duty\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Orr is so far inferior to you, that if it had not been for these \ul cases\ulnone , & the influence of \ul Genl\ulnone \'85\ul Jones\ulnone , which is \ul great\ulnone . & the extensive connexions Mr. Orr has in Laurens district through his Wife who was a Marshall. I would not have been uneasy.\'a0 You have not the advantages which he has, in being connected with so many families.\'a0 You have so many enemies made by your Law business, which he has not.\'a0 You have \ul your\ulnone  \ul merits\ulnone  alone to depend on, & that is the last thing people think of.\'a0 I will conclude by saying, I long to see you & love you dearly.\'a0 E.F.P. If you do not come for me, or do not come at all, write word what house I had better stop at on my way back.\'a0 I am inclined to stop at Mr. Barksdale\'92s where I stopped coming here.\'a0 It was so comfortable, or at his brother\'92s six miles from him, who you have offended, but I hope the cases will be conducted so fair & honorably, that he will change & become your friend again. If you see the Mr. Barksdale I passed the night in coming here, speak to him, he seemed a good old man.\'a0 I do not know his given name.\'a0 I thought it was Allen, but Mr. Cunningham says Allen is the name of the one Mr. Richardson drove against.\'a0 I expect Jim will stay with him when he comes back, & you if you see him, can pay him or as we go back, you can pay, or I if you are not with me.\'a0 You might be friendly also with the other one I should think & explain that he should not be opposed to you, for what is not meant as unfriendly on your part.\'a0 Since I have heard Genl C. Jones is such an influential dangerous man, I wish you could have made him your friend again.\'a0 I staid with him hitherto.\'a0 Now I have expressed all my thoughts I feel easier.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham says he has always given you four fifths of Laurens D.\'a0 He had no idea until \ul lately\ulnone , Mr. Barksdale\'92s cases were to be of so much importance.\'a0 He says there is not a more influential family in the whole District.\'a0 He says Mr. Orr will make exertions, & after the Canvass commences, you must also.\'a0 All knows you to be the superior man, but various motives influence men, & they vote often for those qualified,\'a0 but to\'85revenge & other\'85.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Though My letters I believe cannot be very welcome to you, containing so much bad news as they do, still I feel that I must write to you again, to give you more information respecting your prospects, & our personal welfare.\'a0 I never felt so uncertain of your thoughts, acts & concerns, as I do now.\'a0 It is so long since I have seen you, & you have been to so many different places, since we parted & perhaps been through many trials, & also without being able to inform your Wife, & let her know what is going on, & how your affairs are proceeding.\'a0 I feel that this is an important week with you, that your words & actions this week, will lead to either good or bad results. So I beg you will be \ul useful\ulnone , while performing your \ul duty\ulnone , to do nothing \ul unnecessarily\ulnone  to prejudice others against you.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tomorrow when I believe the mail comes from Laurens , & that I will then know all that has passed since we parted, & what your plans are, what time you will be able to come here.\'a0 We are all quite well, & I have been passing my time \ul very\ulnone  \ul pleasantly\ulnone , as I \ul always do\ulnone  \ul here\ulnone , for I consider \ul this\ulnone  \ul family\ulnone  as our \ul best\ulnone  \ul friends\ulnone .\'a0 I believe I like them the\'85I know of them.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham seems a perfect gentleman, honorable & good hearted in the extreme.\'a0 It is under the influence of \'85[word illegible] that he would act imprudently, & he is a sensible man too.\'a0 I have seen more of him this visit, that I ever have done, & I like him more.\'a0 Mrs. Cunningham I have always liked, & Pamela too, I have a great regard for, indeed we may put them down as our very best friends.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham told me one day, that Mr. Quin said, he \ul heard\ulnone  the R. Road question would be brought forward in the Congressional Election.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham said he did not know if it \ul would\ulnone  be, but if it was it would not \ul injure\ulnone , but on the contrary benefit you, for Laurens & Greenville of course would go for you\'a0 in that question, & in Anderson only Mr. Orr would be sustained on that question, & in Anderson where Mr. Orr has always lived, & represented it, of course you expect to be beaten..\'a0 Pickens I \ul suppose\ulnone  would take no interest in the matter.\'a0 The Aiken route Mr. Cunningham is certain will succeed, when they get a charter, because it will pass through so many districts.\'a0 The subscription for building the road can easily be obtained without any aid from the State.\'a0 He will subscribe 10,000 dollars.\'a0 In this neighborhood Mr. Cunningham says, there will he thinks be very little division in the support \ul you\ulnone  will have.\'a0 Mr. George Anderson who keeps the store at Waterloo, married a Smith, & the Smiths are connected with the Marshall\'92s, the family into which Mr. Orr married, so he & his influence he thinks, from what he has heard him say, will go for Mr. Orr.\'a0 I had no idea Mr. Orr had so many connexions.\'a0 Mr. Orr\'92s vote will be principally with the families with whom himself & his \ul wife\ulnone  are connected, & from the families who \ul you\ulnone  have had Law cases against.\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  have been a great help to him.\'a0 You never could have done \ul him\ulnone  a \ul better\ulnone  \ul service\ulnone , than taking these cases against Mr. Barksdale, for that man is \ul popular\ulnone  & \ul powerful\ulnone , connected with the most \ul influential\ulnone  \ul families\ulnone  in the District.\'a0 Genl C\'85 Jones who supports Mr. Orr has a plantation adjoining John Smith, & John Smith is connected with the Marshalls, & Jones & Smith always go together.\'a0 You my dear stand upon your \ul merits\ulnone  \ul alone\ulnone ; your opponents support comes from those who are \ul connected\ulnone  with him, who in an election of this kind will vote for him however remote the connexion may be, because they consider it an \ul honor\ulnone  to send to Congress, one who is connected with them, never mind how remotely.\'a0 You will not gain \ul one\ulnone  \ul vote\ulnone  from the influence of \ul your\ulnone  Wife, unless it is through the influence of \ul her\ulnone  \ul merits\ulnone .\'a0 In this respect we are \'85ted alike.\'a0 But my dear you are so far superior to your rival that seriously I would have no fears, except for the \ul exertions\ulnone  I know that we\'85make. If you are true to yourself I should hope you would be successful, but labouring under disadvantages as you do, particularly as a \ul Lawyer\ulnone  making so \ul many\ulnone  \ul enemies\ulnone , you must be on the \ul alert\ulnone .\'a0 It is a duty you owe your country, you ought not to permit it to send one who can do \ul nothing\ulnone  for it, but\'85them send you, who can stand up for it.\'a0 Mr. Cunninghams overseer saw Mr. Anderson (the postmaster at Laurens village) the other day at some Muster in the neighborhood.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham asked me who he went for, & I told him he went for you.\'a0 He said Mr. Wells the Overseer, had thought from his \ul manner\ulnone , that he was \ul not\ulnone  your friend, but it may have been only suspicion.\'a0 You must not think my mind is occupied only with this subject.\'a0 I have hardly thought of it, since I last wrote to you.\'a0 It is a relief to me to open my mind to you, & after that is done, I cease to dwell\'a0 on the subject that has oppressed me.\'a0 I have not passed any sleepless nights since I wrote.\'a0 Today when I took up my pen I thought I would give you all the information I could, on a subject so deeply interesting to us both.\'a0 When I am done writing, I am going to sit with Pamela, & invest myself in what concerns her, & forget you & your prospects for the time.\'a0 Pamela has been down in the Drawing room only one evening since I came.\'a0 I sit with her in her room in the morning & afternoon, & in the evening in the Drawing room, she would like me to sit with her in the evening too.\'a0 Last evening I stole away from the Drawing room, & did pass with her.\'a0 I sit up till past 10 oclock every night, so you see time does not hang heavily, but rather passes too quickly.\'a0 I am working for Mrs. Cunningham a pr of Shoes.\'a0 She says she has long wanted a pr, but I am the first friend who ever offered to work her a pr.\'a0 She says I have done more work for her, than any friend she has.\'a0 Pamela is very much pleased with my having furnished her with two anecdotes for Mrs. Ellet.\'a0 She was applied to for anecdotes by Mrs. Gilman, the Wife of the Unitarian Minister in Charleston, the Authoress you know. She became acquainted with her last summer.\'a0 I have been reading some affidavits of old persons who flourishes in the Revolutionary War, regarding what they know of the exploits of others. & the affidavits are really amusing.\'a0 They represent things Mrs. Bowen the Wife of Keith Bowen, who lives at Waterloo, paid Mrs. Cunningham yesterday.\'a0 She seems to be a very fine lady, & very sweet looking.\'a0 She begged me to go & see her.\'a0 If I had time on my way home, I would like to stop for a few minutes, but I do not expect to be able to.\'a0 She is a Tennessee Lady.\'a0 Mr. Cunningham has been reading Wille\'92s pencillings by the way, & is very much pleased with them.\'a0 He talks at night of what he has been reading during the day.\'a0 I have seen a Mountaineer, but have not heard otherwise from Greenville.\'a0 I have written to Mamma once.\'a0 Pamela wished me to write for her to buy her some Gingham & send her by Jim.\'a0 Perhaps Jim may bring me letters for her.\'a0 It seems strange when I think of \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 I know so little of what is going on there that my home now seems to be here, where my children are, my husband only is wanting, & he I hope to see soon.\'a0 I hope to hear tomorrow when he will be here.\'a0 You must be sure & come one night \ul during\ulnone  \ul Court\ulnone , if you find you \ul cannot\ulnone  \ul come\ulnone  for me.\'a0 I have only spent 2 dollars, bundles by 5 cts. I gave the servants before I left home, so I have plenty of money.\'a0 Fanny has given me no trouble.\'a0 She has become so attached to Delia that I would wean her easily, except at night, but as I have no idea she shall be weaned, I make her nurse during the day.\'a0 I do not wish her to be entirely independent of me.\'a0 The other children have also behaved well.\'a0 They are thoroughly \ul good\ulnone  \ul children\ulnone .\'a0 Believe me my dear husband your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You did not seem particularly anxious to hear from me when you left, but as you may be uneasy if Wednesdays Mail carries you no letter I will write if it is only a few lines.\'a0 Yesterday when I got up in the morning I had a little headache, & as both Dr. Earle & Dr. Crook had said Calomel would not hurt me, I last night took 6 grains, & this morning some Oil.\'a0 I hope it will do me good, & prevent my taking as many Pills as I would otherwise have to take, but you may imagine having taken this medicine, today I am not much inclined to write.\'a0 I only write for fear you might be uneasy.\'a0 I do not wish you to suffer what I sometimes do.\'a0 Friday morning Susan came as she promised.\'a0 In the afternoon Mrs. Butler paid me a visit.\'a0 That evening the news came of Genl Scotts Victory, & at night there was a Torch Light procession, Music & speeches.\'a0 Mr. Walker, Mr. Elford, Mr. Town[e]s, Mr. Spears, & Dr. Crook all spoke.\'a0 Not knowing all this was to take place, we had retired early, otherwise we would have gone near your office & heard the speeches, but I dare say we did not lose much.\'a0 Some appropriate transparencies were made very quickly, one with Santa Anna running off on a Mule without his wooden leg, some\'85the battle the day it was fought & so on, & some made for the night previous were used.\'a0 Mr. Elias Alexander said you hit the mark exactly in your prediction.\'a0 The servants at Mamma\'92s came in.\'a0 They said none of the speeches came up to \ul yours\ulnone , & that one person spoke as if he had mush in his mouth. Saturday we had some Showers.\'a0 Yesterday we went to church.\'a0 Mr. Cornish preached both morning & afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Arthur had his child baptized.\'a0 We dined at Mamma\'92s & after church in the afternoon rode to Mr. Poinsetts, to get Strawberries, but they have none yet & the plants seem to be bearing very few, like ours.\'a0 I expect this is a bad year for Strawberries. I saw Perry Butler at the church door with his Uniform on.\'a0 I asked him how many recruits he had gained; he said not one.\'a0 The children are all well.\'a0 Willie on Friday got down four more boys.\'a0 They all went to church yesterday morning, & Frank was so good as to go in the afternoon also, but he slept the whole time in the afternoon.\'a0 He says very often what makes Pa stay so long in \'93Lumbia.\'94\'a0 I say, \'93he has just got there\'94, he says, \'93did you see him.\'94\'a0 Saturday\'a0 Jim went to the Farm, & he & Charles planted their Corn.\'a0 Today he is Whitewashing, & Mary washing.\'a0 Tomorrow they will both go to the Farm & commence ploughing.\'a0 Jim says the Corn does not much need the ploughing yet, for it has not all come up, & the ground is hard.\'a0 However they will plough tomorrow, & Mary shall go every day.\'a0 Last night Susan slept at Mrs. McBees; today she has gone to Mammas to work.\'a0 She will come back this evening.\'a0 She hopes to go to the Factory next week, & I do not wonder she wishes to go, for I had rather be to myself, than living with anyone, & particularly persons so strange as they are.\'a0 Susan hopes Genl Thompson & yourself speaking to Mr. McBee will be able to effect something for Harriett & herself.\'a0 She thinks if he was aware, that the world thought he ought to do something for his children, that he would do something.\'a0 If you & Genl Thompson both speak together, he will not be offended with either.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Arthur have just been to see me.\'a0 Mrs. Thomas is paying them a visit. Mr. Wallace was to have Whitewashed here today, but he came this morning, & said he was working for Judge Gantt who would not let him off, but that he would come Friday.\'a0As I may not write again for sometime, I will tell you again the Commissions you are to execute, for \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 Get the books, or some of them on the list I gave you.\'a0 The children have told you what they wish.\'a0 For Ann be sure to get some present, & I would like very much that \ul you\ulnone  should get the Straw chair for Vardry, for I told Susan long ago you would give it, so if you can \ul afford\ulnone  it, you must, & you are his Godfather & ought to make him presents sometimes, but if the Chair costs more than we calculated on, I do not wish you to give it.\'a0 I suppose 2 dollars or 1.50 [page torn] be what it would cost, for it is only straw.\'a0 A letter [page torn] from Dr. Hardy\'a0 about the Check, saying if you would send it to him, he would forward you another without the condition on the bank notes which you might prefer, that he had long since wondered that he had not heard from the owner of that check.\'a0 Another letter came from Mr. Nathaniel Morgan, & one from Mr. John McClanahan, saying Mr. Salmon thought your account just, but the 10 dollar fee Stroud ought to pay half of, & he preferred to give his note for 60 dollars.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 Mr. Croft has not yet returned.\'a0 Our household are well.\'a0 If you do not hear from me again do not be uneasy, but in all probability I will write.\'a0 Excuse the shabby looking letter, for I have no good material for writing, not even ruled paper.\'a0 Take care of yourself for the sake of Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have taken up my pen to write you only a few lines, to contradict some advice I gave you in my last letter.\'a0 You know I begged you to speak to Mr. McBee to get him to do something for Susan.\'a0 I have now come to the conclusion, that it is \ul better\ulnone  for you \ul not\ulnone  to \ul speak\ulnone , & I by \ul no\ulnone  \ul means\ulnone  wish you to do it.\'a0 In the first place it will be of no avail. & in the second place, even if it were, it would be of no consequence,\'a0 for Mr. Luther McBee is such a creature, I don\'92t think Susan can live much longer with him. \'a0But I know your speaking to old Mr. McBee cannot change his character & make him liberal.\'a0 It cannot implant feelings in his heart which have never existed there, so I do not wish you to interfere.\'a0 Mr. Luther has always thought though you know without any foundation, that your influence was \ul against\ulnone  him, so if you speak to his father to do something for Susan, with his suspicion, he will think you put it into Susan\'92s head, to think nothing was done for her, so I advise \ul you\ulnone  to say nothing, but I would be very glad if Genl Thompson would speak, & he I believe has influence with the old man. I am sorry to write you so unpleasant a letter & on such paper, but it is all I have, & I am too poor to buy any more.\'a0 We are all quite well.\'a0 My\'a0 Medicine has done me good.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight, & that you are well.\'a0 We have had Showers today, but Mary & Jim went to the Farm.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 Nothing came by the Mail\'a0 last night.\'a0 Willie yesterday got nearly head, only three boys were above him.\'a0 Today I dare say he will get down more.\'a0 He looks remarkably well at present.\'a0 I long to see you.\'a0 I would write more, but dinner is nearly ready & I am particularly busy.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Only to prevent your being uneasy, induces me to write now, for I am in the greatest confusion.\'a0 Mr. Wallace unexpectedly came this morning to Whitewash, though I had engaged him, I had forgotten he was coming, or thought he would not keep his promise.\'a0 Just as I was going today to go out to visit he came, & I was almost sorry to see him.\'a0 I had then to have the Carpets taken up, Curtains taken down &c. & after that I went out, as I had kept Jim on purpose to drive me.\'a0 It rained a great deal yesterday, & the ground was quite wet, so I had a good excuse for keeping Jim, & it was well he was here to move the furniture.\'a0 I wished to finish off my visiting, so that next week he might plough steadily.\'a0 He said the rains we have had lately, will make the Corn grow fast.\'a0 I paid 4 visits only this morning. As I went out late.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. S\'85ham, & Mrs. Pinckney McBee, & then I stopped with Susan at old Mrs. McBee\'92s.\'a0 They were at dinner.\'a0 They pressed me to get out & dine, so I did.\'a0 When I returned I gave Mr. Wallace his dinner & now I am seated in the Dining room which is dismantled of its furniture, & the servants washing the paint.\'a0 I assure you a Housecleaning is dreadful, & you ought to be thankful to be absent while they are going on, for the parts not cleaning, are in such confusion there is no place to sit in comfort.\'a0 Susan moved back to Mrs. McBee\'92s.\'a0 I could not ask Mr. McBee to stay here, for I wish to be at ease at present, & Mr. McBee did not like Susan to be here without him, so we determined it was best for her to go back,, & so she went, & he has behaved well since she returned. & the family also have been kinder to her.\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday night, & was much gratified by it.\'a0 All who see me ask the news from Columbia, so I am glad when I can have something to tell.\'a0 It does not seem to me Mr. Kilgore will make a good President of the Rail Road.\'a0 If it did not interfere with your Law business, I think they ought to have thought of you.\'a0 They would not have got a better one than yourself.\'a0 I am glad you will have seen Mr. Webster, as it will be pleasant to meet him in your own State.\'a0 You say Col. Dawkins & his \ul new\ulnone  Wife have gone to Charleston to see him.\'a0 I had not heard Col. Dawkins had married a \ul third\ulnone  time, for certainly his \ul second\ulnone  Wife who he married 2 or 3 years ago,\'a0 you do not call a \ul new \ulnone wife.\'a0 I hope this new \ul wife\ulnone  will be more fortunate than the other two, in being the means of carrying down his name to posterity.\'a0 I suppose Col. Herndon has lost his vanity now he is an old married man, & finds it too troublesome to dye his grey locks.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 The proceedings of Thanksgiving day, the illumination &c. was in the Mountaineer this morning, as also your speech.\'a0 The only news I know is, that Jane Walker is to be married in a few weeks to Mr. Gourdin.\'a0 Margaret Croft is making her clothes.\'a0 I long to see you.\'a0 Willie has not yet got head, & the boys know if he gets up, he wont get down again, so they study hard, but I tell him I know he will get up soon.\'a0 Frank Hoke has lost his ball for\'85so Willie says you must bring him another.\'a0 Write me all the news.\'a0 I have litterally nothing to write about, & no materials for writing, such shabby paper, & bad writing.\'a0 You will hardly care to receive the letter, & my gold pen will hardly make a mark, the Ink is so think.\'a0 You ought not to insist on my writing every Mail, & sitting so steadily to write disagrees with me entirely.\'a0 I must now conclude hoping this letter will at any rate be the means of preventing your having any anxious feelings about us.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you a letter which I suppose your received last night, on your arrival in Columbia.\'a0 I received yours written at Newberry, last evening.\'a0 Willie answered it for me, & put his letter in the Post Office on his way to school today.\'a0 It is his \ul first\ulnone  letter so you must be \ul pleased\ulnone  with it, & answer it & \ul praise\ulnone  it.\'a0 He was not satisfied with it himself, wished to write it over again, but I told him it would do very well.\'a0 I wish you had carried him with you.\'a0 Excursions from home always do him good, & associating with grown persons.\'a0 He always appears well, having no excuse to quarrel, or be irritated as he is with children.\'a0 You can carry him with you next Spring, when you go to Columbia.\'a0 Though Willie has written, I cannot resist writing, to express some of the thoughts\'a0 that are passing through my brain now that I have been to Columbia, I can imagine your situation there, much better than I did formerly.\'a0 I know where your chamber is, & where your seat in the Senate is.\'a0 I used to imagine the Senate Chamber, at the other end of the State House.\'a0 I am sorry indeed the Convention acted with so little harmony.\'a0 If I may express my humble opinion I would say, that the only plan now to be adopted is, that each District should build the road for itself.\'a0 Newberry must build the Road from Columbia to Newberry C.H.\'a0 Then Laurens must continue it & build from Newberry to Laurens C.H. & Greenville must go on & build it from Laurens to Greenville.\'a0 In the same way Abbeville & Anderson will have to do, for no people will build a road for others, that is not to benefit them.\'a0 Selfishness is too deeply planted in\'85nature for that.\'a0 I hope Anderson does not feel to you, as Laurens you say does to Mr. Orr.\'a0 It was unfortunate the interest of the two places should clash together & that you should be situated as to have to offend one or the other.\'a0 I hope that your good judgement carried you skilfully through & that in the end it may be all the better for you, & that you have gained & not injured yourself with either party.\'a0 I have perfect confidence in you, though I often venture to suggest, some \ul new\ulnone  \ul ideas\ulnone  to you.\'a0 Your honor, prudence, & good judgement, I believe equal to anyone.\'a0 Now for a little advice, if you would obtain a Seat on the Bench \ul easily\ulnone , you hear so from our friends, you must by no means \ul decline\ulnone  it, it being in my opinion a situation preferable to any other, combining both \ul profit\ulnone  & \ul honour\ulnone , with permanency, but I rather think the office will be sought so earnestly\'a0 by so many, that your claims would have to be \ul pressed\ulnone  to be successful.\'a0 A Judge you are cut out for, your good judgement, would make you an invaluable one, but in my opinion there is no responsible situation you are not fitted for, even the Presidential Chair.\'a0 I am glad Mr. Choice & yourself are friendly, an \ul honorable\ulnone  \ul enemy\ulnone , could easily be changed into a \ul friend\ulnone .\'a0 I was uneasy about \ul you\ulnone , when I heard of his accident.\'a0 Mrs. Thurston I believe was hurt also.\'a0 Mrs. Butler told me she jumped out, & knocked out some of her Teeth.\'a0 Mrs. Butler stopped at the gate Saturday.\'a0 Miss Rogers says she will stay with me, so I expect her at any time.\'a0 No one can supply your place to me, therefore when you are away, I prefer no one staying with me, I am not \ul lonely\ulnone , but I \ul miss\ulnone  you.\'a0 But if Miss Rogers comes, I will try & make her pass her time pleasantly.\'a0 Jim has carried me to ride \ul twice\ulnone  since you left, one afternoon & one morning.\'a0 All the rest of the time, he has been digging Potatoes for Mr. Hoke.\'a0 He will finish I hope today.\'a0 He says Mr. Hoke has about 100 bushels of Potatoes.\'a0 Mr. Hoke Saturday sent me a peice of Pork & a peice of Beef.\'a0 Saturday & Sunday were so cold.\'a0 If such weather had continued, hogs would have been killed, but the weather today has moderated.\'a0 It is cloudy & drizzly, so unfavorable.\'a0 Mary & Delia have not washed as usual.\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Harrison one evening.\'a0 I think she seems more comfortable in her present home than in her old one.\'a0 I have received pleasant letters from Aunt Harriett & Mrs. Dubose.\'a0 Uncle Edward & his daughter has not yet arrived.\'a0 Mrs. Alston Hayne Aunt Harriett says has sent some of her Bridal Cake to us. Sarah Cunningham, Pamela\'92s cousin is engaged to Mr. Daniel of Georgia.\'a0 I suppose she saw him last summer.\'a0 You know she went to Clarksville.\'a0 Have you heard anything of Pamela?\'a0 I am surprised she has not answered my letter.\'a0 I directed it to Hamburgh to the care of Mr. Yancey.\'a0 Ask him if she received it.\'a0 Willie wrote you the compliment Genl Whitner paid your speech.\'a0 Mrs. Dubose says Mrs. Gordon & Mrs. B\'85 who have children named after you & to whom I sent a frock & book were delighted with the presents, particularly as coming from me.\'a0 Your brother Fosters children thanked me for what I sent them.\'a0 Her brother Mr. Lee had been elected Magistrate, but the friends of his opponent, are going to try to present a petition to the legislature about it.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 I went to see Mamma yesterday morning after church.\'a0 The 3 oldest children dined with her.\'a0 I returned to my sweet little Fanny, who is as good as ever.\'a0 The cold days I could not keep her warm, so wrapped her up in a\'85blanket.\'a0 Mary Long is said to be engaged to Tom Crayton & to be married next month.\'a0 One of the Miss Bollins is to be married Thursday night, & the other the Thursday after.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s I believe is well.\'a0 Mrs. Roberts & Mrs. Burn came to see me Saturday.\'a0 As I have written twice already, I do not think I will write by the next mail, but will wait to hear from you.\'a0 I dare say the opponents of the R[ail] Road would constantly have said, the road would stop at Newberry, that the money would all be used to bring it as far as that & no further, so perhaps it is as well the company should be dissolved & each District made to build it for herself. \'a0Newberry must commence, & the other Districts follow.\'a0 Each one now will be obliged to build for itself, & Abbeville & Anderson do the same.\'a0 Adieu my dear husband.\'a0 Tell Edward I am glad to hear he is behaving well.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your second letter Wednesday night, & was \ul very\ulnone  \ul much\ulnone  pleased to hear from you.\'a0 It would have been a \ul great\ulnone  \ul disappointment\ulnone  if Mary had returned from the office \ul without\ulnone  a letter, for a \ul letter\ulnone  from \ul you\ulnone  \ul now\ulnone  is the principal incident in our lives.\'a0 You say I must write if it is only to say \ul we\ulnone  \ul are\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0\'a0 I have not much more of interest now to tell you, so you must blame circumstances & not \ul me\ulnone , if you receive uninteresting letters.\'a0 I wrote you Monday.\'a0 I must now think of all that has happened since Tuesday & Wednesday.\'a0 It rained incessantly, so that Willie & Anna were obliged to stay from school, but they each said their lessons to me.\'a0 They are both \ul smart\ulnone  children, & learn with great ease.\'a0 Willie learns now a history lesson every day.\'a0\'a0 Wednesday Jim killed the smallest hog.\'a0 He said the other hogs would kill it, if \ul he\ulnone  did not.\'a0 They fought it constantly so I made no objection, & we now have some fresh meat to eat.\'a0 I sent a peice to Mamma .\'a0 It is very fat meat.\'a0 The weather has not continued long \ul enough\ulnone  to kill all of the hogs.\'a0 Mr. Phillips has not sent any hams yet.\'a0\'a0 Wednesday Mr. Croft sent me some Packages from Pamela.\'a0 He had just returned, & had passed one night at Mrs. Cunningham\'92s on his return.\'a0 Pamela sent your books \'93Moultrie\'92s American Revolution,\'94 \'93Drayton\'92s Memoir,\'94 \'94Hallam\'92s Literature\'94.\'a0 She sent you a \ul beautiful\ulnone \'85& Mrs. Cunningham sent me a small book, called \'93Woman\'92s Mission.\'94\'a0 Pamela wrote me a letter.\'a0 They had but recently arrived at Rosemonte, & she had been sick with Chill & Fever.\'a0 She had intended going to the Lower Country this month, but as she had just reached home, she did not know now when she would go; perhaps not until the Spring, when she expected again to go to the Island.\'a0 The purse, she said she finished the very day Mr. Croft arrived.\'a0 She intended writing a note with it, but Mr. Croft was\'85so short of time, she was not able to, so I must present her kind regards & beg you to accept this simple offering of her conviction of your \ul honesty\ulnone  & \ul purity\ulnone  of \ul purpose\ulnone  in public life, & whenever you looked at it in \ul Washington\ulnone  (that den of corruption) it must serve to remind you that your fiends look to \ul you\ulnone  on all occasions to display that love of Country, which disregards party interests & individual aggrandizement!\'a0 I wish I was as certain my dear husband that you will have the opportunity of so acting as she is.\'a0 I am afraid this Rail Road business will injure you greatly in Anderson, but even if it has injured you there, I know your \ul first\ulnone  duty was to Greenville, therefore it cannot be.\'a0 I only hope Mr. Orr is as much injured in Laurens as you are in his District & that you are at any rate \ul even\ulnone , (but here comes the suggestion).\'a0 \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Orr\ulnone  has been \ul successful\ulnone  in his efforts for the Road, & \ul you\ulnone  have \ul not\ulnone  \ul been\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Orr\'92s friends will be so grateful they will do all they can to elect him, however I will not \ul worry\ulnone .\'a0 I \ul know\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  \ul act\ulnone  as \ul duty\ulnone  \ul inculcates\ulnone  & I hope in the end you will be \ul rewarded\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you have not estranged Genl Thompson & Mr. Read from you.\'a0 It is well if you \ul can\ulnone , to retain them as your friends, as they are the leading Whigs in this Congressional District.\'a0 The Canvas in which you are now engaged is so extensive & so important, that great circumspection is required to ensure success.\'a0 You know I always wish you to \ul act\ulnone  \ul honorably\ulnone  & \ul independently\ulnone .\'a0 All I ever fear is, that when there is no \ul reason\ulnone  for it, you will act independently, & without cause injure yourself, \ul just\ulnone  to show your \ul independence\ulnone .\'a0 I think you are justified in \ul honorably\ulnone  doing all you can to \ul retain\ulnone  & make friends, but ! will go on to other subjects, that I know you think more within \ul my\ulnone  \ul sphere\ulnone .\'a0 The Book Mrs. Cunningham has sent me, Pamela says they had read & were very much pleased with, that they knew I would like it, it would give me many ideas as to governing children.\'a0 I was interrupted in my letter by a visit from Mr. & Mrs. Rowland.\'a0 Mr. Rowland said as the Greenville & Laurens Stockholders withdrew , from the Convention, those who were left, applauded them, that they were treated with no respect.\'a0 I am very sorry the Convention should so have ended & that Greenville should have lost the road.\'a0 What do you think now will be done. Will Greenville do anything again toward having a Road?\'a0 Yesterday morning Jim cleaned out the Stable yard & in the afternoon I rode with the children to Mr. Buists\'92s to know when he was going to Bachelors Retreat.\'a0 Mrs. Doloc wishes me to send something by him.\'a0 He is going there to assist in the ordination of Mr. Hillhouse.\'a0 They are to have a 3 days meeting.\'a0 I had not been on the Spartanburgh road since I paid a visit to Mr. Buist with you years ago.\'a0 This morning Jim is hauling wood\'a0 & this afternoon, I intend going to see Mrs. Pearson.\'a0 Fanny is sweeter than ever & gets more interesting the older she grows.\'a0 She knows \ul me\ulnone  now, & I love her so, when she cries to come to me.\'a0 She also knows Delia, & sometimes likes to go to her from me.\'a0 She is my little comfort at night.\'a0 A father is necessary to a child, when she is looking & behaving so sweetly.\'a0 I always wish \ul you\ulnone  were here to see her.\'a0 Frank is shaking my desk, & saying he wishes Pa would come.\'a0 Almost every morning & in the middle of the night, when he wakes, his first exclamatiion is \'93has Pa come\'94?\'a0 I say no, he says, \'93well then I dreamt he had come\'94.\'a0 One morning he said,\'a0 \'93I dreamt Pa was baptized\'94.\'a0 I asked him who baptized him, he said, \'93he baptized himself\'94.\'a0 When the children behave badly, I tell them I will write & tell you, & it distresses them very much, & they beg me not to.\'a0 I think they have behaved pretty well, since you left.\'a0 The servants do as usual.\'a0 Minerva ought to be satisfied.\'a0 I have as little cooking as possible, so as to allow her plenty of time to make her clothes.\'a0 I have been very busy making Delia Mary & Lindy\'92s clothes.\'a0 I have not touched the Worsted work.\'a0 Except going behind the Carri[a]ge, I do not miss Edward in the least.\'a0 Lindy with ease does what he did.\'a0 I would like when he returns, to put Lindy with Mary McLeod to learn to wash iron & cook, so that she may be a useful servant.\'a0 She has a good temper & I want to make her a valuable servant.\'a0 At Mamma\'92s they are as usual.\'a0 Susan has had headache lately.\'a0 Mamma says she would like you to get a chair like ours, even if you had to give more.\'a0 I must now close & will only say if I have given more advice than you care for.\'a0 You must\'a0 consider it only as a vent to my thoughts, that I have no one to listen to me as you do, & that I have perfect confidence in my dear husband that he always acts as \ul duty\ulnone  & \ul honor\ulnone  dictates, & that his \ul good\ulnone  \ul judgement\ulnone  will carry him \ul safely\ulnone  through life.\'a0 I hope even to a better world , in spite of his wifes interference.\'a0 E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 If Fanny will permit me I wish to write to you this morning.\'a0 I have the charge of her, Delia & Mary having gone to the Spring to wash.\'a0 She is now lying on the floor, but does not seem satisfied with her position.\'a0 I received a letter from you last night, & Willie also received one.\'a0 He answered his immediately, so you will get two letters again the next Mail, but I know it will not be too much of a good thing for you.\'a0 I must give you a \ul scold\ulnone , for breaking your word & being \ul extravagant\ulnone  when you promised you \ul would\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 It is well for you to say, you got the books to \ul send\ulnone  to \ul me\ulnone  this winter.\'a0 Your \ul conscience\ulnone  told you, you must give me some excuse, for doing \ul exactly\ulnone  what you told me you were \ul not\ulnone  going to do.\'a0 There are more books in the Library now, than I can expect to read, & until we have read those, there is no necessity to buy any more.\'a0 There is no room in the Library even to \ul place\ulnone  them.\'a0 Those that Pamela sent back, I cannot find a place for.\'a0 If you buy books to \ul please\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone , I would like Mrs. Opie\'92s, Mrs. Sherwood\'92s, Miss R\'85\'92s works , & others of the like kind.\'a0 \ul Novels\ulnone , I do not care for, but such works as I have mentioned, are improving & interesting & light, serve to wile away an hour agreeably.\'a0 Your books, almost all of them are too deep & solid, for the general reader.\'a0 Yesterday Mamma & Susan stopped on their way from church to see me, & they went in the Library to choose a book for Ann, & except two or three little books \ul I\ulnone  had bought there was scarcely one suitable for her, who was sick & wished something amusing & interesting.\'a0 There are so many things we need for the \ul house\ulnone , \ul necessities\ulnone  that we will be \ul obliged\ulnone  soon to supply, that we ought both to deny ourselves of whatever we can do without, that we may have money to supply those wants.\'a0 We now need many things, Staircase Carpet, Waiters, Face Towels, Cups & Saucers, Dinner set &c&c, but even these things we must try & do without as long as we can.\'a0 It must be a\'85tation to you, when in Columbia, & particularly in a Book store, to forget all of your economical resolutions.\'a0 I cannot \ul blame\ulnone  you, in Charleston last winter I saw so many things I wished to get, & it was such a good opportunity to supply all my wants that I could not but regret that my means did not allow me to, & I did spend to the very last cent almost, all that you gave me.\'a0 I would never go to town again, unless I had plenty of money, as I know that will never be the case.\'a0 I for my part need not regret the Rail Road failure.\'a0 It would have been no immediate benefit to me.\'a0 It would have brought crowds of friends to see us, but not carried us to see them in return.\'a0 It would not have cheapened the price of board in Charleston, & would have made things dearer here.\'a0 I am not so selfish as to begrudge to others the benefit they would have received, so if the failure of the Road is an injury to my State,\'a0 I do regret it, but I do not regret it for myself.\'a0 Genl Whitner is really anxious to be elected Judge, & I am sure he has no \ul claims\ulnone  to it, for he is not I believe, even a good Lawyer.\'a0 He would make a \ul poor\ulnone  \ul Judge\ulnone .\'a0 \ul Honour\ulnone  has certainly something more fascinating in it, than money, for Col. Memminger I suppose makes a great deal more as a Lawyer, than he will as Judge, but he wishes the \ul honour \ulnone of being a Judge.\'a0 I have always felt so.\'a0 I would not wish the honour with \ul no\ulnone  money, but I am satisfied\'a0 with \ul less\ulnone  \ul money\ulnone  & \ul some\ulnone  \ul honour\ulnone .\'a0 You \ul tantalize\ulnone  when you say, Col. Martin says if you continued in the Senate, you would be elected President of it.\'a0 If I were \ul certain\ulnone  of that I would wish you to continue, for you would then still practice Law, & the position would be just as honorable & even more so than if you were in Congress.\'a0 I suppose though it is entirely uncertain if you would be elected President, & at any rate it is too late to change for Col. Brockman considers perhaps himself as in the field.\'a0 I believe if you are \ul confident\ulnone  you can be elected to Congress, & at the same time practice Law, & support your family, though you have to give up half you make to a partner, I am satisfied I would have liked you to have been a Judge above all things, but there are so many aspirants for that office, & would be also for the President of the Senate that I need worry myself, that you will lose all chance of ever being elected to those offices.\'a0 In a few years as our young servants grow up, we must\'85or sell some of the older ones & make something in that way.\'a0 When Edward can drive, we can sell Jim, & when Lindy is older we can sell Mary & Minerva & Lindy herself or hire them out.\'a0 I would like now to hire out some of them. \'a0I am glad you have heard good news from Stephens, & that Genl Thompson is interested in your election.\'a0 As you \ul are\ulnone  a \ul Candidate\ulnone , I wish you elected.\'a0 Mrs. Duloc wrote me word you had a great many warm friends in Pickens.\'a0 Willie was very much pleased with your letter.\'a0 As I read it to him, the tears came into his eyes.\'a0 Every evening I hear him his lessons, & after that he reads to me or asks questions.\'a0 We sit up till 9 oclock, & I am so busy working I am sorry then to go to bed.\'a0 I have\'85now for all of my learning.\'a0 Woman\'92s Mission, which Mrs. Cunningham sent me, I find I have read.\'a0 Aunt Eliza sent it to Susan; in it, I recollect reading to you, that Mothers must recollect they were to be the Mothers of grown up men, as well as children, & must improve their minds, to keep pace with them respect them.\'a0 Saturday Jim & Charles killed the Steer.\'a0 It is not very nice meat, tastes poor, however it is some help; the hog also that was killed, was\'85by the other hogs so I do not eat the meat with much pleasure, but it makes no difference with the servants.\'a0 As regards the presents you are to bring us, I wish you to be \ul economical\ulnone  & bring \ul trifles\ulnone .\'a0 I assure you we do not care for valuable presents.\'a0 Bring Susan & myself a string of Black beads, such as you got us before.\'a0 I think the price was 621/2 cts.\'a0 Bring Ann a basket if you see a pretty one to put her knitting in, if not some little trifle.\'a0 Bring Anna a Match to her China Doll, bring Willie a Knife, bring Frank some Marbles he says & a knife.\'a0 He needs a cap for the Winter, but I expect I could get a cheaper & prettier one in Charleston.\'a0 I could send for one, but do as you think about the Cap.\'a0 Bring Fanny a Straw Rattle; in Charleston they cost\'85so I can send for one, if there are none cheap in Columbia, & bring her an Ivory ring if you see them cheap.\'a0 I mention these things, but you can bring whatever you think best, provided they \ul cost\ulnone  \ul little\ulnone .\'a0 We are counting the days until you return.\'a0 You must write \ul every\ulnone  Mail, if it is only a line.\'a0 Willie says I must tell you to be \ul sure\ulnone , and ask Mr. Summer for his dog.\'a0 Since I began writing, I have held Fanny repeatedly, & have now put her to sleep.\'a0 She is more & more interesting.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry P.S. I do not\'85to scold you for buying books.\'a0 You must get whatever you wish, but I like lighter works\'85.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again am I seated at the desk to write to you, with literally nothing to write about, but that you may hear Friday night.\'a0 I must even make a letter out of \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 This first winter day is a bad one.\'a0 This morning early it was sleeting, & mow it is raining. So that Willie & Anna have been obliged to stay at home from School.\'a0 They have each said their lessons to me, , & Willie has been reading to me one of Miss Edgeworth\'92s good stories.\'a0 He has now stopped to eat with Anna & Frank Molasses & ice & bread\'a0 & I wish Until I have done writing, that they would be at School.\'a0 Lindy is holding Fanny, who is sucking a peice of Biscuit.\'a0 She looks so eagerly at the children when they are eating, that I give her a peice of biscuit , to make her think she is eating too.\'a0 Jim says Mr. Hoke says\'a0 he will kill hogs the first of next week.\'a0 This week would have been cold enough, but Jim says Charles & himself\'a0 would not have killed ours alone.\'a0 They would have been obliged to hire two hands, that it was best to wait for Mr. Hoke, & that the Hogs are so fat, they do not eat much corn.\'a0 He sold the skin of the steer at the Tan Yard for $1.05 he brought me the money.\'a0 Mr. Phillips has not brought the Meat to Mr. Goodlett\'92s that he intended to.\'a0 I sent to the Jail to inquire, & they sold it without bringing it here.\'a0 Our Beef will last a long time.\'a0 As Minerva wishes to make her clothes, I have Soup principally every day.\'a0 I have spent money in ways I did not expect when you left.\'a0 Some \ul very\ulnone  \ul nice\ulnone  Rice was brought, & as ours was just giving out, I bought between 3 & 4 bushels, more than enough to fill a barrel.\'a0 It was 2 dollars a bushel.\'a0 I let Mamma have a bushel, so that it left me not quite a barrel full.\'a0 The Servants needed more unbleached Homespun to make up underclothes so I was obliged to buy a peice of it.\'a0 Lindy needed shoes.\'a0 She had not had new ones this winter, & Minerva asked for another Homespun frock, having but one thick one, & she wished another for a change, so I gave her one.\'a0 When you went I put aside the greater part of the money you gave me, determining to spend very little, & what I saved reserve[d] for \ul myself\ulnone , with your permission, but these expenses, without my wishing it, have obliged me to draw on the Sum put aside.\'a0 I have been busy ever since you left, & still am, working for Lindy, Mary, Delia & the Children.\'a0 I make the Servants clothes much better than they do, that when I give them good clothes, it is a pity to have them spoiled by their\'85so I generally, even if I commence showing them how to do it, end by doing it myself.\'a0 They must learn to work from mending their clothes.\'a0 Yesterday morning I wrote to Mrs. Duloc, & in the afternoon, carried the letter, along with a package of articles she desired me to purchase, & some plants to Mr. Buist, to carry to her.\'a0 He is to go Friday, but if the weather continues as it is now, I should not think he could go.\'a0 There is to be a three days meeting of the Presbyterians at Bachelors Retreat.\'a0 Mr. Hillhouse is to be ordained.\'a0 I called for Mrs. Arthur to go with me.\'a0 When the weather is pleasant Mr. Arthur & herself to spend the day with me, & Mamma, Susan, & Ann.\'a0 Mamma & Susan Sunday stopped to see me.\'a0 Mamma said I must give her love to you.\'a0 I sent the letter you wrote to Willie, to her to read, & she said, it was a very pretty letter.\'a0 I have not seen Ann to tell her of Mr. Simms\'92 interest in her.\'a0 I wish Mr. Simms was a single man, but I expect Ann would be shocked at my saying so, for conscientiously, I believe marrying never enters her thoughts, & it is only one who is respected by \ul all\ulnone , as ,well as \ul herself\ulnone , that she would every have thought of.\'a0 She has been particularly unwell lately, has had a Blister on, which has been very painful.\'a0 In one of your letters you mention.\'a0 In one of your letters you mention you had just seen Mr. the name that follows, I cannot make out, that he enquired after Mamma & myself, talked a great deal about Congress, & said Orr was a particular friend of his, & he had told him he ought not to have opposed you.\'a0 It is so provoking that you should have written the \ul name\ulnone  so \ul indistinctly\ulnone .\'a0 I cannot tell who it is you are talking about.\'a0 In you next letter tell me who is was, & write the name, so I can read it. I merely looked over the Governor\'92s message, & I see he recommends taking a boundary line & defending it.\'a0 As from the character of the Mexicans, they will never make peace on our terms.\'a0 I should think this was the only plan to be adopted.\'a0 It seems useless to go on fighting them, for they do not mind defeat.\'a0 As useless as to punish Mary for stealing, she has no feeling whatever.\'a0 I believe if her hand were cut off she would not feel it, , so she must just be taken as she is, & not mind her faults, but overlook them.\'a0 So the same with the Mexicans, you must treat them differently from other nations.\'a0 Butler Thompson I expect is nearing home, I see a wagon going to Mr. Montgomery\'92s every now & then lately for furniture,\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Elias Earle after she had left not knowing she had gone.\'a0 Lately I have been glad to stay at home.\'a0 I have been expecting Miss [page torn] constantly, but am glad she has not come, for I have been (that Minerva may\'85) living plainly, & when you are away, I attend to the children, hear their lessons &c & company\'85\'a0 She borrowed when here last, \'93Washington & His Generals.\'94\'a0 She has not returned yet a book she borrowed when she staid with me when Mrs. Duloc was here, & has some she borrowed last summer.\'a0 I have even forgotten what they were except one \'93the Hungarian Tales,\'94 Mrs. Gibbs gave me.\'a0 The others I believe were of the same nature.\'a0 I have heard of several engagements.\'a0 I believe I have not mentioned them, Eliza Earle to Mr. Breaker, & the Miss Juan who stays at Mr. Buists to Mr. Hearn Fountain Irvine, Emma Juan to Col. Irvine, Mary Long to Tom Crayton I have told you.\'a0 I do not know that any are true.\'a0 Take care of yourself my dear husband.\'a0 Frank still dreams of you.\'a0 I am so crowded between Frank & Fanny, I hardly sleep enough to dream.\'a0 Frank throws off the covering so & takes cold, that I am obliged to have him with me, to cover him,\'a0 Anna can\'85very prettily in different books.\'a0 I hope the Legislature with adjourn soon.\'a0 I hope also to hear from you tonight, & that today you are writing to me, so that I may hear Friday night.\'a0 I have written Pameta to thank her for your purse & the book.\'a0 E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again has the day come around for me to write to you.\'a0 I assure you it is a great interruption to your work, but I am willing to be interrupted if it is any satisfaction to you to hear.\'a0 I judge of you by myself, & I am not willing a\'85Mail should come without bringing me a letter.\'a0 I have just been reading the Mountaineer.\'a0 I miss your letters, they were more interesting to me than any others.\'a0 You are Chairman of Finance & Banks.\'a0 You must recollect what Mrs. Colcock told me last winter in town, that her husband though \ul President\ulnone  of the Bank, \ul disapproved\ulnone  of it, & said it was of \ul no\ulnone  \ul advantage\ulnone  to the \ul State\ulnone .\'a0 I read Mr. Sullivans letter about the Rail Road meeting, & he clearly shows, that it was from \ul manuvering\ulnone  \ul beforehand\ulnone , that the Convention terminated so unfavorably for Laurens & Greenville.\'a0 If there are to be as many R[ail] Roads through the State as are \ul now\ulnone  \ul projected\ulnone , after they are all built, they will not be able to pay their own expenses, for there is not freight or passengers enough for all.\'a0 It was the patronage of the greater part of the State, that was to make the Greenville Road profitable.\'a0 She was to get help from \ul all\ulnone , but now that help is to be \ul divided\ulnone .\'a0 One thing I am glad of that you are released from the payment of your Stock, & when you submit again, you must only subscribe \ul one\ulnone  \ul thousand\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone , the sum that so many richer than yourself subscribed.\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday night.\'a0 I am sorry that you spent Sunday writing letters.\'a0\'a0 I know that \ul going\ulnone  \ul to\ulnone  \ul church\ulnone  \ul alone\ulnone  will not carry us to heaven, but I think it shows our hearts are not in a right state, when we think it of no consequence to say Gods\'85.\'a0 \'93Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it \ul holy\ulnone .\'94\'a0 It certainly was not \ul holy\ulnone , to be writing Electioneering letters.\'a0 I wish you to write the letters, but not take the \ul Sabbath\ulnone  \ul Day\ulnone  for it.\'a0 Abridge time from your sleep. business or pleasure, but not from that day.\'a0 You have been peculiarly prosperous, & you above all others, ought one day in reserve to return thanks to God in his house for all his mercies to you.\'a0 I like to go to church on Sunday, not that I think performing that duty, & leaving others undone, will benefit me, but keeping the Sabbath holy is one of Gods commands, & I can keep it more holy at \ul church\ulnone  than anywhere else, & it is a respect we owe to a time honored custom, but I did not mean to say so much.\'a0 You are as Judge Butler said of Cousin Harriett his second wife, you are \ul near\ulnone  \ul perfection\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you to be \ul perfection\ulnone  \ul itself\ulnone .\'a0 If Col. Benjamin Perry opens my letters, he will think his wife has grown very sensible, that he was not aware how superior she was before.\'a0 You ought to have learnt by this time always to look at the back of your letters, & open them very carefully, & look at the signature.\'a0 I am sorry you refused lending Mr. Jones the money.\'a0 I would not have lent 50 but 25 dollars to show my good will, & it would have put him under obligations to you, which would have been to your advantage.\'a0 You must consider it a compliment as I do to be requested to lend.\'a0 My neighbours have much better opinion of my obliging disposition than I have of \ul theirs\ulnone , for I scrupulously avoid borrowing from them, knowing their \ul closeness\ulnone  & \ul illiberallity\ulnone , but they constantly let me know that they think me just the reverse of themselves.\'a0 Unless you have been very extravagant, you certainly have money to spare, so you must repent of your unkindness, & go to Mr. Jones immediately as soon as you receive this, & say Mr. Jones here are 20 dollars, I find I can lend you, you are welcome to it, if it can be of any service to you, I am sorry I have not more to spare.\'a0 He will be grateful to you, & he will then be able to bring his Wife & children a present, & even if he never returns it, I would rather lose it, than be \ul disobliging\ulnone .\'a0 It gives me great delight to oblige others.\'a0 I find it hard to refuse.\'a0 I expect that is the reason you are blessed with your dear Wife.\'a0 I knew it would break your heart, hard as it is, if I refused you.\'a0 I am certain Mr. Jones will return the money, so lend him some, & not be disobliging.\'a0 He must have been \ul hurt\ulnone  at your refusing, & you had more than usual in your purse, & ought to have been glad to have it in your power to assist.\'a0 Yesterday it was cloudy all day but did not rain.\'a0 Last night it rained, but stopped before breakfast.\'a0 It continues cloudy, & is wet & damp.\'a0 Perhaps it is well we have not killed the hogs yet, as it is rather warm, & they are so fat, they might have spoiled.\'a0 Jim is today putting the cabbage under a shelter.\'a0 Mr. Hoke he said intended killing hogs next week, I suppose if the weather is cold.\'a0 Jim said Mr. Hoke intended sending me 10 or 15 bushels of Potatoes, & when I had used those he would send \ul more\ulnone .\'a0 Instead of that he has sent me about 1 bushel.\'a0 I think Jim worked for him 7 or 8 days.\'a0 Willie & Anna are at school.\'a0 I told Willie I was going to write to you.\'a0 He asked if I was going to say they had been good children.\'a0 I told him I would say, \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone , which meant not \ul very\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  & not \ul very\ulnone  \ul bad\ulnone .\'a0 He said I must not say, \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  then.\'a0 I think they are as children go \ul good\ulnone , just as \ul good\ulnone , if not \ul better\ulnone  than \ul most\ulnone , & they have \ul honourable\ulnone  \ul feelings\ulnone .\'a0 Anna this morning got up before the fire was made, dressed, came down & got her book, & went upstairs, & commenced reading.\'a0 She is very \ul quick\ulnone , in all she does.\'a0 I feel very much interested in teaching them, & I am glad to bring the little knowledge I have into use.\'a0 I do all of Willie\'92s sums for him.\'a0 He is now even with Frank Hoke who is 15 & Willie is 8.\'a0 His last letter was written in a hurry.\'a0 Dilia Derbeck came home with Anna, & she distracted his attention.\'a0 He will write soon again.\'a0 Fanny is very sweet & good.\'a0 In the evening when she wont go to sleep, I lay her on the pillow on the floor, & she is happy kicking up her feet.\'a0 She can put her foot in her mouth.\'a0 She is so quick & active & lively & strong & sweet & good.\'a0 She loves Delia & me.\'a0 I expect she will not go to you.\'a0 She knows strangers & does not like them\'a0 & she will think her Papa a stranger.\'a0 I dare say my dear husband you would like to take a peep at home, but when you are homesick, recollect if you were at home, you would be worried by \ul Wife\ulnone , \ul children\ulnone , & \ul servants\ulnone , which worriment you have not now.\'a0 You have no one to scold you.\'a0 At Washington you will find it much pleasanter than Columbia.\'a0 There will be so much there to interest & improve you, & come \ul May\ulnone , \ul I\ulnone  may go on to see \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 Instead of six months you will have to go six years, but that circumstances\'a0 will determine, when you see how your business goes on.\'a0 I will make any sacrifices for your happiness, & I think it will be happiness to you associating\'a0 with the great & learned, & seeing men & things.\'a0 No happiness is without\'85, but perhaps ,you can even make arrangements, sometimes to have your family with you, hire out all our servants, & give up housekeeping in the winter, but I am calculating too surely.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 Yours truly & sincerely, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I must write you again.\'a0 Willie just put a letter of his in the Post Office this morning for you as he went to school.\'a0 He was interrupted \ul twice\ulnone , while writing it, so at last has to finish it in a hurry.\'a0 I received one from you last night.\'a0 I thank you for the present you have bought me.\'a0 Tell Genl Martin I will wear it with more pleasure knowing that Eloisa has one like it.\'a0 I am sorry for Judge Richardson, but his family if he did not, ought to have perceived he was too old to be a Judge.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says he ought to be impeached, or at \ul least\ulnone  he seemed to think it was right, but I cannot say whether it was right or not.\'a0 If he heard he was to be impeached, it seemed\'85he did not resign.\'a0 Perhaps he thinks the resolution will not pass.\'a0 It seems such a \ul dishonorable\ulnone  ending, for an \ul honorable\ulnone  life.\'a0 As regards the Mexican War, you must have told me all your doing on that subject, to make me \ul uneasy\ulnone , for you know I have always thought you too \ul zealous\ulnone  about it, particularly as you are a \ul Candidate\ulnone , & it is such an \ul unpopular\ulnone  \ul War\ulnone , say what you will about it.\'a0 Mr. Orr perhaps is in favor of it, but he has the good sense & prudence, not to express his opinion \ul constantly\ulnone .\'a0 By the means you have taken to spread abroad yours, you will lose the Whig votes, the Calhoun men votes, & many of the Democratic votes, for even the \ul Democrats\ulnone  are opposed to the War.\'a0 You & Col. Town[e]s are almost the only persons & Mr. Ritchie & Mr. Polk in favor of it.\'a0 As for me I think this country ought not to have considered the Mexicans worth fighting, & though an inferior people, like \ul fools\ulnone , they are the hardest to deal with, & in the end we will have to give way to them.\'a0 Everybody is tired of the War, & I wish we had peace on any terms.\'a0 We have more territory now than we can manage.\'a0 Disunion is even now threatened.\'a0 Therefore we are better without more Territory, & I do not see how \ul that\ulnone  is to pay back the money spent in carrying on the War, & it cannot make up for the blood spilt which is worth more than the whole of Mexico.\'a0 \ul Candidly\ulnone  I have read the speeches made on \ul both\ulnone  sides of the questions, & I \ul sincerely\ulnone  decide \ul against\ulnone  the \ul War\ulnone , & I think it most \ul unfortunate\ulnone  it was ever commenced.\'a0 It would have been best not to have noticed them, like some quarrels that persons get into, which are hard to settle & could so easily have been avoided at first. It is well you say, you are happy independent of being elected or not, for I think your prospects now, if you inquire, you will find very bad.\'a0 Mr. Orr ought to be happy electioneering himself, & \ul you\ulnone  electioneering for him.\'a0 If you are \ul indifferent\ulnone  as to mind \ul being\ulnone  \ul beaten\ulnone , you ought \ul not\ulnone  to be a Candidate, for a Candidate should \ul strive\ulnone  to be elected.\'a0 I will consider it a \ul great\ulnone  \ul disgrace\ulnone  for you to be beaten by a man like Mr. Orr.\'a0 If you had acted \ul judiciously \ulnone I am certain you would have been elected.\'a0 Mr Orr I see attends to the \ul interests\ulnone  of his \ul District\ulnone .\'a0 He does not meddle with the Mexican War.\'a0 Mr. Polk who originated it, must terminate it.\'a0 I have said more than I expected, but you must recollect, in \ul your\ulnone  \ul absence\ulnone , I have no one to sympathize with me, or express my thoughts & feelings to, so when I write to you, I embrace the opportunity to express them to you.\'a0 You know I \ul love\ulnone , \ul respect\ulnone  & have the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul admiration\ulnone  for you, but I think \ul sometimes\ulnone  you try to be \ul too\ulnone  \ul independent\ulnone , just to \ul show\ulnone  you are independent, & I feel certain by your course on the subject I have been writing, you have \ul weaned\ulnone  many from you, who would have supported you.\'a0 Tomorrow Jim & Charles will kill \ul half\ulnone  of the hogs.\'a0 We can attend to half at a time much better, & have fresh meat twice.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says some of yours would do better to fatten a little longer.\'a0 He only kills half of his.\'a0 He came over this morning to see me about it.\'a0 Mamma & Susan were here this morning.\'a0 Mr. Croft also made me a visit this morning.\'a0 I was engaged talking with him very interestingly about the Cunninghams &c. when Mamma came in.\'a0 Mr. Croft says Lawyers do not make as much as they did, that the Law is getting into disrepute, so you had better when Law declines, try & secure some other way of making money for your family, so you had better in future be more prudent how you act, for I think a seat in Congress now will be very eligible.\'a0I have been interrupted by Mr. Hooker who came to say he would go on putting up the fence on Wednesday, & would like Charles & Jim to help him.\'a0 It will be a great pleasure to me to see the fence continued.\'a0 I forgot to tell Mamma about Mr. Choice\'92s carri[a]ge, but I am certain Mr. Choice will not exchange, & his carri[a]ge I think smaller than Mamma\'92s.\'a0 It can hold only 2 in the\'85.Mamma\'92s though crowded can hold 4, his is the prettiest looking.\'a0 Vardry has been here.\'a0 As you are his \ul Godfather\ulnone , I would like you to bring him a present, a Toy of some kind.\'a0 Bring \ul him\ulnone  a present, instead of bringing one to \ul Susan\ulnone .\'a0 I told Mr. Croft you had seen Mr. Gliddon, & that you had a book written by him, so he borrowed the book to read.\'a0 Mr. Hooker said Judge Richardson ought to be made to resign, the general impression is that he should be made.\'a0 His last Circuit I suppose showed he was incapable of performing his duties.\'a0 A certain\'a0 age \ul 65\ulnone \'a0 will have to be fixed for the Judges to continue in office.\'a0 You once before introduced some such bill.\'a0 Suppose you introduce it this Session.\'a0 I know of no news whatever to tell you.\'a0 I have had a cold, but am now quite well.\'a0 I have written in a great hurry, & often been interrupted.\'a0 Aunt Eliza wrote word that Susan on her return from Columbia lost her Trunk.\'a0 The Omnibus in which it was placed went first to the Wilmington boat, & it must have been placed on board the boat by mistake.\'a0 It contained \ul all\ulnone  of Susan\'92s clothes, all of them new.\'a0 She had fitted herself up \ul completely\ulnone , all of their Jewels, & a valuable package for Miss Elmore, & presents made Susan in Columbia.\'a0 The loss she says is not much less than 300 dollars.\'a0 Every effort has been made to recover it but without success.\'a0 Alston\'92s wife she says, is a lovely gentle being, intelligent & pious.\'a0 They are all very much pleased with her.\'a0 She sent Mamma a Slice of Wedding cake.\'a0 You will be glad to hear from me, I know, though I reason with you on some of your acts.\'a0 It is all for your good.\'a0 Fanny is crying for me.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\cf0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just put Fanny asleep, & will embrace the opportunity while she is in the cradle to write to you.\'a0 Yesterday was the great Hog killing day.\'a0 I changed my mind about killing only \ul half\ulnone , & had \ul all\ulnone  killed \ul except\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  that is \ul crippled\ulnone  & that Jim thought ought \ul not\ulnone  to be killed.\'a0 He has turned it into the Stable yard; one we killed after you went, so that left \ul 12\ulnone  to be killed yesterday.\'a0 Today Charles is cutting them up & salting them & Delia & Minerva are drying the Lard.\'a0 Unfortunately, it is a delightful \ul mild\ulnone  day, but Charles thinks it will turn cold again, & that there is no danger of the meat spoiling.\'a0 I was glad to have the hogs killed so as to save your Corn.\'a0 This morning was cloudy, & looked like rain.\'a0 It was the day Mr. Hooker was to have continued putting up the Fence, but as the weather seemed unfavorable, but he told Jim, he disliked throwing down the fence in such weather, so he had better haul wood, that he might not be interrupted.\'a0 When he \ul did\ulnone  commence, since then, the weather has improved, but I hope it will continue so, & that he will begin tomorrow.\'a0 Mr. Elford sent yesterday to let me know he was going to Columbia, & would take anything to you, so I sent you your purse, that you might have an opportunity of showing it, it is so pretty, but recollect that you are not to \ul use\ulnone  it.\'a0 It is to be reserved for \ul Washington\ulnone , & to hold the first money that you receive \ul there\ulnone .\'a0 I wrote to Pamela, to thank her, & to tell her she must still write the note she intended to have sent with it.\'a0 Mr. Croft says Mrs. B\'85 was at Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 Mr. Croft soon goes to town, to wile away he says the \ul loneliness\ulnone  of the Winter.\'a0 I told him he ought to bring a companion back with him, to wile away the Winter \ul here\ulnone .\'a0 He said he was afraid his case was \ul hopeless\ulnone .\'a0 So you see he regards children & grandchildren as nothing, for he could have his daughter & her children to pass the whole Winter here with him, but he is not satisfied, he wants a \ul Wife\ulnone ; no one like a \ul Wife\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Pearsons children are sick at present, so she cannot go when Mr. Croft does.\'a0 In January one of her brothers will come for her.\'a0 She must have found it \ul unpleasant\ulnone  with her husband in Florida, or I think she would have remained, where she would have a \ul settled\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 In the last letter I wrote you, I gave you a good deal of advice on the Mexican War.\'a0 I have since come to the conclusion not to meddle with Politics, but leave you to act as you choose, though of course hearing as much of politics as I do, I must form an opinion, but I believe my opinion is as Judge Colcocks used to be of the roads; if you take \ul one\ulnone  side I am always afraid you have taken the \ul wrong\ulnone  side, & that the \ul other\ulnone  \ul side\ulnone  is the \ul right\ulnone  one so I do not like you to be too obstinate on the side you have taken, & you must promise me to think of your own \ul interest\ulnone , even while you are \ul acting\ulnone  \ul conscientiously\ulnone , & I will not advise you.\'a0 Aunt Eliza said in her last letter said Cousin Isaac was in Columbia, with what \ul prospect\ulnone  she hardly knew.\'a0 Is he a Candidate for Attorney General, & does it come on in this Session.\'a0 If it does, & he \ul is\ulnone  a Candidate, without \ul wishing\ulnone  to advise you, you must vote for him on account of \ul Aunt\ulnone  \ul Eliza\ulnone , who I esteem as one of the \ul best\ulnone  of my \ul friends\ulnone  & know she would be \ul hurt\ulnone , if you did not vote for Cousin Isaac.\'a0 I am anxious what has been done with Judge Richardson.\'a0 I\'a0 have nothing interesting \ul at\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone  to write you.\'a0 I have not been out for a long time, & owe almost everyone visits, so I have seen very few, & am so busy working, I am glad not to be interrupted.\'a0 Writing \ul so\ulnone  \ul often\ulnone  to you is a great interruption.\'a0 Mr. Buist did not go to Bachelors Retreat as he expected, on account of the unfavorable weather, so I had yesterday to write to Mrs. Duloc to tell her about it.\'a0 The bundle I will have to keep I expect a long time.\'a0 Willie & Anna are at school.\'a0 Anna sometimes lays the Supper Table entirely herself, & is very proud of it, so I told her I would tell you of it.\'a0 Frank says he does not want a \ul dog\ulnone  \ul knife\ulnone , wants another kind of knife.\'a0 I am anxious to see my Brooch.\'a0 When will Mamma\'92s chair come?\'a0 & When will the Legislature adjourn?\'a0 The village seems \ul very\ulnone  \ul dull\ulnone .\'a0 I am sure it is well our happiness is at \ul Home\ulnone , for there is nothing \ul anywhere\ulnone  \ul else\ulnone  to contribute to it.\'a0 If you are elected to Congress, the delight of \ul writing\ulnone , will be enough to compensate for \ul all\ulnone  the \ul pain\ulnone  \ul experienced\ulnone  by the \ul previous\ulnone  \ul absence\ulnone .\'a0 I have laid out \ul very\ulnone  \ul economical\ulnone  \ul plans\ulnone , if you \ul do\ulnone  \ul go\ulnone , in \ul your\ulnone  \ul absence\ulnone  to hire out Minerva, Mary & Lindy.\'a0 Minerva will bring good wages as a Cook, & even when you return, to continue hiring out Mary & Lindy.\'a0 Charlotte could now do most of what Lindy does, & Delia is to learn to cook, & Eliza can help iron.\'a0 Edward can fix the house &c. &c.\'a0 It is such a monotonous life in Greenville.\'a0 I am glad for you to have a little variety.\'a0 Mrs. Butlers son George has come on to visit her.\'a0 I have not seen Mrs. Butler for a long time.\'a0 She said I must ride & see her, but the weather has been too cold, & now it is pleasant, Jim will be engaged.\'a0 Susan stopped here yesterday for a short time.\'a0 She seems well & I think more cheerful than she was.\'a0 Mamma was not well.\'a0 As I have literally \ul nothing\ulnone  to write you[.]\'a0 I might as well stop now, & Fanny is \ul crying\ulnone  for me.\'a0 She woke long ago, & Lindy has been holding her.\'a0 I hope to hear tonight.\'a0 Willie was so disappointed when I read to him what you wrote about Mr. Summer\'92s having no Dog to give him, that he had laid down on the rug, & cried; he thought Mr. Summer had treated him very badly, but do not mention this to Willie, as he does not like things told about him.\'a0 Your affectionate & \ul obedient\ulnone  Wife, Liz\

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I hope I am going to write, now, one of my \ul last\ulnone  letters to you, that you will \ul very\ulnone  \ul soon\ulnone  be at \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 The remainder of my letters I promise you shall be \ul pleasant\ulnone  ones, for I do not intend to give you any more \ul advice\ulnone , & only wonder that I should have ever set up \ul my\ulnone  \ul will\ulnone  & \ul judgement\ulnone , in opposition to \ul yours\ulnone , you know you are in my opinion \ul incomparable\ulnone .\'a0 I received two \ul delightful\ulnone  letters from you Wednesday night.\'a0\'a0 I wish you had written me two \ul every\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone .\'a0 Your letters have been my \ul chief\ulnone  \ul pleasure \ulnone since you left.\'a0 They compensate me a \ul little\ulnone  for your absence.\'a0 I thank you for \ul all\ulnone  you have got for us.\'a0 You are so \ul generous\ulnone , that when away from me, I believe there is no wish of mine you would not gratify.\'a0 I am always afraid to express a wish, knowing you will go \ul beyond\ulnone  it.\'a0 You deserve a \ul good\ulnone  \ul Wife\ulnone , & I will be a \ul kind\ulnone  \ul sweet \ulnone wife to you.\'a0 I wish you to love your \ul Home\ulnone  & those \ul in\ulnone  it \ul above\ulnone  \ul every\ulnone  thing.\'a0 They ought to constitute your \ul chief\ulnone  \ul happiness\ulnone , but your duty to your \ul country \ulnone also, must not be forgotten, & you are so well fitted to be of service to your Country, that you must be willing even at a sacrifice to your \ul feelings\ulnone , to devote your talents & all the gifts you possess for your Countrys interest.\'a0 My only fear has been, whether in going to Congress, you can still \ul support\ulnone  your family, but I have thought what you made by \ul going \ulnone would compensate for what you lose in \ul practice\ulnone , & as Law business is \ul declining\ulnone , perhaps you would do just as well, as you will not make as much in future at the Law.\'a0 Except in Equity & that business, you can still carry on almost as well as if you were here all the time.\'a0 I think perhaps you can even carry your \ul family\ulnone  to Washington \ul sometimes \ulnone if you are elected.\'a0 Mr. Barnwell Rhett who is very economical did.\'a0 Housekeeping is expensive, & if we give up Housekeeping a \ul whole\ulnone  \ul Winter\ulnone , & hire out \ul all\ulnone  our servants, \ul except one\ulnone  who will stay at home to take care of the negro children & the animals, this will enable us to pay the board of our family at Washington.\'a0 However after you go on one Winter & see how matters are, you can make some pleasant arrangement I know.\'a0 One thing I am \ul determined\ulnone  on, & that is not to have as many servants about us as we now have.\'a0 It is a useless expense, the feeding & clothing so many\'a0 & losing the interest on the money they cost.\'a0 I have done so well without Edward, that I will be sorry when he comes back, & I think then we must hire out Lindy, or put her out to Mary McLeod; but I must not fill up my letter with all these plans.\'a0 I only mention them, that you may know we \ul can\ulnone  live more economically, if there is a \ul necessity\ulnone  for it. & to beg you not to have any \ul misgivings\ulnone  on your \ul future\ulnone  \ul course\ulnone .\'a0 Your judgement is so \ul good\ulnone  that I do not think you would have \ul formed\ulnone  such plans for yourself if they have been \ul wrong\ulnone , & I am not going to \ul worry\ulnone  about the election, but leave you to manage it as you think best.\'a0 \ul Hoping \ulnone that you will manage us to be \ul successful\ulnone .\'a0 You do not write a \ul scrawl\ulnone , your writing is as plain to me as \ul print\ulnone , only \ul sometimes\ulnone  the name of an \ul individual \ulnone I cannot make out, but the name I asked you about I \ul told \ulnone Willie looked like \ul Symms\ulnone , you spelt it with a y , but I did not think it was \ul Simms\ulnone , because I did not know \ul he \ulnone knew much about \ul Congress\ulnone , or even \ul knew\ulnone  Mr. Orr.\'a0 I had forgotten he was once a member of the Legislature himself.\'a0 Since our Hogs were killed, the weather has become \ul warm\ulnone , but many have killed, even since it became warm, so I suppose there is no danger of our Meat spoiling, & that it will turn\'85soon again.\'a0 Yesterday it rained, today it is cloudy & looks like rain, so our fence has not been commenced yet.\'a0 Margaret this week sent to beg me to let Eliza go & help her work.\'a0 I asked the servant who she was working for, & among others she mentioned, she was making a \ul Wedding\ulnone  \ul dress\ulnone  for \ul Miss\ulnone  \ul Foster\ulnone .\'a0 I asked when she was to be married.\'a0 She said Christmas.\'a0 So Harriet Foster must have been accepted.\'a0 Dr. Hillhouse, so much for owning a few negroes, it makes up even for lameness.\'a0 I am \ul glad\ulnone  she is to be married, for I would be sorry that a \ul misfortune\ulnone  debar her of happiness in this life,\'a0 but certainly it is owing to what she \ul has\ulnone , not what she \ul is\ulnone , that she should be chosen, & it does not say much for the young man.\'a0 I have been reading the Mountaineer, but I do not take the interest in \ul Col.\ulnone  \ul Townes\ulnone  letters, as I did in \ul yours\ulnone  for I principally wish to hear about \ul you\ulnone , & of course when you wrote, you mentioned all you did.\'a0 I see Col. Townes is going to introduce the bill I told \ul you\ulnone  to, limiting the Judge to 65.\'a0 It will\'85the Judges feelings, & they will retire from the Bench\'a0 with \ul honor\ulnone , except, they will be apt to \ul conceal\ulnone  their age & \ul never\ulnone  \ul reach\ulnone  \ul 65\ulnone .\'a0 Willie & Anna are at school.\'a0 Anna often lays the supper table.\'a0 The other evening after laying it, she ran in the kitchen & brought in the supper.\'a0 She said, you must write & tell papa I brought in \ul every\ulnone  \ul thing\'a0 \ulnone except the \ul Tea\ulnone .\'a0 I said yes, & \ul every\ulnone  \ul thing\ulnone  was the \ul hot\ulnone  \ul water\ulnone  & \ul bread\ulnone , she said the \ul Molasses\ulnone  too.\'a0 Frank repeats constantly, \'93why don\'92t Pa come.\'94\'a0 I told him of the pretty knife you have bought him.\'a0 He wants to know how many \ul blades\ulnone  it has, is very much afraid it has \ul not\ulnone  \ul two\ulnone .\'a0 He must have \ul two\ulnone  \ul blades\ulnone , he says like\'85. as he calls Willie.\'a0 Fanny has had a cold, but it is almost well now.\'a0 She wets her clothes so from \ul drivelling\ulnone .\'a0 It is impossible to keep her from catching cold.\'a0 She presses her gums together, as if they hurt her.\'a0 I hope before long she will have some Teeth.\'a0 We were not able to go to Mrs. Perry Duncan\'92s Thursday, as I expected.\'a0 I do not know if we can go at all, but if possible we will go one day next week.\'a0 I want to ask Mr. & Mrs. Arthur to pass one day with me, before you return, if not after you come back.\'a0 I told her I was going to.\'a0 Cousin Isaac\'92s Wife is not \ul amiable\ulnone , but \ul selfish\ulnone  in the \ul extreme\ulnone  & so \ul fussy\ulnone .\'a0 She had a child after I left last Winter.\'a0 She did not nurse it, & now expects to have another, & Aunt Eliza says, she will not \ul leave\ulnone  the \ul house \ulnone except to \ul ride\ulnone , & if she had kept her own counsel, she would have gone out some time longer, without anyone knowing even, she was in that way.\'a0 I dare say she is not an \ul amiable\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone .\'a0 She is too selfish \ul even\ulnone  for \ul that\ulnone .\'a0 I expect \ul she\ulnone  \ul made\ulnone  cousin Isaac leave Alabama.\'a0 For Aunt Eliza\'92s sake, I would like him elected, his own too, as I am sorry for him.\'a0 Although you have never been a particular friend of his, you must do what you \ul consistently\ulnone  can for him, but I expect \ul no\ulnone  \ul election\ulnone  comes on now.\'a0 I have heard of none, & I forgot I must not \ul advise\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I will be \ul disappointed\ulnone  if I do not hear from you tonight.\'a0 Mamma is not well, the rest as usual.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\

\cf0 My dear husband\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you last night.\'a0 Willie was very much disappointed at not receiving one also.\'a0 We had calculated that last night was the time for his answer to come.\'a0 I hope he will hear the next Mail, as you were too busy to write by the last.\'a0 It is a great comfort to hear \ul regularly\ulnone , & be \ul certain\ulnone  that each Mail \ul will\ulnone  bring a letter.\'a0 When you go to Washington, if \ul I\ulnone  do not go with you we will write to each other \ul every\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone .\'a0 I \ul do\ulnone  think it \ul is\ulnone  a price of \ul independence\ulnone  for Mr. Orr to oppose \ul you\ulnone , & that is \ul one\ulnone  \ul reason\ulnone , I \ul particularly\ulnone  wish you to \ul beat\ulnone  \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad that you have favorable accounts from Pickens.\'a0 It depends entirely upon \ul yourself\ulnone , whether you are elected.\'a0 I believe if you \ul exert\ulnone  \ul yourself\ulnone , & do \ul all\ulnone  that \ul ought\ulnone  to be done, you \ul will\ulnone  be \ul elected.\ulnone \'a0 Last week the weather was so bad, Mr. Hooker was not able to do anything to the Fence, until Saturday afternoon, when he put up \ul one\ulnone  \ul panel\ulnone .\'a0 Today he is \ul actually\ulnone  at \ul this\ulnone  \ul moment\ulnone  going on with it.\'a0 It is now \ul one\ulnone  week since we killed hogs.\'a0 The weather turned warm the \ul very\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  we killed & has ever since continued warm, that we have sometimes, sat without fire.\'a0 The Sausage meat & the Livers have both spoilt, before we used them, & if the weather continues so, much longer, I will be uneasy about the Meat.\'a0 After you left, \ul soon\ulnone , I begged Jim to kill, but he said \ul no\ulnone , we must wait for Mr. Hoke.\'a0 You said he must kill with him, & also wait for the \ul increase\ulnone  of the Moon, & all we have gained by waiting, is warm weather.\'a0 The Salt with the Meat I suppose will preserve it.\'a0 Mr. Hoke I believe is not uneasy about his, & his is much larger meat than ours.\'a0 It is cloudy today, & does not yet look like clearing , but it is not \ul raining\ulnone .\'a0 Willie & Anna have gone to school.\'a0 They will holiday next week, for six weeks.\'a0 Willie is the only boy of his age, that learns history.\'a0 He commenced a letter to you Saturday, but did not have time to finish it.\'a0 Anna says I must be sure & tell you how nicely she lays the table & puts on \ul everything\ulnone .\'a0 She then runs upstairs, & turns down the beds, & fills the pitchers.\'a0 She will get through her reading book in a day or two.\'a0 Frank says he dreamt last night you had come home, & brought him a knife & marbles.\'a0 Fanny has had a bad cold, which has prevented her improving as much as she would have done, but she is very sweet & pretty,\'a0 She will be delighted with her present, for she loves to hear a noise, & to put things in her mouth.\'a0 Yesterday morning I went to church.\'a0 Mr. Arthur preached a \ul very\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  \ul sermon\ulnone , to a \ul very\ulnone  \ul small\ulnone  \ul congregation\ulnone .\'a0 I am sure if he was \ul heard\ulnone , he would be \ul liked\ulnone , \ul better\ulnone  than the \ul other\ulnone  \ul Ministers\ulnone  here but persons do not even give themselves the opportunity of judging what kind of preacher he is.\'a0 In the afternoon I carried the children with me to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 They were all there as usual.\'a0 Mamma said I must remember her to you.\'a0 I told them about what you said about Mr. Choice\'92s carri[a]ge.\'a0 They said they would be \ul very\ulnone  \ul glad\ulnone  to exchange theirs for it, but I am certain Mr. Choice would not change. Mr. Luther McBee & his brothers have gone to N. Carolina to Vardry McBee\'92s wedding, which takes place Thursday night.\'a0 I think the lady\'92s name is Sumner,\'a0 She has no property.\'a0 I have hardly seen Mr. Luther to \ul speak\ulnone  to, since the separation \ul first\ulnone  took place.\'a0 Susan I am certain has told him, what little I said of him, & which I said, in consequence\'a0 of their thinking me \ul lukewarm\ulnone  & \ul partial\ulnone  to \ul him\ulnone , & they provoked me by telling me he cursed \ul you\ulnone  a whole night & cursed me &c.\'a0 If he was\'a0 inclined to like \ul us\ulnone , & our \ul not\ulnone  \ul opposing\ulnone  of the separation, the good opinion was soon removed, by being told, we had \ul originally\ulnone  dispproved of the \ul marriage\ulnone .\'a0 I do not think \ul separation\ulnone  will be tried again.\'a0 It is well it \ul has\ulnone  \ul been\ulnone , for they have now seen the inefficiency of it, which they would never have been satisfied of, if they had not \ul tried\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Butler came to see me Friday.\'a0 She said it was only the second time she had been in, since you left.\'a0 She asked me what you wrote about.\'a0 I told her of the Brooch you had bought me.\'a0 She said she had seen the kind.\'a0 They were \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Lowndes had one, & asked the \ul price\ulnone .\'a0 I told her $1.50.\'a0 She said if she had known they were as cheap as that, she would have given you the money to buy \ul Behethland\ulnone  one, so if you think proper, \ul you\ulnone  may buy one for Behethland.\'a0 She said Behethland was making \ul me\ulnone  a \ul Chain\ulnone , of \ul course\ulnone  I will have to make her some \ul return\ulnone .\'a0 So I think you had \ul better\ulnone  \ul buy\ulnone  a \ul Brooch\ulnone  for her.\'a0 I did not ask Miss Rodgers to stay with me, it being particularly inconvenient.\'a0 After you return, I will ask her perhaps, for a short time.\'a0 I have been very busy \'85king, & the weather has been bad,\'a0 Minerva also busy making her clothes.\'a0 I have so many more uses for my money than I expected, that I thought I had better send Mrs. D\'91Oyley a barrel of flour.\'a0 Flour is at \ul all\ulnone  \ul times\ulnone  acceptable, for if she has it now, when that gives out, it will save her buying more, so I sent the barrel.\'a0 I have $2.12 \'bd still for her, which I will spend for her, before you come back.\'a0\'a0 Judge Dunkin is very kind, but not more so than he ought to be.\'a0 How \ul much\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  the rich \ul might\ulnone  \ul do\ulnone , without even feeling the loss of the money they so spend.\'a0 Mr. Hoke has a bad \ul bile\ulnone  or \ul boil\ulnone  on his leg, which confines him to the house.\'a0 He cannot walk.\'a0 It must be a great trial to a restless, active person like himself, particularly when he must wish to be electioneering, the election being so near at hand.\'a0 Mr. Nat Heyward has returned to Charleston & Mr. Beauford Dean has come to take his place.\'a0 Beauford is our family name.\'a0 I think there must be some connexion between us.\'a0 Mr. Hoke has put his house lower down than where it stood before.\'a0 I expect he intends to put a store next to McNicols.\'a0 The brick foundation is up several feet.\'a0 He intends to have a Basement story, with a kitchen & [page torn] room in it. You must be very busy, & ought to be happy to be so useful.\'a0 The Telegraph is\'85sent now.\'a0 I suppose they do not send it, because \ul you\ulnone  are \ul in\ulnone  Columbia, so I have not seen the report of your speech.\'a0 I dare say Mr. Speers has gone to Columbia to see if he can be appointed the one to \ul digest\ulnone  the \ul Laws\ulnone .\'a0 I saw a bill was introduced relating to that matter, & I thought perhaps Mr. Speers would try to be elected, to do it.\'a0 I wonder who will succeed Judge Richardson.\'a0 I think \ul you\ulnone  would have stood a good chance, if you had not had other views.\'a0 I do not think Mr. Wardlaw ought to be elected.\'a0 Two brothers ought not to be so favored, & besides he is not much.\'a0 I am surprised Mr. Poinsett was not chosen as Trustee in his place.\'a0 I see in the papers the death of Miss Crawford, & of Mrs. Brisbane, Mr. Thomas only remaining sister.\'a0 He had but two, the other died a few years ago.\'a0 She had I expect 12 children or more, & most of them daughters.\'a0 Mr. Gibbs also you saw at Glenn Springs is also dead.\'a0 I hope you have received your purse \ul safely\ulnone .\'a0 Wednesday I am going to ask Mr. & Mrs. Arthur to dine with me.\'a0 I saw Genl Thompson in the streets yesterday.\'a0 I got a message from Mrs. Town[e]s today.\'a0 They are well.\'a0 Truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I must write you a few lines \ul tonight\ulnone , because tomorrow Mrs. Arthur & Mamma\'92s family are to dine with me, & I will not have a moment to spare for writing.\'a0 The barrel of Cider was bought\'85ago., by the Mr. Millers father & son.\'a0 Willie received from Mr. Gantt two \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone  letters, one was written 2 weeks ago when he thought Mr. Miller was going to bring the Cider then, the other was written yesterday.\'a0 In one of the letters he tells Willie, Mr. Miller is connected with a large, respectable & influential family in Pickens, the Alexanders, & that if \ul you\ulnone  were at home, he would have advised\'a0 you to pay him some attention, with a view to the result at the Congressional Election, so \ul I\ulnone  took the \ul hint\ulnone , & was very polite, asked them to take Supper which they did, & I pressed them to pass the night, but they said they had to sleep at the Mill, with their Grain.\'a0 I asked them to come back to breakfast tomorrow.\'a0 They said they would as they had to come for T\'85. Mr. Gantt sent the letter by the \ul son\ulnone , who came to his fathers last night, about 15 miles from here near Pickensville.\'a0 The old man lives & they came on together.\'a0 I am to pay 1 dollar for bringing the Cider.\'a0 Mr. Gantt in his letter says the Cider ought to be drawn off \ul immediately\ulnone , & put in smaller vessels, or it will turn \ul acid\ulnone , but I have nothing to put it in.\'a0\'a0 He gives Willie a great deal of \ul good\ulnone  \ul advice\ulnone .\'a0 Wilie is \ul now\ulnone  writing to him.\'a0 Poor T\'85 we are all sorry to part with him.\'a0 Mr. Gantt says he will be \ul kind\ulnone  to him, & if ever he parts with him return him to Willie.\'a0 Yesterday I wrote to you, & it was \ul warm,\ulnone  last night, it \ul rained\ulnone  \ul hard\ulnone , then the \ul wind blew\ulnone , & this morning it cleared up \ul cold\ulnone , tonight it is \ul very\ulnone  \ul cold\ulnone .\'a0 It is well for our meat, that this change has taken place, for if the warm weather had continued only a \ul little\ulnone  longer, it would have \ul spoiled\ulnone .\'a0 As it is, the Sausage meat, Liver, & Hogs head cheese, have all been \ul useless\ulnone .\'a0 Jim examined the Meat yesterday & says it is \ul safe\ulnone .\'a0 I am happy to tall you that for two days Mr. Hooker has been working on the Fence, & it has now almost reached the office.\'a0 Yesterday I looked at it repeatedly, today the wind has been so high, I have hardly been to the door.\'a0 Mr. Arthur is going away tomorrow, so only Mrs. Arthur is coming, & those at Mamma\'92s.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s yesterday, sent to ask me to fix upon a day to go to Mr. Duncans, so I fixed upon Friday, as by that time Mr. Hooker will not need Jim to help him, so Friday if it is a \ul good\ulnone  day, you can imagine us there.\'a0 Mr. Croft goes to town Thursday.\'a0 I had intended writing to some of my friends by him, but he goes so much sooner than I expected, that I am afraid now, I will not be able to.\'a0 The Mr. Miller\'92s asked me the news from Columbia, so I told them all I knew.\'a0 I told them Judge Harper\'92s family had been given by the Senate a years Salary.\'a0 They \ul disapproved\ulnone  of that.\'a0 I told them \ul you\ulnone  voted \ul against\ulnone  it.\'a0 They said there were a great many \ul poor\ulnone  \ul families\ulnone  besides Judge Harpers.\'a0 There was no reason they should have money given them.\'a0 They asked if anything had been done for Col. Butlers family?\'a0 I said I had heard of nothing.\'a0 I expected \ul Congress\ulnone  would attend to that.\'a0 They said yes, it was by \ul Congress\ulnone .\'a0 The provision ought to be a years salary.\'a0 Mr. Hooker said Judge Harpers family ought \ul not\ulnone  to have a years salary, that it was time now to stop that practice.\'a0 Do you not think it would be a good plan to buy your garden seeds of Mr. Russel[l] in Columbia.\'a0 When we went to Housekeeping you used to do so, & we had much better vegetables than we now have.\'a0 I expect they keep the seeds here from year to year.\'a0 At Russel[l]s you would be more apt to get them fresh.\'a0 I write in a hurry, & am dictating at the same time, Willies letter.\'a0\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 We long to see you.\'a0 I expect you will have \ul dreadful\ulnone  \ul roads\ulnone  to travel home, but you must not mind it when you recollect\'a0 that every step however slow & rough, brings you nearer home, & when you \ul get\ulnone  \ul home\ulnone , it will be pleasant to talk of all\'a0 of all that has passed during your absence.\'a0 The talk will all be on your side, for \ul nothing\ulnone  has occurred since you left.\'a0 This is a dull season.\'a0 You ought to be glad to be away from Greenville a short time, that you may not stagnate.\'a0 I do not hear of any weddings to take place.\'a0 All the engagements I believe were mere rumours.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tomorrow.\'a0 I wrote you yesterday, so have nothing to write about now.\'a0 Anna got through her reading book today.\'a0 She is a smart little girl.\'a0 Mr. Gantt wrote \ul beautiful\ulnone  letters to Willie, giving him \ul good\ulnone  \ul advice\ulnone , & speaking of his friendship for you.\'a0 I think he will be \ul pleased\ulnone  to receive an answer from him.\'a0 If the Legislature adjourns \ul Friday\ulnone , this will be my last letter.\'a0 If it does not, I will write again.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write a few lines to you tonight, as perhaps you may remain long enough in Anderson, to get this letter by the Mail, which I will be obliged to send it by, as I know of no private opportunity.\'a0 I write, because I think your mind will be more at ease, & your absence from home, you will bear better, if you receive a few lines from your Wife assuring you of the welfare of herself & family.\'a0 So I hope you will get this letter before you leave Anderson.\'a0 I will tell you now of all that has occurred since we parted.\'a0 Sunday morning, Susan came in, & the children & myself went to church with her, in her carri[a]ge.\'a0 I was glad not to use our carri[a]ge, for Jim thought it entirely unfit for use,\'a0 It was damp & muddy.\'a0 Mr. Arthur gave us a very good sermon.\'a0 Mr. Arthur met with me.\'a0 I spoke to a good many after church, who enquired when I returned.\'a0 We rode with Susan over to see Mamma, & then Susan came back with her children, & went up to dine at Mr. McBee\'92s.\'a0 Sunday afternoon I staid at home, & read to the children, & myself.\'a0 Monday morning, Susan & Ann walked in, & Ann staid here, while I went to shop with Susan.\'a0 In Mr. Beattie\'92s we saw Mr. Erwin Jones, who said he supposed you had gone to Anderson, that there was too little business for the other Lawyers to go, for if there was business to be got, you would get it.\'a0 Mr. Beattie & himself both said, that you ought to go to Court now, for other purposes as well as Law business, to see the people.\'a0 In the streets I saw Mr. Elford who was just setting off for Anderson.\'a0 I told him to tell you we were well, that I had not had time to write, & that he must bring me a letter when [he] returned.\'a0 In the afternoon Mamma said I must walk & meet them on the road, & bring home Anna, who had returned with Susan & Ann to dine with them, so I set off with Frank & Fanny, but not meeting them, walked the whole way to their house, where I found them just starting.\'a0 So I went in & paid a visit, & Susan walked part of the way back with me.\'a0 This morning Mr. Croft paid me a visit.\'a0 Soon after he left, it commenced raining, & has been raining pretty steadily ever since.\'a0 It is raining now.\'a0 Yesterday Jim cleaned the carri[a]ge , but he says, it does not look as well as it did.\'a0 He thinks it is so much injured it ought to be varnished.\'a0 It is a pity he did not clean immediately, instead of letting it remain damp & dirty so long.\'a0 Charles spaded the beds in the garden, that had not been spaded, & hauled manure.\'a0 Today Jim hauled Manure.\'a0 As soon as the weather permits he will plough.\'a0 Delia today seemed ailing, & said she had dreadful pain in her chest, so I thought she ought to be attended to at once, & sent her to Dr. Earle to prescribe for her.\'a0 He gave her a phial of Medicine, of which she is to take two teaspoonsful every day, & a box of ointment with which she is to rub the lumps in her chest & neck once a day.\'a0 He wrote word, her symptoms were Scrofulous.\'a0 So I am very glad I sent her to him, so that she may at once take what is necessary.\'a0 Willie has got \ul head\ulnone  in his class.\'a0 He says there are about 27 boys in the class.\'a0 So I think the little fellow deserves praise.\'a0 No letters have come for you.\'a0 The Charleston Courier\'92s, the Carolinian, the Union, & Mr. Footes speech sent you by \ul himself\ulnone  are all that have come.\'a0 I see by the Courier tonight, that the Model Artists have been exhibiting at the Theater in Charleston & have been treated with \ul deserved\ulnone  \ul contempt\ulnone , by the \ul press\ulnone , the \ul Ladies\ulnone , & the \ul Moral\ulnone  \ul portion\ulnone  of the \ul gentlemen\ulnone .\'a0 I suppose, for it would only be the \ul low\ulnone  &\ul  vile\ulnone  who would \ul degrade\ulnone  \ul themselves\ulnone , by going to such an exhibition.\'a0 I have no further news of Mrs. Ru\'85, when she left Edgefield, she was barely alive.\'a0 The Doctors gave her\'85constantly to sooth her pain.\'a0 He saw her only once, & the room was so dark, he could hardly distinguish her, but he expected she was altered so much, that her friends would not recognize her, that the family were all in great distress.\'a0 Mr. Croft made me a pleasant visit.\'a0 He likes Mr. Bradshaw very much, says this was a hard hearted community, that if one was going downhill, all felt disposed to give a knock, that Mr. Bradshaw owed about a thousand dollars, that his school was worth to him 1500 a year, so in a short time he would be able to pay all he owed, that he had borrowed money to pay old debts, & also to send to an aged parent in Ireland, the part of the church money he had returned, that he wanted to put him at the head of the Sunday school, that he was a first rate farmer & gardener, & his wife had 7 children, & going to have her eighth.\'a0 Speaking of the Election he said, you would get all of Greenville with a few exceptions, one of which was Mr.Wa\'85, that your friends were doing all they could for you, but that \ul you\ulnone  must do your \ul best\ulnone , & made \ul assurance\ulnone  \ul doubly\ulnone  \ul sure\ulnone , that Mr. Orr he heard would get all of Anderson.\'a0 Speaking of L.W. Barksdales cases, which he said you mentioned to him. He said you were right to defend Mr. Richardson when he asked you to, but he says Mr. Richardson ought to have whipped his servant well for his impertinence in driving against Mr. Barksdale.\'a0 He also said what I wish you would have heard, that Lawyers can defend cases, justly to their Clients, without hurting the feelings of their opponents at all; that it is their business to argue on the testimony brought into Court, & not leave that to abuse the \ul Character\ulnone  of the opposite party, that when they do so, they are travelling out of the Record, for the characters of the parties have \ul generally\ulnone  (though of course sometimes) nothing to do with the case, though there is no reason at all why you should hurt the \ul feelings\ulnone  of your opponent, & when the feelings are so hurt, the person never forgets it,\'a0 but harbors a secret revenge, which he embraces the first opportunity of gratifying.\'a0 He says Judge Gailliard always made it a rule to argue with the greatest \ul ability\ulnone  & \ul success\ulnone  for his Client, yet without saying one word to hurt the feelings of the opposite party, insomuch as after \ul gaining\ulnone  his case, the opposite party would come to him. shake him by the hands, & say \'93Sir we thank you for the manner in which you have conducted this case, & the very next case we have, we will give it to you.\'94\'a0 Mr. Croft spoke so sensibly on this subject, I wish you would have heard him, you might have profited from him, for on this subject my dear you need a lesson.\'a0 There is no Lawyer I believe who makes so many enemies as you do, & it may be that you travel out of the record, & deal in wholesale abuse of your adversary.\'a0 So for the future improve in this respect, & Mr. Barksdales cases & all others, keep to the testimony, & disdain all else, take Judge Gailliard as your example.\'a0 Men do not like to receive advice from their Wives, & you really go \ul contrary\ulnone , just to show they are not going to be governed by them. But in this instance the advice comes from a \ul wise\ulnone  & \ul loving\ulnone  wife, who has her husband\'92s interest at heart, so he must even follow it, because it is such wholesome good advice.\'a0 I hope you are doing the best you can in your enemy\'92s stronghold, better than he will do week after next in your stronghold.\'a0 Make as long a Circuit as you can, through Anderson & Pickens.\'a0 If you pass through Pendleton, if you can see Frances, & I dare say Mrs. John Ewing Colhoun will be glad to see you.\'a0\'a0 You must go to Bachelors Retreat & as many places as you can, & take care of yourself over the bad roads, & do not take cold.\'a0 Colds seem now so serious.\'a0 Mary Crayton has been very sick but is better.\'a0 Mrs. Hay is very ill.\'a0 I will leave this open, in case I have anything to add tomorrow.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write you a few lines tonight, to send by Mr. Elford tomorrow.\'a0 I wrote you a long letter by Mail, a few days ago, directed it to Anderson, thinking you would be there Thursday, to receive it, but in your letter to me, you mentioned you expected to leave Anderson, Wednesday morning.\'a0 If you did, you cannot have received my letter, & I am very sorry for it.\'a0 I would be sorry for it never to be read by \ul you\ulnone , for whom it was intended, & very sorry it should be read by anyone else.\'a0 It contained all that occurred Sunday Monday & Tuesday after you left.\'a0 It mentioned a visit Mr. Croft paid me, & his conversation, & had some \ul advice\ulnone  in it, that I think might be of benefit to you for \ul life\ulnone .\'a0 I do not like to repeat over again in this letter, what I said in that, for you may perchance have received it, but if you have \ul not\ulnone , you must write to the Post Master to forward it to you immediately.\'a0 Perhaps some are going to Pickens might carry it to you.\'a0 If not, have it sent by Mail.\'a0 I received your letter by Mr. Elford, & it gave me great pleasure, particularly as it contained \ul good\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone .\'a0 I only hope you are not \ul deceiving\ulnone \'a0 yourself, as you think Mr. Orr is \ul himself\ulnone , but it seems to me so impossible that Mr. Orr should be preferred to \ul you\ulnone , that I cannot but think you will be elected.\'a0 Mr. Orr I expect is like one of the Candidates for Sheriff at the last Election here.\'a0 He you know was confident of being elected, until Mr. Goodlett came out. He had such a high opinion of his own merits, he thought the people must have the same. But he was greatly mistaken, & I hope in this instance someone will [page torn]\'a0 themselves \ul greatly\ulnone  \ul mistaken\ulnone  too.\'a0 It would \ul rejoice\ulnone  me so to have this\'85person \ul beaten\ulnone  & \ul badly\ulnone  beaten, for daring to oppose \ul you\ulnone , who is so much better fitted than he is, to assist in the councils of the nation, & so much better \ul entitled\ulnone  to it.\'a0 You must my dear try your \ul best\ulnone , do not deceive yourself, & if unsure, you must as Mr. Croft said, make \ul assurance\ulnone  \ul doubly\ulnone  \ul sure\ulnone .\'a0 Papers have come for you, & only two letters which I send to you.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson continues the same.\'a0 I hear the Doctors say, though so low, she may linger yet several weeks.\'a0 Mrs. Hay is very ill with \ul Consumption\ulnone , so of course she cannot get well..\'a0 Mrs. James Williams (Ann D\'92Oyley) has a \ul son\ulnone , & Mrs. Barnard Cleveland an infant.\'a0 I first hear it was a daughter, then a son, so I do not know which it is.\'a0\'a0 Mrs. Bryan & Henrietta D\'92Oyley came to see me yesterday.\'a0 I sent Mrs. D\'92Oyley this week, \ul four\ulnone  of the \ul largest \ulnone of Mrs. Griffins Hams.\'a0 They weighed 62 \'bd pounds.\'a0 Miss Williford & Emma Service came to see me day before yesterday.\'a0 They asked if you would take a bundle to Pickens for Mrs. Duloc.\'a0 I said you were not here, but I intended writing by Mr. Elford, & expected he would take the bundle, so I sent to him to know & he said yes, anything he would take.\'a0 So I send the bundle, & you must give it to someone to carry to Mrs. Duloc.\'a0 They are things she wrote to Miss Wiliford to buy for her.\'a0 I have been busy in the garden all this week, & have almost got it into order.\'a0 Mary only has been working in it.\'a0 Delia has pain in her chest & neck, so does not seem to be of much use there.\'a0 Mary is a first rate hand.\'a0 I have let Lindy go to the farm to\'85Corn.\'a0 Mary shall go next week, but she ought not to work too hard now.\'a0 Minerva says she herself expects to be confined in June, so Mary I expect I should think expected much sooner.\'a0 The garden looks very nicely.\'a0 I have planted some of all the seeds.\'a0 Miss Williford said they were planting their \ul second\ulnone  crop of Squashes, Cucumbers, Okra &c. so I thought it high time our \ul first\ulnone  crop should be planted.\'a0 I looked at the plants today Mrs. Cunningham gave me, & they are most of them putting out leaves already.\'a0 The Mountain Ash,\'85&c. so I hope all will live.\'a0 The incident you mention of Esquire Long, his saying I asked him if I was not as good looking as Susan, is quite a \ul mistake\ulnone .\'a0 I have such a \ul good\ulnone  \ul memory\ulnone , that such a thing I would not have forgotten, & besides it does not sound like me.\'a0 It seems to ne I recollect Susan\'92s saying someone praised me, & added by way of complement, so that she might not be offended, that she was almost as good looking.\'a0 Something of this kind I think occurred.\'a0 I walked to Mamma\'92s this afternoon with all the children.\'a0 In my other letter I mentioned going there last Monday afternoon.\'a0 They inquired after you.\'a0 Mrs. Butler stopped one day & left Headleys \'93Washington & His Generals\'94, & asked for the second vol.\'a0 She expected to meet Behethland here, but Behethland had not come.\'a0 She did not come in.\'a0 She said I must go & see her.\'a0 She was going to be ceremonious.\'a0 I have been out only 3 times since you left, once to church & twice to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 Willie is still head.\'a0 He will soon finish his History book, & then he wishes to commence Geography.\'a0 Anna is full of May day.\'a0 Monday they are to elect their Queen.\'a0 Frank & Fanny are well.\'a0 I know of no \ul news\ulnone  to tell you.\'a0 I long to hear from you again.\'a0 After Pickens Court is over, you had better employ the remainder of the week, in travelling over the District, going to places you may not be able to go to when Musters, or other gatherings take place, when perhaps you will be attending meetings in the other Districts, & you cannot like Mr. Orr divide yourself in half, & be in both places at once.\'a0 Make sociable calls at as many houses As you can, before you come home again.\'a0 Mrs. Bowen the person I bought Eggs & onions from once & made such bad bargains, was here today.\'a0 She says her husband is Robert Bowen & lives in Anderson.\'a0 Miss Williford says Dr. Alston left 60000 dollars to be divided among his 3 grandsons, & Mrs. Alston\'92s property is larger than his, so when she dies they will have more.\'a0 Mrs. Walker sent me word, she would have been to have seen me, but she had to walk now.\'a0 They had sold their horses.\'a0 I asked the servant why they sold them.\'a0 She said they were old, & her Master wanted to buy a better pair.\'a0 This is Saturday night.\'a0\'a0 The children are asleep, & I must now go upstairs.\'a0 Adieu, my dearest.\'a0 Ever Your obedient. faithful, & loving Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As you have not returned home today, I will write you a few lines, which perhaps may reach you, & inform you how matters stand with your family.\'a0 I am \ul happy\ulnone  to tell you that Mary is a great deal better, Dr. Crook finding that it was not the \ul Morphine\ulnone , that excited her, & that she needed \ul sleep\ulnone , gave her a large dose Friday night, & in the morning she awoke in her \ul right\ulnone  \ul mind\ulnone .\'a0 She asked Delia about herself.\'a0 She thought from her feelings, she was about to be confined & was astonished when she heard she had been sick a\'85had her baby, had had convulsions, bruised herself &c.\'a0 Her sight is not perfectly restored yet, but that is improving, & Dr. Crook tonight said all she needed now, was a good nursing.\'a0 He yesterday said Mary would soon be able to take charge of the baby.\'a0 If she is not, when Mom Charlotte leaves, we must hire a woman with a child, to attend to Mary, & nurse the baby.\'a0 I have become attached to the little thing, but I must reserve my strength that may await me hereafter.\'a0 From the moment you left, things took a better turn.\'a0 The baby seemed to give less trouble & Mary seemed better.\'a0 I was sorry you could not know of the favorable change, as it would have been such a relief to your mind.\'a0 I hope you are this evening at Mrs. Cunninghams; at any rate I imagine you there.\'a0 You must do the best for yourself.\'a0 You know it is the universal opinion you have a cunning adroit opponent. The Carolinian & Charleston papers have come tonight, & Judge O\'92Nealls report on Col. Dunhams call.\'a0 I did not go to church today.\'a0 The children went with Susan & Mamma.\'a0 Tomorrow Jim says, both Charles & himself will work in the garden.\'a0 I am sorry I have so bad a pen to write with.\'a0 This is the 9

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will according to promise, write you a few lines, though I have \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 I have just written a letter to Eliza Hayne to send by Mr. Wells.\'a0 I have sent her money to buy me, \'93the \ul Carolina\ulnone  \ul Housewife\ulnone ,\'94 so \ul you\ulnone  \ul need\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  buy it for me, nor \ul either\ulnone  of the \ul other\ulnone  books I gave you the list of.\'a0 Keep the list, as I do not wish to forget the Titles of the Books.\'a0 At some other time, I may get them, but not now.\'a0 I thought it best for Eliza to get \'93the \ul Carolina\ulnone  \ul Housewife\ulnone ,\'94 because I was certain it could be got in Charleston, & in Columbia they may not have it.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Town[e]s & Mrs. Elford came to see me.\'a0 In the evening I got a note from Mamma saying Susan & Ann were both sick, Susan with dreadful headache, & she was very sorry, she had been unable to see you before you left.\'a0 This morning Jim came over & hoed a little in the garden, but I expect he could not do much.\'a0 He is not there now, perhaps he may have gone to the farm.\'a0 Today I let Lindy go with Charles to dross Corn.\'a0 She can go when it is necessary instead of hiring boys.\'a0 I have told Charles that any boy Jim hires, to send away.\'a0 We are not going to pay anything for hiring.\'a0 I sent the Peacocks & the Pigeons to the Farm. They are a good riddance, & if they cannot stay there, will have to\'85their exit out of this world.\'a0 This morning Mr. Littlejohn made his appearance.\'a0 He says he got here yesterday, two hours after you left.\'a0 He wished to know certainly when you would return, & to tell you what his business was, which ought to be commenced before the Equity Court sat, so I advised him to write to you, & gave him pen, ink, & paper, & he sat down in the Drawing room & wrote you a letter, & I sent it to the office for him.\'a0 The wind is now very high.\'a0 I hope you are making good use of your time, & wiping out the \ul tracks\ulnone  very fast.\'a0 You are a person, that can accomplish anything you choose, & in this instance I believe it depends \ul entirely\ulnone  upon \ul yourself\ulnone , whether you will be successful or not.\'a0 My opinion of you is such that I believe you cannot be \ul seen\ulnone  & \ul known\ulnone , & then the vote cast in favor of one \ul far\ulnone  your \ul inferior\ulnone .\'a0 The unfortunate reputation you have of being \ul aristocratical\ulnone , renders it absolutely necessary, that you should go among the people, & show them by your kindness & familiarity, that if you are \ul aristocratical \ulnone in \ul appearance\ulnone , you are not so in character.\'a0 It is\'85they should judge from appearance, for you know appearance indicates character.\'a0The truth is you are \ul reserved\ulnone , & reserved persons always appear proud.\'a0 Do not waste time in Columbia, but if you find your cases will not come on soon, return to Laurens & spend your time there to some purpose, or if your cases do come on next week & you will also be detained in Columbia part of the week following, arrange it, so you can return to Laurens to the Muster tomorrow week, & then return to Columbia.\'a0 You must not depend on your \ul friends \ulnone exertions for you.\'a0 There is no friend that you can depend on as you can on \ul yourself\ulnone .\'a0 Believe me it is \ul yourself\ulnone  alone that will elect you.\'a0 Do all \ul you\ulnone  can, & be \ul thankful\ulnone  for what aid your friends give you.\'a0 I have no objection to their \ul helping\ulnone , but it is on you the chief burden rests.\'a0 Fanny is crawling over the floor.\'a0 Charlotte is now my principal servant in the house & to take care of Fanny Lindy helped Delia wash yesterday.\'a0 We have done without Mary pretty well, so if ever we need it, we can dispose of some of our servants, particularly as the young ones grow up.\'a0 So if your property increases in no other way, it does in the value of your servants.\'a0 I have no news or anything interesting to write you.\'a0 It is only a little more than a day since you [page torn].\'a0 Last night was our hottest night.\'a0 Today for the first time I think, we have had no fire built.\'a0 This is a bad season for providing, no vegetables, so you would not be from home at a better time.\'a0 If I do not write by the next Mail, it will be that I do not know whether you are in Columbia.\'a0 Mr. Wells leaves tonight in the stage.\'a0 Write me as often as you can, though I would not have writing to me, interfere with your other duties.\'a0 I have written fast without stopping once, & I have managed to fill up a letter with \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 I cannot think of any advice to give you except to try your best, for your Clients, & try to make the Laurens people your Constituents.\'a0 With best wishes for your success believe me.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again like a good wife do I take up my pen to write to you.\'a0 I wish to prevent your being at all uneasy about \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 I almost hope you will not be in Columbia to receive this, that you are in \ul Laurens\ulnone , where you ought to be, until your cases come on.\'a0 I will now think of all that has occurred since I wrote you on Friday.\'a0 Mary is getting quite well, & in a week when her baby will be a month old, she will go about her ordinary duties.\'a0 Jim is well now.\'a0 He drove me to church yesterday morning, & has gone to the Farm today.\'a0 Mrs. Butler was seated, it was early, & I had a long talk with her.\'a0 She asked where you were, & said I must soon go & see her.\'a0 She sent me Saturday a \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul note\ulnone , Miss Rodgers wrote me, & enclosed in a letter to her.\'a0 Miss Rodgers thanks us for our kindness to her & you for the beautiful breast pin & says she hopes to see us both at the North.\'a0 She has been sick she says & would have written before.\'a0 After church Mr. Arthur requested the Members to remain in, as he wished to say something to them, & the business was, that the pews should henceforth be \ul free\ulnone , persons still occupy the same pews they did, but instead of paying \ul pew\ulnone  \ul rent\ulnone , \ul call\ulnone  it a \ul subscription\ulnone .\'a0 He thinks adopting this plan persons will go to the church, as the pews are \ul free\ulnone , the congregation will\'85, the subscription will amount to more, than the pew rent does, but I think he is entirely mistaken, that many who now pay pew rent will pay less when the subscription is [final two lines on this sheet obscured] will now pay much less.\'a0 It would make no difference with me, for 20 dollars is little enough to give to Mr. Arthur for his preaching to us for a whole year. But I am certain also, money loving persons will pay as little as possible.\'a0 I carried Mrs. Rowland home.\'a0 She seems to be without horses at present.\'a0 She asked how Mary was, said a general interest had been felt in her on account of her suffering so much.\'a0 In the afternoon I walked with all of the children to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 Before I went a violent storm of wind & rain had occurred.\'a0 It was a whirlwind, but did not last very long.\'a0 At Mamma\'92s, I found \ul two\ulnone  \ul Oak\ulnone  \ul Trees\ulnone  had been uprooted, \ul one\ulnone , a \ul monstrous \ulnone one, larger than our Oaks.\'a0 Susan has had headaches all the week, but was up.\'a0 Mamma & Ann have both been particularly unwell.\'a0 I told Mamma that Mr. Luther McBee thought Mr. Orr would be elected.\'a0 She said that was different from what he told Susan, & she supposed he judged from what he had heard, that he told Susan he was standing with a circle of gentlemen, who were talking of the Election, & Mr. \ul Elford\ulnone  said he thought Mr. Orr would be elected, but Mr. Beattie said he thought \ul you\ulnone  would be.\'a0 Now Mr. Elford is your \ul friend\ulnone  I \ul believe\ulnone , & his opinion at that time was that Mr. Orr would be elected, so when your \ul friends\ulnone  think so, it ought to \ul alarm\ulnone  you, & make you determine to do \ul all\ulnone , that can be done to ensure success.\'a0 These \ul four\ulnone  \ul weeks\ulnone  Mr. Orr has spent in Laurens I am afraid will do \ul wonders\ulnone  for him, so on your return from Columbia, \ul you\ulnone  must spend a few weeks in Laurens & \ul rub\ulnone  out all the \ul tracks\ulnone  he has made.\'a0 You must not be too secure for yourself.\'a0 It is that feeling of security, that makes me fear for you.\'a0 I am afraid that Mr. Orr & his friends not feeling secure, will try so much \ul harder\ulnone  than you & your friends do, then they will in the end distance you.\'a0\'a0This morning at daybreak a storm of thunder & rain came on but it cleared up soon, & since I commenced writing, the thunder has commenced, & it is raining also & is very cloudy, except for Delia & Lindy who will have to come from the Spring.\'a0 I would be glad of the rain, for we need it greatly.\'a0 I put down my pen to go upstairs to shut the windows, & in the big room I found the rain pouring down into the Wardrobe, so I opened the Wardrobe & found my dresses wet, Boston\'85almost\'85& all the things in a fair way to be \ul washed\ulnone .\'a0 I will have the Wardrobe moved from behind the door, for it is too much trouble every rain, to remove the things out of it.\'a0 You must have the Leaks stopped.\'a0 I had to mount the Step Ladder & put three basins on top of the Wardrobe, & I am afraid more of the plastering will fall down.\'a0 It is raining \ul very\ulnone  \ul hard\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Earle went to see Mamma last week.\'a0 She said she had intended having a large wedding for her daughter & inviting all her friends, but now on account of Mrs. Thompsons situation, she would have a private one.\'a0 She said Mrs. Harrison was so envious of her daughters, & said such horrible things about them, that her daughters now would not speak to them, that Anne Harrison had not been to her house since her daughter Emily married Mr. Williams, that Anna said, Mr. Williams intended addressing \ul her\ulnone , but \ul Emily\ulnone  \ul supplanted\ulnone  her.\'a0 Anna Harrison also went to Mamma\'92s, & she asked her if she had heard of the great match her cousin was going to make, that she was going to marry a man nearly as old as Maj. Turpin, & who has illegitimate children in every direction, & that Elias Earle\'92s assurance was really great to think he was running for \ul Congress\ulnone .\'a0 It was presumption in him to offer for the Legislature.\'a0 My dear there is \ul one\ulnone  \ul book\ulnone  I wish you to buy me.\'a0 I enclose the advertisement that you may see it.\'a0 Mrs. \ul Cunningham told me no female should be without it\ulnone , so buy it for me.\'a0 My dear husband, I will send to town for it, if you do not, so save me that trouble, & buy it in Columbia \ul now\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry to write on such coarse paper, but I have no other in the house.\'a0 Willie & Anna are at school, Frank & Charlotte are together upstairs & Fanny in the cradle asleep.\'a0 Miss Rodgers calls her the Rosebud, & it is an appropriate name for her.\'a0 No letters have come for you, only newspapers, the Cultivator & Southern Review.\'a0 Mr. Edward Earle has gone to Augusta & from there goes to Pendleton to address Miss Calhoun.\'a0 Susan says she has given him a hint to return & she will \ul accept\ulnone  him.\'a0 If this is so, Mr. Burt is mistaken in thinking she will only marry one who fills a large space in the world.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson is dying.\'a0 Mrs. Butler says it was a mistake in thinking she was better.\'a0 A Catholic Minister preached here last night.\'a0 A Catholic congregation I believe is to be formed.\'a0 I long to hear from you.\'a0 I will\'85on one letter until I receive another.\'a0 I will conclude by saying you must fulfil[l] the expression, \ul running\ulnone  for Congress, & not let Mr. Orr do the \ul running\ulnone , & you the \ul walking,\ulnone  for if so, you will be left far behind\'85, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter.\'a0 I was so \ul anxious\ulnone  & yet \ul afraid\ulnone  to open it, that as usual, it gave me the \ul pain\ulnone  that I have often told you anxiety & fear produces.\'a0 This shows you how much interest I feel in your success, & an unfavorable result may produce serious consequences, to me, so this must make you exert yourself\'a0 more than ever for the love you bear your Wife \ul do\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  let her be disappointed.\'a0 Mr. Orr is doing all he can, & he will not be particular what means he uses.\'a0 You have not so good a chance as you only avail yourself of honorable means, & your friends are also honorable, so you must try the harder in the ways you allow yourself for I would not have you beaten on any consideration.\'a0 I am glad you have been encouraged.\'a0 I am a croaker like Mr. Norton, & I hope you are not flattering & deceiving yourself.\'a0 I am afraid Mr. Norton is only \ul half\ulnone  a \ul Perry\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone .\'a0 In one of his letters he said he had promised Mr. Orr not to do anything against him.\'a0 The evening you left Mr. Lester paid me a visit.\'a0 He said he heard Washington Shepherd say, (who has been ped[d]ling in Laurens, that you were doing well there, that in G\'85 Wrights neighborhood I think 3 or 4 steady men\'a0 who were going to vote for Mr. Orr, changed after hearing both of you speak, & were going now to vote for you,, & that Sullivan was now for Orr, but before the Election he might find it to his interest to vote for \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 Th\'85 Mr. Lester said was warm in your favor.\'a0 Mr. Robert Maxwell he said he heard say he would like to be your friend, but you must take care & not make any more Railroad speech, as they might cut you out.\'a0 I send you a letter of Mr. Bridwell\'92s & one from Mr. Simpson, which I opened as I considered it addressed to \ul me\ulnone , as we \ul twain\ulnone  are \ul one\ulnone  \ul flesh\ulnone , as Mr. Arthur said last Sunday.\'a0 He is decidedly against Mr. Cass, & has objections to Genl Taylor, so your position is like the South Carolina Delegation \ul neutral\ulnone .\'a0 I hope Mr. Orr will be served right, & \ul lose\ulnone  instead of \ul gaining\ulnone  by the position he has assumed.\'a0 I dare say he will take some of your friends from you, Mr. Reed for instance, but I hope you will take from him in returning Sunday morning.\'a0 Susan & myself went to the Baptist church to hear Mrs. Thompsons funeral sermon.\'a0 Mr. Arthur had no service in the morning in consequence of it.\'a0 Mr. Bre\'85 spoke of Mrs. Thompson as a most perfect person. Compared her to the beloved Di[s]ciple John, & from his description she was as perfect as our Saviour himself & possessing \ul every\ulnone  \ul accomplishment\ulnone  of \ul mind\ulnone  & \ul person\ulnone .\'a0 Genl Thompson & his family sat in the front pew.\'a0 As far as I could tell they seemed composed.\'a0 In the afternoon we went to our own church.\'a0 I carried Mrs. Walker home in the morning.\'a0 On the way back, I was caught in the rain, with my new dress on, the rain came in, & wet it.\'a0 I was so provoked I determined not to carry Mrs. Walker home ever again. For after all my kindness to her, she is your enemy.\'a0 Mr. Lester said he hardly supposed Col. Walker would vote for you, & what objection has Col. Walker to you.\'a0 I suppose you are too far his superior, for him to wish well to.\'a0 Yesterday Frank chewed a Lucifer Match & I sent for Dr. Crook to know whether it would hurt him,\'a0 He said, no, one match containing too little on it to injure, but I gave him a dose of Castor oil, which I knew would do him good.\'a0 Frank found the match underneath the Sofa cushion in my chamber, the having to take Oil, will be a lesson to him never to touch a match again, & I will keep them where there will not be scattered about.\'a0 Speaking of the election Dr. Crook said he heard persons say, even those who thought you would be elected that Mr. Orr electioneered so much better than you did.\'a0 He said if he had been a Candidate, he would have such opponents as Mr. Mc\'85, Jones & Elias Earle, & they by \ul electioneering\ulnone  might beat him.\'a0 Mr. Orr\'92s reputation for electioneering is wonderful, but you will prove his reputation is \ul undeserved\ulnone .\'a0 Saturday night Mr. Long\'92s servant brought the shoes.\'a0 Some lady had brought the bundle from Columbia.\'a0 They are made up better than I expected.\'a0 The material with which they are lined, is much better than that used by the Charleston Shoemaker, but the shape, & the work is not fixed as pretty.\'a0 Instead of putting all of my work, he cuts off some of it.\'a0 The red pr I last worked, he was obliged to make according\'a0 to the shape I worked them, & they look \ul beautiful\ulnone .\'a0 Today I sent Mary to the farm, to hoe, & kept Jim to whitewash the living room.\'a0 When the carpet was taken up, there was an immense quantity of dirt underneath.\'a0 Tomorrow Jim will go to the farm, & Mary will wash the paint.\'a0 Thursday\'a0 I will again keep Jim to whitewash the Entry & send Mary to the farm to hoe, then the housecleaning will be finished, & then Mary will at her leisure whitewash the fences, & Jim when you can spare him, the kitchen & chairs.\'a0 Yesterday the Rye was cut.\'a0 We have had showers every day since you left.\'a0 Yesterday it rained almost all day.\'a0 I thought of you, but hoped you were beyond the rain.\'a0 Minerva is not taken sick yet, but one of Willie\'92s Sows has been, & brought forth her first pigs 6 in number, 2 of which died, & 4 are living, & Willie says he has another one about to have pigs.\'a0 Mr. Beattie this afternoon sent an account for the Gingham dress I bought months ago.\'a0 I had a receipt for it & kept it in my Wardrobe until last week.\'a0 I thought I would never have any use for it, & tore it up.\'a0 I am so provoked that I did.\'a0 I wrote him a note, which satisfied him, but I would have been delighted to have had the receipt to have shown him.\'a0 Tonight two notes came from Dr. & Mrs. Thomas inviting us to their house the evening of 4
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of July.\'a0 Perhaps Dr. Thomas\'92 daughter is to be married.\'a0 I was in hopes you would have stopped to have seen Col. Keen Saturday as you passed.\'a0 I forgot to tell you to.\'a0 Do stay in Pickens as long as you can & \ul electioneer\ulnone , go over every part of it, that you possibly have time to, & bring me back \ul good\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you to \ul beat\ulnone  \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Orr\ulnone  \ul severely\ulnone , & in future making [page torn] afraid to contend with you.\'a0 Mary McLeod said today, that Mr. Sam Earle did not even \ul write\ulnone  to his \ul Wife\ulnone , & here are we\'a0 when absent only a \ul few\ulnone  days, writing to each other.\'a0 I send you all the papers & letters that have come for you.\'a0 No one has been to inquire for you.\'a0 Do try & bring some money with you, so that you may not have to \ul borrow\ulnone  to return Mr. Folders money.\'a0 I am certain you can get someone to pay you.\'a0 If you could see Josiah, I am sure he would be able to pay you some.\'a0 Eveline says Col. Dunham\'a0 is better, & his mind is restored, but I do not know whether this is true.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Willie is head.\'a0 Fanny looks a great deal better, & is more interesting than ever.\'a0 She kicked Frank this morning when he was asleep.\'a0 Frank without knowing it, \ul pushed\ulnone  her, & she was quite indignant & tried to push him out of bed.\'a0 It is past \ul 10 oclock\ulnone .\'a0 I am writing with a \ul bad\ulnone  \ul pen\ulnone  & \ul bad\ulnone  \ul light\ulnone .\'a0 I know you are very \ul particular\ulnone , but you must excuse my shabby letter.\'a0 I am also sleepy, not having taken my usual nap.\'a0 If you come back too soon, you will find us in the midst of housecleaning, so you need not hurry home, not that I do not wish to see you, but I wish you to be better employed, in shaking hands with the men, \ul kissing\ulnone  the women &\'85the children on your knees.\'a0 Good night my dear husband.\'a0 \ul Write\ulnone  me by \ul Col.\ulnone  \ul Town[e]s\ulnone .\'a0 Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write you a few lines to inform you of all that has happened since you left, to prevent your being uneasy & hurrying back sooner than you ought, & when you hear \ul all\ulnone , you will find you could not be from home at a better time than \ul now\ulnone .\'a0 Frances left yesterday, & she had scarcely gone, when Minerva was taken sick, & in a short time was delivered of a girl, & both doing well.\'a0 She will now be up when Frances returns in a month.\'a0 Mamma Susan & Mr. Arthur dined with us Wednesday & with\'85assistance I was able to prepare a nice dinner.\'a0 Delia was sick all day.\'a0 What with her sickness, the company, the ironing has been so retarded, that scarce any is done, & now Minerva confined.\'a0 I expect to live comfortably for a long time, as I have been living ever since Mary\'92s sickness.\'a0 So I advise you to take this opportunity & do all the Electioneering that is to be done between this & October.\'a0 You will fare better anywhere than at\ul  home\ulnone , for with Delia sick & at the same time our cook we will necessarily live economically, & it will be a convenient necessity.\'a0 Money is universally scarce.\'a0 Mr. Sharpe said he heard a merchant say, he did not believe there was 50 dollars in Greenville.\'a0 You had better bring back some money from Laurens.\'a0 I dare say if you try you will get interest money, or from someone that owes you.\'a0 If you can pay the money you have to without borrowing I will be so glad.\'a0 I never wish to go into \ul debt\ulnone .\'a0 You saw Mrs. H\'85 with me.\'a0 She\'a0 came to beg a great favor, that I would lend her four dollars, to pay a debt, but I had neither inclination or power to\'85her going \ul into\ulnone  \ul debt\ulnone , for the purpose of getting out of debt.\'a0 Before she left, Mrs. Walker came, with a subscription for the organ headed with her name 5 dollars, & she wished mine placed next.\'a0 I told her I had put down 100 for the church which I ought not to have done in your absence, & I was not going to contract any more debts.\'a0 She said if anyone gave for the church, \ul you\ulnone  ought to,\'a0 for you were the first Lawyer here, & had a most \ul extreme\ulnone \'85.\'a0 She forgot that she once said, no Lawyer made enough here to clothe his Wife.\'a0 She was quite vexed, & said she had done so much for the church, her \ul work\ulnone  would amount to 100 dollars, but that everyone must do as they chose, & I told her I thought so too.\'a0 The next time I will ask her how much she has\'85for the church.\'a0 Little did I think we would have so much cause to regret her joining our church.\'a0 If it was not for her, the church would remain just as it is, which it ought to until they have enough money to build a new one.\'a0 After she left Mrs. Tom Lowndes stopped to leave a bundle for Mamma, & begged me to go to the Working Society where she was bound, & said I must go & see her.\'a0 I told her I would go to the Society when I could, but that time will be very far off.\'a0 Yesterday Susan & her children dined here.\'a0 In the afternoon we set off to go to Mrs. Stones, but it rained, & we had to turn back.\'a0 It poured, & today Jim says the ground is too wet to plough, so this afternoon if it does not rain we will go, & then I will not take the carri[a]ge until the\'85is finished.\'a0 Willie went to the Methodist Fair, but he said he wished himself at home.\'a0 He was obliged to stay until after 11 until Frank Hoke came away.\'a0 I was uneasy & sent for him, but he was then on his way home.\'a0 I expect very little was made, but I have not heard.\'a0 I write to you my dear husband, though you did not request it, but I think if you hear that all at home are well, you will stay away with more comfort.\'a0 Otherwise you might come home sooner than you ought, merely to see how things are going on.\'a0 I wish your mine to be at ease respecting home.\'a0 I hope to hear from you this evening.\'a0 You must do all you can for yourself.\'a0 The time is approaching, & I tremble at the result.\'a0 I hope & trust that you will be successful;\'a0 you deserve it, but merit does not always bring its reward.\'a0 Art, intrigue, vanity & deceit, often triumph. Therefore it behooves you to do all that is \ul honorable\ulnone  to ensure success, & I think as yet you have done but little, & but little time remains.\'a0 New questions have been started.\'a0 You must try & see your way clear before you.\'a0 If you can you must see my friend Mr. Barksdale & the other brothers that you have not been to see yet.\'a0 I see all the communications you wrote for the Herald about Burnley & Johnson, in this mornings Mountaineer.\'a0 I hear Mr. Croft is to be married tonight.\'a0 I hardly think he would choose Friday, & Caroline Earle next month to Mr. Mills.\'a0 You ought to be thankful that your property is gradually increasing as you have now an additional negro.\'a0 Minerva[\'91s] children do not interfere with her work, as Mary\'92s baby did.\'a0 Frances came just at the right time,\'a0 She will stay one night when she returns.\'a0 I would like very much to go to Pendleton this summer, stay at Mrs. Heywards.\'a0 I always prefer boarding to a private house, (except Mrs. Cunninghams), but Frances pressed me to stay with her & said you may but the persons I like most Mrs. M\'85 for instance, she seems to have little to do with, never seen Mrs. Burt even.\'a0 The village is very quiet.\'a0 Susan said she heard Mr. N\'85 was going to stay six months in Stewarts store N. York.\'a0\'a0\'a0 You affectionate wife in haste, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter last night, in which you say, you may not be at home till Wednesday.\'a0 On the strength of that, I will write you a few lines to \ul comfort\ulnone  you , & make you \ul happy\ulnone , as I know you \ul cannot\ulnone  be, unless you are informed \ul every\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  or \ul two\ulnone , of the \ul health\ulnone  of your family.\'a0 We are accustomed to hear frequently from each other, that we are more uneasy from a \ul short\ulnone  \ul silence\ulnone  than others are from \ul months\ulnone .\'a0 You do not mention having received a letter from me Saturday, which you must have got, but in your haste forgot mentioning.\'a0 \ul This\ulnone  letter you may not receive, as you may leave Laurens before it reaches there, this being the case & not knowing in whose hands it may fall, I must be particular & not write with as much freedom as I generally do.\'a0 I only write because it may be to your interest to stay in Laurens some time longer, & if you hear that all at home are well, you will be induced to stay when otherwise you will hurry home to see how matters are going on.\'a0 I was very glad to hear from you last night.\'a0 I would have been uneasy if I had not heard, for I had been looking anxiously for you.\'a0 I am sorry \ul business\ulnone  should detain you, & I hope you will come home, with a \ul fee\ulnone  in your pocket.\'a0 I am certain some one of your Clients can pay you, so I hope you will induce some of them to.\'a0 I am sorry it did not suit you to accept the invitations you received.\'a0 I suppose \ul business\ulnone  prevented you, or you would have done so.\'a0 I have heard less about your Election than usual.\'a0 Mrs. Butler has paid me no visit lately.\'a0 I suppose she is waiting to have her budget full, before she comes.\'a0 Mamma asked Mr. Sharpe, what your prospects & he said, in Pendleton, they thought you would be elected by a majority of 1200.\'a0 Friday afternoon I went to see Mrs. Stone & Mrs. Sam Townes.\'a0 Mrs. Townes said she had recently been to Pendleton & heard very encouraging accounts, & all along the road they inquired, & they saw but \ul one\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone  who said Mr. Orr would be elected, & he was a barefooted ignorant person, & would give no reason for his\'85.\'a0 I do not like to tell you this news, for fear it may lessen your exertions which have never been great.\'a0 I would rather tell what your\'85friends, such as \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Jones\ulnone , \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Norton\ulnone  & \ul Genl\ulnone  \ul Thompson\ulnone  say.\'a0 I am glad for your sake that you have been making friends, & yet at the same time I am \ul vexed\ulnone  that your Election should be doubted, for it seems injustice to you, for a moment to think you can be beaten, by one your inferior in every respect.\'a0 I think this remark is rather free, considering my letter may be opened by those for whom it was not intended, but it is the \ul truth\ulnone , & even your enemies will allow it.\'a0 This is Sale day, but it seems very quiet, & I see no one coming in.\'a0 I am glad you are in Laurens, where there is more to be done than in Greenville.\'a0 Tomorrow is the 4
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of July. But I have heard of no preparations to celebrate it.\'a0 The Sunday school children are not going to march as usual, & have a Picnic, for which I am very glad.\'a0 It was all trouble for nothing.\'a0 Only one letter has come for you, from Walker & Bradford, wishing to know what had become of their case.\'a0 I paid a very short visit to Mrs. Sam Townes.\'a0 Jim thought it was going to rain, & hurried me off, but it did not rain after all.\'a0 When you come back, you must drive me out, unless I can have the carri[a]ge & take Mamma with me.\'a0 She seems very anxious to see Mamma.\'a0 Said her sister Mrs. Burt asked her, if she had seen Mamma.\'a0 Frances\'85her bag fully of medicines.\'a0 I see they are medicines such as she can easily\'85so I have made no exertion to send them after her.\'a0 The visit passed off very pleasantly, but it was just long enough, for after she left Minerva was taken sick, in a short time her child was born of which I have written you, a girl it is.\'a0 Eliza was last week at Mamma\'92s.\'a0 She has now come home to assist in working, but she seems very unwell.\'a0 She begged to go to Dr. Earle.\'a0 I let her go, & he has written me a note, saying her womb is affected & unless she is examined he can do nothing.\'a0 He sent some medicine for the nettle thrash which she has.\'a0 Delia is better again.\'a0 She & Mary have gone to the Spring to wash.\'a0 John drove us to church yesterday morning, & Jim in the afternoon.\'a0 Susan is still at the Parsonage, but I expect she will be obliged to go to the house Mr. Dupree lived in.\'a0 It is a very mean one & I am afraid she will never have a better.\'a0 I tell her she is the rich man\'92s wife without a comfort, & I am the poor man\'92s wife, with every comfort.\'a0 Caroline Earle is engaged to\'85.\'a0 I expect when Mamma saw her, she was considering.\'a0 Mamma sent her a message by her Mother, advising her to accept him, & Mrs. Earle seemed pleased, & said she would be sure & deliver it.\'a0 Mr. McBee heard that Caroline Earle was engaged to a gentleman \ul richer\ulnone  than \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 I saw Col. Dunham seated in the\'85of his Tin Shop yesterday.\'a0 He looked pale.\'a0 Ann heard that \'85 Dubose was to be married.\'a0 Clara was the authority.\'a0 She may have heard it from Margaret, who generally knows of the engagements.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull sent Fanny a dress by Mrs. Tom Laurens.\'a0 I expect it was 6 \'bc a yd., but for \ul her\ulnone  it was a valuable present.\'a0 I now take the Shower bath every day, & find it very pleasant.\'a0 The first day the water was so cold, it took away my breath, & I could not stand it.\'a0 I now use water brought the day before.\'a0 Willie loves to take it, but neither of the other children.\'a0 I wonder Mrs. Cunningham & Pamela have not written me.\'a0 Stop & see Mrs. Barksdale on your way back & Capt. Conner, & others.\'a0 I hope you will receive this letter safe.\'a0 It is a medley like Aunt Harriett.\'a0 I am going to write to her now.\'a0 Stay as long as you ought in Laurens.\'a0 I wish you to be elected by an \ul overwhelming\ulnone  majority not by \ul hundreds\ulnone , but \ul thousands\ulnone .\'a0 When you return you must go to Pickens & Anderson, & if you wish it I will accompany you, though I had better stay at home, & attend to your interests in Greenville.\'a0 Your ever attached Wife, E.F.P. Mr. Croft will soon be home with his Bride, his 3d bride.\

\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I did not expect to write to you when you left, but I feel now so uneasy about \ul you\ulnone , that I cannot avoid writing a few lines to express my uneasiness.\'a0 I went to see Mamma yesterday afternoon after church,& she said you looked so bilious when you stood at her carri[a]ge Saturday Afternoon, speaking to her, that both Ann & herself observed it, that she was sorry you had taken the Calomel, for Dr. Horlbeck in Charleston, told her once, it was very wrong in hot weather, to take a large dose of Calomel.\'a0 It was apt to bring on Typhus fever, that it stirred up the Bile.\'a0 You know I wished you to take it, & thought Mamma of all others would approve of it.\'a0 So I feel now very wretched.\'a0 You should have taken Salts & S\'85. Mamma says.\'a0 When I think how well you looked when we paid our visit to Mrs. Burt, & how badly you looked yesterday morning as you made off, & that you have gone to a sickly place, that you are weaker, have been excited, & will be excited this week & fatigued my uneasiness is great.\'a0 So I beg you my dear husband, to be particularly careful of yourself, eat only wholesome well cooked food, , & take pills, & come back to me \ul safe\ulnone  & \ul well\ulnone , & write so I may hear Wednesday\'92s Mail, & relieve me by assuring me you feel better.\'a0 Today is quite cool, so I hope in Laurens, it is cool also, & that, that will be one thing in your favor, & do not allow yourself to be excited wither by Politics, or Law.\'a0 I send you a letter which was brought to you this morning while we were at breakfast.\'a0 I did not see the person.\'a0 It contains important news, so I wish you to see it at once.\'a0 The Col. H. mentioned, I have often heard you say was your \ul friend\ulnone .\'a0 The writer of the letter seems your \ul true\ulnone  friend.\'a0 I wish you had many such.\'a0 Last night there came for you, a Union, Carolinian, & Courier, & two letters from Mr. Boyce, about a pension I expect, & the other from G. Foster saying that 2200 dollars had at last been paid into the hands of Mr. Graham the Lawyer, & that out of that he Mr. Graham intended to keep 500 as his Fee (what cheats the Alabama Lawyers are) & out of the remaining 1700, one seventh was to be divided between you, my brother & sister, so as well as I can understand it, 60 dollars will be your portion.\'a0 It is a trifle, but as soon as you receive it, pay it to Mr. Hoke, & by that time I hope you will have received more to add to it.\'a0 I dare say you will from Mr. Berry certainly.\'a0 Fanny seems better.\'a0 I have determined to continue nursing her, for it is her only comfort, for I dare say now that she has cut two more teeth, she will be better.\'a0 Today Delia & Mary\'a0 have gone to the Spring to wash & as \ul you are\ulnone  not here Lindy will be\'85.\'a0 I saw \'85yesterday.\'a0 She was no better.\'a0 Dr. Earle says she does not improve as he hoped.\'a0 I saw Mrs. Choice\'92s carriage with Mrs. Choice & Mrs. Thurston in it, returning in front of the Augusta Stage.\'a0 They had gone to meet Mr. \'85 I suppose.\'a0 It is said Mrs. Thurston is engaged to him, that her wedding dress is even made.\'a0 He has not arrived though.\'a0 The report of the rich Mexican lady, must have been false.\'a0 I went to church yesterday morning & afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Walker who I believe is the Minister at Edgefield, preached for us.\'a0 I hope you received my letter that has been so long at Laurens, & that you burned it without reading & for all that was in it you knew & now my dear husband for \ul my\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone , take care of yourself.\'a0 If you do not get fatigued, & take pills, I think you will return quite well, but having taken the calomel which has stirred up the Bile, you must be particularly careful.\'a0 If you had remained at home, it would have been well to have followed up the Calomel with more medicine, so as to have carried off the Bile entirely.\'a0 You ought to consult a Physician about the itching you always have, after taking medicine.\'a0 This is a delightful day.\'a0 Your attached & devoted Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I feel as if I must write you a few lines by Genl Thompson, who leaves for laurens about 10 oclock today.\'a0 He will carry later news than mine, but I will tell of little incidents, that he will not mention.\'a0 He voted for you, but that is \ul all\ulnone  he did.\'a0 He has not \ul gained\ulnone  you \ul one\ulnone  vote besides, but on the contrary like some other of your \ul professed\ulnone  friends, has \ul tried\ulnone  to injure you by telling how many more votes Mr. Orr\'a0 would get at certain places than yourself.\'a0 For instance he said, at Pickensville, Mr. Orr would beat you 200 votes, & he only beat you 71.\'a0 Mr. Jones told a man from Pickens, that Mr. Orr would beat you at \ul this\ulnone  \ul box\ulnone .\'a0 I think in future Mr. Orr, Genl Thompson, & Mr. Jones must put very little confidence in their calculations.\'a0 So far the news from Greenville is \ul better\ulnone  than you expected, for all the boxes \ul I\ulnone  have heard from, you have got more than you expected & Mr. Orr only as much, or less than you calculated, except \ul Dickeys\ulnone  where not as many votes were given in as you thought, but of those you got all but \ul 2\ulnone .\'a0 Of the other candidates, Mr. Edward Earle is ahead, Smith next, Col. Town[e]s \ul perhaps\ulnone  next, though Mr. Hoke says he has fallen off wonderfully, for which I am \ul very\ulnone  \ul sorry\ulnone , for next to \ul you\ulnone  I wish him elected.\'a0 The fourth man will most probably be Elias Earle.\'a0 I will not tell you who voted against you.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says generally the most trifling worthless people from the country, some from Pickens & Anderson voted here against you, & I heard of one from the Sullivan neighborhood, two of the Paris\'92\'a0 voted against you, , the Fergusons, a Richard, a Kemp, from the country , of the villagers, \ul Old\ulnone  \ul Maj.\ulnone  \ul Turpin\ulnone , who is an \ul intimate\ulnone  friend of Genl Thompson, Tom Turpin, Charles Stone, Gaines, Isaac Hennings, & he did all he could \ul against\ulnone  you, boasts of having turned 4 men from \ul you\ulnone , to \ul Orr\ulnone  yesterday.\'a0 Mr. Wm Choice is \ul against\ulnone  you & doing all he can against you, & Tandy Walker is \ul against\ulnone  you.\'a0 He saw a man passing & asked who he was going to votes for, the man replied \ul Perry\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Walker said, \'93Oh no! that wont do.\'94\'a0 The man in reply said, \'93I will vote as I please Sir.\'94\'a0 Choice & Walker are both electioneering \ul against\ulnone  Col. Town[e]s, \ul because\ulnone  Col. Town[e]s is for \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 They take men into a corner & electioneer in a sneaking underhanded way.\'a0 Mr. Nicol made Lark vote \ul for\ulnone  youwho was going to vote against you, because he said, because you tried to make his wife a free dealer.\'a0 The old man Lark & Palman were going to vote against you, but Mr. Hoke changed them.\'a0 Mr. Taft at the Mill, was going to vote against you, but Mr. Hoke made him vote for you.\'a0 He saw him put in your ticket, & afterwards heard him saying, he had voted for \ul Orr\ulnone .\'a0 Lewis Thurston voted for \ul you\ulnone , Dr. Turpin voted for \ul you\ulnone , S\'85thiel Martin voted for \ul you\ulnone , Smith who works at Mr. Cox\'92s voted for \ul you\ulnone , & Mr. Luther McBee says he is certain Mr. Peter Cauble will.\'a0 Maj. Earle voted for you Mr. Hoke thinks.\'a0 Mr. Orr said, if \ul Hoke\ulnone  could be kept away from the Dark Corner, he would get \ul 100\ulnone  votes there.\'a0 Hoke \ul did\ulnone  stay away, & he got \ul 30\ulnone .\'a0 So mention this circumstance to him and ask him to account for it.\'a0 I received a message last night from Mr. Durbec, saying he had heard from you at Laurens, & you begged him to tell me not to be uneasy foryou were getting a great many more votes in Laurens than Col. Orr.\'a0 It seems to me that there is some mistake in this, that time did not allow for a message to arrive so quickly.\'a0 I feel very anxious, for though the news from Greenville, so far is \ul good\ulnone . There are still other boxes to hear from, & \ul three\ulnone  other Districts, in two of which Mr. Orr is certainly to beat.\'a0 Yesterday, it was so quiet, that I would hardly have known that an election was going on, except from my feelings, it was a clear but windy day rather.\'a0 Today it is cloudy, & unfortunately has commenced drizzling, but it only makes me more thankful that \ul yesterday\ulnone  was a good day.\'a0 The vote in Greenville is larger than you expected.\'a0 You have been unlucky in having your friends absent & sick.\'a0 Mr. Croft intended if able to come out today & vote for you, but the rain will of course prevent him.\'a0 Mr. Spears is sick & cannot leave his room.\'a0 Mamma stopped yesterday to inquire after him, & Mr. Spears said, it made him more sick the disappointment, at not being able to come out to vote for you.\'a0 He has diarrhea, passes blood.\'a0 Dr. Earle, Mr. Poinsett, Mr. Arthur & others are absent.\'a0 Dr. Crittenden & his sons voted for you.\'a0 John Crittenden wrote the tickets for Mr. Hoke.\'a0 I feel grateful to your friends here, Mr. Hoke, Taylor, Dill & Others I will be always obligated to, but those who voted \ul against\ulnone  such as Maj. Turpin &c. I will \ul never\ulnone  forgive; for Orr\'92s being a Taylor man is \ul no\ulnone  \ul excuse\ulnone .\'a0 It ought to have made him contemptible in their opinion, knowing he only went for Taylor, to gain their \ul votes\ulnone ; & the men who \ul voted\ulnone  for you, but were not in their \ul hearts\ulnone  for you, & tried to \ul injure\ulnone  you by saying you would not be elected\'a0 & would hardly get any votes at such & such places, are the worst of all, & they have sunk in my \ul esteem\ulnone .\'a0 If they had been your \ul friends\ulnone , & such was \ul their\ulnone  \ul real \ulnone opinion, they would have kept it to themselves, but they expressed this opinion with a view to injure you.\'a0 It is raining now quite hard.\'a0 A great many people have come in already, but I am afraid many of your friends, will be prevented by the rain, from going in to vote for you, , & today the strong pull, the long pull, & the pull altogether is to be given, that is to make you successful, today the great event\'a0 is to be decided.\'a0 I am so sorry it is raining.\'a0 How I wish\'a0 there was a Telegraphic line to Laurens, & I could ask you, how you are coming on?\'a0 I do hope in Laurens you will get the majority you expected.\'a0 The paper I send you was furnished by Mr. Taylor.\'a0 At the Dark Corner Mr. Nicol gave you 5 more votes than he does, 175 instead of 170.\'a0 Mr. Orr\'92s minority are so small, that you will be able to tall to a man who voted for him.\'a0 Some of the boxes are not mentioned on the list you gave me, or they have different names.\'a0 Groces I cannot find, or Brushy Creek.\'a0 At Pickensville Mr. Orr got about what you expected, & you less.\'a0 Perhaps some of your friends went to other places to vote.\'a0 Mr. Hoke does not think Mr. Jones will be elected, but somehow it seems to me he will; his friends will try so hard today.\'a0 Do write me by Wednesdays Mail.\'a0 Last night I hardly slept at all.\'a0 Just before bedtime I heard the news, & it excited me.\'a0 Either \ul good\ulnone  or \ul bad \ulnone news keeps me awake, but the \ul former\ulnone  makes my thoughts much pleasanter when I am awake.\'a0 I do not see McDaniels mentioned on your list either.\'a0 While I have been writing I suppose more news has arrived.\'a0 I am seated at the window in my chamber with the blind hooked.\'a0 Little while ago I saw two buggy\'92s pass with gentleman in them.\'a0 It seemed to me they were friends of Mr. Orr\'92s come over from Anderson to electioneer for him.\'a0 They looked at the house so much, as if they had never seen it before, was what made me think so.\'a0 Mrs. Lowndes came to see me yesterday.\'a0 I told her she must make Mr. Lowndes & Mr. Wm Lowndes come in & vote for you.\'a0 She said she wished she had a vote she would give it to you; that Mr. Lowndes was then in the village & she expected would vote for you.\'a0 Mr. Shermans little son brought some apples, & I took 2 \'bd bushels, & told him his father must vote for you, & he said he \ul was\ulnone  going to, but I do not know if it was true.\'a0 I bought some Irish Potatoes from a person Molineaux. Who said he had just voted for you.\'a0 The rain has now stopped so I hope your friends will not be kept away.\'a0 You ought to be proud of the vote at Dickeys, all but \ul two\ulnone .\'a0 You certainly must inquire who those two are.\'a0 If you are elected, & Edward Earle, Col. Town, Smith & McKay all will be as I wish.\'a0 Mr. Jones has acted too treacherously for me to wish well to.\'a0 Perhaps he may lose by it, as Genl Garvin did.\'a0 At Burtons you did so well, all but 7.\'a0 Smith at Cox\'92s shop, voted for you of his own accord, because you were best qualified.\'a0 Charles Stone voted against you, because you voted he says against Richard Stone.\'a0 Mrs. Earles son in law\'92s have not acted I [word obscured] suppose as she wished.\'a0 If you are only elected my dear husband I will be so gratified, I must have my likeness taken again.\'a0 It will look so much happier than the last, & the reason I wish you elected is that you \ul deserve\ulnone  it, & I will feel for \ul once\ulnone , that \ul merit\ulnone  has met with its \ul reward\ulnone , that envy & \ul malice\ulnone  have been \ul defeated\ulnone .\'a0\'a0 We are all \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 I hope to see you safe & well next Tuesday as the representative of your State, but if it is ordered otherwise, I must be resigned, but I wish Col. Orr to be made to feel his \ul presumption\ulnone , & the Pendleton junto to know, as things do not happen as they \ul dictate\ulnone . & [word obscured] believe in prosperity or adversity.\'a0 Ever your attached, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mr. Taylor has just sent me the list of boxes showing how many votes you received.\'a0 You got altogether 23 less than you expected, & Mr. Orr 18 more than you expected, so that your calculation in that way was pretty correct, but at the separate boxes in some of them you were so much mistaken, that it makes me more anxious than ever. For the Sullivans were so successful in their exertions as to cause you to be beat at two boxes.\'a0 Therefore in Laurens, they may be equally successful, & occasion your defeat.\'a0 It is all decided now, though I am in the dark.\'a0 Last night, Mr. Hoke read me a letter from Mr. Sitton to Joe Powel.\'a0 He said it was thought Mr. Orr would beat you in Pendleton District 800 or 1000 votes.\'a0 Your vote in Greenville will makeup for that, but unless you get a large majority in Laurens you may be defeated.\'a0 I know of 10 men in this village who voted \ul against\ulnone  you, so I have \ul heard\ulnone , it may be a mistake, some of them & \ul others\ulnone  no doubt voted against you that I have not heard of yet.\'a0 Old Maj. Turpin \ul did\ulnone  vote for you.\'a0 He had said he would not, but he \ul did\ulnone .\'a0 Butler Thompson, Charles Stone, Isaac Henning, Joe Hayden, Tom Turpin, Gaines, Mr. Penible, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Walker & Mr. Choice voted against you.\'a0 Mrs. Wallace was here this morning, & she said Mr. Jacobs said at her house, that Mrs. Walker said to him, if \ul you\ulnone  were elected, she supposed you would call your dogs & feed them.\'a0 Mr. Lester said Dr. Sullivan was electioneering against you, saying you called the people vagabonds.\'a0 Col. Town[e]s, Mr. Smith & the two Earles are elected to the Legislature.\'a0 Mr. Lester says he knows of a dozen men at least, at Shockley, who if they had voted, would have voted for you, & yet did not leave their work to go to the Polls.\'a0 Mr. Dill did wonders for you at the dark corner.\'a0 Mr. Hoke worked well here & if he had had more like himself, says he would have saved you many more votes, but there are very few electioneerers, like Mr. Hoke & now I understand how much can be done on the day of election.\'a0 I am more uneasy than ever, for good electioneerers are in the class of Mr. Orr\'92s friends.\'a0 Your friends are generally those who do not pull & drag people to the polls, & force a ticket into their hands.\'a0 At Pickensville you got 73 votes, Mr. Orr 144.\'a0 Perhaps it was only guess work.\'a0 I do not know that the votes were counted out.\'a0 At Brushy creek you 35, Mr. Orr 60.\'a0 At Pickens C.H. Mr. Sitton said you were running ahead, at Bachelors Retreat Col. Orr, but he thought that a mistake.\'a0 At Gantts & the Trap you beat; at Stantonville & McElroy Mr. Orr.\'a0 I suppose tonight we will hear certainly from Laurens.\'a0 That news will decide the election.\'a0 Mrs. Butler was here this morning.\'a0 She says Butler Thompson told Dr. Butler he was going to vote for you.\'a0 I hear he voted against you, but it may be a mistake, as it was with Maj. Turpin.\'a0 The two Dr. Crofts came to see me yesterday.\'a0 Their father sent for the managers to come & take his vote.\'a0 They went, but afterwards said they would not take it, it was illegal.\'a0 A young Guinn would have voted for you, but because \ul more\ulnone  \ul than\ulnone  a \ul year\ulnone  ago he went to Texas for the purpose of settling, but did not like the country & returned.\'a0 Mr. Kilgore told him he must not vote because he had not been here 2 years; he had been more than a year.\'a0 Your friends are too scrupulous.\'a0 If Mr. Orr had such, he would get no votes at all.\'a0 I hope & pray Laurens may have done you \ul justice\ulnone , but Mr. Orr has powerful friends there.\'a0 I have seen no gentleman today.\'a0 I hope some of them will write, & tell you more than I know.\'a0 Mr. Thirlkill did a great deal for you.\'a0 At Doiuthits Mr. Orr beat you 11 votes; at McCulloughs 11.\'a0 Elias Earles brother voted \ul against\ulnone  you.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says if they had known that, the first day of the election, they would have paid it off on Elias.\'a0 I am so sorry Mr. McKay was not elected.\'a0 Col. Town[e]s saw a narrow escape.\'a0 Mrs. Wallace says she heard people saying Col. Orr was the poor mans friend; that you never bowed to anyone except when you were a candidate. She contradicted it.\'a0 Your Law cases have made you so many enemies.\'a0 Genl Thompson was electioneering for Mr. Jones, & said he did not know of four other men, who were so disinterested as he was, that he always acted from\'a0 \ul principle\ulnone , he disregarded his interest.\'a0 Genl Thompson says he gained you 500 votes by voting for you.\'a0 I rather think he lost you 500, by telling, how many places you would be beaten at.\'a0 He might have gained you thousands, by writing & speaking to his Whig friends throughout the Congressional District.\'a0 I am afraid no one comes to tell me news today, because they have heard \ul bad\ulnone  news.\'a0 I am sorry to close without hav[ing] something more definite to tell.\'a0 Mr. Sitton said at Pendleton you were getting one third.\'a0 Col. Irby Mamma heard , pretended to be for you, but was electioneering against you. I hope this is [fal]se.\'a0 The village has seemed to me very quiet.\'a0 I can [word obscured] imagine such important events have been going.\'a0 [Word obscured] hope you received my letter safe by Genl Tompson [word obscured] message Mr. Durbec sent me, saying you were doing well in Laurens, was a mistake of the servants.\'a0 I was sorry it turned out so.\'a0 If Genl Thompson influenced 500 votes, it was strange he did not influence his son.\'a0 My dear husband, your character for pride, & your abusing the opposite party in Law cases, has injured you to an immense degree, so I hope in future you will pursue a different course, look & be more sociable, & not be so abusive in your speeches.\'a0 Your course has been of great advantage to Mr. Orr.\'a0 If you had gone about more, you would have convinced the people it was not pride you had.\'a0 There is nothing they dislike as much as that.\'a0 I have heard more chicken stories.\'a0 A Mrs. Gunter, said she would not come to this house to be degraded, that persons who came here to sell things, were made to stand \ul out\ulnone  of the house, said she heard it from good authority.\'a0 In Laurens I am afraid all that stuff will have injured you a great deal.\'a0 I am really sorry I have not some \ul very\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  \ul news\ulnone  to tell.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mrs. Du\'85\'a0\'a0 has just paid me a visit, & I am so sorry you did not see her.\'a0 She came about half an hour after you left, & she told me a \ul great\ulnone  \ul deal\ulnone  about the Election, & gave me \ul great\ulnone  \ul comfort\ulnone , for she explained how much \ul chicanery\ulnone  & \ul cheating\ulnone  went on in the election, & which when you are aware of, you might another time counteract.\'a0 She says your friends are \ul indignant\ulnone  at the way things were managed & say Col. Orr shall never get as many votes again, & indeed they think that he did not in reality get all the votes counted him.\'a0 At Bachelors Retreat Ebenezer Verner voted for you, but did \ul nothing\ulnone  \ul more\ulnone  for you.\'a0 Sam Verner certainly voted \ul against\ulnone  you.\'a0 Old Mr. Verner said he did not care for either you or Col. Orr.\'a0 Old Whitfield she says acted a \ul double\ulnone  party at Bachelors Retreat pretended to be for you, so that your family even voted for him, & elsewhere abused you, & tickets that were written for \ul you\ulnone  & given to voters, he withdrew & gave others with \ul Orr\'92s\ulnone  name on it.\'a0 She says he acted most deceitfully.\'a0\'a0 Mr. Taylor Mrs. Du\'85 says turned against you two weeks before the election & electioneered against you all he could.\'a0 Says\'85were attributed to you, as being in favor of, which you never\'85that something I think Genl Cass said about poor people being sold, it was said was a measure of yours.\'a0 In short such \ul cheating\ulnone , \ul stealing\ulnone  & \ul corruption\ulnone  as went on at this Election, was never known before.\'a0 Mr. Lee says Orr is a disgrace to the country, & you ought to hold your head higher than ever, but he thinks \ul he\ulnone  could never be elected again.\'a0 Mr. Humphries the minister electioneered against you.\'a0 He is Wm Lee\'92s brother, told Mr.M\'85 Judge [page torn] was a great friend of yours.\'a0 Mr. Orr\'92s friends thought \ul you\ulnone  would be elected, & that is the reason they made such exertions.\'a0 Mr. Orr, your friend, I suppose, thought you would be, & did not exert themselves as they ought to have done.\'a0 Mr. Ben Hillhouse the gentleman who dined here, was a good friend of yours.\'a0 I hope you will hear a great deal from your friends about the election, & write me about it, & if they think so you ought to, & run again & beat the \ul drunken\ulnone  \ul demagogue\ulnone .\'a0 It is a disgrace to send such a creature to represent the State, & I hardly think the people would do so another \ul time\ulnone .\'a0 You have pursued such an honorable\'a0 & manly course, that I must believe you will be rewarded.\'a0 Your intellectual countenance. & fine commanding person\'a0 were not given you for nothing.\'a0 It is meant that you shall take a stand among the highest of Creation, & then you\'a0 will be appreciated.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 says\'a0 all that was said against you was your \ul pride\ulnone , but the idle lies, about Brandy &c. were circulated.\'a0 They may have injured you this time, but another time, I think they will lose their effect.\'a0 If you are ever a Candidate again, I will put in the newspaper an especial advertisement for myself, saying all the idle reports of my \ul sayings\ulnone  are \ul false\ulnone , that I love the poor people, & have always been particularly kind to them.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 threw a new light upon Mrs. Choice\'92s dislike to you.\'a0 She says Mrs. Choice\'a0 once thought you were going to marry her, & I believe it firmly, even if you do not.\'a0 You never have suspicions of that kind, but I dare say she would like very much to have married you, for when she was young, among her acquaintances in Greenville, there would have been none superior to you, or who a young lady would have been more likely to wish to make a conquest of than \ul yourself\ulnone .\'a0 So my dear husband, I feel very gratified & quite complimented that you should have chosen \ul me\ulnone , when I know there were others, who would have been glad to have bestowed themselves [page torn] & who also at the same time would have bestowed a \ul fortune\ulnone  likewise.\'a0 I must try & make you a good wife, & I assure you I would not change you now, for anyone else in the universe & as for \ul Col.\ulnone  \ul Orr\ulnone , he is not fit to black your boots.\'a0 I am too worrying a person, should have triumphed over you.\'a0 It would have been quite natural for you to beat him, but I think it must have been a most unexpected surprise to himself & his friends, when they found he was the successful one, but you must hold your head above him & hold it higher than ever, & he ought to put his in the dust when he knows how many tricks he had to resort to, to accomplish his ends.\'a0 Yes he triumphed, but he ought often to pass in rev\'85 all he means he used.\'a0 I wish you would mention to him or his friends, that they must have really determined to use all means, when he even tried to injure \ul you\ulnone  through your wife.\'a0 Tell them you heard what he said of me.\'a0 It was a \ul mean\ulnone  \ul thing\ulnone , & I wish him to \ul know\ulnone  it.\'a0 He ought to know that we heard it.\'a0 Mr, Pickens Mrs. D\'85 does not like, says he thinks only of himself.\'a0 I expect among all the Candidates in Pendleton District you had (except Mr. Lee) not one friend.\'a0 Tell Mr. Burt from me, that I always knew he was a false friend.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 says Josiah is confined to the house.\'a0 Wilbern is staying with him.\'a0 Perhaps you had better return home from Anderson, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court, for I\'85say he is in immediate danger.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 did not know anything more of him than this.\'a0 She told me a great deal about the Election which I would like you to have heard, before you went to Anderson.\'a0 Col. Orr\'92s brother, though he was treating so for him, did not expect him to be elected.\'a0 I do not suppose anybody did.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 will come & see me tomorrow again, & I expect pass the night.\'a0 I expect she will stay with me off & on while she is here.\'a0 You must certainly write to me by Tuesday\'92s Mail & I think you had better return home, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court,\'a0 I wish you would go to Pendleton Village before you re[turn] next week on your way to Josiah, & see what the people there say. I think there will be a reaction in your favor, at least I hope so.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 thinks Mr. Taylor acted shamefully, but W\'85field the worst of all.\'a0 I hope you will hear all she told me, & I suppose you will, when you see Foster, & Mr. Keith & others.\'a0 I have nothing to write about, which is the reason I dwell so long on one thing.\'a0 Willie is downstairs.\'a0 I have spent the morning in writing to you, & this afternoon I must read.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 says Col. Orr can never again get the same number of votes, as he got this time, that the eyes of the people are opened, & they are disgusted at his electioneering, & this is the last thing I will say.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P. Write to me Tuesday, whether you will come back, or go on to Pickens & see Mr. Lee if you go to Pickens, & he will tell how things were managed at Bachelors Retreat.\

My dear husband\'a0\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to promise I have taken my seat at the desk to write to you, & I must commence with the business part first.\'a0 Mrs. Harrison has just left here.\'a0 She came to ask if I knew if you would buy Reuben, that Reuben was anxious you should buy him, & though she would get a higher price for him, from others, she would be willing to sell him to you\'a0 for 500.\'a0 She says her son James saw you, as you were starting to Columbia, & asked you if you would buy Reuben, & you said \ul yes\ulnone , you would give \ul 500\ulnone  for him.\'a0 She begs you to write to me \ul immediately\ulnone , so that I may hear by this Friday\'92s Mail, for next week she is to leave for Florida, so you must be certain & let me hear Friday night, & immediately as I get the letter, I am to let her know.\'a0 She seems exceedingly anxious you should buy Reuben.\'a0 I know not what to advise you.\'a0 She speaks in the highest terms of Reuben, says she does not know his age exactly, that he is 30 certainly, how much more she does not know, that Dr. Harrison bought him when her daughter Mrs. Earle was a baby, to go to the Mill, & Mrs. Earle is nearly 26, that he was a little boy, that he is sober & industrious\'a0 & made her last summer 10 dollars a week, that Mr. Cox speaks highly of him &c. &c. &c.\'a0 Write me an answer by Fridays Mail.\'a0 I will now speak of other matters.\'a0 Fanny is a great deal better.\'a0 I have not given her any medicine.\'a0 I hope she will be quite well when you return.\'a0 The rest of the family are well except John who now has the Measles, & Delia who though complaining, is better.\'a0 She is able to hold Fanny & today is cooking while Mary & Minerva are at the Spring washing.\'a0 The weather cleared up so soon, I expect you are almost sorry you did not go down in your Buggy, but perhaps the first day you might have taken cold, so it is all for the best.\'a0 I hope you & Mr. Keith had a pleasant journey down.\'a0 I expect to hear from you by Jim.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 slept here Friday night, & \'85 slept here last night & this morning went to Mrs. Service\'92s to prepare to start.\'a0 They were to stop to bid me goodbye, but they have not come yet, so I expect they will not leave today.\'a0 Mrs. D\'85 had a pain in her face, which perhaps prevents her going.\'a0 The children & myself went to church yesterday morning, & Mr. Arthur preached a sermon on temperance, alluding to the Law lately passed by the Town Council, & said the community ought to sustain them.\'a0 Mrs. Tom Jones was at church.\'a0 As well as I could see, she was not remarkably pretty, looked very pale.\'a0 In the afternoon there was no service.\'a0 Mr. Arthur had a bad cold. \'a0\'85 the children & myself walked over to Susans house.\'a0 It is a very plain looking house, & seems built in the most economical manner, & ought to have had a chamber downstairs, which I think is essential in winter.\'a0 Mr. Hoke had a load of wood hauled Saturday for us.\'a0 It has all gone already, so Charles today has got one of Mamma\'92s horses & is hauling wood.\'a0 Jim cut up so little Sausage meat, that with the greatest economy, it has only lasted for 7 meals. & then we each had only two little ones, not enough to satisfy us.\'a0 I should think one hog, the trimmings from, would have furnished more meat than that.\'a0 A letter came last night from Walker & Bradford, saying they had forwarded a box to you.\'a0 It weighs a hundred pounds, the freight is 50 cts a hundred.\'a0 It is the box I suppose Aunt Eliza sent.\'a0 It will be here Friday.\'a0 A letter has come for you from Mr. Barclay who is now in Canada, patronized he says by the nobility & gentry & standing at the head of his profession.\'a0 He wrote to you for a friend who is writing a book on Indian traditions, & who wanted to know something of the Carri\'85, who lived in Georgia, & as you had interested yourself in Revolutionary Incidents, he thought you might be in possession of information relating\'a0 to the Indians, which might be of service to his friend.\'a0 His name is J.A. VanHeuvel, Ogdensberg, N.Y.\'a0 He was a classmate of Mr. Calhouns.\'a0 Another letter came from Mr. Berry & wished to know. If you would wish the Lumber that was at the Mill for Josiah, that Josiah had hauled off 88 cts worth more than he had paid for, & that if you needed the lumber he had, he would like for you to pay for it immediately, as he was closing his business & was going to Mississippi & that if it was not convenient to pay immediately for the lumber, he would rather keep it, that Josiah would have preferred getting it at Sh\'85s Mill which was in sight, but engaged it from him, thinking he would have finished it sooner.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 The village seems very dull.\'a0 The weather is very cold.\'a0 I suppose you will wish the other hogs killed now.\'a0 You must write me by every Mail.\'a0 Your letters will be my chief pleasure in your absence.\'a0 I hope you will be able to get a new trial for Dr. Anderson.\'a0 You must speak to your friends in the Legislature for Cousin Isaac, Mr. Cannon, Col. Ware, Mr. Earle & others I am sure might be influenced by you, & do what you can for Wm Ed to retain the office of Inspector.\'a0 I am sure your speaking only to enemy would cause them to vote for Cousin Isaac, & you may with very little exertion do him good, for many would give their votes to the one who has first asked them for it, so you ought to have spoken long ago.\'a0 I am anxious Cousin Isaac should be elected, particularly for Aunt Eliza\'92s sake.\'a0 I have a bad pen to write with, & nothing to write about, which must be the excuse for this uninteresting letter.\'a0 When I hear from you, I will have\'85to write you, & I will try & get a better pen.\'a0 Anna went to school today.\'a0 I was reading a peice in the Spartan last night, which says children should not commence to learn until 7.\'a0 That those children who know the \ul least\ulnone  at \ul 12\ulnone , prove in after life the smartest men, that Dr. Adam Clarke when a child was thought rather stupid, that it injures the brain to exercise it too much.\'a0 I intend Willie to write to you sometimes instead of me.\'a0 I have so much work to do, writing takes up too much time, particularly when I have nothing to write about.\'a0I hope to hear certainly Friday your answer about Reuben.\'a0 Mrs. Harrison says until then, she will make no exertion to sell him.\'a0 She says Mr. Mooney offered her 6 dollars a month for him which would be 72 a year, but she does not wish to hire him out.\'a0 She seems very anxious you should buy him, says Col. Irvine would buy him\'a0 & give more than 500 but she prefers you having him, says she heard you were willing to give 550 but was advised by someone not to do it.\'a0 She says you told James before you started, that you would give 600 for Reuben.\'a0 I told her I had not heard you say anything before you left, that not hearing from her, I thought she had made other arrangements.\'a0 So my dear husband, in this instance I leave you to \ul act\ulnone  as \ul you\ulnone  \ul think\ulnone  \ul best\ulnone , for fear that I might influence you, & then be blamed by you.\'a0 If she is correct, Reuben would be an invaluable servant, but you know we must make allowances for her representations.\'a0 She says she knows you would not sell him, you would be so much pleased with him.\'a0 I wish you could see Fanny now playing about the floor.\'a0 Our carpet is getting so old.\'a0 I am trying to save to buy one.\'a0 If I show you the 10 dollars when you return, you must let me get one either send town or get one at Mr. Nicols.\'a0 Now adieu my dear husband, recollect when I give advice, I always\'85you to consider it, but \ul do\ulnone  \ul as\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  \ul think\ulnone  \ul best\ulnone .\'a0 Late events have made me lose some confidence in your judgment, & place more in mine.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday night, & am glad in writing this time to have a letter to answer.\'a0 Your letter as usual gave me great pleasure.\'a0 You know they are my chief source of pleasure, in your absence.\'a0 I regret, as well as the \ul Members\ulnone , that you are not in the Legislature.\'a0 It is a place suited for you, & I feel now that your talents have no field for their usefulness.\'a0 You ought to have remained there at any rate, until the Electoral Bill was passed, for you have been its great Champion, & others will take the credit from you.\'a0 As regards the Presidency of the Bank, it is a subject too important for me, to give any advice on.\'a0 Your comprehensive mind, can judge better of that, than I can.\'a0 I never could like some wives try to influence my husband \ul against\ulnone  \ul his\ulnone  \ul judgment\ulnone , what will effect his whole life.\'a0 You know what your prospects are in Greenville.\'a0 I have often wished you could be, where there was more congenial society for you, minds on a footing with your own, & with whom you would have pleasant intercourse.\'a0 I regret this more than you do, but such an important step , as changing your residence & your business, I cannot say one word either way.\'a0 Mr. Hooker was here today.\'a0 He says, he heard a Charleston gentleman, say at the Mansion House, last night, that Mr. Elmore wished to be Judge, when Judge Richardson resigned.\'a0 I wish you could be Judge.\'a0 I have always wished it, & when there is a chance of your succeeding, you must try for it.\'a0 The upper country Members are in the majority, & they generally would vote for you, so I think your chance would be good.\'a0 If you had thought of it in time, I would like you to have been a Candidate for Attorney General.\'a0 Being from the Upper Country, you would have beat both of the other Candidates, & that would be an eligible office, worth removing to Charleston for I wish you to get some office or other, & I hope there is still a chance at any rate of your being a Member of Congress.\'a0 You were \ul foully\ulnone  \ul treated\ulnone  this time.\'a0 As you say it is \ul doubtful \ulnone who will be elected Attorney, it behooves the friends of each party to use their influence, so I hope for \ul my\ulnone  sake, you will speak to your friends in behalf of Cousin Isaac.\'a0 I do not wish you to make strenuous exertions, but such friends as you can influence, speak quietly to.\'a0 He will lose all the Taylor Democrats & Whig votes I expect, having taken an active part on the other side.\'a0 I am sorry to hear Sarah Taylor is sick, but hope she is better now.\'a0 The box containing the Shrimps has arrived.\'a0 Aunt Brewton sent Willie a little Gold pencil case.\'a0 A few of our other friends sent presents to the children, & Shrimps to me.\'a0 I am glad to tell you, that my Gold Thimble is found.\'a0 Night before last, Lindy took the Candle out of the Candle Stick, to grease her face, & when she was putting the candle back, in the socket of the Candle Stick she found the thimble, almost concealed by grease.\'a0 I instantly conjectured, that Frank while at the stand, the night I missed it must have put it there, & that it was the spool that dropped & you picked it up the next morning.\'a0 So in the morning I asked Frank about it, & he says yes, he put the Thimble there.\'a0 Yesterday on removing the Fender to clean it, my large scissors was found.\'a0 So Mary is no longer implicated in those supposed thefts.\'a0 I hope now, my Che\'85, & other lost articles will come to light.\'a0 It was natural I should suspect her, when the morning after the Thimble was lost she stole an apple & a few days after a quarter of a dollar.\'a0 I believe none of us were glad to see Jim on his return.\'a0 We had got along so comfortably without him.\'a0 He is a worthless servant.\'a0 A plank has been off the carri[a]ge house a long time, & instead of mending it he let it remain, & in his absence someone got through\'a0\'a0 & took out a peice of leather.\'a0 The person knocked off another plank.\'a0 He yesterday was wearing the nice pantaloons you gave him, instead of keeping them for his dress pantaloons all winter.\'a0 I told him to take them off.\'a0 He said he had no others to put on.\'a0 I told him he must, & he then went & put on others, & I made Elizer make him a pair.\'a0 He seems to like to destroy his clothes, & every thing about him.\'a0 He has a bad temper & is at war with the whole world.\'a0 In contrast to him stands Reuben, who though I know is not perfection, yet he cant be worse than Jim, & must be better.\'a0 The day I wrote you he hauled two loads of wood for us.\'a0 He also hauled three loads for his mistress from beyond Mr. Brooks.\'a0 That was five loads in one day, & Jim scarcely hauls 3.\'a0 Jim took all day yesterday to clean the carri[a]ge & did not do the harness.\'a0 Today I told him to do that, but he is always so mysterious, he is never to be found.\'a0 Charles this morning cut wood, got his breakfast, & went to the farm before I was dressed.\'a0 He is so different from Jim.\'a0 Indeed there is no servant as bad as Jim & I would rather be \ul without\ulnone  \ul him\ulnone  even if you do not \ul purchase\ulnone  \ul Reuben\ulnone .\'a0 I feel happier when he is away, even if I have to give up riding but I hope tonight, to get a letter saying you will buy Reuben.\'a0 His mistress & himself today I know are very anxious, for I think Mrs. Harrison is a kind mistress, & wishes for him to get a good owner, for she sells him to you for very little 500 dollars, the interest of which is 35.\'a0 I am sorry I did not beg you to buy him, but I was afraid to, for fear you might blame me.\'a0 As soon as Jim returned as\'85& worthless as ever, I was sorry I did not beg you.\'a0 If what Mrs. Harrison says is so, that you told her son James, you would give 500, I suppose there is no doubt, but what your answer will be in the affirmative.\'a0 Otherwise I believe on my own responsibility I will get him, for I am so much without you, I need a good man servant.\'a0 Your first large fees you must pay for him & secure it, so he will not be taken for Mrs. Harrisons debts, & this I suppose you can do, as you did the farm.\'a0 If you will not buy him, then Charles must stay here, & Jim sold or hired out, & Charles learn to drive, or you get a buggy & drive me.\'a0 Jim knows you have thoughts of selling him & yet he does not do any better for it.\'a0 I hope my dear you will look at low Buggy\'92s with\'85, & let Jim carry your Buggy down for you, & see what you can get for it.\'a0 I am anxious you should have a nice Buggy with a cover.\'a0 You travel so much, you need a nice one, that will protect you from the rain.\'a0 I knew you would buy knives.\'a0 We would have done without large ones; small ones only we needed.\'a0 They could have been got cheaper in Charleston.\'a0 I am glad you bought clothes for you needed them.\'a0 The young\'85you do not need.\'a0 After being \ul 11\ulnone  \ul years\ulnone  \ul married\ulnone , it is too late for that now, your habits cannot be changed, so change it for another book.\'a0 I wish \'93to the Married, & those contemplating marriage.\'94\'a0 Mrs. Cunningham wishes all females only to have it.\'a0 I am afraid the Brooches\'a0 are not very pretty, as they are as cheap.\'a0 I wished one as pretty as you got before.\'a0 If they are as pretty I will be satisfied, & as they are so reasonable would like you to get me another, to give to Ann & one of those you have got I will give to Susan.\'a0 Willie says get him a \ul glass\ulnone  \ul slate\ulnone .\'a0 He is fond of drawing; bring Vardry a little present, as you are his Godfather, a \ul trifle\ulnone  will do, just to show you think of him.\'a0 Thank you for the fruit.\'a0 I sent some to Susan, Ann, Mrs. Irvine & Miss Payne.\'a0 It rained yesterday all day, & is wet today.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter by Mr. Keith.\'a0 Mr. Long\'92s son brought it.\'a0 I told him to ask Mr. Keith to come & see me, but I dare say he will not.\'a0 I write to you tonight, because tomorrow I expect to be engaged visiting.\'a0 Jim arrived safely, as you have heard.\'a0 The two next days it rained, so he only cleaned the carri[a]ge & put up Elisa\'92s Stove.\'a0 Yesterday he hauled one load of wood, & some leaves.\'a0 All next week I am going to use the carri[a]ge, so I expect he will do very little work, but Charles will work & Jim as much as I can spare him. Since writing the above, Mr. Keith has paid me a visit.\'a0 He has just left, so I will continue.\'a0 You will be surprised to hear, that I have \ul not\ulnone  \ul purchased\ulnone  Reuben.\'a0 You merely said, if \ul I\ulnone  desired it, you would purchase him.\'a0 This permission, I do not consider authority enough.\'a0 I will tell you all that has passed.\'a0 After receiving your letter, I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, what you said, & that I would not decide unless I knew your wish, to purchase Reuben.\'a0 She said I must decide at once, for Mr. Beattie & Mr. McBee both wanted him, so I sent for Mr. Hoke, to get advice from him. He said he had never thought much of Reuben, but admitted he knew nothing against him, except that he drove Mrs. Harrisons horses hard, that he knew he would suit \ul me\ulnone  better than Jim, for he was obedient, sober, & industrious, that Jim was a worthless creature, drank, traded with poor people, was idler, careless, &c. that he saw him constantly at Pecks stable & numerous other things that he mentioned, & yet said he would rather have Jim than Reuben, for he would whip him & make him know his place, but with you he would never be of any account, because you were too indulgent.\'a0 After this account of Jim, I was determined to buy Reuben, so I sent to Mrs. Harrison that he should come for me to look at.\'a0 He came, & I liked his looks, & what he said, but still not give a decided answer.\'a0 At night when Jim came in with the keys, I felt sorry for him, so I thought I would say something to him, so I said \'93Jim you know if we buy Reuben,\'a0 & are pleased with him, we will sell you, but I do not suppose you will care, for you never have seemed happy here,[\'93], he said, \'93 if my owners are not satisfied with me, I am perfectly willing to be sold, I do my work, & if I cant please them\'a0 I am willing to leave them\'94.\'a0 I said, \'93you have told me you would rather belong to a strict owner, than your master\'94.\'a0 He said, \'93I would rather belong to an owner who treats his servants alike some of them here are treated well, the other have to poke about,\'94 insinuating that he, the most indulged of \ul all\ulnone , was treated the worst.\'a0 I now lost all pity for him, & determined to buy Reuben.\'a0 I was in this frame of mind, when Mr. Hoke came in, & brought with him Dr. Crook, who he said knew more about Reuben, than he did.\'a0 Dr. Crook said he had always seemed to him slow motioned, & if you sent him on an errand, he would stop if he met anyone & laugh & talk with them, that he thought compared with Jim. It was 6 of one & a half a dozen of the other.\'a0 Mr. Hoke said he had worked for him & worked faithfully, & what Dr. Crook knew against him was literally nothing, yet they both advised me not to buy him, & said if he ever acted badly, I would blame myself.\'a0 Of course advised in this way. I would not make the purchase, so I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, that in your absence I could do nothing.\'a0 This morning Reuben came again & said his mistress said, that she would let him remain so, until you returned, that she would send me the bill of Sale, & then if you did not wish him, you could give it to Mr. Beattie, & Mr. Beattie would buy him.\'a0 She said you would fix all right.\'a0 She had perfect confidence in you.\'a0 Matters rested so until this evening after church.\'a0 I saw Mr. Beattie, & asked him if Mr. Harrison left Reuben & you did not buy him, if he would, & he said he had sent word to Mrs. Harrison he would take Reuben, but had not received an answer so he thought if Mrs. Harrison would agree to it, he would take Reuben at once, & when you return if you wish him, he will sell him to you at the 500 dollars.\'a0 If you do not wish him, he can easily sell him to someone else.\'a0 So here the matter rests, & I think I am a perfect Metternich to arrange things so well.\'a0 Dr. Croft after church this morning, said he wished to see you, to consult you on some business.\'a0 I told him, I could advise him, I knew a great deal about Law.\'a0 He said I was indeed, the smartest lady he ever knew.\'a0 He invited us to visit him at Newberry this winter.\'a0\'a0And now for your letter.\'a0 I must my dear husband say that I am vexed at the \ul foolish\ulnone  \ul purchases\ulnone  you make.\'a0 You show no judgement at all, \ul knives\ulnone , \ul forks\ulnone , \ul spoons\ulnone , when we have not a decent cup or plate to use with either, the spoons, but particularly the forks we could have done without & as the forks are not \ul real\ulnone  \ul silver\ulnone , it was foolish to get them, for our\'85ones answer perfectly well, & one set of \ul imitation \ulnone is quite enough.\'a0 What we need is a \ul dinner\ulnone  \ul set\ulnone  of \ul Crockery\ulnone , a nice set of \ul cups\ulnone  & \ul saucers\ulnone , some \ul Table\ulnone  \ul Mats\ulnone , a carpet for the Dining room, which we will be \ul obliged\ulnone  to get, for our present one is in \ul rags\ulnone , a chamber downstairs, our house painted, an oil cloth for the Stair case.\'a0 These things are \ul necessaries\ulnone .\'a0 The 36 dollars thrown away in the spoons & forks, would have bought the carpet, & then our chamber would have been made comfortable with the old carpet, & the dining room with the new.\'a0 Every thing of this kind is yet so much cheaper in Charleston, & comes up so much more conveniently, that I prefer getting them there.\'a0 Things are so dear in Columbia, that when you go down, I do not even mention what we want, for fear you may buy it, but as you will throw away your money so \ul foolishly\ulnone  I will not be so scrupulous another time.\'a0 If you knew how self denying I was, how I deny myself of every comfort in clothing, because you cannot afford it, you would reflect more before you spend your money.\'a0 If you were to see my \ul petticoats\ulnone , my \ul drawers\ulnone , my \ul stockings\ulnone  you would be \ul shocked\ulnone .\'a0 Of the money that passes through my hands. \ul Precious\ulnone  little is spent on myself.\'a0 It is all expended on the house, children & servants; a few handsome dresses I have & those \ul you\ulnone  bought me.\'a0 I have taste, & make my things look well but nothing more than I possibly can help, do I buy.\'a0 Aunt Eliza who thinks herself so straitened, would be astonished if she examined my Wardrobe.\'a0 You preach economy, & in your \ul dress\ulnone  you are economical, but at one blow you spoil it all; 36 dollars or at least 18 thrown away, for forks we had no earthly use for.\'a0 What we have are good enough for our circumstances, & they are not even \ul silver\ulnone .\'a0 What you have bought therefore I must say it was very foolish to buy a \ul second\ulnone  \ul set\ulnone  of \ul imitation\ulnone  silver.\'a0 I would like you if you would\'a0 to get back your money & keep it for some of the necessaries mentioned above.\'a0 The first 20 dollars you can spare me, I am going to send to Charleston or the North for a Musical box.\'a0 If you had\'85the money you\'85to, I would long ago have got one.\'a0 I do not wish it now, but next year some time I hope to git one.\'a0 Now I wish the house painted, and a Chamber downstairs, & a Carpet, & an Oil Cloth, & a Dinner Set, & a Tea Set, & Table Mats, & more Table Cloths, Towels, Pillow cases &c., but these things I intend getting in Charleston, everything now is cheap there.\'a0 Columbia particularly during the Session is extravagant,\'a0 Therefore I do not care for them to be got there.\'a0 I\'a0 have spoken long on this subject for I really \ul feel\ulnone  it.\'a0 I know that we have no money to spend uselessly.\'a0 I never have a fourpence to give away.\'a0 As \ul you\ulnone  have I want you to bring a present for \ul Vardry\ulnone .\'a0 You are his Godfather, & have never given him a present yet so get something for \ul him\ulnone , & the three pictures for 50 cts for Ann, & the glass slate for Willie, & engage the \ul Lady\'92s\ulnone  \ul book\ulnone  \ul for\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone , & if Graham & that together can be got for 5.00 engage Graham for Mamma.\'a0 Willie has \ul 15\ulnone  cts I owed him for Chickens.\'a0 He says you must buy something pretty for him at that \ul price\ulnone  besides the slate & he will pay you the money when you come home.\'a0 You must buy what books you can afford, but I expect that will not be many.\'a0 I expect the Women of the Bible, is too costly, so you can get that another time.\'a0 Per[s]ons here seem to think Mr. Edward Earle is sick, but as you do not mention it, I suppose he is not.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Perry Duncan were here this evening a few minutes to see how Fanny was.\'a0 They had heard she was sick, & did not know she was better.\'a0 I went to church today, both morning & afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says Genl Thompsons family say he has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.\'a0 I wonder he does not accept it.\'a0 He boasts enough.\'a0 He loves nothing from his humility.\'a0 I cant bear him or his \ul family\ulnone .\'a0 They are too conceited, but conceit & vanity helps a person in this world.\'a0 It has \ul made\ulnone  Genl Thompson.\'a0 I am pleased at the compliments paid you, but nothing can make up for my mortification at your late defeat, until you have \ul triumphed\ulnone  over your \ul base\ulnone  \ul enemies\ulnone .\'a0 Until then I can not feel as happy as I once did.\'a0 I took\'85pride in you, & it has been humbled, & so many are pleased at your defeat in this Congressional District.\'a0 The Lower County appreciates you much more than the Upper.\'a0 I wish Judge Butler could be beaten.\'a0 He never ought to have been elected.\'a0 I do not wish Col. Manning elected Governor.\'a0 He has no claims to it.\'a0 I hope Cousin Isaac will be elected.\'a0 You must do what you can, without injuring yourself.\'a0 I am sure you can influence many.\'a0 I feel great interest in his election, not only for Cousin Eliza\'92s sake, but for the sake of the name he bears.\'a0 He is the only one at present, to preserve it with distinction., & I am sorry for him.\'a0 Gloria has not much manner.\'a0 She is like her father, & she is very cold.\'a0 She always was.\'a0 I hope Col. Orr heard the speech made by Genl Brisbane, & I hope Col. Edwards with be elected Solicitor.\'a0 I wish you would be elected Solicitor when Genl Whitner is elected Judge, which Mr. Keith says he will be when Judge Richardson resigns.\'a0 Do you not think your chance is better than Mr. Youngs.\'a0 You must watch your chance, & be elected to something to cover the disgrace of your late defeat.\'a0 You must certainly price Buggy\'92s & Carri[a]ge\'92s, but a\'85Buggy you most need, & if you can make a good bargain, buy one.\'a0 See how much they would give for your old one.\'a0 Describe it to them, & then let Jim carry it down to you, or if you can get a reasonable one, perhaps you might\'85your old buggy here.\'a0 At any rate see what kind of bargain you can make.\'a0 If you cannot make a \ul good\ulnone  one, then get one from Mr. Cox here.\'a0 You might price Carri[a]ges & at one time or other change ones.\'a0 I dare say you would sell ours here, to someone in the country at a good price, when you wish to get another.\'a0 I have had a long chat with you, & if you were not tired would go on much longer.\'a0 I am not as silent as Gloria.\'a0 It is going on 10 oclock.\'a0 I am sending Willie upstairs.\'a0 I am glad you thought his letter did pretty well.\'a0 You might have told Col. Dawkins, if he meant it as a disparagement\'a0 [of] the four children only that you had had 6, & asked him how many he had.\'a0\'a0 They having married \ul twice\ulnone , you supposed\'a0 he had a house full, & tell him we were going on quite as rapidly as we desired, but if\'85would leave some of his property to one, we would try & have another & name after him.\'a0 Mr. Henry Thompson will be disappointed in not being Bursar.\'a0 I am going to write to Aunt Eliza now , & will tell her you think Cousin Isaac will be elected, & that the Greenville delegation will go for him.\'a0 The village is dull.\'a0 I have only been out to church, since you left.\'a0 I have been working for the servants all the time.\'a0 Eliza has worked two days for Margaret Croft, which will come to 75 cts.\'a0 Adieu I may add something tomorrow.\'a0 I am going to see Mrs. Town[e]s tomorrow.\'a0 Several messages have passed between us.\'a0 I am going to see Mrs. Tom Jones,\'a0 & Mrs. \'85.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P. I have a shocking pen to write with & no way of getting another.\'a0 I am ashamed of my letter but cant help it.\

	Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a visit.\'a0 She is very anxious, that I should take Reuben, with the bill of Sale, & on your return if you do not wish him, let Mr. Beattie have him, or she says, or perhaps she may let Mr. McBee have him at once.\'a0 I told her I proposed that to Mr. Beattie but he said the other was the best plan.\'a0 I suppose Mr. Beattie in taking him now & selling him to you would have his debt paid, but otherwise he would not.\'a0 I cannot buy Reuben on my own responsibility, for I do not know whether you wish to buy him or not, so I will not take any step.\'a0 You write me word so I can hear Friday, whether you prefer \ul buying\ulnone  him. Or prefer not.\'a0 Just tell me what \ul you\ulnone  \ul wish\ulnone , & I will do \ul exactly\ulnone  as you \ul say\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Harrison will be here I expect then, & then I can give her the answer.\'a0 I preferred waiting until you returned, that we might have a long talk on the matter, but I expect it will have to be settled now.\'a0 Mrs. Harrison asked who was elected Messenger to carry votes.\'a0 I told her I expected Mr. Black would be & told his motive for going.\'a0 She said \ul he\ulnone  ought to be \ul elected\ulnone .\'a0 She says Mr. Jones is a candidate for Treasurer of upper division.\'a0 I hope he will \ul not\ulnone  \ul be\ulnone  \ul elected\ulnone .\'a0 You \ul need\ulnone  not \ul do\ulnone  \ul anything\ulnone  \ul for\ulnone  \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 I am going to his house today, but I am sorry to have to.\'a0 Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a second visit to say Mr. Nichols says he \ul knows\ulnone  you will be willing to buy Reuben.\'a0 You write me word \ul distinctly\ulnone  what to do, whether to \ul buy\ulnone  him or \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 I will do just as you say.\'a0 Mr. Cox says he \ul likes\ulnone  him.\'a0 Mr. Hoke & Dr. Crook say they do not.\'a0 You know what Jim is, & I expect you have some idea of what Reuben is, so just do as you think best.\'a0 Mrs. Kerrison is so anxious you should take him.\'a0 She seems averse to Mr. Beatties taking him, but you must do as you think best.\'a0 Do write me exactly what your wish is, so that I may not have to act on my responsibility, but \ul yours\ulnone . I have not said all I wished, so will write a little more.\'a0 If you have good news for Mr. Henry Thompson, you must write & tell him.\'a0 I am going soon to see his Wife.\'a0 Mrs. Tom Jones sees company, so Susan & myself are going to see her.\'a0 I suppose Genl Thompson has gone on to Washington to get an office.\'a0 He is well situated now, for his disposition, able to go wherever he pleases.\'a0 I do not think he is suited for domestic life.\'a0 As Mrs. Pattersons expectations were so large, I hope she got something, at any rate enough to make her lead a virtuous life, & not be the means of leading many a young man astray, as I expect she now does.\'a0 I wish my dear husband you would be elected Senator.\'a0 I have such aspirations for you.\'a0 I believe I would be happier, if you were a stupid ignorant man, for then I would expect nothing for you, & would be satisfied, but as it is, my opinion of you is so \ul exalted\ulnone ,\'a0 my expectations for you are \ul great\ulnone , & as they are not realized, I am unhappy.\'a0 I am not \ul envious\ulnone  of others, but I am provoked, when those, so far your inferior, triumph over you.\'a0 I never can forgive the people of Pickens, Anderson, & Laurens for letting Mr. Orr beat you, when they knew what low means, he was using, & should have made them feel a contempt for him, instead of that to put him in such an honorable position, as he now holds.\'a0 Mr. Burt acted \ul basely\ulnone , & I hope he may \ul never \ulnone succeed in obtaining an office again, but he is so \ul mean\ulnone  I dare say he will.\'a0 Col. Irby, Mr. Sullivan the Pendleton people & others, I think are contemptible, & yet such a man as Sullivan, can get forward better than you, & I dare say will be a Member of Congress some day.\'a0 If you can do nothing better, you must go back in the Legislature, which I am sorry you quitted, for another time you might have been elected to Congress.\'a0 It was most unfortunate you should have come out when you did.\'a0 I wish you had staid 4 years more in the Senate, & then run for Congress.\'a0 When I think of these things I am so unhappy.\'a0 I cannot feel as happy as I once did.\'a0 I have a bitter, mortified feeling, which I will never get over, until you have triumphed over your enemies, & made them see, that they cannot always pull \ul you\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone .\'a0 Then again I will be happy, & I hope that time will come.\'a0 It is too bad to think that such men as Garvin, Reid, Whi\'85, headed by Calhoun, just as mean as they are, should succeed in preventing your obtaining the place, that Providence by giving you the proper qualifications for, meant you to have.\'a0 I hope they will yet be mortified, by seeing you successful.\'a0 I hope experience will teach you in future to manage better, for you are greatly to blame yourself.\'a0 Your publishing your peice, your \ul controversy \ulnone with \ul Sullivan \ulnone occasioned your defeat, & now that it is over, the speeches we can see helped to it, but I know\'a0 you acted for the best, though unwisely, so now I will stop.\'a0 Fanny is better & looks better & prettier than I ever saw her.\'a0 Write me every Mail.\'a0 The rest of us are well.\'a0 It has been a \ul relief\ulnone  to me to write what I have done.\'a0 You know I must express my thoughts to you, & it is my high opinion of you that makes me feel you have been so illy treated.\'a0 Your defeat is \ul astonishing\ulnone .\'a0 I cant understand how you could have been except there are too many Mr. Burts.\'a0 I hope Mr. Burt will be defeated.\'a0 He is one of your worst enemies, & pretending to be a friend.\'a0 Mrs. B\'85. who you & Mr. Beattie & other denominations have to support, immediately after Mr. Beattie had paid 5 dollars on Mr. Elfords subscription, went into Mr. Beatties store & bought 16 dollars worth of velvet to make herself a V\'85, supported by C\'85, & then to be so extravagant, more so than the wives of those who support me.\'a0 Tell Col. Evans & Mr. Elford of this.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just written a long letter to Aunt Eliza, & you will see by the date, that it is now very late, but I cannot go to bed, without writing to you, because tomorrow I may not be able to.\'a0 I expect to spend the morning in writing.\'a0 This morning I went to see Mrs. Kingsland, & then Susan, Mamma & myself, to see Mrs. Bryan, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Robert Smith, & Mrs. Coleman.\'a0 Mr. Bryan is trying to sell his place.\'a0 He asks 2500 dollars for it, & he is selling his furniture at private Sale now, & afterwards what is left, will sell at Auction.\'a0 They will go to town whether the house is sold or not.\'a0 Mrs. Bryan was very anxious to go & says she does not wish to return.\'a0 Says Mr. Bryan says, perhaps he may return & buy a farm.\'a0 Dr. Simmons must have a very bad judgement before he has tried Greenville, & known whether he will like it, & known whether he will succeed.\'a0 He has bought a poor farm of Dr. Atwoods near Piney Mountain, given 800 dollars for it, & engaged board for himself Wife & children & 2 servants at Dr. Atwoods for 650 dollars a year.\'a0 \'85at the Mansion House he would have boarded the same family for 450 dollars.\'a0 Mrs. Bryan says, he said the Trustees had thrown out\'85inducements to him (which he would not\ul  mention\ulnone ) that he would not decline settling here, that she knows next year, he will get the Female Academy, & that she is sorry for Mr. Bradshaws family, they are such a fine family.\'a0 I myself am sorry for them, & as Mr. Bradshaw seems a good Teacher, I think for their sakes even, he ought to be continued.\'a0 Anna learns well, & of the two I prefer Mr. Bradshaw to Dr. Simmons,\'85looks too young, & too weak, & simple, & I dislike hurting Mr. Bradshaws feelings, & sending him & his family adrift into the world.\'a0 Mr. Mc\'85 Mrs. Bryan says is going to remain, & has the promise of 30 scholars.\'a0 I must tell you the final settlement about Reuben.\'a0 Mr. Beattie is to take him, & you buy him, or not, just as you please, on your return.\'a0 So we can have a long talk about it, when you come back.\'a0 I have no letter to answer of yours, so have no more to scold you about at present.\'a0 Mrs. Coleman today, showed us over her house, & told the price of the furniture, for Susan\'92s benefit, who will have to get furniture for her new house.\'a0 She had in her Dining room a beautiful Carpet, Red & Black, colours suited for this Soil.\'a0 It was only \ul 80\ulnone  \ul cts\ulnone  a yd.\'a0 I intend to write to town for just such a one.\'a0 She bought it at Lambert & Brothers.\'a0 She had a set of the handsomest Waiters I ever saw. Which she gave only 5 dollars for, & a beautiful Sideboard with a Marble top, which she gave only 50 dollars for.\'a0 I wish you to buy as few things as possible in Columbia.\'a0 Everything is too dear their.\'a0 I expect you could have got Knives much cheaper in Charleston.\'a0 Mrs. Colemans chamber looked so comfortable opening into her Dining room.\'a0 As soon as you come back I want you to have one made for me back of my Dining room, so much of it being made already, it will not cost much, & I wish the house painted.\'a0 The paint is so dirty now, I cannot make it look cleaner, so save all your money for this.\'a0 You need not buy any Books, except engage the Lady\'92s book.\'a0 The Croft family left today, all except Mr. Croft & Mrs. Pearson\'92s family.\'a0 Jim this morning drove me out.\'a0 This afternoon he shelled Corn for Meal & Hominy.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s is better.\'a0 I hope Cousin Isaac\'92s prospects are brightening.\'a0 I take no interest in the Legislative proceedings, as you are not a member.\'a0 I hope you will be, this time 2 years, if nothing better offers.\'a0 I cannot let you remain as \ul useless\ulnone  as you now are.\'a0 You are too well fitted for the duties of a Legislator, not to be one.\'a0 All the bills you introduced about giving the voting for President to the people, the Penitentiary &c. will be passed, & you gain no credit for it.\'a0 I will stop now & add some more tomorrow.\

	I have just done breakfast.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s sent me a few Oysters, & some bread, & says she is quite smart, & that Maj. Earle returned last night & says Col. Townes is better.\'a0 The Oysters as usual were \ul shocking\ulnone .\'a0 I sent them into the kitchen.\'a0 The pickled Oysters brought to Greenville, are not fit to eat.\'a0 You know the Cornfield at one side of Joe P\'85s house, between his house & Mr. Luther McBee\'92s .\'a0 He has sold \ul half\ulnone  of it, a narrow strip to Mr. Rowand for 500 dollars, which I think was enormous.\'a0 Today it is very cloudy & warm.\'a0 I expect it will rain.\'a0 If you get a Buggy, & can have yours taken in exchange, you must write for Jim to carry it down.\'a0 If you do not get one, & wish to come back in the carri[a]ge, write for that, & I will let Willie go down in it.\'a0 The horses seemed not at all injured by the journey, or the Carri[a]ge either.\'a0 If you get a Buggy, it must be a fashionable kind, but if they are too \ul expensive\ulnone , you can wait until next Spring.\'a0 Columbia is so dear, perhaps Buggy\'92s & Carri[a]ges may be dear too.\'a0 So I do not tell you to get \ul either\ulnone .\

	I have just returned from paying visits.\'a0 In the course of them I heard the Governor was dead, that Maj. Earle brought the news.\'a0 I heard also that young Elias Earle, intended next winter to be a Candidate for Comptroller General, & Mr. Jones also, that Mr. Jones had declined running for Treasurer.\'a0 I went to Mrs. Arthur\'92s where I saw Mr. Rosemond who is building a nice piazza in front of Mr. Arthur\'92s house, for only 27 dollars.\'a0 Mr. Arthur furnishes Lumber & Nails.\'a0 I asked him how much he would ask for putting a room in our Piazza & described it to him.\'a0 He said he would not exactly say, but he supposed 10 or 12 dollars.\'a0 I told him to come down tonight & look at the Piazza & tell us exactly.\'a0 He is going to build the house for Mrs. Pearson, & is said to be the cheapest workman here.\'a0 He has been working for Mr. Pinckney at Flat Rock, & was recommended by him.\'a0 So I wish you as soon as you return, to get the Lumber, & have the room commenced by Mr. Rosemond.\'a0 I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0 Susan is going to Housekeeping, & I will wish you to make her a valuable present.\'a0 So a dozen large & small forks, such as you have got, I will wish you to get for her.\'a0 If you could afford it \ul now\ulnone , I would like it, if not in the Spring when you go to Columbia, perhaps what you have got for me I may give to her.\'a0 I will see about it.\'a0 This week I expect to get through with my visiting.\'a0 Every afternoon Jim has leisure.\'a0 Yesterday he shelled Corn; this afternoon he is going to haul wood.\'a0 Tomorrow I am going to see Mr. Henry Thompson.\'a0 This afternoon I am going to pay visits in the neighbourhood, so when you return, I will be able to stay at home, & entertain you, & ride with you.\'a0 Fanny is at this moment seated on the table sucking a bone.\'a0 Charles stays entirely at the farm, so I hope he is doing well.\'a0 It has cleared off now, & the sun is shining, but it is so warm I expect it will rain soon.\'a0 I must now close to send the letter to the office.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I did not intend writing to you by this Mail because I thought you would leave Columbia tomorrow, but as in your letter tonight you do not say when you will be at home.\'a0 I write, for fear if you do not hear, you will be uneasy, & hurry home.\'a0 Today I have been visiting.\'a0 Mamma & myself went to Dr. Butlers this morning, & Mrs. Henry Thompsons this afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Thompson said he would always recollect the interest you had taken in his election as Bursar.\'a0 I am surprised you should have voted for Thompson Earle as Messenger, when you were under no obligation to his family, but rather the reverse.\'a0 I thought you would have voted for Mr. Black.\'a0 I am glad Cousin Isaac is elected Attorney General.\'a0 Mrs. Butler said there were such reports about Dr. Griffin when he left Abbeville.\'a0 He was the \ul last\ulnone  man she thought would have got an office, particularly that of \ul Treasurer\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you did not have to pay for the printing of Dr. Anderson\'92s briefs, & I also hope you will do your best, & get him a new trial.\'a0 I wish you had mentioned the Decisions in your cases.\'a0 Mrs. H\'85 seemed to me a pleasant lady.\'a0 I hear Mr. Eddings your friend has taken Dr. Austin\'92s house.\'a0 I suppose hired it.\'a0 It is uncertain whether Mr. Bryan will leave or not.\'a0 I rather expect Greenville suits him too well, that he will remain.\'a0 I am glad you purchased Candlesticks for we need them.\'a0 We need some for the Drawing room.\'a0 China ones are used, & when we can afford it, I will get a pr.\'a0 I wish you to buy for me, \'93the Carolina Receipt Book,\'94 by Miss Rutledge of Charleston.\'a0 The price in Charleston is 1 dollar, Mamma wishes it also, but as we are not certain\'a0 how we will like it, only one is enough to get.\'a0 You have not mentioned whether you have engaged the Lady\'92s Book. & whether Graham & that taken together would be got for 5[.]00.\'a0 Mamma wished Graham, if it would be got on those terms.\'a0 Cork Soles are worn in Shoes now.\'a0 Mrs. Arthur got a pr from Charleston.\'a0 I wish you would inquire in Columbia, & if they can be got, buy me 1 pair, & if \ul very\ulnone  \ul reasonable\ulnone  \ul 2\ulnone  \ul pair\ulnone .\'a0 You must bring something for the children, something that will be useful & last, not broken up immediately.\'a0 I will send this letter by Mr. Smith who leaves tonight, & get him to put it in the Post Office at Columbia.\'a0 Tomorrow I expect to finish my visiting,\'858 next week.\'a0 Jim will work steadily.\'a0 I will not take him off.\'a0 I thought it best to visit while you are away, as Jim will work more steadily when you are here.\'a0 He has not given me so much trouble in getting the carri[a]ge as usual.\'a0 Franks dog is quite well.\'a0 The Baptist Convention commenced today, but I do not think many persons have come yet.\'a0 The Village looks as quiet as ever.\'a0 We will all be happy to see you, but do not come sooner than\'a0 your business permits.\'a0 I must now conclude so as to send the letter before the bell rings.\'a0 Do you not think it would be a good plan to buy you[r] seed in Columbia of Russell, that they are better than those got here, but this is, as you think.\'a0 Willie is now studying his lesson.\'a0 Fanny is asleep in the Cradle.\'a0 Anna & Frank are gone to bed.\'a0 I believe I have nothing more to write.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P. Recollect the pictures for Ann 3 for half a dollar, such as you got before, & something for Vardry, an Ornament such as you have sometimes got for Anna, or some little thing, I do not care what.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I must write to you, so that if you remain in Columbia until Wednesday you may hear from me.\'a0 I have been very punctual in writing.\'a0 There is a great pleasure in feeling \ul confident\ulnone , when the Mail arrives, that it will bring a letter.\'a0 I judge of you by myself & know that you would rather hear, even if you receive a \ul scold\ulnone .\'a0 I indeed ought to scold you \ul now\ulnone .\'a0 The Crockery & waiters we needed.\'a0 Though Columbia being so dear & inconvenient\'a0 to get things up from there & also so expensive, I would have preferred getting those things in Charleston.\'a0 However we needed them so I wont scold about that.\'a0 But the Toys were perfectly useless, a \ul few\ulnone  would have answered.\'a0 You put too much money in them.\'a0 A little more, would have bought me a Musical Box, which I have so long wished, so now to make \ul friends\ulnone , you must give me 20 dollars, on your return & I will send it to town & buy a box with most beautiful tunes, which I will listen to all day while at my work.\'a0 You have no air for music, cannot realize my fondness for it.\'a0 One thing you must do, you must tell the children, \ul I \ulnone am to choose, what I wish first.\'a0 If not, anything you say is theirs, & I wish they will not give up, for already they are quarreling about it.\'a0 I wish one of the knives, I have long wished a knife, so tell them as soon as you arrive, that I am to \ul distribute\ulnone .\'a0 I will take what I wish, & then give to\'85what suits them best.\'a0 You know if you had plenty of \ul money\ulnone  I would not [obje]ct to your buying whatever you fancied, but we need too many [necess]aries, to indulge our \ul fancy\ulnone .\'a0 We will have to get a carpet for the Dining [roo]m, our present one is in \ul rags\ulnone .\'a0 The 30 dollars the Legislature gives you [page torn] \ul Couch\ulnone , except to put up separately in a paper, & give to me on your \'85turn, to send to town to buy one.\'a0 Mrs. Coleman has one [page torn] Room, which I think beautiful.\'a0 It is \ul black\ulnone  & \ul red\ulnone . Does not show dirt, &\'85[page torn] the Dining roomas we sit in that room in Winter.\'a0 She bought it in Charleston at Lambert & Brothers, & gave only 80 cts a yard\'a0 for it.\'a0 Our room requires 37 yds so the carpet with the Binding would come to just 30 dollars, & we ought to get a \ul Rug\ulnone  to \ul suit\ulnone , but we could do without the \ul Rug\ulnone .\'a0 If you could get \ul such\ulnone  a \ul Carpet\ulnone  in Columbia, at \ul that\ulnone  \ul price\ulnone , I would \ul like\ulnone  you to \ul get\ulnone  it, but I do not believe you could get one there so reasonable.\'a0 It was a \ul strong\ulnone  \ul carpet\ulnone , \ul not\ulnone  Venetian, Ingrain I expect.\'a0 Carpets are not very reasonable.\'a0 Red & Black, or Red & Green are the colours I like.\'a0 They are dark & yet bright.\'a0 You might inquire the \ul prices\ulnone  of Carpets [page torn] but if you find them like the Buggy\'92s \ul dear\ulnone , [do] not get any. 80 cts [page torn] Mrs. Coleman gave for hers.\'a0 The waiters that you have bought, must be\'85I described to you, that she had.\'a0 Sometime I would like to give out, that [page torn] are going away, have an \ul auction\ulnone , sell our furniture high, then change our minds, &\'85, & buy \ul new\ulnone .\'a0 What do you think of my having made a contract with Mr. Rosemond to put a room in the piazza, for \ul 23\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone , \ul he\ulnone  furnishing the Lumber.\'a0 This is \ul most\ulnone  \ul reasonable\ulnone , as you may know, from Mr. Croft\'92s employing him, to build Mrs. Pearsons house.\'a0 He will commence the room immediately as you return, unless you prefer instead of the room in the Piazza, an addition put at each side of the house, \ul two\ulnone  \ul rooms\ulnone  on each side.\'a0 \ul Four\ulnone  rooms altogether with a little passage like Mr. Poinsetts, & doors to each room, 2 windows to each &c.\'a0 He has given me a bill.\'a0 He can do it, furnishing the Lumber for 325 dollars.\'a0 This is reasonable, & if you would not approve that, one room on each side, would be about half, but if you do not wish this, he will immediately put the room in the Piazza & this Winter we will occupy it.\'a0 The other he does not know if [page torn] can do until he has finished Mr. Crofts house.\'a0 I told him we had [page torn] boy who during the time we would hire to him, so that Jims [page torn] [w[ill be \ul deducted\ulnone  from what we pay him.\'a0 He says for good [page torn] from 18 to 26 dollars a month, that he could not tell how much he would pay for Jim, until he tried him, but at any rate would pay from 12 dollars upward.\'a0 Now do you not think I am a \ul manager\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Beattie yesterday sent me a paper, saying that he had purchased Reuben, & on your return would let you have the choice of purchasing him, on the same terms he had done, provided you purchased him in a month, from that date.\'a0 So do you not think\'a0 I did well there too.\'a0 Mr. Lester paid me a visit today, says he saw you in Columbia, looking as well as he ever saw you.\'a0 I received a letter last night from Aunt Harriet McCall.\'a0 She says she heard gentlemen regretting you were not in the Legislature.\'a0 You know Mrs. Faber has married a third time.\'a0 Aunt Harriet says she has married a young man 27 her \ul sons\ulnone  \ul Tutor\ulnone , that it seemed strange that she could not support her Widow\'85.\'a0 Tom Roper who a little more than a year ago, you saw, has \ul since\ulnone  lost his Wife & Married again, so Matrimony is \ul complimented\ulnone .\'a0 Neither of them had the \ul excuse\ulnone  of a gentleman I read of in the papers, who lost his Wife, was \ul sorry\ulnone  for his \ul little\ulnone  \ul daughter\ulnone , so married again to give her \ul another\ulnone  \ul Mother\ulnone .\'a0 I hope \ul my\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone  will never have such \ul sorrow\ulnone  for his \ul children\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Hooker was here this morning.\'a0 He says he heard Mr. Curtis last night at the mansion house, expressing his astonishment at your defeat, & saying how much interest Spartanburgh felt in it.\'a0 All these compliments only provoke me the more, to think the Congressional District you \ul live\ulnone  in, & one you asked the favor of, was the \ul only\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone , that would have \ul refused\ulnone  it.\'a0 From any other part of the \ul State\ulnone , you would have been elected.\'a0 You must try your chance again, or I will never be satisfied.\'a0 Play your cards better the next time.\'a0 Mrs. Theodore Thompson told me Col. Orr was taken up & brought away from a Corn Shucking, \ul dead\ulnone  \ul drunk\ulnone , that she said at the time, you were not above \ul Shucking\ulnone  \ul Corn\ulnone , but you \ul were\ulnone  above degrading yourself in that way, that her brother was anxious you should be elected.\'a0 You had always been a friend of their family.\'a0 She & Mr. Thompson are going to Union to live on a plantation she owns.\'a0 She says there Mr. Thompson will have employment [page torn] of the \'85pation, & said when she saw the page torn] were moral, faithful to their \ul Wives\ulnone , acted in every respect as they ought, she felt ready to fall down & worship them, & that you were \ul one\ulnone .\'a0 I told her \ul yes\ulnone  you \ul were\ulnone  an \ul exception\ulnone .\'a0 Genl Thompson made quite a mistake in sending Willie a \ul female\ulnone  Dog.\'a0 \ul Both\ulnone  are females.\'a0 Do tell him of [word obscured] Franks has grown \ul finely\ulnone , & is the prettiest Dog I ever saw.\'a0 Lindy washed it, & it looks white as Snow.\'a0 Willie\'92s has been sick, & at one time [page torn] thought would have died, but it is getting better.\'a0 It has not grown like the other.\'a0 It has mortified Willie very much.\'a0 He has the feeling of a parent to it.\'a0 He cannot bear to hear comparisons made between the dogs.\'a0 Anna stepped on his this morning & lamed it.\'a0 He is afraid it will never get over it.\'a0 He does without Milk to give it to his Dog.\'a0 I have paid all my visits but \ul one\ulnone  to Mrs. Loveland.\'a0 Jim has commenced ploughing the garden.\'a0 Charles stays entirely at the farm.\'a0 I have had the whole front lot raked & swept, & cut down three old Peach trees.\'a0 I am more ready for the house to be painted.\'a0 Delia is sick, is in her room.\'a0 She is almost entirely useless, & perhaps will not live long.\'a0 [word obscured] will be a great loss .\'a0 After this spell, I will let her do no [word obscured] work, only mind Fanny.\'a0 The least hard work, makes her worse.\'a0 Dr. Earle has been \ul over\ulnone  to see her & sent medicine & direction.\'a0 The Convention of the Baptists is going on.\'a0 I have been too busy [to] go the church to hear the Ministers.\'a0 There is no news to write about.\'a0 The children long to see their presents, & I long to see you.\'a0 Buy me the \'94Carolina Receipt book\'94, if you have the \ul funds\ulnone .\'a0 Do not make a mistake.\'a0 It is by Miss \ul Rutledge\ulnone , & buy me \'93to the married & those contemplating Marriage\'94.\'a0 Each of these books is 1 dollar, & buy me some \ul Cork\ulnone  Soles.\'a0 They keep the feet \ul warm\ulnone .\'a0 I have [word obscured] a long letter to Aunt Anna Turnbull, & am going to write to [word obscured] Cunningham.\'a0 I am glad Eloisa Martin has sent a bundle.\'a0 Give my love to her, & inquire particularly how Sarah Taylor is.\'a0 I expect Miss Calhoun would like to marry Col. Manning.\'a0 Mr. Calhoun has treated you badly.\'a0 He blasted your hopes this last summer, but I hope, you will yet triumph over him.\'a0 I woke the servants this morning at 4, & was done myself a little after 6. [page torn] I woke them it was so early.\'a0 It was moonlight.\'a0 I took [page torn] now.\'a0 Ever Your attached Wife, E.F.P. Mr. Lester says Genl Thompson is not your friend & never has been.\'a0 He has always considered you a \ul rival\ulnone  & has been the means of injuring your prospects greatly that Mr. Kilgore has no opinion of him.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Again I am at my desk writing to you with bad pen, ink & paper, for the deficiencies of which you must make allowances.\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday evening, & it gave me much pleasure.\'a0 Mrs. Elford sent to know if I had heard, that she had not.\'a0 I was glad to be able to inform her of Mr. Elfords safe arrival.\'a0 Mr. Bobo was really unfortunate.\'a0 I hope your horse will not be ruined like Skylark.\'a0 I will not tell you of all that has been done at home.\'a0 Tuesday & Wednesday the Mr. Smiths Whitewashed & did it very nicely.\'a0 They understand it better than Mr. Wallace.\'a0 The dining room they have done lighter than before, so it is now of a beautiful straw colour, the little room the same, but that can never look well, until the leak by the Stovepipe is stopped.\'a0 The rooms downstairs\'a0 except the Library, are arr\'85 in\'85, with the exception of the Curtains.\'a0 Upstairs is nearly fixed.\'a0 Last night I was able to sleep in my own bed, which was quite a treat.\'a0 Today the cleaning has been stopped & Minerva & Mary gone to the Spring to wash Curtains, bed clothes &c assisted by a woman of old Mrs. Greens who washes beautifully.\'a0 They have more to wash, than I think the 3 will be able to get through with, so next week we will go on washing paint windows &c.\'a0 The\'85of the house will be much\'85on your return, to judge by the \ul quantities\ulnone  of \ul dirt\ulnone  that has been removed.\'a0 If you had seen how much had accumulated under the carpets & in every corner, you would wonder the house should have looked at all neat, or we been able to breathe in it.\'a0 A great deal is yet to be done, weeks worth I am afraid.\'a0 Charles is in the garden.\'a0 We have had fine rains.\'a0 Yesterday the ground was too wet to plough, but Reuben went to the Farm.\'a0 The day before Lindy he said was sick & helped only a little.\'a0 Today they have both gone.\'a0 Tomorrow Reuben has to go to Mr. Fairs for Corn.\'a0 The barrel Mr. Foster sent has given out, & I intend to take the opportunity of Lindys being at home & send for Dr. Crooks to see her.\'a0 She is not well.\'a0 She has headaches, bleeding at the nose, & she is at a time of life, that she must be attended to, to ensure her \ul health\ulnone  & even \ul life\ulnone \'a0 so I hope Dr. Crooks will put her in a way to have\ul  all\ulnone  \ul right\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Foster sent only 202 pounds of Bacon,\'a0 22\'a0 peices.\'a0 I sent 100 pounds to Mrs. D\'92Oyley. Myself & the children are well. Though I feel fatigued,, from the labours of the few days past.\'a0 Scott I expect has got over his lameness.\'a0 I have heard nothing more of it, but I was very much afraid it will come on again next \ul Sunday\ulnone .\'a0 Hochel\'85 I hope is getting well.\'a0 Yesterday for the first time since the sad change in his fate, he pranced about the orchard as in days of old.\'a0 The hogs & pigs I believe are well, & the Cows & Calves.\'a0 The poultry escapes every now & then out of the pen, so they are reduced in number without our receiving the benefit.\'a0 We churn a little every day, & get one or two Eggs. I was walking over the front yard this morning & many of my plants seem flourishing but others are dying from the rude treatment of the Colt trampling\'a0 & breaking them down.\'a0 A good many Hawthorns are planted & the fence one in bloom. Miss M\'85died Wednesday night, & her funeral took place yesterday morning at Mr. Watsons.\'a0 She was buried at her fathers place.\'a0 I attended the funeral.\'a0 Mr. Arthur performed the services.\'a0 She was I believe quite good, \'85she communicated on her sick bed.\'a0 That day for the first time she was told she would not recover.\'a0 She said she wished she had been told sooner & she was perfectly resigned & her parents seem so too.\'a0 Mr. Bate\'92s child was buried yesterday afternoon.\'a0 Willie says the Clevelands took home their books yesterday from school, that they are going to New Haven to school.\'a0 William Choice also, Mr. Jefferson Choice\'92s son.\'a0 A letter came for you last mail\'a0 from Willis Burket giving an account of the Tugaloo Farm. I received a note from Mrs. Sharpe acknowledging the reception of the Shoes & thanking me for them.\'a0 Her health she says is better & that they were sorry they missed seeing you, as you passed through Pendleton.\'a0 Mr. Croft told me Mr. Pearson was one of the Delegates to the Nashville Convention from Florida, & that he is to pass the summer in Greenville. Mamma & Susan walked in yesterday.\'a0 They are as usual.\'a0 I have been nowhere & seen no one, so have not much to tell you, Last Monday Mr. Davis had 5 new scholars, so now he has nearly 50.\'a0 He is very anxious Anna should learn\'85& I would be too, if we could afford it at present.\'a0 It would be occupation for her, & prevent her playing at home with servants.\'a0 We will talk about it when you return.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 You must not forget to buy some Bird seed of different kinds & send up by Mr. Elford.\'a0 If he comes first, Mr. Croft says he does not know when my package will be here.\'a0 He does not intend sending down for his Groceries, until freight is lower & the roads better. Do not forget Ann\'92s \ul apple\ulnone  box.\'a0 She will think hard of it if you do not get it.\'a0 Have the shoes made up.\'a0 1 pr is for Ann & she will pay for, & get from the shoemaker the pattern he kept before.\'a0 It was a good shoe, & bring back the one you carried this time.\'a0You must not let your claims on\'85be overlooked,\'85it is what I positively desire for you, & I hope you will be thought of for that office, which you are so well calculated to fill.\'a0 You will receive this letter Sunday evening.\'a0 Before you can get another you may leave, so perhaps this is the last letter I will write to you, for if you are away\'a0 only the 2 weeks you expected, you will start for home next Wednesday.\'a0 I wish\'a0 you would get a new trial for Mr. Gilreath, but I am afraid you cannot.\'a0 The weather is quite cool.\'a0 I must now stop.\'a0 I wish to take up some tacks out of the floor in the\'85chamber.\'a0 I took up the matting, & there was an inconceivable quantity of dirt underneath.\'a0 I had thought there was none.\'a0 The room was so little used. But it is two years since the matting was taken up.\'a0 A great deal of dirt had collected.\'a0 I have gone through so much fatigue to clean the house for \ul you\ulnone , you ought to feel obligated to me, the rest of the year, & be very kind & obliging & love me, & never scold me, or give me one unkind word, or make me afraid to ask you for money, or say I am extravagant, & do \ul all\ulnone  \ul I\ulnone  \ul wish\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  too.\'a0 So good bye for the present, & I hope this is my last letter, that this time next Friday you will be on your way home.\'a0 Your obedient faithful Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter Wednesday evening, & cannot tell how mortified I am at the useless purchases you have made.\'a0 If money was\'85, or if you were ever out of debt, I would be less \ul grieved\ulnone , but when you know how much at present you owe, & that you are making \ul less\ulnone , than you have done for years, I cannot but be surprised, that you should so \ul thoughtlessly \ulnone spend your money, & show so \ul little\ulnone  \ul judgement\ulnone , the things we \ul need\ulnone , you do not get, & what are \ul entirely\ulnone  \ul superfluous\ulnone , you get, what we have\'85for an \ul Entry\ulnone  \ul Lamp\ulnone  which is only necessary, where much company is entertained, & a chamber Lamp. what in the name of wonder are we to do with it.\'a0 I told you \ul expressly\ulnone  if you bought Lamps, to get them for the Drawing room, for the only one we have in there, is an old fashioned\'85, out of repair.\'a0 I did not think at present you could afford even for the Drawing room, but if you \ul would\ulnone  get them, it ought to have been for that room, & not for our little narrow Entry, where it will not be used more than once in a year.\'a0 I must say I am provoked at this purchase & if it is not too late, would wish you to \ul exchange\ulnone  it, for something more \ul useful\ulnone ; then again to give \ul six\ulnone  dollars for Wine glasses, when 2 dollars would have been according to our means, & when we have not even a nice set of Cups & Saucers, to use for company, & 16 dollars to give for Decanters, when 1 pr would have been sufficient, to get two bed\'85when only one we needed, & so many Pitchers & Basins, when we have not Basin Stands to put them on.\'a0 My dear husband, you see how inconsistent your purchases are, so do in future I beg you, learn first from \ul me\ulnone  what we \ul need\ulnone , before you \ul throw\ulnone  your money away.\'a0 I have [page torn] as if the money was \ul lost\ulnone , & I think how many things we really need, & that I have been denying myself of so long [page torn] would have purchased.\'a0 Col. Dunham is \ul good\ulnone  for the money, therefore there was no necessity of laying it out at the agents.\'a0 It would have been even better to have had the note gaining interest, & to be of service, in extricating you from debt. \'a0You have certainly forgotten, what you owe, & that the house is to be painted, & will be such an expense.\'a0 We ought to save all we can for that, & now Col. Irby\'92s note is\'85upon, & that will soon go principle & all.\'a0 As long as you are alive, your family will be supported, if your \ul health\ulnone  does not fail you, but even \ul that\ulnone  is uncertain, & when you think of the \ul uncertainty\ulnone  of \ul Life\ulnone , & how unprovided your family would be if you were taken away, I wonder this thought does not make you\'85, & determine you to begin before it is too late, & lay up all you possibly can for your helpless family.\'a0 In future I beg you to give me 100 dollars a year to supply myself with clothes.\'a0 It is \ul 50\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone  \ul less\ulnone , than you allowed me when we were \ul first\ulnone  married.\'a0 I find it is of no use for me to \ul deny\ulnone  myself, \ul actually\ulnone  of \ul necessary\ulnone  clothing, when all that I\'85is spent so uselessly by you.\'a0 You ought to see my \ul petticoats\ulnone , my \ul night\ulnone  \ul dress\ulnone , \ul my\ulnone  \ul stockings\ulnone , actually in \ul rags\ulnone , & then your Entry Lamp would\'85, but I could fill sheet after sheet with my reproofs on your \ul want\ulnone  of \ul thought\ulnone , for I must attribute imprudence to \ul this\ulnone , so I will stop.\'a0 The \ul Wig\ulnone  I am glad you got.\'a0 I am always pleased at your providing yourself, with what is necessary to your good appearance.\'a0 It is a duty you owe your \ul Wife\ulnone , to make yourself look as \ul comely\ulnone  as possible.\'a0 We should take the same pains with our appearance after marriage as before.\'a0 It is more necessary then, for the \ul Leaf\ulnone  \ul gold\ulnone  is then wanting, which each party had thrown over the \ul object\ulnone  of its love.\'a0 The Dining Table I am not displeased at your getting, though the freight will\'85high, but you must now get a \ul Table\ulnone  \ul Cover\ulnone  for it, & I hope as you have been so liberal in buying what we \ul do\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  need, that you will buy a \ul Transparent\ulnone  \ul Curtain\ulnone , which we \ul do\ulnone  \ul need\ulnone  for the Library.\'a0 When I said we would not purchase Groceries at present, it was to [page torn] my determination to be \ul economical\ulnone .\'a0 I did not think you would argue from it, that the money that ought to have been appropriated to that purpose, you would spend in other ways less useful.\'a0 I need clothes, & I am actually letting E\'85 take in Clothes so as to make a little for me, to supply myself with the Clothes.\'a0 She is now working with Mrs. Shoolbred at the Mansion house.\'a0 I told her she must bring me 50 cts a day, & I am doing the work of all my family.\'a0 Our circumstances have pressed upon me lately, for I saw you were making little. & the expenses of our family increasing, for we will wish as our children grow up, to give them every advantage of education, but I do not see how we can, for now you spend more than you make.\'a0 You ought to have saved to buy a \ul horse\ulnone , & I do not know anything that makes a housekeeper so comfortable, as a great supply of Groceries, but we cannot get them now. It has rained ever since I wrote to you.\'a0 The weather is gloomy & cold.\'a0 I have been able to have \ul nothing\ulnone  done in the garden.\'a0 The ground continues so wet.\'a0 I expect much ploughing has not been done at the farm, but they have been hoeing, but I suppose the rain makes the Oats & Corn grow.\'a0 Reuben goes off early & returns late.\'a0 Miss Long has had bad weather for her honey\'85.\'a0 I hope Love has made up in warmth, for the loss of the pleasant sunshine.\'a0 We have had fire constantly.\'a0 It is not raining at this present moment, but it is cold & damp & the wind is blowing.\'a0 Frank is quite well.\'a0 Willie yesterday was taken with a throwing up, & continued during the day.\'a0 Dr. Crooks is away so I sent for Dr. Earle to know what to give him, & he sent him Senna & Salts.\'a0 Today he feels pretty well, but I have kept him at home.\'a0 I sent to Dr. Earle for something for Fanny, & he sent her two doses of Calomel.\'a0 I gave them to her with Oil afterwards, & her operations were dark green stuff.\'a0 I think she looks better, so I hope the Calomel has done her good.\'a0 The children say you must bring them some Paint boxes.\'a0 I suppose Tom Butler [page torn] not sent the money.\'a0 I hope not, as I am afraid you would \{page torn] it all, & we must spend some now in consequence the purchases you have already made.\'a0 We will have to get more Pillows, Pillow cases, Sheets, Basin Stands, Table Cloths for the Dining Table &c & Curtains are needed for the Room we used to sleep in.\'a0 & when we can I wish to buy a Carpet for that room. Mr. Edward Earle died before Dr. Earle got there as I mentioned to you.\'a0 I have not heard any particulars. The old Cow has broken down almost every Orange Tree.\'a0 I am so provoked, but feel to her as I do to you, that my vexation can profit nothing, & even any punishment I can inflict cannot restore things, as they were. Do supply yourself with all the clothes you need.\'a0 I hope you have got a Sack Coat.\'a0 I love to see you looking neat & nice.\'a0 Judge Evans imagines what his feelings will be for a Wife if he gets another.\'a0 I have no thankful feelings, on account of your defeat. Eliza Hayne writes me that Mrs. Taylor has been very ill, & the Doctor ordered her to change the air, so she was going to Charleston to pay a visit. The children long to see you, so do I, so you may expect & prepare for many scolds, for I assure you I have been worried & even kept \ul awake\ulnone , thinking how many things we needed could have been purchased with the money you spent for what we did not need.\'a0 An Entry Lamp is very little used even in Charleston, & Gas is dangerous; change it I beseech you for Drawing room Lamps or something else useful.\'a0 Now I have opened my mind, I hope I will feel easier.\'a0 But I have not said half I intended.\'a0 But I love you still.\'a0 I only grieve you understand your circumstances so little & take [page torn] thought for the future, while it is in your power.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I suppose you will expect to hear from me tomorrow when the mail reaches Laurens, so I must write to you now.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 No letter came Sunday night.\'a0 If any arrive tonight, it will be too late to send them by the Mail that carries this letter.\'a0 I will begin as usual & tell all that has occurred\'a0 since the moment you left.\'a0 Sunday morning we went to church.\'a0 Mr. Pinckney preached & gave us a very fine sermon.\'a0 He & his son only came down this way, & were to meet the rest of the family at Mr. Andersons.\'a0 Mr. Stuart played very finely on the Organ.\'a0 In the afternoon Mr. Arthur preached \ul not\ulnone  one of his best.\'a0 In comparing the Union of Church & his people, to the Union between Husband & Wife, he always knows my delicacy, for it was an old sermon.\'a0 Mr. Croft spoke to me after church.\'a0 He says Mr. Moore has married a poor lady.\'a0 On Monday morning Mr. Pinckney made me a pleasant visit.\'a0 He says he did not speak against Greenville to Mr. Shoolbred, but if he had been asked on the subject, he would have said, that he was perfectly disgusted at the open manner in which the gentlemen drank when he was here last, showing no shame whatever.\'a0 In the afternoon he went to see Mamma, & told her, \ul I\ulnone  seemed so well.\'a0 The next morning he left.\'a0 Charlie also came to see Willie.\'a0 He is very much grown.\'a0 Monday afternoon the Mother & Wife of Mr. Hopkins returned my visit.\'a0 They are both, particularly the Wife very pleasant ladies.\'a0 Yesterday morning Dr. Simons called to see you.\'a0 Sarah asked him in, so I went down & saw\'a0 him.\'a0 He commenced by reading me a note he had addressed to the Trustees requesting them to meet him somewhere, that he might explain to them his reasons for having sent in his letter of resignation, on hearing of his not being elected to the Female Academy.\'a0 He says he has no mortified feelings whatever, but considers himself as very badly treated by some members of the Board; that he was persuaded by some of them to accept of his situation as assisting in the Male Academy, on the express\'a0 condition, that he should be elected to the Female; that he asked the few who spoke to him, if they spoke authoritatively in the name of the Board & they told him yes, & when he became dissatisfied & wished to give up, one of them told him to consider well,\'a0 for he would certainly be elected Principal of the Female Academy; so he considered himself as elected, & afterwards those very ones had shifted their grounds, & quite forgotten what they had formerly said.\'a0 He said \ul you\ulnone  & several others had \ul never\ulnone  said a word to him on the subject, so he exculpated you, & did not even ask \ul how\ulnone  you voted, & I must tell you he wished the private relations formerly subsisting between you to continue just the same.\'a0 He says though he sent in his resignation, as the time for his engagement had expired, which was until the Election took place, he would continue to assist Mr. Leary until the vacation, but it would be a Jubilee to him when he gave up; for the boys were so bad. I would be shocked if I took a peep in at them; & he himself would never send a son to the Academy, where there was such a mixture that one boy came into his presence smoking a Cigar, one of them wrote a most insulting composition, & if he whipped the parent complained & if he did not they complained.\'a0 He will commence a school on his own account.\'a0 He did not know how he would succeed.\'a0 I listened very patiently.\'a0 I thought I might easily have explained his disappointment, by telling him, those very Trustees who had promised him the Female Academy had since found he was incompetent to the chrnge & therefore would not vote for him.\'a0\'a0Last evening Susan Hoke came over & spent with me.\'a0 This morning Mrs. Pearson paid me a visit.\'a0 She says she wishes to see you as soon as you return, that she has received a letter from Florida, & wishes you to attend to, or look over some papers.\'a0 She says Dr. Simons met her Father & spoke to him about his treatment & abused Mr. Beattie a great deal.\'a0 She says Mr. Moore was boarding at the house where Miss Trott was, with her Grandmother. & the Grandmother was always telling him, he had talents that would not be appreciated in the Country.\'a0 He ought to live in the City, & so he thought he would marry the Granddaughter & live in the City & let the Grandmother support him.\'a0 Mr. Bradshaw she says is certainly going.\'a0 Since you left I had heard Mr. Waddil would not let him.\'a0 Mr. Smith who applied for this school, had also applied for the one Mr. Bradshaw is now going to take charge of, & he says it is one of the most desirable in the Southern Country; that the Music Teacher is paid one thousand dollars a year.\'a0 Mr. Bradshaw will have a good opportunity of pocketing there.\'a0 He says he will pay the money he owes the church in 6 months after he leaves here. Reuben & Charles are sowing the Wheat.\'a0 Mr. Moore was here a little while ago, & says he has brought the Wheat to the Mill.\'a0 Mr. Slatton engaged you, & kindly is now cleaning two barrels to carry down for it.\'a0 Mrs. Pearson says it is scarce & dear.\'a0 Except to church, I have not been out I was going to say, but I forgot, Monday morning only I went to the Genl to see Mrs. McConnell & Miss Goodlett & went to see Mrs. Westfield & Mrs. Watson.\'a0 The latter lady told me she heard Mrs. Dr. Butler had lost her young daughter, but I think this must be a mistake.\'a0 Lucinda got a letter from Bob Sunday night.\'a0 He said he could not endure the treatment of his owners, so he left them & 4 days after he was taken by a gentleman, to whom he now belonged & liked very much, & he expected now to get a letter from Dr. Butler, so I suppose the gentleman has offered to purchase him, but I expect Mrs. Butler\'a0 will wish to get possession of him to vent her anger on him, but I hope not.\'a0 We have been reading a little book of Mamma\'92s called \'93Home\'94 by Mrs. Sedgewick.\'a0 It is most excellent.\'a0 I wish I would be such a Mother & Wife as is there described.\'a0 I would like you to read it.\'a0 Mrs. Daniel Ravenel gave it to Mamma.\'a0 I have written in a great hurry, have no time or room at\'85to tell you how much I \ul love\ulnone  you, & \ul miss\ulnone  you.\'a0 I hope you will come back with some notes.\'a0 I do not care for money which is soon spent.\'a0 I wish you to accumulate notes for our future benefit.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 The weather pleasant.\'a0 A Miss Wynn came over yesterday to see me with Caroline Horton. She lives 12 miles from here is Anderson District, & says her Father is a great friend of yours. She had heard so much of my house, she wished to see it.\'a0 Mrs. Pearson says all who come to see me speak in praise of the house.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mr. Elford called this afternoon, to say he was to leave tomorrow for Columbia, & would take any letter or package I had for you.\'a0 I avail myself of the opportunity to send \ul both\ulnone , for I have a pr ofto, you had better get him some new ones to you, so I send them now, with a Shoe to have them made the size of.\'a0 1.25 is what they used to ask, even for yours, which are so large.\'a0 Perhaps the men will make them for less.\'a0 I am very fond of these kind of Shoes, & I have just worn out a pr, & wish these to supply their place. I am writing sooner than I expected to, & had not supplied myself with writing materials.\'a0 This accounts for my blotted paper, the only sheet in the desk, & there is hardly any ink in the inkstand.\'a0 I have thought of Willie & yourself constantly since yesterday morning.\'a0 In the afternoon Anna went home with Fanny Town[e]s, so I have been unusually quiet & lonely.\'a0 Tomorrow afternoon Instead of going to church I will go for Anna.\'a0 She was delighted to go.\'a0 She is of a very social disposition.\'a0 Frank seems lost by himself.\'a0 He liked the girls school better than he expected, & went off willingly yesterday afternoon.\'a0 Fanny is very merry &\'85.\'a0 Last night I invited Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon to take tea.\'a0 They had told me they would come over one evening socially, & I thought I had better invite them at once.\'a0 We spent quite a pleasant evening, conversing, & looking at pictures & books.\'a0 Fanny was the life of the evening & very entertaining.\'a0 This morning Mamma Susan & Ann came in to shop & pay me a visit.\'a0 Mamma brought a kind letter she had received from Miss Drayton.\'a0 In it she mentioned that Paul Hayne had received\'a0 the Gold Medal as a reward for Elocution, & that she heard him speak, & he well deserved it.\'a0 I saw also by last nights paper that he had received it.\'a0 I am glad, as it has gratified his Mother, I am sure & will be encouragement to him\'a0\'a0 Miss Drayton mentioned that Dr. Tiddyman had sent up trimmings for the altar & pulpit of the Episcopal Church, & wished to know if they had been received.\'a0 Said he was soon to cross the Atlantic.\'a0 She mentioned that her nephew & our cousin Wm Ford, had by collecting money for the Library society & in other ways doing business more efficient to reenter College \ul himself\ulnone .\'a0 He was a young man of talent, & highly thought of.\'a0 \'85his Uncle Tiddyman without denying himself in the least have \ul given\ulnone  him the money & educated him.\'a0 Some \ul abound\ulnone  with money, others have to \ul struggle\ulnone  for it, even to get an education.\'a0 I asked Mrs. Town[e]s to take tea with me this evening socially, but her baby was not well enough for her to come.\'a0 Reuben & Charles have been ploughing, & this afternoon Reuben cleaned the carri[a]ge. A man yesterday brought me your Office key, which I was very glad you sent.\'a0 I looked in the Drawer after you left, & not seeing it, knew you had carried it with you, & intended requesting you to send it back by some one, that I might have your office well cleaned. A letter came last night from Mr. Taylor, saying your writing to Nancy Saterfield had done good, for she had since called on him & promised to pay what she owed him, that if she did not he would let you know.\'a0Mrs. Kingsland has just sent me a Pumpkin pie & said if it was not Saturday night, she would come down & sit with me, & she sent word Mrs. Arthur had received the trimmings, & they would keep it for the new Church. You have now been two days in Columbia & seen of course a great many people.\'a0 I\'a0 am anxious to know how Willie gets on, whether he enjoys himself & whether you are able to manage his dressing, so as to make him appear to the \ul greatest\ulnone  \ul advantage\ulnone , the little minutia of combing & curling his hair well, turning down his Collar & Waistband neatly, arranging his Cravat, for by this time he has one.\'a0 All these little things are so important to the making a \ul neat\ulnone  appearance, & a Father \ul overlooks\ulnone , but a Mother attends to with \ul particularity\ulnone .\'a0 I wish Willie to look his \ul best\ulnone  now, for so many will see \ul him\ulnone , who know \ul me\ulnone , & I wish him to do credit to me & \ul what\ulnone  is more important, he must \ul behave\ulnone  himself so as to do credit to his parents; behave as his did on his \ul first\ulnone  visit to town,\'a0 when his fiends said , he committed not \ul one\ulnone  \ul impropriety\ulnone .\'a0 I hope to see him return improved in every respect, in character manners & appearance.\'a0 He is where he can profit more than here, running about the streets, & playing marbles with the W\'85, V\'85 &c, & it was to avoid the bad habits & manners contracted in such company that I wished him to go with you.\'a0 The \ul more\ulnone  he can be with you, the \ul better\ulnone  it will be for him.\'a0 If he is tired or gives you trouble, he can return with someone. But I hope you have found it pleasant to have him, & that he enjoys himself.\'a0 You have of course\'85your appearance before this.\'a0 I expect I would hardly know you if I were to see you now.\'a0 You were indeed getting quite shabby when you left.\'a0 If you can find clothes to fit Willie, you had better get him some new ones.\'a0 Except his Boston suit, he has never had any yet to set well on him.\'a0 In future I expect a Tailor will have to cut for him.\'a0 He will be obliged to get a cap or hat when he returns, so if you see pretty & reasonable ones supply him with that article at least, & get some fashionable covering for Franks head.\'a0 With regard to \ul my\ulnone  present, I wish to impress it on you, that I am not so \ul anxious\ulnone  for something warm, that you should get it, whether expensive pretty or not.\'a0 Miss Drayton & others say, that Charleston is overflowing with pretty & \ul reasonable\ulnone  of every description.\'a0 I would much rather always get what I wish in Charleston where there is a greater choice.\'a0 So if you do not see a Shawl\'85Mantilla or little Cloak or \ul whatever\ulnone  is worn both \ul reasonable\ulnone  & \ul pretty\ulnone  in Columbia, I beg you to get nothing for me.\'a0 I will wait until you return, & \ul then\ulnone  send to Charleston for something.\'a0 I wish something very pretty & reasonable too, & I am afraid, such cannot be got in Columbia, a place not calculated for either \ul fashion\ulnone  or \ul cheapness\ulnone .\'a0 Write me when you can, & when you cannot, tell Willie to, but his letters must not be too short.\'a0 Frank said I must be sure & tell you to buy him a drum or trumpet & ball & I don\'92t know what all.\'a0 Fanny talks of the Cocoa nut cake.\'a0 You supplied me so well with money, if yours gives out, you must write to me for some.\'a0 Tell Willie I hope to hear he has been a \ul good\ulnone  \ul boy\ulnone .\'a0 Perhaps I may not write again until I hear from you.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\

\cf0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I write to you by Mr. Elford who left yesterday so I did not intend writing by tonights Mail, but I heard something today that worries me & until I communicate it to you I will not feel at ease, so I will send my letter by someone who is going in the Stage tonight.\'a0 Yesterday at the Church door, Mr. E\'85 Jones handed me out of the carri[a]ge, & he said he was obliged to go to Columbia, & was sorry he had not gone before the weather became bad.\'a0 Ann today said he was Candidate for Solicitor in place of Genl Whitner.\'a0 I hardly think he has the presumption to \ul oppose\ulnone  Genl Whitner, so the thought has struck me perhaps Genl Whitner is going to resign.\'a0 If so, \ul you\ulnone  are the one to take his place.\'a0 You once said Mr. Young would, but I wish \ul you\ulnone  to think of it, if Genl Whitner is \ul not\ulnone  a Candidate, for you \ul deserve\ulnone  the place, & it is a stepping stone to a seat on the bench, so if there are to be \ul new\ulnone  Candidates, do you think of it,\'a0 for as you are so well known to the Members you would stand a good chance; so I have now relieved myself, & if I had not I would not have slept well tonight, if I was worried & you are not here to console me, I am kept awake to recollect if Genl Whitner is going to give up, as I think he \ul must\ulnone  be, do \ul you\ulnone  offer, if you think you would be elected, & I \ul know\ulnone  you \ul would\ulnone  be.\'a0 I believe the Legislature would elect you to \ul anything\ulnone  you offered.\'a0 It is only the ignorant people that will not.\'a0 I long to hear how Willie is coming on.\'a0 I went for Anna yesterday at Mrs. Town[e]s.\'a0 She had spent her time quite pleasantly.\'a0 Mr. Town[e]s is going to spend the winter in Florida, & if his prospects are good, come back to his family in the Spring.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s says she is very lonely.\'a0 I went this evening with Mrs. Dr. Williams to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.\'a0 Anna Williams goes to Columbia in the Stage tonight, to take in work, & improve herself, as a Mantua Maker.\'a0 She says she is poor, & has her children to support & educate, & must do something to enable her to.\'a0 Dr. Irvine also goes, by whom I will send this letter.\'a0 Mamma Susan & Ann paid me a visit today.\'a0 I expect they will dine with me Wednesday.\'a0 The horses will go on ploughing tomorrow.\'a0 It rained yesterday afternoon & last night.\'a0 The household are all well.\'a0 Miss Vance is to be married Thursday night.\'a0 I repeat if you do not see anything you think I will like as a warm covering for the Winter as a Shawl\'85or so forth, do not get me \ul anything\ulnone .\'a0 Frank goes to school & makes no objection.\'a0 No letters came for you last night.\'a0 Tell Willie I hope he has been a good boy, & I am anxiously waiting for a letter from him.\'a0 I wrote today to Eliza & told her Willie had gone with you.\'a0 I must now close so as to send my letter to Dr. Jones before he goes to bed.\'a0 Yours affectionately, E.F.P. P.S. Get Willie all that is necessary to make him look genteel.\'a0 I expect to see you quite renovated.\'a0 I always wished you to be Solicitor, when Genl Whitner gave up.\'a0 You deserve it, & then the salary the Solicitor gets every year, for going to Columbia is somet[h]ing, & now Law business is getting scarce, you ought to think of something\'a0 to add to your income.\'a0 I think there must be some mistake, if Genl. Whitner has no intention of giving up, but if he has, no doubt Mr. Jones would be a Candidate.\

\cf0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I expect mamma, Susan & Ann to dine here today.\'a0 I have got everything ready for them, & until they come will employ my time writing to you.\'a0 I may not be able to write a \ul long\ulnone \'a0 letter.\'a0 I am anxiously looking forward to the Mails arrival tonight, bringing me a letter.\'a0 Today is rather cold, so as a good many persons are killing hogs.\'a0 Reuben & Charles have killed 5.\'a0 They intended killing all, but I think it is not cold enough at all.\'a0 Mr. Hoke is not killing & came over yesterday to say \ul we\ulnone  had better not; afterwards Reuben said, he told him he \ul might\ulnone . But I know from his not killing himself, he does not think it cold enough so after killing five, I told Charles he had better not kill any more, but as soon as the weather gets a little colder, they will finish with the others, for it is better not to run a risk with all.\'a0 I would have preferred not killing at all today, because it is not as cold weather as we generally kill in, but the servants were so anxious to kill, that they would not wait. I was trying to pass my time pleasantly in your absence, so last night I invited Mrs. Kingsland & her Sister & the family generally to take tea with me.\'a0 Mrs. Kingsland her Sister & the children came & we spent a very pleasant evening.\'a0 Mr. Kingsland came for them, & was quite agreeable.\'a0 We looked at the books, pictures, &c.\'a0 Fanny Town[e]s slept with Anna last night.\'a0 Fanny this morning after she was dressed sat on the floor, & after looking quite sad, said, \'93I wasn\'92t to see Pa, Ma.\'94\'a0 She talks often of you & if anyone offends her, says I wont give you any cake Pa brings me.\'a0 She is now in the Piazza talking to herself, is playing with the Waiters I think, & every now & then saying \'93you wont do so any more?\'94\'a0 She can amuse herself with any thing.\'a0 I hear her now carrying on a conversation, with whatever she is playing with. No more letters have come for you.\'a0 I suppose persons know you are away.\'a0 Only the Charleston paper came last night.\'a0 Jim is a shabby fellow.\'a0 I sent word to Betsey his Wife, to tell him to come to me.\'a0 She sent word she did not expect to see him.\'a0 He did not come \ul near\ulnone  \ul her\ulnone .\'a0 He has not been to see her since she returned, & last Sunday told Mr. Arthurs servant, who works at Mr. Rosemonds to stop for 25 cts I owed him; said he had hurt his \ul feet\ulnone , & could not come in.\'a0 I expect he supplied Betseys place, while she was away, & does not care now to see her. Anna & Frank are at school.\'a0 Frank likes going very well.\'a0 I am wondering how Willie is coming on, & whether he passes his time pleasantly.\'a0 It is certainly more improving than to be at home running about the streets.\'a0 He will be more manly going about with you.\'a0 I hope he is a good boy.\'a0 You were wondering who Mr. Hopkins purchased his place from.\'a0 It was one of Pink Hawkins\'92 places, called the Dozier place.\'a0 He gave I believe 800 dollars for it.\'a0 Mr. Beattie purchased the McClanahan place & Mr. Farr the home place.\'a0 Mrs. Hopkins Father wishes to purchase a place also, would like the place Mr. Beattie bought, as it joins Mr. Hopkins.\'a0 Dr. Simons I have not heard anything of lately.\'a0 I\'85say his school will succeed at first, as a new thing is apt to up here, but as he himself is so unsteady, I hope it will not last, & Mr. Stuart must not be discouraged, if Dr. Simons does for a while get a good many scholars.\'a0 Mr. Erwin wishes to rent Dr. Austins house & take boarders as well as assist Mr. Leary. Before this I suppose you have seen Mr. Jones.\'a0 I am anxious to know, whether he is a candidate for Solicitor.\'a0 I expect next year he will be Candidate for Governor, & in three years for President.\'a0 If Genl Whitner is going to give up his Office, \ul you\ulnone  must think of it.\'a0 You are more entitled to it, than any other Lawyer on the Circuit, & whenever he \ul does\ulnone  give up, \ul you\ulnone  must take the place.\'a0 He has seemed for some time to be so unwell, & take so little interest in his profession, that it seems likely he intends to resign, & Mr. Jones is aware of it.\'a0 It is really\'85to think of being \ul Solicitor\ulnone , when he cannot issue a \ul Writ\ulnone ; he certainly is ignorant of his \ul real\ulnone  worth.\'a0 He is like the ignorant man, Mr. Arthur mentioned in his last sermon, who knew so \ul little\ulnone , but his \ul ignorance\ulnone  made him think he \ul knew\ulnone  \ul everything\ulnone , whereas the \ul wise\ulnone  man, knowing how \ul much\ulnone  in reality he was ignorant of, felt \ul humble\ulnone  & \ul diffident\ulnone .\'a0 I am anxious to know if Mr. Jones really is a Candidate for Solicitor, it must be a mistake. Our household are well.\'a0 I have very little to write you about.\'a0 I will try & go see Evel\'85 Foster , who was married last night, if she does not leave too soon.\'a0I must now close, with love to Willie & yourself.\'a0 Yours affectionately, E.F.P. P.S. You must try & get the place for Mr. Markleys son. Since finishing my letter I have seen Charles & he says he has killed \ul all\ulnone  the hogs.\'a0 Susan is now here, & says Mr. Luther says it is the right weather to kill, that his Father & a great many are killing today, that though it is not \ul very \ulnone cold still this kind of weather will continue.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I ought not to write to you today, for I have now written you \ul three\ulnone  letters, & received \ul not\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  from you.\'a0 I have always said if I was \ul neglected\ulnone  by my husband, I would not bear it calmly & submissively, as some poor, weak spirited Wives do.\'a0 You will think now I am not putting my Theory into practice.\'a0 I assure you I only write because I am \ul certain\ulnone  \ul tonight\ulnone  I will hear, a most \ul justifiable\ulnone  excuse.\'a0 You are always so attentive in writing, that when I do not hear, I am sure it is \ul business \ulnone prevents you, & I am always pleased you should have just as much \ul business\ulnone  as \ul possible\ulnone  to occupy you.\'a0 I mentioned in my last that Mamma, Susan, Ann & the children were to dine with me that day.\'a0 Mr. McBee I invited but he was busy assisting in the Hog killing at his fathers, so did not come.\'a0 We spent a pleasant day.\'a0 Yesterday after breakfast, I was surprised by a visit from Clarke & Harriet Perry.\'a0 They came to Eveline Fosters wedding.\'a0 They dined here.\'a0 I asked them to pass the night, but they said they had promised to return to Mr. Fosters, & were to leave for home this morning by the way of Mr. Hunts, where they would sleep tonight.\'a0 Clarke regretted you were not at home.\'a0 He walked to the Mill, & the Village & Harriet walked over the house, & I entertained her as well as I could.\'a0 I thought they were going to pass the night & ordered the carri[a]ge to carry her to ride, but they said they could not stay.\'a0 So I carried Mrs. Forbes to Mr. Colemans place.\'a0 Mr. Powell is painting the house Straw colour, & it looks much prettier than ours.\'a0 The colour of our house is entirely too \ul deep\ulnone .\'a0 I am longing for it to fade.\'a0 Eveline left for Abbeville yesterday.\'a0 She had a small wedding. Principally the family, & the persons Dr. Cox brought with him from Abbeville.\'a0 She is just 15, he about 21.\'a0 Miss Vance was married last night; only the connexions of the parties were invited.\'a0 Mrs. Dr. Williams says Mr. Dubose came here last summer in search of a Wife; at Mrs. Brooks he saw Miss Vance.\'a0 Miss Ann Anderson came to see me yesterday.\'a0 She says Mrs. Stuart the Wife of the Teacher of the Academy, is a very plane lady in \ul appearance \ulnone quite a contrast to her husband, & \ul quiet\ulnone  in manners, that they have been married
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super  
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub several years, & lost one child, that Mr. Stuart has taught in her brothers family. & was once private Tutor in the Rutledge family in Statesburg, & gave private lessons to young ladies, at the same time that he kept a school for boys.\'a0 Dr. Simons has five borders engaged to him & some scholars I am afraid his\'85will take, particularly from his saying he would be cheaper than any other. I gave you wrong information about your Hogs.\'a0 First I said they had killed only 5, & afterwards said they had killed \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 I misunderstood, Reuben says they killed 9, & left 4 which had been injured by fighting &c to be killed at a future time.\'a0 The weather still continues cold enough to be safe.\'a0 They are going on with the ploughing today.\'a0 It does seem a pity to put such fine horses in the plough.\'a0 You must get a Mule.\'a0 I have heard Mrs. Sam Earle was coming on with Mr. Earle to be with Dr. T\'85 in her confinement.\'a0Mamma paid a visit to Mrs. Rowland lately & heard the other side of the quarrel, & it really seems from Mrs. Rowlands representation that she is not at all to blame.\'a0 She says she is not as well off as persons think, & her son John left his property to her on that account, & on his death bed wished he had more to leave her; that at her death, she intended leaving it to his Sisters, but that Mr. Beattie & themselves made so much fuss about it,\'a0 that her son Tom & Mrs. Henry Earle begged her to give it up at once to them, & they would return her what she had given them; that she had given it up now, & was so straightened, she intended to sell her place, & move to another place she owned 20 miles in the Country, that she had worked hard to give her children a good education & a start in life, & this was her return, that\'85Speers she always liked, but Mrs. Speers would not let her give anything.\'a0 What she gave Mrs. Speers had settled on herself.\'a0 She said a good deal more, & cried bitterly, & said the ungrateful conduct of her children was the greatest affliction she had ever met with. Ann received by the last Mail a pleasant letter from Paul.\'a0 In it he says that he had that morning seen Alston Hayne, who had lately returned from Philadelphia, that Alston inquired particularly about us all, & had a \ul high\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  of \ul your\ulnone  \ul abilities\ulnone , & \ul regretted\ulnone  your non election to Congress, (& which I will never cease to regret)[.] We are all well.\'a0 Anna & Frank are at school.\'a0 I think Frank finds it much pleasanter at Mr. Beads\'85, than he did at Dr. Simons school.\'a0 He had no dread of\'85now.\'a0 Fanny is playing about, & still talks about you, & Billy in Lumbia.\'a0 She is as\'85as ever & as interesting.\'a0 Since sleeping at Fanny Town[e]s & bringing her home to sleep with her, the very next day when she came from school, said Fanny Town[e]s had quarreled with her.\'a0 Anna had taken a tuck out of her dress, which made it quite long , & Fanny Town[e]s told her, her dress was too long.\'a0 Anna replied, that she dressed as her Mamma wished her, & so Fanny got miffed & left her seat at the desk with Anna, & would not speak to her, & Mary Croft who had quarreled with her companion, left her desk & came & sat with Anna.\'a0 I have not asked whether the quarrel was made up yet.\'a0Yesterday as I was riding, I saw Judge Moore walking with a lady.\'a0 I could not see the ladys face well as she had on a sun bonnet. Our dining room now looks very comfortable.\'a0 I have shut up one of the doors by the Sideboard & removed the Table in that direction, & a little in \ul front\ulnone  of where the Table was, put the Sofa, the one Jim made.\'a0 Mamma & my Sisters think it the sweetest little Sofa they ever saw, & now that E\'85 has altered the Cover, & made it right, it does look very comfortable.\'a0 Mr. Rosemond came here yesterday. He measured the distance for the Fence, & will send a bill of what it will cost.\'a0 I believe I have nothing more to tell you.\'a0 Mamma desired their love to you when I wrote.\'a0 Mrs. Hokes family are to take tea with me this evening.\'a0 Tell Willie he does not know how anxious I am to know how he is getting on.\'a0 I hope to hear a good account of him, & that he will return quite a man, & never quarrel with his brother & sisters again.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P. P.S. I have a shocking pen, & do not want to trouble Mr. N\'85 very often to mend it.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just finished reading Willie\'92s letter; yours to me, & yours to Mr. Wells, the \ul letter\ulnone  Mr. Wells I am sure will think entirely too long.\'a0 It is now 8 oclock, too late to commence writing, but I am more at leisure now, than I will be tomorrow.\'a0 Tell Willie his letter is a very pretty one, & I value it, because it was written entirely by himself.\'a0 You must make him write me a little \ul every\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone , telling \ul all\ulnone  that he has \ul seen\ulnone  & \ul done\ulnone , & in this way, have a \ul long\ulnone  \ul letter\ulnone  to send me by each Mail, & your must also write, for never mind how much business you have in the day, at night before retiring to bed, you can write me a letter, you write so \ul quickly\ulnone .\'a0 I look forward anxiously to the arrival of this Mail, & you cannot imagine my disappointment, if I do not have.\'a0 I was very much provoked Friday night when Mrs. Irvine\'85me my letter.\'a0 Dr. Irvine had written to tell her where it was.\'a0 The reason of my writing by him was this.\'a0 As I had written by Mr. Elford, I did not intend writing by the next Mail, which would arrive on the evening after him, but I heard some news about Mr. Jones which worried me, & to relieve my mind, I wished instantly to impart it to you.\'a0 The Mail had closed so I sent to the Stage Office to inquire who was going.\'a0 They sent word Dr. Irvine & Mrs. Anna Williams, so I sent my letter to Dr. Irvine.\'a0 I will send it along with this one.\'a0 I have not read it over, but I wish you to know why I wrote about Mr. Jones, which will explain what I alluded to\'a0 in my next letter.\'a0 I was sorry & provoked at what you told me of Isaac Hayne as it showed such a \ul mean\ulnone  \ul spirit\ulnone .\'a0 He no doubt has not got over the prejudice he contracted against you\'a0 during political times, though self interest made him forget it last winter, & though you have married into the \ul Hayne\ulnone  \ul family\ulnone , \ul his\ulnone  \ul branch\ulnone  is not nearly connected with ours, & it was only our being \ul brought\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  with his Sisters that made us intimate.\'a0 \ul He\ulnone  is a S\ul tranger\ulnone  to me, & therefore he feels no interest, (though perhaps he ought to) in you on my account; & I must say that all of Uncle Haynes \ul first\ulnone  children as they have grown up & settled in life, have proved themselves \ul utterly \ulnone \'a0\ul selfish\ulnone  & \ul ungrateful \ulnone & indifferent to all but themselves & families.\'a0 They were indebted to Mamma for a home, when they \ul needed\ulnone  one, & no one else offered.\'a0 Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor & ourselves were like Sisters, but now the only times I have seen them for years, they have been so \ul cold\ulnone  & \ul selfish\ulnone  & \ul indifferent\ulnone , that I have lost all respect for them, & would expect more from a\ul  Stranger\ulnone  than from them.\'a0 Isaac Hayne I suppose is just like them, & he can hardly have lived with his \ul Wife\ulnone  without having contracted her bad qualities.\'a0 She is proud, sarcastic, \ul selfish\ulnone  in the \ul extreme\ulnone , the \ul spoiled\ulnone  \ul favorite\ulnone  of her Mother, & never regarded anyone of importance but herself, & now only those nearly connected with her.\'a0 But in spite of all of this, I was going to say, that perhaps \ul your\ulnone  \ul manner\ulnone  towards Isaac Hayne was not cordial, & he may have perceived it, & made his less so, for you have though unconscious to yourself, often a \ul cold\ulnone  forbidding manner, not sociable enough, & you know in your Elections your manner has always been objected to , & has made you enemies.\'a0 I am glad in your last letter, that you say Mr. Haynes manner is more cordial, for if possible, I wish you to be friends, & persons often dislike one another from not knowing each other personally, & if they would be\'85to be familiar & pleasant towards each other, would respect & like each other, so do you in your manner be \ul cordial\ulnone  when you meet.\'a0 You can soon see whether he reciprocates.\'a0 What you mentioned about your being thought of as Governor, I know you meant only as a joke.\'a0 I am certain the legislature would give you any Office you applied for, & though you are not lowered in my opinion by your late defeat, in the eyes of others you are.\'a0 A defeated man seems like a fallen man, until he is elected to some equally honorable station as the one he strived for.\'a0 So I say my dear husband, let your friends or do you get some friend to bring your name forward for Governor.\'a0 The Upper Country ought to have the next one, & if you come forward in time, you will be sure to be elected, & then I will be reconciled to my late great disappointment, but until you succeed\'a0 in gaining some distinction of this kind, I never will get over it.\'a0 I am surprised at so many Upper Country members going for the Bank.\'a0 I thought you had the popular view, & felt easy.\'a0 I am afraid now you are on the unpopular; not that I wish you to change, but I had felt so\'85on the subject, thinking the Majority were with you.\'a0 I am sorry you have so little money.\'a0 You ought not to have changed your pencil, & given with an exorbitant boot, for your pencil was a superior one.\'a0 You ought to have given it to me, & changed mine.\'a0 After getting me something warm, only get some Cocoa nut cakes for the children, that will please them as much as anything.\'a0 Toys they instantly break.\'a0 I will send by this Mail a letter Anna wrote you this morning, her first letter & she is just 8.\'a0 From the way she holds her pen & forms her letters, I can tell that she has been carelessly instructed in writing.\'a0 Indeed the Academys have had poor Teachers.\'a0 I am so vexed with Dr. Simons.\'a0 I wish he would be\'85, does not you quick sense tell you that Mr. Stuart has seen his \ul extravagant\ulnone  \ul puff\ulnone , & it is \ul this\ulnone  that has made his resign.\'a0 He is a gentleman & does not wish to be involved in squabbles with opposition schools.\'a0 You know he said that he would not apply for the Academy, if Mr. Bradshaw intended remaining & setting up a school in opposition.\'a0 His wifes health is only an \ul excuse\ulnone .\'a0 It was expressly on account of health he was coming here.\'a0 I would not be surprised if Dr. Simons in his mean]n]ess had written to tell him, he himself expected to have a flourishing school.\'a0 I am sure he has injured Greenville enough already, deprived the Academy of a fine Teacher, & the Church of a delightful Organist.\'a0 I anticipated much pleasure hearing Mrs. Stuart play.\'a0 I wish you to write to him, & persuade him to accept. If his Wife is in bad health, Greenville is the very place to come to.\'a0 You may be sure that is not the reason at all.\'a0 \ul Dr. \ulnone \'a0\ul Simons\ulnone  \ul is\ulnone .\'a0 You know what Machivelli says.\'a0 It has been raining all day & I was afraid it was getting too warm for our meat, but it is now getting \ul very\ulnone  \ul cold\ulnone .\'a0 The Shelter for the Cows fell down yesterday, & for fear the Stable might follow suit, Reuben at present has our horses in Mr. Goodletts Stable.\'a0 They are locked up carefully.\'a0 In this wet weather, he says there is more danger of the Stable falling than in dry.\'a0 Jim was here last night, &\'85he did not know where his Wife was staying, said \ul he\ulnone  knew what had occurred between them, & it was best for him to keep away.\'a0 He says Mr. Rosemond will have some large jobs next year, & he thinks finds him so useful, will give good wages for him\'a0 I think he will for Jim is a good carpenter & must be great help.\'a0 I have been reading today Lectures on Bunyan & the Pilgrims Progress, lent me by Mrs. Pearson, a very good work, though severe against \ul Churchmen\ulnone .\'a0 It is written I think by a Presbyterian.\'a0 Bunyan was an open Communion Baptist, & was imprisoned 12 years during Charles 2d reign on account of his non conformity to the established Church, & in prison wrote the Pilgrims Progress.\'a0 I have read also to Anna & Frank, & Fanny took up a book & thought she was reading too.\'a0 She is the smartest & most interesting child I ever saw.\'a0 Tell Willie I am very much pleased at his letter, & would write to him by this Mail, if it was not that 3 letters are ready to go.\'a0 Do send me your letters to read first, that are written for the Mountaineer.\'a0 I enjoy them more, than when I see them in the paper.\'a0 The last paper I have not even sent for, but will tomorrow, when I send your letter.\'a0 You must write good letters, & not get into trouble by them.\'a0 The one tonight I liked, but I think you might have condensed it more.\'a0 You must think of some honor to gain from the Legislature.\'a0 In Mr. Calhouns Congressional District I am afraid you can never gain anything.\'a0 I [am] thankful at any rate you are in the Legislature, some field for your talents. I see Mr. Whitt\'85 compliments you.\'a0 You must subscribe for his Wifes poetry.\'a0 You must continue in the Legislature if you cannot do anything more, but you must think of being Governor.\

Dear Willie\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote to Papa last night, & have sent the letter to the Post office, along with the one Dr. Irvine ought to have carried & also one Anna wrote yesterday.\'a0 As so many letters were going by this Mail, I thought I would write to you by the \ul next\ulnone , but today I find I have so much to say, I feel I must write.\'a0 I am so much alone, I get thinking, & having no one to express my thoughts to. I am obliged to write.\'a0 I was very glad to receive your letter.\'a0 You must write often & tell me everything you see & what persons you see, & how you enjoy yourself.\'a0 I think you must be passing your time quite pleasantly.\'a0 You have set the fashion for little boys going with their Fathers to Columbia.\'a0 It will be followed.\'a0 Ann\'85 says Mr. Jones perhaps will take his son & Col. Town[e]s Alex the next time.\'a0 I would not send a son younger than you are.\'a0 You are just old enough to take care of yourself, & notice things & improve from associating with gentlemen.\'a0 I am glad you have new clothes.\'a0 I have always preferred a round Jacket to a Frock coat.\'a0 I have never seen you in a Coat, so cannot imagine how you look.\'a0 You must be a good boy.\'a0 Papa has done so much for you to make you happy.\'a0 Anna says she wishes to read your books.\'a0 Papa must not\'a0 bring many presents to the Children, for he will need all his money to pay your board, & to give you to spend in other ways.\'a0 12 numbers of the Lady\'92s book for 1849 have come.\'a0 Mr. Godey wrote word those were all he had, that he would get two bound volumes of the years previous at a high price 5 dollars a peice, & if Papa wanted them, he would have to send 5 dollars more.\'a0 Frank & Anna carried their dinner today.\'a0 It is so wet, so I have only Fanny at home.\'a0 Frank dreams of you every night; says he dreamt last night you had grown so big.\'a0 I expect he saw you in your new suit.\'a0 Have you new pantaloons & waistcoat? as well as Coat.\'a0 I hope you read in your little Testament every day, & say your prayers, & that you clean your teeth. & have your face & hands washed very nicely.\'a0 I am glad you behave like a little man.\'a0 Today I suppose you are at the College Commencement.\'a0 When you are graduating, I will go to Columbia to hear you speak.\'a0 Perhaps Papa will carry Frank next Spring.\'a0 I sent word to Poinsett Wells that you had bought him a knife.\'a0 I send in this letter a 2 dollar bill, which Papa must keep, & out of it pay 1 dollar or 1.25 for my shoes.\'a0 I send it because as Papa has not much money I would rather pay for the Shoes out of what he left me.\'a0 Mr. Leary I believe\'a0 gives holiday next week.\'a0 I am so sorry Mr. Stuart is not coming.\'a0 I am certain Dr. Simons having set up an opposition school is the cause of his resigning.\'a0 Mr. Arthur has moved back to the Parsonage.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 Grandma says she can never love any grandchild as well as you, for she helped to take care of you, when you were a baby.\'a0 I wish you would pay a visit to Charleston.\'a0 You would stay with Aunt Eliza, but I expect Papa would hardly have the money now to let you go.\'a0 You have travelled a good deal for a little fellow like you.\'a0 Fanny talks often of \ul Billy\ulnone , & thought your letter was written to her.\'a0 She has put it away in a corner, & will not let me have it.\'a0 Your affectionate Mama, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You will think I am in a writing humour, but really having no one to talk to, it is a relief to write, having written so much by this Mail.\'a0 Unless I have any particular thing to relate, I may not write by the next Mail.\'a0 I sent your letter this morning to Mr. Wells.\'a0 If you continue to write, be careful in all you say, & not get into any trouble, & write good letters.\'a0 I am quite worried about the Bank question.\'a0 You say it is such an important question.\'a0 I hope you understand it well & are on the right side.\'a0 I am staggered when I hear of Col. Irby, Mr. Henry, & so many intelligent upcountry gentlemen going for it, & am surprised that 3 members from Greenville should.\'a0 I had thought the very name of B\'85 was odious to the Upper Country, but it seems so many of them are in favour of it, as in the Lower.\'a0 So examine the subject & be sure you are \ul right\ulnone .\'a0 You cannot think how sorry I am at Mr. Stuarts resignation, & am particularly provoked\'a0 with Dr. Simons, who I feel certain is the cause, & to think such an Organist we have lost.\'a0 I wish you would write to him & tell him his Wifes health would improve in Greenville.\'a0 I am very sorry you did not carry my pencil case down, & exchange it instead of yours.\'a0 I suppose you could have exchanged it on the same terms, & yours was a superior English one, which I would like to have had.\'a0 You blame others for fickleness, & liking to change, but you are very fond of changing all you have yourself.\'a0 Some of the servants say, they hear Mr. & Mrs. Sam Earle are here.\'a0 I do not know but as tomorrow is the \ul Sale\ulnone , suppose he at least is.\'a0 Mr. Moore was here, not his Wife, the lady with him was Miss Thurston. Send your letters to me to read, if you write any to Mr. Wells, I have not looked at the last Mountaineer yet.\'a0 I would rather read your letters in manuscript.\'a0 They give me more pleasure there.\'a0\'a0\'a0 The B\'85 Office Reports, & a book on Mexico & California with a map.\'a0 I have written Willie about the Lady\'92s books.\'a0 There are two or three pretty pictures in each number.\'a0 The rest are woodcuts.\'a0 I believe I have said all I had to say.\'a0 I only feel\'85that the majority of the people are for the Bank, & I am sorry if you are on the unpopular side, & as Mr. Elmore thinks it is so important that you should go for the Bank so\'85to us, you ought to examine the subject well.\'a0 I do not mean to interfere.\'a0 I only tell\'a0 my \ul thoughts\ulnone .\'a0 You must speak well & distinguish yourself as you have hitherto done.\'a0 I wish I could be seated in the Gallery by Willie listening to you.\'a0 Before next winter we will perhaps get a new carri[a]ge, & I can go down for part of the Session, & hear you, if you are still in the Legislature, but I believe it is so cold now, I will prefer going in the Spring, if ever I do go.\'a0 I will go to see \ul you\ulnone  \ul inaugurated\ulnone .\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P. Col. Ware is so politic.\'a0 What makes him go \ul for\ulnone  the \ul bank\ulnone .\'a0 He keeps very quiet.\'a0 He does not distinguish himself, but he gets along easily with all parties, & so finds no difficulty in being elected.\'a0 If nothing better offers, in two years, you must have your place back again, that he now has.\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Though I have nothing very particular to write about, as you may be disappointed if you do not hear, I will write you again.\'a0 I expect you were \ul surprised\ulnone  by the last Mail.\'a0 I have just returned from carrying Mrs. Forbes to ride to Mr. Lowndes.\'a0 The view is prettier than I ever saw it.\'a0 The whole village & all the settlements about can be seen.\'a0 I told Mrs. Forbes Mr. Stuart had resigned, & she said; so Mrs. Durb\'85 said, & with what spirit he had acted; that she understood when he went home. & began to consider the manner in which he had been elected, & how \ul badly\ulnone  Dr. Simons had been treated by the Trustees, particularly how a \ul Committee\ulnone  had acted, he determined to resign.\'a0 Did you ever hear such a story, & yet there may be truth in it.\'a0 You may depend on it.\'a0 Dr. Simons has had some understanding with him.\'a0 He has written to him & given him a Statement of his treatment.\'a0 Mrs. Forbes said she heard Mr. Stuart was elected on account of his being rich, that he had plenty of negroes to bring along with him.\'a0 All this I suppose has come from Dr. Simons, & if he has not written to Mr. Stuart, at any rate these are the reasons he gives for Mr. Stuarts resignation.\'a0 I begin to think it strange in Mr. Stuart to have resigned.\'a0 He had no right to, & it was no reason to give; his Wifes ill health, for I always understood he came here on account of health, that where he had been living was sickly.\'a0 Perhaps it will all be for the best; though on account of the Organ I will also regret his not coming.\'a0 Mr. Davis has been elected.\'a0 I hope he will be a good Teacher, for the children have been sadly neglected.\'a0 Dr. Simons acted outrageously.\'a0 I think Willie learned nothing with him.\'a0 Charlotte Smith told Miss Stuart; in Charleston he is thought \ul half\ulnone  \ul cracked\ulnone .\'a0 Yesterday was a gloomy day;\'a0 I sat down quite easy, though I would see no one all day.\'a0 Minerva & Mary had gone to the Spring to wash. Eliza was sick in bed, & Lindy was to be our Cook.\'a0 At 11 I heard a wrap at the door & to my surprise Miss Stuart & little Henry Thompson were there.\'a0 Miss Stuart said she was obliged to shop, & had come to my home as being more convenient to shop from, than Genl Thompsons.\'a0 I told her I was glad to have her, but she never would have found me more unprepared to entertain her well.\'a0 So she went to shop & I laid the table nicely & Lindy killed a fowl & fixed it, & we had a Fist, & with the help of raisons, Almonds, & sweetmeats, we did quite well. Poor Mr. Kinloch died this morning.\'a0 He has been ill a long time.\'a0 His Mother & his sister Mrs. Singleton, passed down some time ago from Flat Rock.\'a0 His cousin Mr. Middleton, Mrs. William Lowndes both staid with him to nurse him.\'a0 It seems so strange his mother did not come up to him.\'a0 He is an only son.\'a0 His parents have been separated for a long time.\'a0 When he was a little boy we used to see him in New Haven where he was going to school.\'a0 Mrs, Forbes says she has heard he was sent there to be away from his Father & as soon as he had finished school, was put in the Navy, & when he found out how his Father had been treated, & that he had been purposely kept away from him, he had a difference with his Mother on account of it.\'a0 So I suppose this is the reason his Mother has not been with him.\'a0 I expect he had great feeling.\'a0 He died of an affection of the heart.\'a0 The funeral takes place tomorrow morning at the Mansion House.\'a0 The father I believe is in the Asylum at Columbia.\'a0 His Mother is a sister of Mrs. Aiken.\'a0 I sent to Mrs. Hoke to know who bought Mr. Ed Earles place, thinking you would wish to know, & she sent word Mr. Sam Earle, & that he gave 12,100 dollars for it.\'a0 I believe it is a \ul mistake\ulnone , Mrs. Sam Earle being here.\'a0 I have not heard anything about him except that he was here.\'a0 We have cold weather, so the hogs were killed at a very good time.\'a0 We are all well except Eliza, who has been in bed for 3 days with pain in her side,\'a0 She is better & thinks she will be up tomorrow. I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0 It is a great disappointment when I do not hear. Tomorrow night there is to be a Cotillion party given as a farewell compliment to Mary Bradshaw & her sister.\'a0 Frank goes cheerfully to school, & is learning to read.\'a0 Fanny is my little companion, & all I can say of her is, she is as sweet & amusing as ever. I paid Mr. Miller for the Potatoes & bought some more.\'a0 Reuben & Charles ploughed yesterday, & are to plough this afternoon.\'a0 I hope soon to get a long letter from Willie, & to hear good accounts of him.\'a0 He attended Commencement I suppose, & perhaps Commencement Ball.\'a0 I will now bid you adieu with love to Willie.\'a0 Yours affectionately, E.F.P. P.S. Willie said Aunt Eliza wrote a note to you asking you to send him to town.\'a0 Did you answer it.\'a0 I wish he could go.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you the last Mail & it gave me great pleasure.\'a0 I am glad cousin Isaac Hayne is more cordial.\'a0 I expect his coldness at first was owing to your manner, & as I wish you to be on good terms, you must return his visit & take Willie with you.\'a0 Mr. Heyward, is Nat Heyward, who we were intimate with at New Haven, & who liked \ul me\ulnone  particularly.\'a0 He is a cousin of ours.\'a0 His Mother was a Miss Barnwell.\'a0 You must be very polite to him, for our sake.\'a0 I am gratified to hear how well Willie behaves.\'a0 Mamma is afraid he looks too much like a man with his frock coat & cravat.\'a0 I hope his coat is a \ul Sack\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad you have fitted up yourself well in Clothes, for you \ul needed\ulnone  them, & it gives me pleasure\'a0 to see you well dressed.\'a0 I think married persons ought to dress better after marriage than they did before,\'a0 They ought to appear as comely as possible to each other.\'a0 They have then \ul one\ulnone  \ul person\ulnone  at \ul least\ulnone  to please, before they had \ul no\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  in particular.\'a0 Susan now tells me that Mr. Jones mentioned she thinks in his correspondence to Mr. McBee, that probably in \ul two\ulnone  \ul years\ulnone  he will be Candidate for Solicitor, that Genl Whitner perhaps will not wish to be reelected & Mr. McBee mentioned it to her, as showing how conceited he was.\'a0 I heard it in t\ul his\ulnone  \ul manner\ulnone .\'a0 I said to Ann, Mr. Jones is going to Columbia, & she said yes.\'a0 He is a Candidate for Solicitor the office Genl Whitner has.\'a0 I felt certain Genl Whitner was going to resign so in two years, if you have been elected to nothing more lucrative or honorable \ul you\ulnone  must think of it, but in earnest I hope someone will bring you forward as Mr. Seabrook\'92s successor.\'a0 All have to convince themselves & do for themselves & if you give a hint to some friend, to propose you, you will be elected, for the Legislature can appreciate you more\'a0 than the people did, & of course give you whatever you asked for, & the Upper Country ought to share the honours equally with the Lower, & Greenville has not yet had that honour bestowed on her. Dr. Tiddyman has written word that the Rail Road \ul shall\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  pass through his land, but that he wil sell them his place at \ul 10,000\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone , & you know he thought he was \ul cheated\ulnone  when he gave \ul 7000\ulnone  for it.\'a0 What is the Law on the subject; cannot they have the right of way, whether he gives it or not?\'a0 How \ul illiberal\ulnone  he is.\'a0 I think he is a \ul mean\ulnone  old man.\'a0 Mr. Cox who gave a \ul high\ulnone  price for his place, I think it was 25,000 dollars, says he will sell his place for a Depot, for \ul 8000\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone . We attended Mr. Kinloch\'92s funeral yesterday at the Episcopal Church.\'a0 It was a \ul sad\ulnone  funeral, only 20 persons at it, & his cousin & \ul servant\ulnone  chef mourners.\'a0 I should think his Mother would never forgive herself, for not having been with her \ul only\ulnone  \ul son\ulnone , the \ul best\ulnone  of his name in his dying moments.\'a0 I hear he was a handsome, accomplished young man.\'a0 Every vehicle that stopped at the door, he would ask if his friends had come.\'a0 They were written for.\'a0 He afterwards felt better & came down into the Bar room, & so countermanded the order.\'a0 He rode out to try his strength, to see if he would bear the journey down, but found he could not, & became so much worse, that his friends were written for again, the\'85weeks he\'85down stairs, he was brought down a\'85; if he was sick enough to remain up here & his cousin obliged to remain with him, it shows that he needed his Mother, & if she had loved \ul him\ulnone  she would have been with him.\'a0 Mrs. Forbes says she has \ul heard\ulnone , he was \ul indignant\ulnone  at the treatment of his \ul Father\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Croft says his Father is not in the Asylum.\'a0 He saw him in Charleston when he was last there.\'a0 It is singular that at New Haven, we should meet with the little boy he was then, every day going to school. & here in Greenville, we should be brought in contact with him again but in so sad a way, Mrs. Sam Jones is in the Village today, so I invited her & Mrs. Town[e]s to come & take tea with me this evening, & invited Mrs. Elford also.\'a0 They are coming,\'a0 Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon are going to spend the \ul afternoon\ulnone  with me.\'a0 They are afraid to be out after dark, on account of the cold.\'a0 I have made some nice Jelly, & some Custard for them, & have sent to ask Mamma & Susan, family to come.\'a0 Anna last night took tea\'a0 with Fanny Town[e]s next door.\'a0 They are good friends again.\'a0 Miss McBee told Susan the other day, she was anxious to see her to tell what Mr. Bradshaw said of Anna.\'a0 He says, \ul Anna \ulnone is the \ul brightest\ulnone  \ul genius\ulnone  in his school.\'a0 She ought to be smart, if she takes after you, as you daughters do after Fathers.\'a0 I am willing \ul all\ulnone  should be like you.\'a0 Miss Stuart says Fannys face from her nose down is the express image of \ul yours\ulnone . Ann begs me to request you, to buy for her, a large box representing an \ul Apple\ulnone  such as you bought for her before.\'a0 You recollect it I suppose.\'a0 She will return the money.\'a0 As you are \ul Vardry\'92s\ulnone  \ul Godfather\ulnone  you must bring \ul him\ulnone  some \ul little\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone  to show you \ul think\ulnone  of him.\'a0 If you see nothing suitable or pretty or reasonable to buy for me, to wear this winter, I will \ul wait\ulnone  until you come back, & what money you can spare, send to town\'a0 & buy something there.\'a0 In Charleston they have a great variety & you can get an article for almost any price you choose.\'a0 In Columbia everything is dear & not such a variety as in Charleston.\'a0 So if you can get nothing for me you \ul like \ulnone I prefer waiting & sending to Charleston, when I am certain I can get something \ul pretty\ulnone  & \ul reasonable\ulnone . I wish you to do one thing in the Legislature, & that is make an alteration in the Court of Appeals.\'a0 Introduce a law to make the \ul lower\ulnone  country Lawyers try their Appeal cases in \ul Charleston\ulnone , when the Court sits \ul there\ulnone , & the Upper country Lawyers try \ul their\ulnone  \ul cases\ulnone  only in \ul Columbia\ulnone .\'a0 As it is \ul now\ulnone , the Lower Country has \ul more\ulnone  than she is entitled to, & the Upper Country \ul entirely\ulnone  \ul overlooked\ulnone  & \ul unjustly\ulnone  \ul treated\ulnone , The weather continues cold, so our meat is safe.\'a0 I see Dr. Irvine has returned.\'a0 What 3 votes did Mr. Walker get?\'a0 Perhaps it would have been best for \ul you\ulnone  to have voted for him, to have gained his \ul kind\ulnone  \ul feelings\ulnone .\'a0 You had best be \ul polite\ulnone  to Mr. Jones\'a0 Though he is so vain, how much \ul happier\ulnone  he is, than if he was \ul conscious\ulnone  of his \ul real\ulnone  \ul value\ulnone .\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 Mrs. Turpin came to see me yesterday.\'a0 Miss Vance is married & gone.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Reuben & Charles are ploughing.\'a0 I paid Mr. Slatton yesterday for Flour.\'a0 He says they marked it at the Mill, \ul Superior\ulnone .\'a0 Send pamphlets home to your constituents, such as Dr. Crook who once said you did not.\'a0 You must answer Aunt Eliza\'92s letter, & thank her for inviting Willie.\'a0 I wish he would go down & see his friends.\'a0 Has Judge Dunkin given you the money for Mrs. D\'92Oyley.\'a0\'a0 Col. Irv\'85 has gone to the West to sell a Drove of negroes, & while he is absent his Wife has gone home.\'a0 Caroline Earle went with her.\'a0 What an uninteresting employment he has.\'a0 Examine all subjects brought before the Legislature well, always be sure you are on the right side, & I hope it will happen aways to be on the popular side.\'a0 Give our love to Willie.\'a0 Grandma & all send love.\'a0 I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is just 8 oclock, so I will spend one hour in writing to you.\'a0 I have read your letters to Anna & myself, & Willies letter to me, all of which have given me \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone .\'a0 This has been a rainy day, so we have not been to church.\'a0 I finished reading Lectures on the Pilgrims Progress lent me by Mrs. Pearson, & it is so interesting.\'a0 I wish \ul you \ulnone \'a0to read it when you return.\'a0 I read this morning in the Bible to Mary, Lindy, Charlotte, Sarah & the children,\'a0 & tonight until the Mail came I began the Pilgrims Progress to Mary & Lindy, explaining it as I read.\'a0 I am surprised you did not send a letter to Mr. Wells, for you would have had more to write about now, than at first, & the people like \ul news\ulnone  & \ul business\ulnone  matters, more than sketches of character, which you[r] first letter consisted of.\'a0 I received the first letter you wrote to come by Mr. Keith Friday night.\'a0 \ul He\ulnone  paid me a visit last night, said that he had just arrived, that he was not able to leave Columbia the day he expected, & put your letter in the Post Office.\'a0 He went on today to Pickens.\'a0 Unless your \ul compliments\ulnone  amount to something in \ul reality\ulnone , it only \ul provokes\ulnone  me.\'a0 What makes me unhappy, is my \ul aspirations\ulnone  for you, & that they are not \ul realized\ulnone .\'a0 It is only your being elected to something \ul honorable\ulnone  that can make me forget your \ul late\ulnone  \ul defeat\ulnone , so you must embrace the \ul first\ulnone  \ul chance\ulnone  that offers.\'a0 I am \ul vexed\ulnone  that you should have \ul declined \ulnone Genl Adams \ul suggestion\ulnone  , for it is an \ul honour\ulnone  to be a \ul Candidate\ulnone  for \ul Governor\ulnone .\'a0 Even if not elected, you must consent to any proposal made you, & whatever it is, do not think it will interfere with your private interests.\'a0 I can attend to them, & I am willing to stay in Greenville, & live economically, so \ul you\ulnone  are \ul honoured\ulnone , & if you wish to remove to any place, you can sell your property here to advantage, now, property has risen so.\'a0 To have a good chance for Governor\'a0 you must be \'85get out \ul soon\ulnone , so if anything \ul more \ulnone is said to you, do you \ul consent\ulnone , for the Salary is good, & for only 2 years will not interfere with your other business, for you have partners, & can have more during that time.\'a0 As regards being President of the Bank, I was \ul willing\ulnone  for it, if you are.\'a0 It is from the \ul State\ulnone  that with Mr. Elmore, & ever since has been a flaming Bank man.\'a0 I was glad to find Mr. Keith was against the Bank, & he says the majority of the people of Pickens & Greenville are.\'a0 I had begun to be uneasy about \ul you\ulnone , fearing you were as usual in a small minority.\'a0 I hope you will make an \ul able\ulnone  speech on the \ul subject\ulnone .\'a0 You ought certainly to have dined with the Governor.\'a0 I hope you will be appointed Trustee of the College again, that is such a dignified office.\'a0 I am glad you are one of the Board of Visitors, & that you think you will be appointed a delegate to the Southern Convention.\'a0 Mr. Keith says some alteration ought to be made in the Court of Appeals that the\'a0 Charleston Lawyers shall not try their cases there in Columbia so you must attend to this as I wrote you.\'a0 \ul Commissioner\ulnone  of \ul Equity\ulnone  ought to be given to the \ul people\ulnone , but not Attorney General, Controller &c. to the \ul Governor\ulnone  or people.\'a0 It would be giving him too much power.\'a0 He would favour his friends.\'a0 I see you introduced a bill of that kind.\'a0 Tom Butler knew not whether we were sick or well.\'a0 I heard he arrived one evening, & left that very night again for Columbia.\'a0 Now that I think of it, you must get the \ul Sum\ulnone  allowed last Session for the \ul Electors\ulnone , & which you have \ul never\ulnone  got.\'a0 There is one book which I wish you to buy \ul me\ulnone , & that is, \'93the \ul Lady\ulnone  \ul Alice\ulnone  or the \ul new\ulnone  \ul Una\ulnone .\'94\'a0 Mr. Brown said it was one of the best books he had read for a long time, so do not forget it, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers, by Bulwer.\'a0 You have the second part called Alice, so ought to have the \ul first\ulnone .\'a0 In Anna\'92s letter you Say you have bought my Shawl.\'a0 I \ul thank\ulnone  you.\'a0 I was going to quarrel with you for getting \ul White\ulnone , which was expressly what I told you not to get, but as the Shawl is so \ul reasonable\ulnone  I cannot object.\'a0 I am afraid it will not suit my other clothes.\'a0 I ought now to have a\'a0 \ul Winter\ulnone  \'85.\'a0 If you see a \ul reasonable\ulnone  one you might get me one, a dark Silk or velvet.\'a0 About the Canary birds, I do not know what to say.\'a0 Anna is asleep & has not read your letter.\'a0 If you could afford it I would like them; perhaps it is the only chance we may ever have of getting them & four dollars for a p[ai]r \ul including\ulnone  the \ul Cage\ulnone  is reasonable, & you can have the Cage fixed in some part of your Buggy, & must bring up seed, & we can raise the birds.\'a0 Aunt Mary Hayne\'85them, &\'a0 can give me directions, so my advice is, if you have the \ul money\ulnone  \ul to\ulnone  \ul get\ulnone  \ul them\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad you are so much pleased with Anna\'92s letter.\'a0 You do injustice to Frank.\'a0 Dr. Simons taught him \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 The short time he \ul \'a0\ulnone has been going to Mr. Bradshaws, Mr. Burnham the \ul assistant\ulnone  has taught him to \ul read\ulnone .\'a0 Today he has been reading in a religious Primer, Aunt Eliza sent him some time ago.\'a0 When you come back, he will be able to read it \ul through\ulnone  to you, & he loves to read, as soon as a child can \ul read\ulnone  he takes great interest in it.\'a0 He said yesterday he wished to write to you, that he would \ul hold\ulnone  the pen, & I must \ul move\ulnone  it for him, & you would think he wrote it.\'a0 Frank has too \ul fine\ulnone  a \ul face\ulnone  not to be \ul more\ulnone  than \ul ordinary\ulnone .\'a0 Aunt Eliza was \ul selfish\ulnone  in her kindness to Willie.\'a0 \ul Self interest governs her\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Isaac Hayne used to be \ul very\ulnone  \ul pretty\ulnone , though with some defects, a long chin, & bad figure & walk.\'a0 I had heard she was faded, but have not seen her for years.\'a0 I am glad Col. Hayne & yourself are better friends.\'a0 Fanny yesterday morning when she woke up, said, \'93Ma, Pa sleep here.\'94\'a0 I said \'93no, Pa is in Lumbia.\'94\'a0 She said, \'93I want Pa to come soon, I want Pa to come now.\'94\'a0 We all would be very glad to see Willie & yourself, but all I think of is \ul your\ulnone  \ul happiness\ulnone , & Greenville is so dull now, I am glad you are in Columbia among congenial spirits.\'a0 I am surprised you did not write to Mr. Wells.\'a0 I sent to him just now to know if he had received a letter from you, & he sends word no.\'a0 When you write again, enclose the letter to me, as I like to read it in manuscript.\'a0 I have not seen the last Mountaineer.\'a0 I put them when I send for them in the Library, without opening them.\'a0 The two Mrs. Town[e]s & Mrs. Elford took tea with me Friday evening, & we had a \ul pleasant\ulnone  \ul sociable\ulnone  time.\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s makes any place pleasant. She seems so free from envy, & bad feelings towards others.\'a0 Mr. Mauldin says Dr. Simons rejoices now he was not elected, says he was disappointed at \ul first\ulnone , but he would not be in the power of such a \ul set\ulnone  of \ul men\ulnone  as the \ul Trustees\ulnone  on any account.\'a0 He has published a Circular, in which he says, his table will be furnished with the \ul best\ulnone  of the \ul Land\ulnone , \ul fresh\ulnone  & \ul good\ulnone  from his \ul Farm\ulnone .\'a0 He is looking out for some white man to live on his Farm, & cultivate it on \ul shares\ulnone  with him.\'a0 He dined at the Mansion House lately, & Mrs. Forbes says made his story out quite clear, that says the Board of Trustees consists of 10, that 7 form a quorum, that he got \ul 4\ulnone  \ul votes\ulnone , & besides Mr. B\'85 wrote a note, saying he must get \ul his\ulnone  & Mr. Roberts who was absent wished him to have \ul his\ulnone , & yet the Trustees say Mr. Stuart was elected unanimously, that he heard Mr. Stuart\'92s resignation was attributed to \ul him\ulnone , but he had no doubt, Mr. Stuart staid here long enough to see what \ul kind\ulnone  of \ul men\ulnone  the \ul Trustees\ulnone  were.\'a0 Said you troubled yourself very little about who was elected.\'a0 He considers Mr. Stuarts resignation quite a feather in his cap.\'a0 Susan Hoke says she heard that a lady who went down in the Stage with Mr. Stuart says, he said he had \ul amused\ulnone  himself with the people of Greenville, but I think this must be \ul false\ulnone .\'a0 He has however acted I think dishonourably & unjustifiably, accepting the place\'a0 & then resigning it,when it was not of the power of the Trustees to elect those they might have chosen\'a0 & had in their power, if he had not accepted, for Mr. D\'85 who I hear was the second choice, & has been written to, has had a situation now offered him in Columbia, & therefore may decline this.\'a0 Mr. Smith also has a place, so Mr. Stuart has prevented the Academy having a good teacher.\'a0 His Wifes ill health is foolishness, for it must be the same now, as a few weeks ago, when he \ul accepted\ulnone .\'a0 I would \ul like\ulnone  you to have voted for Arthus Simkins, on account of old associations.\'a0 Mr. Keith says Mr. Jones is a candidate for two Offices, neither of which are vacant, Solicitor & Brigadier General.\'a0 Genl G\'85 it is thought, may resign.\'a0 He is\'85to be in \ul time\ulnone . Yesterday was very cold, today it has been raining & is warmer, but if it is cold tomorrow, Reuben & Charles will kill the 4 remaining hogs, & so save the Corn.\'a0 I have had the Gutters cleaned out.\'a0 You had better vote Richard Stone for a Director of the Bank, on account of Tom Butler who has generally been \ul your\ulnone  \ul friend\ulnone , & Mrs. Stone who is \ul mine\ulnone . Mr. Keith says he thinks there are more members \ul against\ulnone  the Bank than for it, that the vote that was taken on the subject of the special Committee in which there was a \ul tie\ulnone , some who were \ul against\ulnone  the Bank, voted on that question with the friends of the Bank.\'a0 It is now getting late.\'a0 I will finish my letter tomorrow.\'a0 When I go to bed tonight, before I go to sleep, many things will occur to my mind, that I wish to mention to you, one sheet will not hold half I have to say,\

Monday morning.
\f0\b0 \'a0 \

	I have a good pen & will now my dear finish my letter.\'a0 Anna the first thing this morning when she woke looked under her pillow to feel for your letter.\'a0 I told her when she went to bed, if one came, I would put it there, but I had forgot to.\'a0 She dressed & came downstairs & I read it to her & it pleased her very much.\'a0 She sat down & answered it, but only had a short time before School, so hurried & did not write it as well as the last.\'a0 She is quite pleased at the idea of the \ul Birds\ulnone .\'a0 Frank is surprised you do not say what you will bring \ul him\ulnone , & while we were talking about your letter, Fanny said you must write to her.\'a0 She had a book a little while ago, & said she was going to play school.\'a0 She was to be little Sis, \'85(Sarah) big Sis, & C\'85 was to be \ul Mother\ulnone .\'a0 Frank is now sitting down reading his book.\'a0 He wont let me tell him the words, says \ul he\ulnone  knows, so it is amusing to hear him, but he manages to find out a great many.\'a0 Tell Willie I will soon write to him, & Anna says she will write after he has written to her.\'a0 I think his letters do quite well, when you think he has never written\'a0 but one or two before in his life.\'a0 I hope this visit will be of lasting benefit to him.\'a0 The other parents had better leave their children at home.\'a0 They are not equal to Willie.\'a0 It is a damp drizzly day, so the hogs are not to be killed, but as soon as it becomes cold again, they will be.\'a0 Anna has gone to school.\'a0 She will have holiday the middle of this week.\'a0 Wha Office is Dr.St\'85 a Candidate for?\'a0 I hope Mr. Burt will not be elected Secretary of State.\'a0 He is a malignant creature.\'a0 Mr. Keith says you have often \ul nonsuited\ulnone  him in court which is one reason of his dislike to you. You seem to make no complaint of want of money, & say you would have given even 15 dollars for my Shawl.\'a0 As the Shawl is so pretty & yet reasonable, you must spend the remainder of the 10 dollars which is what you were to give for the Shawl, in a bonnet for me 6 dollars or less could buy a pretty winter bonnet,\'85Silks or any kind that is fashionable.\'a0 I will need one now to wear with my Shawl.\'a0 I had intended wearing a Straw bonnet trimmed with Blue, that I wore in the summer, for a bonnet cannot even be trimmed well here.\'a0 But as the Shawl has cost so little, you must spend the remainder of the money allowed for it, in a bonnet whatever kind is fashionable.\'a0 I think you can get one for \ul less\ulnone  than 6 dollars, & buy me the books I have mentioned \'93The lady Alice, or the new Una.\'94\'a0 Mr. Brown said it was a superior work, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers by Bulwer.\'a0 It is the first part of Alice which you bought at Mr. Earles sale.\'a0 If you have still money enough, buy Miss Pardoe\'92s [\'93] Francis the First.\'94\'a0 Of course if you have not the money you must not think of getting these things.\'a0 You must get your money due you as an Elector.\'a0 I wish you would send me the Telegraph, that contains all the news I believe.\'a0 I should think you might give up the Banner edited by Mr. Morgan, the Carolinian is sufficient.\'a0 I suppose you are beginning to have gloomy weather in Columbia as we have here.\'a0 Stay until the very \ul end\ulnone  of the Session.\'a0 I will be delighted if you are elected President of the Bank, or Governor or any honourable Office.\'a0 Genl Adams seems a good sincere friend.\'a0 I have just asked Fanny what I shall tell you.\'a0 She says you must bring her Cocoa nut cakes & she wants you to come home.\'a0 She laughed aloud at Willie\'92s message that he longed to see her.\

	I will not conclude my \ul journal\ulnone .\'a0 Anna came home early this moprning, said Mr. Bradshaw had dismissed the School, that \ul he\ulnone  cried, & the scholars cried.

Dear Willie\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As I answered your Papa\'92s letter by the last Mail, I will now answer yours.\'a0 I was very much pleased with both of your letters & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself.\'a0 Anna thanks you for thinking of her when you saw the birds.\'a0 It showed you loved her, & though absent, had not forgotten her.\'a0 Fanny was very much pleased at your message.\'a0 Almost every day, she says she wants Billy to come home.\'a0 Anna this morning before breakfast wrote a letter to Aunt Mary Hayne, told her you were going to bring her some birds, & asked her to write & tell her, how to take care of them & when she must make nests for them to lay the Eggs in.\'a0 I hope the Cage is pretty.\'a0 I have seen very pretty wire ones painted green.\'a0 Fanny Townes wrote a note to Anna yesterday to ask her to get her Slate & pen from school, so Anna has gone to get them & to carry Mr. Bradshaw a book mark she worked with \'93Think of me\'94 on it.\'a0 Fanny said\'a0 to go too, so I suggested she go warm & she has gone too.\'a0 Frank reads quite well now, & is very fond of it.\'a0 If he had gone to school to Mr. Burnham for the past year, he would have improved a great deal.\'a0 He even learned to write on the Slate, & wrote so well, Mr. Burnham told me he did not believe he made the letters himself.\'a0 Mr. Burnham has gone away now, & Mr. Bradshaw has broken up school, & is going away next week.\'a0 This is the coldest day we have had.\'a0 The Thermometer when I came down this morning was at 24, 6 degrees below freezing point.\'a0 It continues cold.\'a0 Reuben & Charles are killing the 4 remaining hogs.\'a0 Frank read his lesson & then ran out to see them.\'a0 If you were here, you would be with them too.\'a0 How much better it is to believe you are improving I hope in every respect.\'a0 I am glad the hogs are killed, so our Corn may be saved, but you will miss Sausage meat when you come back.\'a0 I suppose you have plenty of Sausages in Columbia.\'a0 When Papa comes back he must send for some Buckwheat Flour, & then you will have Buckwheat cakes which you like so much.\'a0 Frank soon after he had his ball worked to make a hole in it.\'a0 I told him \ul not\ulnone  to.\'a0 One day he brought it from school with a hole he said the boys made while throwing it.\'a0 He would fill the ball with water & squeeze it out, & in so doing has made the hole so large that he has ruined the ball. So you had better bring him one, or he will be borrowing yours.\'a0 I hope to get letters tonight from Papa & yourself.\'a0 Anna says you must write to her, & then she will write to you.\'a0 She has worked a pretty pincushion, or little ottoman she may call it.\'a0 I made it up for her, & it will astonish her Papa as much as her letter.\'a0 She has been so busy at it, she has been quite happy, for she is always happy when she is employed.\'a0 I am wondering who will be her Teacher.\'a0 Mr. Stuart ought not to have acted as he has done, for the Teacher the Trustees would have got when they selected him, are now engaged to other places.\'a0 Dr. Simons taught you nothing at all.\'a0 Frank would have learnt so much more at the other school.\'a0 The money spent on you was thrown away.\'a0 You must write me the name of the books you have bought.\'a0 I think you have enough.\'a0 Frank has no cap to wear to church.\'a0 You must buy him whatever kind the boys wear.\'a0 You are well supplied with clothes.\'a0 I have only been to church once since you left.\'a0 The two last Sundays, the weather has been bad.\'a0 You must tell Papa he must not forget to interest himself in getting a place in the Military Academy for Mr. Markley\'92s son.\'a0 He is one of a large family, & entitled to a place there.\'a0 Perhaps one of these days you will be going to school in that place.\'a0 I have
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super  
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub seen no little boys since you left & do not know how they are spending the holidays.\'a0 Last night the boys gave a party to the girls.\'a0 It was so cold I hardly think many went.\'a0 I had no thought of Anna\'92s going.\'a0 Last week the young men gave one to the Beachams.\'a0 Your Grandmama is very much pleased you behave so well in Columbia.\'a0 She gave me some small change to keep for you, & it was money left from what she gave me to buy butter for her.\'a0 Vardry fell on a kettle or over I do not know which in the kitchen, & burnt his hand very badly.\'a0 About the same time, at night when Fanny was undressing to go to bed & was standing before the fire, a spark popped out, & burnt her behind her ear.\'a0 It must have rested on the collar of her night dress.\'a0 It was only a little burn, & is now quite well.\'a0 Fanny is still very lively & affectionate.\'a0 She sleeps with me at night, & she hugs me, & if I turn away, she says \'93turn over Ma.\'94\'a0 Anna & Fanny have come back now.\'a0 They are making so much noise, I must finish my letter to you, & will write a few lines on the other side to Papa.\'a0 Mr. Bradshaw (Anna says,) is selling his furniture today.\'a0 The two oldest boys are to stay with Mr. Erwin to go to school to him.\'a0 Mr. Keith told me he offered to bring you home, but you preferred staying until you Papa came.\'a0 Fanny says I must tell you howdy.\'a0 Anna that you must write.\'a0 Frank is not here to send any message.\'a0 So Good bye,\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\

My dear husband, \
	As I had nothing particular to write to you today, I thought it best to answer Willie\'92s letter.\'a0 I will now however express a few thoughts to you.\'a0 I saw the Courier last night.\'a0 I approve of your recommendation about the Penitentiary.\'a0 The other motion you made partly I approve.\'a0 The election of Commissioner in Equity ought to be given to the people, but the Attorney General, Solicitor, Controller &c ought to be left as it is.\'a0 I suppose by this time you have spoken on the Bank.\'a0 I hope you did \ul credit\ulnone  to \ul yourself\ulnone , acquitted yourself better than Mr. Reed.\'a0 Have you done anything for Mr. Markley\'92s son?\'a0 You must not forget him.\'a0 I hope your prospects as regards the Executive & the Bank are progressing, now that \ul Law\ulnone  is\'85, you ought to think of something else.\'a0 You must do something in advancing your own interests, not\'85leave it to friends, & I hope you will tell me your prospects are good, for one or the other of these offices.\'a0 I think if your name was only suggested for the future Governor, it would take immediately, for you are \ul respected \ulnone throughout the State.\'a0 So if you are not elected to the Bank. You must think of the other.\'a0 You can have a partner here to attend to your business for [word obscured].\'a0 My directions about getting me a bonnet are not a joke.\'a0 10 dollars was what I allowed you for the Shawl, & as you only gave 4 dollars, the remaining 6 spend for me in a suitable winter bonnet.\'a0 You have much good taste.\'a0 Whatever you get will be pretty, & it gives me pleasure to wear anything \ul you\ulnone  \ul buy\ulnone .\'a0 These are the only things I care to buy this winter.\'a0 I do not expect to buy a dress.\'a0 What I have I will make do.\'a0 When I tell you to buy me anything, it is always of course meaning if you have the money.\'a0 If you had the \ul money \ulnone I would like a dress too but I know you have not.\'a0 From your being able to do all you have done, you mst have been supplied from some source I know not of. We are all well.\'a0 The weather is very cold.\'a0 We have fine weather for our meat.\'a0 I wrote Willie all I could think of, having received no letter since I last wrote.\'a0 I have less than usual to write about.\'a0 Your letters give me great pleasure.\'a0 If it were not for the cold I would like to be with you.\'a0 I am really glad Willie does so well.\'a0 Yours affectionately, E.F.P.\

\'a0My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write to you tonight, because I have \ul quiet\ulnone .\'a0 In the day I am so much interrupted , my ideas get confused.\'a0 I am sorry I have such a bad pen.\'a0 It is the only one I have given me by Mr. Dill, & every now & then he mends it for me, but I do not like to trouble him very often.\'a0 You must leave me better supplied another time.\'a0 I have had to buy paper twice.\'a0 I received your letter last night, & also Mr. Wells, which I sent to him after reading it.\'a0 As you had Sunday to write to me. I was in hopes you would have written me a long letter, of one or two sheets of foolscap, & thought Willie would have written too.\'a0 He I can see is not fond of his pen.\'a0 We had a rainy Sunday here too.\'a0 Yesterday it was \ul very\ulnone  cold.\'a0 Our hogs are now all killed.\'a0 Last night I made custard thinking it would \ul freeze\ulnone , but it did not.\'a0 Still it has been quite cold, & all day raining & freezing, so the trees are covered with icicles, & some of the Cedars & Oranges bent to the ground, & I am afraid are broken.\'a0 It is very much such a day as we had 3 years ago when we were on our way from Columbia, in the stage, & had Maj. Earle as our companion; one of the most unpleasant days in my life, as any day would be spent in \ul his\ulnone  company, even without Sleet & Ice. Reuben & Charles helped Mr. Goodlet[t] kill his hogs, which they ought to have done, as he was so good as to let our horses stay in his Stable.\'a0 At the farm they have ploughed when they could & cut up wood when\'a0 they could not.\'a0 The wood when they cut it, is just under the piazza & gets dry, so we have good fires.\'a0 I only wrote to you yesterday, so have not much to say now.\'a0 Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon came to see me yesterday afternoon. They thought it a delightful day, do not mind the cold at all.\'a0 They will go down shortly. Mrs. Hayne you say looks dowdyish.\'a0 She always looked so.\'a0 She had pretty eyes & complexion, & was very lively in her manners, but she had a long face, sunk mouth, long chin, bad figure, tall & high shoulders, & her head stooping forward, & a\'85awkward walk.\'a0 Her eyes & her complexion were so good, that she passed for being very pretty.\'a0 She dressed badly always.\'a0 I suppose she looks pretty much the same as she did.\'a0 I would like to know if you heard anything in particular of Ann Williams.\'a0 Her Mill\'85 was all an excuse to get to a gay place like Columbia, & perhaps make a conquest.\'a0 She was not one, who would mind being a burden on her Grandmother.\'a0 She would have assisted her Mother in taking in work in\'85.\'a0 Tom Butler I expect is such a successful Gambler that he always has money at\'85, & I suppose Richard Stone being a Bank Director can help him.\'a0 He told Mr. McBee, he saw his way clear, knew how much he owed, & could pay every cent without touching his property.\'a0 His wife seems such a contrast to himself, & the last lady he would have chosen.\'a0 Mrs. Stone made that match.\'a0 How wives deceive themselves.\'a0 I suppose the same Mail that brought me a letter, brought Mrs. Butler & Mrs. Jones most \ul affectionate\ulnone  ones from their husbands, most affectionate perhaps even than mine, because \ul not\ulnone  coming from the \ul heart\ulnone .\'a0 I wish Mrs. Jones could hear of her husbands conduct.\'a0 It would pull down some of her vanity, & make her less egotistic.\'a0 I will not mention it, but it \ul ought\ulnone  to be known, & I hope it will get to the ears of the wives.\'a0 If a \ul wife\ulnone  were even to seem pleased with the attention of a gentleman how angry the hunband would be, but the husbands are to do just as they choose.\'a0 I do not think Mrs. Butler or Mrs. Jones lack any of the comforts of life.\'a0 Their husbands must be better off than the world thinks.\'a0 I am sorry that you did not go to the Fair, that they might have seen, that \ul you\ulnone  at least saw them. You ought to have dined with Col. John Preston.\'a0 All such invitations \ul you\ulnone  ought to accept, & in future \ul must\ulnone .\'a0 They do not come so often as to inconvenience you.\'a0 You should arrange it, so that all of your shirts should not be in the wash at a time, & I thought Willie was such a little man, he had learned to attend to himself, & not oblige you to stay with him.\'a0 You were wrong not to accept the Governors invitation.\'a0 It is for your interest to mingle in such society.\'a0 I wish you had a little more of the spirit of\'85Butler & Jones.\'a0 You go to the other extreme & are not social; enough.\'a0\'a0 I mentioned in my last letter that you had better not buy the birds.\'a0 For fear of the cold climate, you must ascertain whether there would be any risk.\'a0 If there were not, I \ul would\ulnone  like to \ul have\ulnone  \ul them\ulnone , but do not bring any to Ann, as I suggested, she says she would not take care of them.\'a0 
\f2\i \'a0
\f0\i0 I also mentioned that Susan wished a Straw Chair such as a child uses, & you bought for Willie once.\'a0 I think the price is 1.50.\'a0 You will have to send it up by the Stage directed to Mr. McBee.\'a0 Susan will return to me whatever expenses you are at in buying & sending it up.\'a0 If you are straightened for money of course you cannot get it. If the Legislature adjourns next Tuesday the 18
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  as you think, this will be my last letter to you.\'a0 So I will mention all I wish you to get, promising that you must only get what I mention in case you have money.\'a0 Dr. Teague I believe was to pay you some & as you do not mention a scarcity, I think you must have been supplied.\'a0 If you are in funds, get for Anna the birds, if there is no risk of cold weather killing them, for Frank a trumpet or ball or some toy for Fanny & all included Cocoanut cakes; for Ann the box resembling an \ul apple\ulnone , for Vardry a little present of some kind, for \ul me\ulnone  to wear with my Shawl, a bonnet costing not more than 5 or 6 dollars, if you see a \ul pretty\ulnone  one, but if not, [do] \ul not\ulnone  \ul get\ulnone  \ul any\ulnone , & also if you see a pretty dress, worsted, at 25 or 37 1/2 cts a yd, get me enough to make dress & cape, & fringe & buttons, or any other\'85used.\'a0 A dress can be got here at the prices mentioned, but I would rather have one from Columbia, but not on any account with a price higher than this, at 25 or 37 \'bd.\'a0 All my dresses are light coloured\'85& thin Silks, so I used a new one to wear with my Shawl, though if you are \ul straightened\ulnone , I will do without it.\'a0 I got no new one last year.\'a0 All of my present ones except the light Cashmere, suitable only for Spring, are \ul very\ulnone  \ul shabby\ulnone .\'a0 In the way of books get me \'93The Lady Alice or the new Una,\'94 [\'93] Ernest Maltreves,\'94 & \'93the Carolina Receipt book\'94 by a Charleston lady, the \ul price\ulnone \'85\ul dollars\ulnone , & if you have it not to spend, I will wait for the books another time.\'a0 I expect you think I have written demands enough.\'a0 I will now close.\'a0\'a0 If tomorrow I have anything more to write I will inflict another sheet on you.\'a0 On the reception of our letters our exclamations are reversed.\'a0 I of yours, \'93how short,\'94 yours\'a0 of mine, \'93how long\'94!\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Frank says he has almost forgotten how Willie looks.\'a0 Fanny today when she was troubling me, & I said I was busy said \'93is Pa busy.\'94\'a0 She takes up a book & reads, \'93B.F. Perry turn into Court.\'94\'a0 She has not forgotten Mr. Montgomery\'92s call.\'a0 You must be \ul patient\ulnone , & not feel too anxious to come home.\'a0 You will have a long time to stay, & will get tired before the Circuit commences again.\'a0 So enjoy yourself now among congenial spirits.\'a0 The children are all asleep.\'a0 Good night, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write\'a0 you a few lines, as it may be a comfort to hear from home tomorrow if you are\'85that long at Laurens perhaps I ought not to write,\'a0 You may not care to hear so often, but I judge of you by myself, & when absent from you, my only comfort is your letters.\'a0 Mary I am sorry to say is sick, but I expect not seriously.\'a0 She complained yesterday of pain in her stomach, so could do not any work.\'a0 I gave her castor oil, & pepper tea & put on mustard plasters.\'a0 Today she said she felt no better, so I sent for Dr. Crook.\'a0 Think it safer a Doctor should see her, & he says she has cold & must take Parsley root tea with Nitre in it, & iron herself with a warm iron, so I hope & suppose she will soon be well.\'a0 It puts me to great inconvenience having her sick, & Minerva on finding she had to do some of her work, was most \ul impertinent\ulnone , but I need not dwell on this subject, for you know I have never had your sympathy or aid in helping me in these domestic things & I always look to others for sympathy. Mrs. Kingsland & her youngest sister came to see me yesterday.\'a0 These are all I have seen since I wrote, & I have not been out. I am almost sorry Dr. Teague paid you.\'a0 I so prefer your having a note, drawing Interest, & if associates children\'a0 take part of your Rail Road Stock, you will not have so very much to pay.\'a0 You had better keep only one thousand or 1500 yourself, & they take the rest, even if Mr. Foster takes some. The children & myself are well.\'a0 Fanny sweeter than ever.\'a0 Last night at support Anna said something about your drinking hot water tea when you were a little boy.\'a0 Fanny got quite offended, & said to me almost crying \'93Tanner calls Pa a boy, Pa aint a boy,\'94 I said \'93what is he, is he not a \ul gentleman\ulnone ,\'94 she said, \'93\'92no. Pa is Pappy.\'a0 Pa is Pappy.\'94\'a0 She is always saying something sweet & affectionate.\'a0 The children go regularly to school.\'a0\'a0 Dr. Simons seems kinder since his disappointment, than he was before.\'a0 I hear that Mr. Leary has asked Mr. Erwin, who teaches at Spartanburg to assist him, perhaps Mr. Stevens declined coming. I hope Mr. Farleys business will be profitable to you.\'a0 The woman who murdered her husbands mistress, sa\'85ied her revenge \ul for\ulnone , she ought to have shown her contempt for her & him by \ul leaving\ulnone  him, to the enjoyment of one he preferred to her. I hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 You need not be uneasy about Mary.\'a0 When you return Sunday, I dare say she will be up, at her work.\'a0 Dr. Crook said he wished to see you about his Turnpike road, that he expected he would not be able to go to Columbia himself.\'a0 Mrs. Durbec sent me word a few days ago, that she had received a letter from Mrs. Blake, who sent her love to me, & said she had written to me, & wished to know if I had received the letter. Mr. Sam Town[e]s left for Florida a day or two ago.\'a0 We have still pleasant weather.\'a0 I am glad negroes are rising though perhaps it is no advantage to us, who have, except Jim, none to dispose of, & I expect you have not determined to dispose of him.\'a0 If ordinary men servants sell for one thousand, he with his \ul trade\ulnone , ought to sell for 1500.\'a0 I will be willing to sell him when you can get that.\'a0 You know Sheriff a common negro & a rogue into the bargain sold for 1200.\'a0 Betsy, Jims wife has returned from the Limestone Springs.\'a0 I expect Jim has forgotten her. We will all be very glad to see you Sunday & you no doubt glad to see us.\'a0 I have nothing of interest to write about.\'a0 I am sorry Miss Dillard cannot have her case tried.\'a0 She is quite unfortunate.\'a0 I expect she will often be inconvenienced in the same way.\'a0 If her mother is \ul good\ulnone  for the note, no matter if she does not pay it now, though I would rather have her money & Dr. Teagues note. Believe me my dear husband as I ever have & ever will be your attached, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As you will be disappointed if you do not have a letter from me tomorrow I will write you a few lines, but I have a shocking pen, & am very tired.\'a0 I invited some company for the children here today, Mrs. Pearson & a few others.\'a0 I have been on my feet all day, as I always have so much to do myself when I have company, & as usual it has fatigued me.\'a0 I have written a few lines to Mrs. Sharpe to send along with the shoes., & if I have time I wish to write to Mrs. Duboc.\'a0 I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, but I am sorry you made no mention of having received money from Mr. Norris, & nothing of Mr. Dickey\'92s case.\'a0 I expect as you have left it to Mr. Norris\'92 generosity to give you what he thinks right, he will give you nothing more.\'a0 I am afraid there is no chance of your being appointed a Delegate to the Nashville Convention.\'a0 I would have like that\'a0 you should even if you had declined going in case the first nominated declined going, would have gone in your stead, but you have no ambition.\'a0 That is your failing & in that lies your bad success.\'a0 When a man wishes, & is determined to gain what he wishes, he is certain to succeed but you are too lazy sometimes for exertion, but I will not dwell on your faults.\'a0 Reuben & Charles have ploughed every day since you left, & will finish the Oats sometime next week.\'a0 The fence is you mention being down is up now & Reuben does not know who would have taken it down.\'a0 He did not see it down.\'a0 Charles has finished the Stable & has been cleaning the yard.\'a0 Jim has made the Arbor in front of the house in the garden, has finished the Chicken pen, & made the fence by the Stable.\'a0 Next week if there is Lumber enough he will make the pig pen & Cow Stalls.\'a0 He says Mr. Hooker has hired two hands, & said nothing more to him, but I hope when he has finished here, Mr. Hooker\'a0 or someone will hire him, but when you can, you had better sell him, for it is very troublesome to keep servants to hire.\'a0 In your travels you ought to look out for a purchase for him.\'a0 900 I should think you would get, at any rate 850.\'a0 I would be glad for you to have a note for that amount.\'a0 Jim has made a step to Anna\'92s house & a fence would\'85separating it from the servants yard.. Eliza is sick in bed today with pain in her back & side.\'a0 Monday I will go in the garden & direct Charles what to do there.\'a0 The garden needs some attention now.\'a0 Wednesday night we had a heavy Snow, & I am afraid the fruit is all killed.\'a0 One of my large wild oranges was broken down.\'a0 We have cold weather & cold nights now; it is unfortunate, our winters are mild, & our Springs cold.\'a0\'a0\'a0Yesterday was Good Friday, & Mamma & myself Willie & Frank went to church.\'a0 Mr. Leary gave Holiday.\'a0 There was service again today, but I did not go.\'a0 Mr. Arthur for several mornings has had Sunrise meetings, to stir up his congregation, but I believe he has not stirred up many out of their beds.\'a0 Even Mr. Leary said he would not go, & Mrs. Pearson said she went with the greatest exertion.\'a0 I am sure if I was to go, my household would be put in entire confusion. The Ware\'92s dined here today, & Sally Crook.\'a0 Sally says Mr. Davis says, he has enough to support him without teaching that he teaches because he likes it.\'a0 I am glad to hear that Susan has given Anna a pretty doll, which has made her very happy.\'a0 I have been dressing it for her, & it will teach her to work.\'a0 Ann has been suffering from Calomel.\'a0 She took rather too much & not enough medicine after it, & is salivated & Mamma says her head feels as yours did.\'a0 Her mouth is sore & bleeds. Edward says Mrs. Mooney sold his home because he is in debt, that himself & Mr. Dyer get very little work to do, are sometimes weeks without any, but they manage to keep him employed, but Edward is not infallible authority, so I would not mention what he says.\'a0Mr. Cox & Mr. Griffin are exchanging homes.\'a0 I know of no news to tell you, except to church I have not been & at home have only\'85.\'a0 The children are well.\'a0 Willie rode on his colt today & it did pretty well, did not throw him.\'a0 Fanny talks about you, & what she will buy with the money you will bring her.\'a0 Anna has gone regularly to school.\'a0 Willie & Frank Wednesday staid at home because it rained & they have colds.\'a0 I hope Mamma will dine with me tomorrow.\'a0 I thought I would have had things left today, but all was eaten.\'a0 I am glad you sleep well, for that contributes a great deal to ones feeling well.\'a0 I hope your face when you return will be of its\'85.\'a0 At Pendleton last summer I saw some Smiths related to Mrs. North.\'a0 One of them lives with her.\'a0 Perhaps it was one of them that inquired about me of you.\'a0 Judge Withers I think must be quite trifling.\'a0 He seems to be a great talker & I thought\'85in his remarks the evening he spent here.\'a0 Susan told me Mary Creyton was trying for Mr. Campbell. I will send your letters & papers along with this letter, such papers as you have not seen, only one letter has come.\'a0 I hope you will come back with plenty of money, at any rate enough of the Tugaloo\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 estate to pay you what it owes you, & you to pay all the Rail Road then after that.\'a0 I wish you to send for Groceries, which we now greatly need, then get a new carri[a]ge for me\'a0 to ride more comfortably in, & then get a Piano, & furnish me with a generous supply for\'85, so you have a good deal to do.\'a0 Write by someone coming back before you leave.\'a0 I knew Mr. Calhoun was not going to leave this world yet, but be spared to trouble it longer.\'a0 I expect he now has been as ill as said in the papers.\'a0 I was never uneasy about him.\'a0 I can\'85letter up.\'a0 It wont do to be bound.\'a0 It is written too badly for Mrs. P\'85 & Mrs. Williams to read.\'a0 Hetty D\'92Oyley has gone to Aiken to Mrs. Theodore Crofts who has been very ill.\'a0 Your\'85, E.F.P. Though I forget to tell you, you must not leave Pickens until all your business is finished.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have time to write only a few lines.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 I send a Carolinian.\'a0 You will see Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore is appointed Senator.\'a0 The Governor has been cunning.\'a0 He says he need not serve more than this Session.\'a0 Next winter he can return to the Bank, & I suppose he himself take his place.\'a0 I send a receipt for money Mr. Dill begged me to give you, to collect money for Mr. Farr. Mr. Arthur has a daughter, born only 2 hours after Mrs. Thomas arrived Saturday evening. I went to church morning & afternoon yesterday.\'a0 Mr. Arthur preached on the love of the world, going to Theaters Balls &c.\'a0 I am sure in Greenville, there is no theater to go to, & so few Balls, one is not tempted to show their love of the world in that way.\'a0 I think Mr. Arthur loves the world as well as anyone. I called in Edward & told him about the flower.\'a0 His behavior I will tell you of when you return.\'a0 I hope you will gain Dr. Andersons case.\'a0 Miss Greens was certainly the most unjust decision I ever heard of. You must think of what I said about offering for the Legislature.\'a0 You certainly ought to be there next winter when the important Banks question will be discussed.\'a0 Do not wait to be asked; come forward yourself.\'a0 People are too selfish to think of you, if you do not yourself.\'a0 I promise you not to worry you on the subject.\'a0 I think you will if in the Legislature be elected Speaker, & then I will be gratified.\'a0Jim is building the low\'85.\'a0 I long to see you.\'a0 I was prevented writing this morning, & now the Mail is about closing.\'a0 I will\'a0 have to stop.\'a0Only one letter came last night from Mr. Squier, asking you to collect Tom Butlers & Butler Thompsons money due him. I will write a longer letter next time.\'a0 Adieu.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 To prevent your being disappointed I must write, but I really have nothing interesting to write about, but I must try & think of something.\'a0 Today it is raining so not much can be done at the Farm.\'a0 They intended planting Corn today, but the weather being bad, Reuben is hauling Manure.\'a0 I told Charles to cut\'85for the Peas, but I do not know whether he will. Jim has been working at the pig pen & cow stalls ever since you left.\'a0 He has not finished them, says he has not enough to cover them with. I do not like to dictate to you, but it seems to me when you can get what you think his value & a good price it would be well to sell him.\'a0 I think he is worth a great deal, for he is so smart & capable that will a strict owner, he would be invaluable, though to you he has been of little service, but I am willing to take 800 though would be glad to get more.\'a0 The interest of the money added to the principal would be more than he makes for you, deducting his expenses, risk of losing him, & his unsteady way, but I wish you to act for yourself Monday I dined at Mamma\'92s.\'a0 She walked in to see me.\'a0 Fanny & myself walked back with her.\'a0 I spent a pleasant day.\'a0 Yesterday we all dined at Susans.\'a0 Willie & Frank came out after morning school.\'a0 I spent a very pleasant day.\'a0 Speaking of Mr. Erwin Jones, Mr. McBee said if he ran for the Legislature, he would not \ul run\ulnone  \ul far\ulnone , & as for being Solicitor he stood no chance for the Greenville Delegation even would not vote for him, that \ul you\ulnone  he knew would not, nor Col. Town[e]s &c; said if you ran for the Legislature, which he seemed to think was a thing of course, you would be elected.\'a0 I expect it is thought such a settled matter that no one has thought it worthwhile to ask you.\'a0 Frank is still head.\'a0 Fanny talks as usual of you, & we all long to see you.\'a0 I hope \ul gain\ulnone  or \ul not\ulnone , Dr. Anderson will pay you some of the fee you charge that you will come home with a purse full.\'a0 I know of no news to tell you.\'a0 The rain will I hope make our seed come up, & perhaps tomorrow it will clear, & the Corn can be planted.\'a0 I wish a good deal planted as you will have 3 hands & 3 horses all summer. I hope to hear from you tonight, & now having said all I possibly can say except that one letter came for you last night, from a Mr. Fisher or some such name from Augusta which does not seem of much importance.\'a0 I remain your attached, dutiful wife. E.F.P. P.S. If Dr. Anderson does not pay you, be sure & make him give you his note, which will be as well, perhaps better. I do not wish Col. Irby to pay you, so if he offers to, decline.\'a0 I wish his note to accumulate for years as it is such a good Compound Interest\'85him keep it as long as he will.\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I hope you are now safe in Columbia, & resting after your journey.\'a0 According to promise I must write & tell you all that has occurred\'a0 since the moment you left, but very little of importance have I to tell you.\'a0 Friday afternoon Mr. Richardson called & said he was just from the Mill, & Mr. Taft said your wheat only turned out 183 pounds, that I must send a bag to the Mill & get 17 pounds more.\'a0 I told him you said he was celebrated for good wheat.\'a0 He said what he had just brought was good.\'a0 That wheat you got, Mr. Taft said was not secured enough, that the wet weather had given him no chance of securing it, so from this I expect the Flour is not very good, & I observe the Biscuits look black & do not rise well.\'a0 I sent the bag & got the 17 pounds. Friday Charles came in & planted the ground nuts, & prepared the ground for potatoes.\'a0 The slips we will have to buy.\'a0 Yesterday he planted his\'85, & we had in the afternoon a good rain, & last night it rained hard & with this morning, vegetation looks revived. Jim came home a little while last evening I expect for his tolls.\'a0 He thought he would do some mischief, so he set in the Cows to the Calves, so we got very little Milk. Yesterday afternoon I walked to see Mrs. Tom Gower.\'a0 She was out, then to see Mrs. Norton, who has been sick a long time, & then on to Mamma\'92s.\'a0 White at Mamma\'92s it rained hard so she had to send me home in the carri[a]ge.\'a0 This morning the children & myself went to church.\'a0 As it was damp, I called for Mrs. Walker.\'a0 Mr. Arthur gave us an old sermon on regeneration, to a very small congregation.\'a0 This afternoon there was no service.\'a0 The children were catechized.\'a0 Willie & Anna went, & afterwards we all went out to Mamma\'92s & took tea. At church Mr. Croft asked me if I would be home tomorrow at 9 oclock.\'a0 He wished to see me on a little business.\'a0 I told him yes, so I am quite anxious to know what it is about.\'a0 This afternoon I intended going to see Mr. Sam Town[e]s, but Reuben said Scott was lame.\'a0 At the church door when I was getting in the carri[a]ge he said the horse was so lame it could hardly walk, but I thought it only seemed a little lame, & that Reuben was afraid I was going to employ him this afternoon.\'a0 He said , it either sprained its awful kicking against the stable or had run a nail into its foot, in walking over the old planks in the stable yard, & said if I needed it this afternoon it might be lamed for life, so I told him to attend to Scott, & see that he got well soon.\'a0 Reuben loves to exaggerate.\'a0 It is raining now.\'a0 The servants have gone to church.\'a0 The children are upstairs in bed.\'a0 I am downstairs.\'a0 Charlotte told\'85little while ago, that today Mary joined the Methodist church.\'a0 It is no wonder they are turned out so soon, if they join with so little thought as I am sure she has\'85the dreadful accident happened on Mr. Arthurs R[ail] Road\'85yesterday while digging the earth & rocks fell on a servant of Mr. Arthur\'92s named Bob, & Mr. Walkers \ul Joe\ulnone , & \ul killed\ulnone  \ul them\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Walker says an easy way of digging is, to dig the earth [word obscured] the bottom far under & then the earth on the top falls down, that the men were digging in this way, & after digging far under the earth did not fall, so Joe & Bob were told to dig a little more.\'a0 They began, & in a few moments, the earth & rocks came tumbling down on them & killed them.\'a0 She seems to bear it well, but it must be a great trial.\'a0 Mr. Arthur seemed the same as usual today, but I am sure he must be distressed at it. \'a0It was owing to carelessness of the Overseer I believe.\'a0 Mr. Arthur seems to have been unfortunate with negroes.\'a0 Your different papers have come, & 3 letters, one from Dr. Holland about a bill the Tugaloo estate owes him, one from Mr. Christie from Edgefield a few lines\'85Mr. Deans paper, & one from Peirce Earle to his Wife.\'a0 It is directed to you.\'a0 Ann says you must not forget to buy her the apple box.\'a0 Mrs. Arthur gave her a cap, & she thought she ought to make a return, & told her she would give her\'a0 one of those Apple boxes.\'a0 With regard to going to town my dear you must do just as you please.\'a0 I objected because I thought the expense was great, & the pleasure would not equal it, & if I was with you, it would be pleasant visiting my relations, but alone, you might not find it so, & that next year I hoped to go with you, & introduce you to them all, for some of the pleasantest, such as Aunt Mary McCall & Mrs. Susan Hayne, you have never even seen, & do everything you think proper as regards bank Stock.\'a0 If there is any risk, you might sell only half of the Stock.\'a0 Aunt Turnbull you saw in Greenville, so if you did not object, I would like you to call on her.\'a0 The Hayne family, most of them have treated us so\'a0 \'85\ul gently\ulnone , they have no claims on your politeness so I do not tell you to call on \ul them\ulnone , but Aunt Ann Turnbull & my Aunts there I would like you to see.\'a0 I feel \ul nearer\ulnone  to them, & they have always been kinder to us, than my \ul mothers\ulnone  \ul sisters\ulnone .\'a0 Tomorrow the Whitewashing will be commenced which is the reason I write tonight.\'a0 The home will be in confusion.\'a0 This is the only sheet of letter paper in the\'85.\'a0 It is blotted, but you must excuse it, you left me badly off.\'a0 I will leave room to add a few lines tomorrow, telling what Mr. Croft wishes to see me for.\'a0 Mamma says Mr. McBee told Susan Anna was the admiration of all at Mrs. Cannons Mayday.\'a0 Frank is still head.\'a0 Willie\'92s colt is doing quite well.\'a0 Fanny talks about Papa, & wished you home the day you left.\'a0 I hope your horse held out, & that you did not get wet.\'a0 My pen is so bad, I am afraid you cannot make out my letter.\'a0 Mr. Croft says he has not sent down yet for his groceries, that it will be a month at least before they are here.\'a0 The\'85will be out of seed, so if you can buy them in Columbia, you must buy some & send by Mr. Elford or the first person coming.\'a0 If you can get a cage, you must buy one.\'a0 The female has lately had some more feathers plucked out, & the male does not sing at all, so they ought to be separated before they kill each other.\

	My dear husband, \
\
I will now finish my letter.\'a0 Mr.Croft has paid his visit.\'a0 He wished to know my opinion how it would do for him to ask Mrs. Blake to stay at his house & she in return teach all his grandchildren to dance 7 or 8 of them.\'a0 Her\'85would cost him \ul nothing\ulnone , & her teaching his Grandchildren save him 60, 70, or 80 dollars.\'a0 It would really be a bargain on his part.\'a0 He wishes me to propose it to Mrs. Blake on her arrival.\'a0 He says she will have a good school.\'a0 He does not know when his Groceries will be here, not until freight is lower, so you must be sure & buy some seed & bring with you or the birds will perish. Mr. Arthur only bought last week the servant who has been killed.\'a0 Paid 600 dollars for him, from Mr. Garrison. This is sale day, & Mr. Griggs has had his whipping, as great a crowd went to Jail for him, as if he was to be hung. The children are at school.\'a0 The horse sprained its ankle.\'a0 Mr. Westfield says there is no nail in it. Reuben is not using it today.\'a0 Mr. Smith will commence whitewashing tomorrow.\'a0 I hope to hear from you Wednesday & long to see you.\'a0 Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P. There are a great many People in the village today.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have stopped in the midst of my housecleaning to write to you. but I am in such confusion, I cannot collect my ideas sufficiently to write an interesting letter.\'a0 I have had the whole house whitewashed.\'a0 When the carpet & furniture was moved out of the Dining room, the walls looked so dirty, I thought it best as I was obliged to buy yellow wash for the little dining room, to have another coat given to the big one, so it has been done.\'a0 Mr. Smith is here with his brother & will finish today.\'a0 They commenced the house yesterday & having to dismantle the whole of it\'a0 you cannot conceive the disorder it is in, but I am willing for it, for the sake of cleanliness that follows & when you see the quantity of dirt swept under the Carpet, Furniture & corners you would wonder how we could have existed.\'a0 It is well you are away.\'a0 You would have to leave on three occasions, whether business called you away or not.\'a0 Last night Anna, Fanny & myself slept in Anna\'92s bed. It is now raining a little.\'a0 Reuben & Lindy have gone regularly to the Farm.\'a0 Scott\'92s lameness is better.\'a0 Hochelago, yesterday laid down a good deal, & I was afraid was sick.\'a0 Charles brought Mr. Longs Dudley down who said nothing seemed the matter with him.\'a0 He expected he was suffering from the operation he had gone through.\'a0 I do not think he will ever get over that.\'a0 He seems so sad & dispirited.\'a0 It has certainly lamed him.\'a0 I\'a0 hope to hear from you tonight.\'a0 Mr. D\'85\'92s came here yesterday afternoon to say a Piano had arrived, & you should have the refusal of it;\'a0 that it was a very fine instrument & Anna\'92s mind was capable of learning more than she did at present, & he was anxious she should commence with a class now forming.\'a0 The price of the Piano frieght\'a0 included 300 & you pay at your convenience.\'a0 Mama, Susan & myself went up to hear the Piano.\'a0 As well as we could judge it seemed a fine one.\'a0 Mr. D\'85 sent me yesterday a letter to you, which he requested I enclose to you at Columbia, speaking of the Piano & advising Anna to learn.\'a0 I do not send it, because you will be at home so soon, you can then decide on the matter.\'a0 If you could pay for the Piano, I would like to get one, but I cannot say I wish you to go in debt for it, so we will speak on the subject when you return.\'a0 That is time enough.\'a0 He expects other Pianos which will be more reasonable, though perhaps not as good, so it is no\'85to determine at once.\'a0 If anyone wishes this Piano that has arrived I will call Mr. D\'85 to let them have it.\'a0 When you return we can decide whether it is best Anna should commence at once, whether this year we can afford it. Mrs. Tom Rowland has a Son, & Mrs. Charles Rabb has lost hers.\'a0 You know she brought one with her from Louisiana.\'a0 It died yesterday.\'a0 Miss Markley is not expected to live long.\'a0 Mr. Choice is going soon to send the boys, under his charge to Princeton, so Mrs. Blake will lose them as scholars.\'a0 Mr. Beattie says he knows she will have a good school, but several think her terms too high.\'a0 Do you not think Mr. Croft\'92s plan a cunning one.\'a0 The Dr. Crofts can afford better than most to pay for their children dancing.\'a0 Old Mr. Croft can pay for Mrs. Pearsons, & yet he would wish Mrs. Blake to stay with him, save her about 30 dollars, & give his grandchildren 80 dollars worth of dancing, & speaks as if he was quite kind in making the proposal; says he would be the means of putting hundreds in her pocket, that if she makes it she shall have her glass of wine every day, as if that was really extraordinary. Mamma saw Mr. Arthur lately in the streets.\'a0 He seems to bear his loss well, as I said, only the week before he bought the boy for 600 dollars.\'a0 Mrs. Arthur has had headaches lately, but has not yet been in the state she usually is after her confinements.\'a0 Mrs. Thomas I believe is still suffering with her knee.\'a0 Saturday I went to see her, & she was then not able to put it to the ground. We are all well.\'a0 I would write more to you, if I had received a letter from you.\'a0 I hope you will get a new trial in Miss Green\'92s case.\'a0 Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma that E\'85 had received my letter about the bonnet, & would purchase it, that if I had written the age of the young lady it would have been a guide but as it was she would try & do her best.\'a0 I am certain it will be a pretty bonnet, at any rate prettier than could be got here.\'a0 I will never get a bonnet in Greenville.\'a0 They are always old fashioned. The Drawing room is fixed, & Minerva & Mary are now fixing the Entry.\'a0 Upstairs is whitewashed but nothing else done yet.\'a0 The little dining room now is to be yellow washed.\'a0 I wish every part of the establishment just in order, but it will take a long time.\'a0 Charles is working in the garden, but is called off very often to move furniture.\'a0 I must now stop.\'a0 I went to your Office yesterday to look for writing paper but could find only this coarse kind & saw no ink.\'a0 I am badly off for all materials for writing, so you must make excuses.\'a0 I would not write today I am so busy, but you may be uneasy if you do not hear. So I write. I long to see you.\'a0 I forgot to send last night to the Post office, so do not know if any letters have come.\'a0 Adieu, Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will this afternoon write you a few lines as you told me to though I am very busy.\'a0 After the Mail comes in tonight, if any letter comes for you, I will add a few lines & tell you.\'a0 I intended writing tonight instead of this afternoon, but Anna tells me Susan Hoke is coming over to sleep.\'a0 Her father is away.\'a0 If so I will be engaged with her & would only write a line or so. Willie & Anna commenced Dancing yesterday afternoon.\'a0 They have gone again this afternoon.\'a0 I expect Mrs. Blake will give lessons every afternoon, so she will make a good deal in a short time.\'a0 She had yesterday 19 scholars, but many who intend learning, either did not know of it, or were not prepared, so her school will encrease.\'a0 I have not seen her since Sunday.\'a0 Then she said she would be willing to stay at Mr. Crofts & teach for nothing as many children as paid her board.\'a0 All over Mr. Croft ought to pay for.\'a0 I sent a message to her today, & she was there at Mr. Crofts.\'a0 He has sent down his carriage for her, so I would not be surprised if an agreement is made between them.\'a0 Mrs. Pearson is so anxious her children should learn.\'a0 I carried Mrs. Blake to church Sunday morning & afternoon.\'a0 Mr. Arthur gave us long sermons, in the afternoon an old one.\'a0 Susans Alexander was baptized, & Mrs. Arthurs baby.\'a0 Alexander behaved well, but Mrs. Arthur\'92s baby screamed from beginning to end & seemed to agitate her. \'a0Miss Lewis came this morning before we had done breakfast to practice.\'a0 She says they have heard from Mrs. Thomas lately & she still is obliged to use a crutch.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett paid me a visit this morning, said they would come again, when you were at home.\'a0 They say they have not half read the House of Orleans, & asked if we were in a hurry for it.\'a0 I told them no, they could keep it as long as they pleased.\'a0 Mrs. Poinsett had been to Mr. Arthurs, & she says his negroes have again run away, that 3 of them are in the Charleston Jail.\'a0 I suppose they are from the Contract in Newberry, but I do not know.\'a0 He has trouble enough with his negroes.\'a0 He today has gone to his contract in Anderson.\'a0 I wonder he has time to write such long sermons.\'a0 I carried Fanny to church Sunday afternoon, but she behaved very badly.\'a0 I hope Frank is behaving well.\'a0 Tomorrow the 19
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  is his Birth Day.\'a0 He will be 7 years old.\'a0 Willie says that he misses him, & the house is so much quieter. As I have so much less trouble that I miss him in a very agreeable way.\'a0 \'85I hope travelling will so much improve him, that he will behave well when he comes back. Two letters came for you Sunday night, one from Mr. Jamison saying he had received the half of the bills you had sent & begging you to send on the other half.\'a0 The other letter from Eutaw from Mr. Coleman saying the Court had allowed Washington Foster until October to settle his accounts with the Estate, the reason given, that the money was loaned out & had to be sued for & would not be collected until that time. We have had no rain.\'a0 Charles came in last night, & said they were getting the Farm in good order.\'a0 On Sunday while cutting wood, Reuben hurt his knee with the axe, & told Willie he could hardly walk.\'a0 I saw he walked lame, but he said nothing to me about it.\'a0 This afternoon he has returned early from the farm, & Charlotte told me he said he had come because his knee hurt him.\'a0 He left Lindy to hoe I suppose.\'a0 I have not seen him to ask about it, but will this evening when he brings me the keys. I have no news to tell you.\'a0 I have not been out except to church, & have seen only those who I told you came today & Susan Hoke & Mrs. Blake.\'a0 The walking in this dirty weather is so disagreeable I do not like to go out.\'a0 I have been busy working hardly had time to practice.\'a0 Anna says Mrs. Davis is sick in bed with Rheumatism\'a0\'a0 The pianos Mrs. Davids said were on there way, some of them actually in Hamburg, have taken so long to come, that I rather think he deceived us, & that he never wrote on for any more, until we took the one that came, for if the others had been on the way as he said\'a0 they would have been here before this.\'a0 I think ours a fine Piano.\'a0 I played for Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett, & they both thought it a very fine one, & not expensive.\'a0 I like it too, but still as some others might come I would prefer, I do not intend to decide yet until I see them, & whether you pay or not will make no difference.\'a0 I will still be at liberty to exchange this if I see proper.\'a0 I wish to feel perfectly satisfied with my bargain.\'a0 If I prefer this to any that come I will keep it, & if I do not I will exchange it for the one I like better. The household are well, including horses hogs &c except Reuben\'92s knee being hurt, which I suppose will not prevent his working tomorrow.\'a0 We are well.\'a0 Charles last night said when he went to bed at night\'a0 he was in pain all over.\'a0 I suppose old age & infirmities.\'a0 I am afraid he will not be able to work much longer.\'a0 I will stop & add something tonight.\

	Last night Mrs. Blake was here, so I could not finish my letter.\'a0 She said she would stay at Mr. Crofts, if he would send her down in his carriage every evening, that the walk was too long in the hot sun & would fatigue her, & that she wished a room on an upper story.\'a0 The one they intended giving her, is on the first floor just back from the Drawing room; said she would write a note to him today, & tell him.\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will now send my letter to Col. Town[e]s.\'a0 I have not time to read it over.\'a0 Tell Frank this is his birth day, 7 years old.\'a0 If he behaves well while with you, I will on his return make him a present.\'a0 Reuben is going to the Farm today, though his knee hurts he can work.\'a0Write to me by someone returning before you do.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'a0\'a0\'a0\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You only left this morning, & yet you see I am already writing to you.\'a0 I intended writing tomorrow evening but as it will be Sunday, I will wish to send to Mary & Lindy.\'a0 I thought it best to write some this evening.\'a0 I will as usual tell all that has occurred since you left.\'a0 Fanny did not cry very long. & was quieted by sitting in my lap & eating an apple, & tonight is made happy by being put in my bed to sleep. Mr. Moore came this morning to sell Eggs, & I told him of your paper & that he must take it.\'a0 I did not give him a Prospectus, because I was afraid he would not understand it, & I would rather give them when I have the peice you wrote afterwards, to give along with it, for the Prospectus needs an explanation.\'a0 It has been so unrepresented.\'a0 I sent all of the letters you left to the Post office.\'a0 The boy sent word that the postage would amount to $1.35, & you can charge it to the Printing office.\'a0 The Columbia mail brought your newspapers, & a letter from Mr. Pettigru in answer to the one you wrote him, when Mr. Elford was in the desponding humour.\'a0 He said he hopes you will go on with the paper; that one established now on Constitutional principles he knows will succeed, & will deserve the gratitude of the rising generation; that he thinks the Disunion spirit is already lessening , but it would be better if the State did commit some folly & get into a scrape such as separate State action, for it would bring her to sense of her ill conduct, though it would be mortifying to be laughed at by everybody; that it is vanity more than any other feeling that influences South Carolina, so he think it will soon pass away. He says he will see you in Columbia, so as this is the case it will not be worthwhile to send you his letter, & I can make good use of it here.\'a0 Mr. Pickerell came this afternoon to fix the Clock, & we had a political talk.\'a0 He agrees with you, & I told him of Mr. O\'92Hanlon\'92s & Mr. Petttigru\'92s opinions, & he said he knew them both by reputation, so I offered to loan him the letters to read, at which he seemed pleased, so I lent them.\'a0 He said he went to the Mansion House the other evening to see the Phrenologist, who is a very intelligent person, & Dr. Simons came in & turned the conversation on politics, & said he went for Disunion, & they ought to ask Congress for something\'a0 she \ul could\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  \ul grant\ulnone , & then we would have Disunion.\'a0 Mr. Pickerell said someone went to his shop the other day, & asked him if as a Chemist he could explain how it was that you & Genl Thompson had got together; that he told him \ul you \ulnone were where you had always been, & could not help it if Genl Thompson came over to you.\'a0 All who wish to know ought to ask Genl Thompson to explain it. I see by the Courier the Nashville Convention has adjourned & propose a Southern Congress, & see the death of Mr. Daniel Webster who died suddenly in church. This afternoon I went to see the Miss Anderson\'92s & I explained the State of the country to them.\'a0 They say if you go for the Union they will certainly take your paper.\'a0 They agree entirely with you in Politics.\'a0 They say they had heard nothing of the Meeting & Mr. Memminger until Mr. Cox paid them a visit, & they asked him what he thought of matters, & he said it was generally thought now the time had come to Secede & judging from the Demonstrations in honor of Mr. Memminger that was the popular feeling here & begged him to let him request Mr.\'a0 Cam[p]bell to send his paper to them, so you were either mistaken in thinking Mr. Cox agreed with you; or he has changed; or he is on both sides; but the people are so deceived; it is no wonder they think as they do.\'a0 I look for your paper to enlighten them.\'a0 Until that comes out they will remain in ignorance.\'a0 Miss Anderson says you will\'85with justice, if not now, in years to come; when the children of those now who are opposed to you, will be disgraced on account of the conduct of their fathers.\'a0 So my dear husband, act as your Duty dictates; bring forward a resolution for a Southern Convention; make a noble speech on the subject; that will be handed down to posterity; be sure that you say everything that is true & right & consistent with a Patriot & have it published in the Carolinian.\'a0\'a0 You have been\'85now as much as you can be.\'a0 I think the Editors are tired now they have vented their spleen & cannot find any words stronger to express it.\'a0 Do not vote for \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Memminger\ulnone , \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Burt\ulnone . \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Rion\ulnone , & you know who. I hope you had a pleasant journey down, that the horses did not give out, & Willie & Frank are behaving well.\'a0 As you went off Charles said Scott would give out; that he had a strain in his back; that he was injured before you bought him; that you were cheated by the Drover.\'a0 I hope he is not correct in his opinion.\'a0 Tomorrow night I will finish my letter & tell you of everything else that occurs.\'a0 If it were not for want of space, I would write all\'85longer, but I must leave room for what may occur tomorrow.\'a0 Do not forget Susan Hokes Music, \'93Roll on Silver Moon.\'94\'a0 Miss Anderson tells me she heard Dr. Simons & Mrs. Temple had quarreled.\'a0 I do not know if true or not\'85.Sunday night.\'a0 My dear husband, I will now finish my letter.\'a0 I went to church this morning, & heard an \ul old\ulnone  sermon from Mr. Arthur in praise of the Liturgy, which I expect was not interesting to Col Town[e]s & some other Baptists that were there.\'a0 Mr. Arthur attends to his worldly business all the week, & then Sunday gives us an old sermon.\'a0 This afternoon Mamma sent for me to go & see Susan\'92s baby which was not well, but it is better than it was this morning, & after paying Susan a visit, Mamma & myself rode up the Anderson road\'a0 & stopped at Mr. Tom Butlers house & went over it, & then stopped at Mr. Saxons house where Mr. M\'85 staid & went into that.\'a0 Mrs. Carson is to live there, & they are now preparing to plaster it. so Mr. Carson & Mr. Butler will be near neighbors.\'a0 The day has been so cold.\'a0 I thought tomorrow Charles with Marys assistance had better kill some of the smallest hogs, but he says he has to haul more wood first, & tomorrow he will borrow Mr. Goodletts horse, & put with Selim, & haul a load of wood, & if the next day is cold he will kill some of the hogs.\'a0 A good many persons have killed. I see in the Chronicle & Sentinel Mr. Kings & Mr. Clemens Senators from Alabama expressing the same views you do.\'a0 You must while in Columbia do all you can for the paper.\'a0 Get Mr. Pettigru, Mr. O\'92Hanlon, Mr. Yeadon & all your friends who agree with you to interest themselves in sustaining it.\'a0 They ought all to get subscribers for it, for never has a paper been more traduced or have more to encounter than yours has.\'a0 The State is so provoked that after buying up the Mountaineer & get that in the proper training, another should be started in the very place, that they know is above a\'85& may spoil their game.\'a0Write me every Mail, tell me everything, & tell Willie to write.\'a0 I hope Frank & himself are doing well, & will return improved & do credit to you.\'a0 Tell them from me, they must be \ul good\ulnone  \ul boys\ulnone .\'a0 They must keep themselves neat & clean, & they must read in the prayer book every morning & night.\'a0 And my dear husband you must act judiciously & wisely.\'a0 I do wish you could have been elected Judge or some honorable Office that the world might see you had at least met with your reward for people are apt to think until persons are rewarded, that they do not deserve i, & my ambition is you should be appreciated by others, & you seem further from it now than ever, but I must be resigned & hope that even you will meet with your reward & I believe if you were more anxious for it, you would.\'a0 Adieu, your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Reuben returned this evening, but brought no letter from you, for which I was very sorry; but\'a0 I hope you were so busy talking to Col. Brockman enlightening him & others that it left you no time to write to me.\'a0 I am glad you reached Mr. Felkes in safety, & that the horses did not give out as Charles predicted.\'a0 Reuben says they are well, only tired, so they shall rest awhile. You are now in Columbia in the midst of the excitement.\'a0 The papers that came today, I see are full of Judge Cheves speech, but I do not intend to read it, as I have not you to do away any impression it might make on me.\'a0 I thought I would try & enlighten someone, so I sent some papers last night to Mr. Nicol to read, the Chronicle & Sentinel containing Mr. King & Mr. Clemens\'92 speeches, & another with Judge Nes\'85 letter, & he said he would read anything I sent him.\'a0 A letter today came from Mr. Thomas McLure of Chester C.H. begging you to send him the first number of your paper & mentioning a gentleman\'a0 to whom you must also send it, as he thought they would like to subscribe for it.\'a0 The names of the gentlemen were John Rosborough Esqr, Chester C.H.; Peter Wylie, Do; Dr. A.P. Wylie, Do; James Drennan Esqr., Chesnut Grove; Danl. G. Stenson Esqr, Cedar Shoal; William Heath, [Do]; William Moffat, Lewisville, Chester District; William A. Rosborough, [Do]; James Hemphill, Esqr, Chester C.H. I went to see the Miss Andersons yesterday afternoon to carry them some books & papers.\'a0 Miss Anderson told me Mr. Cox told her, that Slavery was \ul abolished\ulnone  in the District of Columbia, so either he is very ignorant, or he says, what he knows is not so.\'a0 I almost wish the State would secede this winter, get into a scrape as Mr. Pettigru says, & then perhaps she would be brought to her senses.\'a0Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.\'a0 I did not say anything wrong that you would have disapproved, but I expressed the state of matters to him & how the paper originated &c, & he was very mild, & agreed with me in all I said about Politics &c; said Mr. Watson presented the Southern Association paper to him to sign it.\'a0 He told him before he was a Minister he was a Democrat, but now he had done with Politics.\'a0 So now I have seen Mr. Arthur & talked to him.\'a0 I have better feelings towards him than I had.\'a0 I think I gave him a great deal of information.\'a0 But I think the Episcopal Church on account of the \ul Members\ulnone , it is composed of, it is really high time now for me to leave.\'a0 Who do you think has joined it?\'a0 Why \ul Mrs.\ulnone  \ul Choice\ulnone  that vindictive ill tempered woman.\'a0 She is still a Baptist in heart. So she was not satisfied with sprinkling, or she thought that not sufficient to wash away her sins, so yesterday she was \ul emersed\ulnone  by Mr. Arthur, & next Sunday is Communion Sunday, so I suppose she will commune.\'a0 Mrs. Joe Powel who I met at the Miss Andersons told me that when she was ill, she heard Mr. Arthur administered the Sacrament to her; so if so, it was after taking that solemn ordinance, she went to Mr. Nicol so infuriated because she had voted for you so it had certainly not changed her heart, or improved her temper.\'a0 The Lords Supper is a feast of \ul Love\ulnone , & when I think of Mrs. Jones who said she \ul hated\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone ; Mrs. Choice & Mrs. Walker who \ul hate\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone , Mrs. Rowland who has always seemed so unfriendly to us \ul both\ulnone , Dr. Crittenden who is so violent against you; Dr. Irvine who is ready now to see his count[r]y in war & bloodshed; I cannot but think it is sacrilegious\'a0 to unite with such; so next Sunday I do not think I can feel it my duty to go to the Episcopal church.\'a0 I am afraid I will commit a greater sin in going than staying away. Tonight a letter has come from Mr. W.M.D. Crowder, Due West, asking for a place in the office of the Southern Patriot.\'a0 He says he can work either at the Case or Press, & the terms whatever is usually paid to Journeymen in the upcountry offices; says he can give you references as to attention to Duty.\'a0 Two Chronicles & Sentinels have come, & that is all. Last Saturday night a Mr. Campbell from Anderson came to see you on business, but he said the business was not important. The children & myself are well.\'a0 When Fanny was saying her prayers, I told her to pray that Papa, Willie & Frank might come safe home, & she said \'93bring Papa, Mr. Duncan Willie & Frank safe home.\'94 Eliza & Minerva as usual are complaining.\'a0 I never knew so much cramp in the stomach as they have.\'a0 Minerva sent in this morning for some Brandy, because she had cramp in the stomach, & then sent word to say she could not work, & she has been in her room all day.\'a0 When she sends for Brandy again, I will send her pepper or pepper tea, for as the spirits do not cure her, it is no use to waste it.\'a0 If all persons made as much fuss as she & Eliza do, in their situations, it would really be dreadful.\'a0 Theye not delicate creatures indeed.\'a0 I hope Willie & Frank have behaved well, & given you no trouble.\'a0 I long to hear from you.\'a0 I have very little to write about.\'a0 I hope though in the \ul minority\ulnone , you will have a pleasant time in Columbia. Dr. Simons scholars are to \ul speak\ulnone  in the Methodist church next Friday morning, & receive Diplomas; young ladies, mind Susan Hoke says in his advertisement he says his school has been most flourishing, consisting of a \ul majority\ulnone  of the respectable families in Greenville, that it is entirely a Southern Institution; & he hopes that parents will send to him, instead of sending to Philadelphia & New York, that he will assist in establishing that \ul non\ulnone  \ul intercourse\ulnone  with the North, so desirable at the present time. Mrs. Temple is going away, so I dare say, she & Dr. Simons did have a quarrel.\'a0 He has angered\'a0 another teacher an English lady I heard, & yet he says his institution is all \ul Southern\ulnone .\'a0 Any humbug can succeed, after him.\'a0 I was at Susan\'92s this afternoon, her baby is well now.\'a0 Send Susan Hoke\'92s Music by Mail.\'a0 It is \'93Roll on Silver Moon.\'94\'a0 It is now time to stop.\'a0 I will have more to write about when I hear from you.\'a0 As soon as the weather gets cold, the hogs shall be killed.\'a0 Charles killed the smallest one\'a0 yesterday, was to give us some fresh meat.\'a0 Good night, your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.\'a0 You must write me \ul every\ulnone  \ul Mail\ulnone .\'a0 I live on your letters & think on the contents of one, until I get another.\'a0 Your news as regards Politics is cheering, but I am afraid you are mistaken.\'a0 It is a bad idea for Judge Cheves to be thought of as Governor, & I think would be unpropitious\'a0 for the State.\'a0 Mr. Memminger with his usual hypocrisy, begins with appealing to the Most High, & re commencing a \ul Fast\ulnone .\'a0 He thinks after \ul this\ulnone , his sincerity cannot be doubted & he will certainly be made Chancellor.\'a0 Do you \ul vote\ulnone  against him, & do all you \ul can\ulnone  \ul against\ulnone  him.\'a0 He has done more to cause the excitement, at any rate in Greenville, than any other man.\'a0 He has \ul deceived\ulnone  the people, & told absolute falsehoods to gain his worldly ends, & then at the same time, pretends he is such a Christian.\'a0 He uses both worlds. As for Mr. Jones, he is as contemptible & mean a man as ever lived.\'a0 He occasions me more vexation than anyone else, for he is constantly doing something so mean.\'a0 He gets what he can from the Anti Bank men, & then what he can from the Bank men.\'a0 It seems as if he pursues the course to get along, for instead of being treated with the \ul contempt\ulnone  he deserves, he is \ul rewarded\ulnone .\'a0 By treachery he gats into the Legislature, & now by Treachery, he will be elected Solicitor, for it only requires electioneering to succeed.\'a0 Court both parties, & he will get what he wishes.\'a0 If he is elected Solicitor, I will never get over it.\'a0 It will be too provoking to think of, & I have no doubt he will, for he is a better Electioneerer\'a0 than Mr. Young.\'a0 He is a Member which is an advantage, & he will by his vanity & conceit make the impression that he is a very important man at home.\'a0 He is no better than Joe P\'85.\'a0 It is strange he should ever have been tolerated in Greenville, but it seems as if he can act just as mean as he chooses, & yet he is thought not the less of.\'a0 I hope Mr. Duncan is now convinced of his \ul true\ulnone  character. Mr. Burt\'92s deceit equals his malice. He has injured you as much as he possibly could\'a0 killed your paper in Pendleton as Mr. Keith said, & now to gain your \ul vote\ulnone , tells a falsehood, & says he ordered your peice to be published.\'a0 He did no such thing, & he must think you a Simpleton, to try to deceive you so\'85.\'a0 I hope you have more sense & spirit than to be taken in by him.\'a0 Tell him from \ul me\ulnone , that you have \ul my\ulnone  \ul orders\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  to \ul vote\ulnone  for him, that if you vote for him, I will \ul never\ulnone  \ul forgive\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I look upon him, as having helped, more than anyone else, to defeat you for Congress, & you are not to turn round & \ul help\ulnone  \ul him\ulnone  to what he wishes.\'a0 With the exception of Mr. Jones, he is one of your greatest enemies, insignificant men, those even you have a \ul contempt\ulnone  for can injure & ruin you.\'a0 The\ul \'85\ulnone in Cuba can undermine & destroy the strongest foundations.\'a0 Mr. Burt need not trouble himself about amusing Willie & Frank.\'a0 He shows his interested motive too plainly. I am glad Willie & Frank have behaved well.\'a0 You must be particular in making them keep themselves clean, have their boots cleaned, their hair parted nicely & smooth, & combed every night with a fine tooth comb.\'a0 They must clean their teeth, wear their gloves when they go out, & keep their clothes brushed, & then behave like little gentlemen.\'a0 Tell them I hope to hear constantly good accounts of them.\'a0 You must get a good supply of clothes for yourself, everything you need. I am glad Col. Brockman is right in Politics.\'a0 I was fearful not seeing the \ul right\ulnone  side of the question he might go wrong.\'a0 I am pleased also that the prospects for your paper are encouraging.\'a0 Mr. Elford ought to act for awhile as agent in Charleston.\'a0 Miss Anderson told me she wished she had thousands to assist in sustaining the paper, that she would take it of course, & you would find persons springing up in every direction\'a0 who would take it.\'a0 Now you are in Columbia & see persons from every part of the State.\'a0 You must not be backwards in asking them to subscribe & do all they can for it.\'a0 Do not forget to stop the Palmetto Banner.\'a0 I saw Mr. S\'85ham the other evening & gave him Mr. O\'92Hanlon, Mr. Pettigrus, & Mr. McLures letters to read to encourage him.\'a0 Mr. Nicol today sent to ask me\'a0 if I had heard any interesting new[s] from Columbia to let him know the items.\'a0 You must tell me all the news, so I may tell others.\'a0 I wish the Mountaineer would let you write for it.\'a0 You can tell the people in that way so much, & influence them right.\'a0 Anything written for that paper now, by the other party will be entirely false.\'a0 Mr. Jones\'92 treachery ought to be known.\'a0 He\'92ll not tell it, but I dare say he will gain by it. In future,\'a0 instead of being treated with the contempt he deserves, he will get \ul both\ulnone  Bank & Anti Bank votes.\'a0 I always knew he was for the bank, for I dare say he is indebted to it in some way. Either borrowed, or other borrowed for him. Minerva has now been 3 days in her room doing nothing, says she cant come out to lift pots & pans.\'a0 I tell her she can have Charotte to help her, but she is not satisfied with that.\'a0 She wishes Mary & Lindy, & with the small family I now have, & so little cooking, it is not necessary to have a grown woman & herself to cook, so she stays in her room.\'a0 I try Bakers bread, & have tea & toast & Eggs & Charlotte looks after the servants.\'a0 She makes more fuss than Mrs. Sharpe with her delicate health.\'a0 Eliza is up now & sewing.\'a0 Reuben instead of wearing his own hat to travel, borrowed a new one of Charles & returned\'a0 a different one to Charles from the one he sent him.\'a0 Reuben says it must have got changed.\'a0 Charles says he knows he sold it, & pocketed the money.\'a0 He was in a great passion, when he found it out, but now he is calm & says you will make Reuben pay him.\'a0 The horses have rested now, & today Reuben hauled Mr. D\'85 a load of wood\'a0 & brought me 50 cts.\'a0 It has been raining all day, so he hauled only 1 load.\'a0 Mr. Davis went somewhere today on business, so Anna has holiday until Monday.\'a0 Tomorrow Dr. Simons scholars speak in the Methodist church.\'a0 He has but 2 boarders, but his school breaks up for the holidays this week, Miss Anderson was here this morning to borrow books.\'a0 She says she hopes you will buy the 3d vol of McCaulay\'92s history of England in Columbia.\'a0 She is anxious to see it.\'a0 If you can get the continuation of \'93Laneton Parsonage,\'94 I would like it.\'a0 I have the first one & a second & a third I think have been published.\'a0 Also the\'85Daughter by the same author, & there is a Book called \'93the lady Alice or the new Una,\'94 which Mr. Brown mentioned as being very fine, I would like, but I only mention in case you have a Book mania\'a0 as usual.\'a0 Whatever you get, must be something pretty.\'a0 Mamma wrote today to know if I had heard from you.\'a0 She is as much interested in your interests as I am.\'a0 The Chronicle & Sentinel has two speeches by Mr. King & Clemens of Alabama, which are very good.\'a0 You must get the paper & read them.\'a0 If you make a speech, you will find them of service.\'a0 I would send you the paper, but I make great use of them.\'a0 Mr. Arthur has them now.\'a0 Mr. Clemens says from Maryland, N. Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky & Texas & Delaware some of their men have voted for the admission of California, so we must secede from them too.\'a0 Mr. Jones goes to Columbia tomorrow, no letters but what I have mentioned have come.\'a0 Good night, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received Willie\'92s & your letters today & was very much pleased with them.\'a0 
\f2\i \'a0
\f0\i0 I wish you would write me two or three letters every Mail in your absence.\'a0 They are my only comfort.\'a0 Mail days I watch for the hour hand to point to 12.\'a0 Tell Willie his was a pretty letter, & he must write me a longer one.\'a0 If you buy him so many books, you must buy such as I would like, any works by Mrs. Howitt is good, buy Mrs. Sherwoods works, Mrs. O\'85\'92s, Miss Sewel\'92s.\'a0 There was a work called Evenings at Donaldson Manor, mentioned lately in the Carolinian, if it is not too expensive get, but it was mentioned as being nicely bound & handsomely illustrated, so I expect it is too expensive, & you will have plenty of use for your money, in other ways.\'a0 I do wish you could be elected Chancellor.\'a0 The very thought thrills me.\'a0 You might have let Col. Dudley nominate you & felt your prospects, even if you did not run.\'a0 It is well to be thought of for it, if not now, it will do you good for the future.\'a0 I see Col. B.G. Alston nominated for Governor, & yet I am sure he is not going to run, but it is a compliment for him to be spoken of. Do my dear husband if you think there is a chance of you being elected Judge or Chancellor, or running tolerably well, now, it may be of service to you.\'a0 Genl Whitner who has been beaten so often, perhaps now will be elected.\'a0 Her seems now to have a claim to it, from having been a Candidate so long, but You must not vote for Genl Whitner.\'a0 He has beaten you too badly.\'a0 I hope he will be obliged to continue Solicitor & then that aspirant for Solicitor will be disappointed and otherwise he may not be.\'a0 Mr. Memminger I suppose is conscious how interested his motive was in changing in Politics so he feels compelled to give up the Chancellorship.\'a0 I wish you could be elected.\'a0 It would be wise to let your friends find out for you, how many votes you would be likely to get.\'a0 You could ascertain I should think, beforehand\'a0 how many votes you would get.\'a0 When you ran for President of the Bank, you knew at first you would be beaten, & therefore you ought not to have run.\'a0 You always decline too soon.\'a0 You ought to let your friends find out, before you decline, what your prospects are, & if they find out they are not good, then it is time to decline.\'a0 I am glad Col. Hayne met you kindly.\'a0 I heard he was \'85lent in Politics, so I thought he would look on you as a Traitor & not speak to you.\'a0 I dare say you will see nothing of Mr. Taylor & Mr. Martin\'92s family.\'a0 They are very selfish, & even now to have no regard for us, whose house was once offered to them when they were in reduced circumstances\'a0 & had no home.\'a0 Mamma was like a Mother to Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin, & we were intimate with them\'85of our own cousins, but I now look upon them as less than strangers,\'a0 Eloisa & Sarah are now as cold & selfish as possible.\'a0 I am pleased at you fitting out yourself with new clothes.\'a0 If sack dress coats had been worn, I would have preferred one to a Frock Coat.\'a0 You must get Susan Hokes Music at once, \'93Roll on Silver Moon,[\'93] & send it by Mail, that is if it can be got.\'a0 I am sorry to tell you that Eliza\'92s child did not live a day.\'a0 It was 5 weeks or more too soon, & owing to her falls I suppose. was outwardly bruised & inwardly hurt, & also Mom Phillis not being here in time, might have been bad for it.\'a0 From the fact of its being born alive, I wrote to you in good spirits, thinking it would live, for Mary\'92s that was so delicate lived 5 or 6 weeks, & perhaps longer if she had been careful, but N\'85 came to see Eliza a few hours after, & as soon as she saw it, said she did not think it would live.\'a0 Minerva came out of her room today but has done very little, & I will not give her more to do; let her do as she pleases, but I expect it will\'85with her as it did before; for I have never known two persons complain as she & Eliza have done. Mrs.. Arthur & Miss Lewis paid me a visit this morning. Miss Lewis had on a white Straw bonnet, & did not look near as well as in black.\'a0 She talks very little, if no more to Mr. Campbell she will not trouble him much, but I am glad they continue friendly.\'a0 I feared the paper & Mr. Campbell to be connected with them might have cooled them. Mary has just brought from the office a letter from Mr. George Gordon of Savannah.\'a0 He says he has a Mortgage on the Property lately occupied by Mr. Service, that he contemplated foreclosing & you will be so good as to inform him what time is necessary for the Legal proceedings in this State, & how long a Sale may be postponed after obtaining a decree.\'a0 He says he does not contemplate a public Sale until September, & not then at any\'85& positive sacrifice, rather than this he would desire you at the proper time to bid it in for him, & for your general services in the matter, please state the probable cost of proceedings &c.\'a0 This is all that is in the letter, so perhaps you had better answer it at once. It was suggested to Dr. Simons that it would not be proper for young ladies to speak in a public church, so he is to read the Essays himself.\'a0 It rained so yesterday, he postponed his exhibition as he calls it until Monday.\'a0 He is to \ul confer\ulnone  \ul Degrees\ulnone .\'a0 He is certainly a \ul great\ulnone  \ul Humbug\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad Mr. Fuller found him out, but there are many here, who would patronize him, just to show opposition to the Academy.\'a0 Mr. Brooks children now have left Mr. Davis .\'a0 Two of them go to Mr. Burnham. It would be bad for the State for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor, as he goes for Disunion, so you had better try & get a more reasonable man than he is.\'a0 I dare say his address will have a great effect, in making the State go for Disunion.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 If tomorrow I can think of anything more I will begin another sheet.\'a0 I have a shocking pen.\'a0 Tell Willie I will write to him & Anna will too.\'a0 If you can buy a Male Canary bird bring it to me as my present.\'a0 It will be company for me when I am alone, & the cage ought to be used.\'a0 The Male bird sings. Mr. Rion I suppose was disappointed.\'a0 Because he was a prot\'e9g\'e9 of Mr. Calhoun he thought he would be elected I expect.\'a0 Mr. Calhoun really is to cost the State a good deal.\'a0 He would be satisfied if he knew how he was remembered.\'a0 You must write to Mr. S\'85 & others here & inform him & them of Politics &c as you have no other way of informing.\'a0 I am glad Frank is behaving pretty well.\'a0 Tell Willie he must not read books so fast.\'a0 He must borrow them from the Book\'85.\'a0 Good night, E.F.P.\'a0 Mamma is glad to hear all the news.\

	I will add a little more now, though not of much importance.\'a0 I read the services at home this morning, & sent Anna & Frank to church.\'a0 This afternoon we rode to Susans.\'a0 She is quite well.\'a0 The baby suffers a good deal with cholic. Charles tells me that Col. Irvine has sold Jim as a \ul first\ulnone  rate \ul Carpenter\ulnone  for 900 dollars, to someone in Aiken.\'a0 He forgot when he was selling him for himself of that \ul protuberance\ulnone , which would always prevent his being a Saleable negro, and he forgot he bought him from you as a \ul learner\ulnone  in his trade.\'a0 How Drovers do deceive they live by cheating. Mr. Ford is Mamma\'92S \ul first\ulnone  \ul cousin\ulnone .\'a0 He is very wor\'85, is poor, & has a large family, so vote for him, & get Mr. Duncan & Col. Brockman, & as many others as you can influence Col. Dudley & Mr. Goodwin &c.\'a0 The two Heywards who are members, are also our cousins.\'a0 If you come in contact with them, be polite.\'a0 Indeed you ought to be friendly & polite to all the Members & it will make them kindly disposed to you. I am afraid you will spend too much money in buying books for Willie.\'a0 I would like him gratified, but you will have need for money when you come home in paying Anna\'92s school bills which will be large, your Doctors bills &c. I forgot to tell you that Miss Anderson does not wish what Mr. Cox told her repeated.\'a0 She says he spoke rather in confidence.\'a0 Her objection to Mr. Arthur is that he leans to P\'85terism, but this also they told me as a great secret, so you must not repeat it. I am glad Col. Preston has been elected to the College, & hope Mr. Barnwell will be reelected Senator.\'a0 Mr. Rhett has tried too hard.\'a0 Mr. Barnwell is better than either himself or Mr. Hammond.\'a0 It would be very bad for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor now, as he goes so for Disunion.\'a0As regards the Chancellorship, you know I would rather you be Chancellor or Judge than anything else, so when you think there is a chance of you being elected, you must for \ul my\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone , \ul try\ulnone .\'a0 I think when your friends propose it to you, you are wrong to decline, you ought to let them electioneer for you, & ascertain what your strength is, & then if you find your prospect not good, it is time enough to decline.\'a0 What I blame you for is refusing too soon, so in future act more wisely.\'a0 Others know better how you would run than you do yourself, so\'a0 you ought to let them ascertain, & then determine.\'a0 I am sure you are superior to the other Candidates, & the Upper Country needs a Chancellor.\'a0 The other two Candidates being from the lower country would divide the votes, so perhaps one from the Upper Country would run well.\'a0 Col. Dawkins & Whitner have no claims as Judge I am sure,\'a0 for they are\'85of them are superior.\'a0 You know how things are better than I do.\'a0 All I say is, you must not \ul decline\ulnone  what honors are offered to you \ul too\ulnone  \ul soon\ulnone ; by waiting awhile, you might find things in your favor.\'a0 Genl Whitner did not vote for you for Congress.\'a0 It is raining now.\'a0 All day has been damp & drizzly.\'a0 The winter continues so warm, there is no prospect of killing hogs now.\'a0 I am sorry I have so bad a pen.\'a0 I dislike sending so shabby a letter.\'a0 I wish you would write me several sheets every Mail.\'a0 I long for the time when I will hear every day.\'a0 Tell Willie & Frank Howdy & to behave well.\'a0 Fanny was looking at my picture the other day, & she said, \'93this is Fanny\'92s Mother.\'94\'a0 Good night, your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today, written last Saturday.\'a0 I was very glad to hear from you.\'a0 The next winter when you go to Columbia you must leave the children at home, & carry me instead.\'a0 I hope you spent a pleasant day at Col. O\'92Hanlons, but would rather if possible, you should have gone to church, & spent fast day with\'85.\'a0 I think it very hypocritical to appoint a fast day, to pray to the Almighty to help out of difficulties, that the State has \ul brought\ulnone  on \ul herself\ulnone  & wishes to \ul bring\ulnone .\'a0 I for one cannot help it.\'a0 I see in your resolutions you speak of the aggressions of the North.\'a0 I have always argued that the North has \ul not\ulnone  aggressed, but on the contrary as Judge Nesbit said, done more for the South lately than she has done for the last fourteen years, that California had a right to exclude Slavery, & Congress a right to admit her a State, that the Wilmot Proviso had been abandoned.\'a0 The Fugitive Slave law passed, & Slavery trade being abolished in the District of Columbia was what many Southerners approved of, & I thought you argued in the same way, so where are the aggressions of the North?\'a0 Mr. Clemens says many Southerners voted for the admission of California.\'a0 The Southern States that are satisfied ought not to be made to take a part even in a Southern Convention.\'a0 If they are satisfied, let them remain so.\'a0 South Carolina only thinks herself ill treated, so let her fight it out herself, so I hope she will get well beat, & be taught a lesson she will never forget, only you, have \ul not\ulnone  \ul helped \ulnone to bring on the difficulty, shall not help them out of it.\'a0 Dr. Crook & Col. Town[e]s & others may be the \ul first\ulnone  to fight.\'a0 Mr. Memminger has done more than anyone to bring on the difficulty, & \ul wishes\ulnone  it & then appoints a fast Day to pray for help & direction &c.\'a0 You have not mentioned Mr. B\'85ly.\'a0 He seemed so friendly to you.\'a0 I suppose you will see him, unless Politics may have made a change in his feelings.\'a0 I am glad Dr. Lieber & Mr. Williams are Union men.\'a0 I can sympathize with Dr. Liebers finding it a treat to have one like you to talk to, for I find it a treat to go to see the Miss Andersons, who are warm for the Union.\'a0 You must interest yourself in getting subscribers for the Southern Patriot.\'a0 I hope Mr. Frederick Ford has been elected & that you voted for him, for he is needy.\'a0 I see in the paper, the first ballot he was 2 votes behind. In the legislature they seem to be getting warm, from their resolutions I suppose it is all for effect.\'a0 It is strange after Mr. Memminger changed his Politics to be made Chancellor, that he should decline running.\'a0 I suppose of course he would\'a0 have been elected.\'a0 If you find there is a prospect of your being elected, you must try your chance.\'a0 You ought to let your friends electioneer for you, & inform you, what they think. You must be on your guard against Pickpockets, even if you have but little in your pocket.\'a0 I yesterday paid Mr. Payne\'92s beef bill, & today Mr. Randolph sent his, but I declined paying it.\'a0 I have bought Tea & Turkeys & do not wish to be quite out of funds so I leave it for you to pay; so recollect you will need money when you come home.\'a0 Willie mentioned you have bought me a pencil & pen, but I am sorry you have, for I have a pencil now & a quill pen I prefer to any other, because it has a \ul finer\ulnone  \ul nib\ulnone , & I told you expressly to bring me no present, if you\'85I would always rather fix upon something I really want.\'a0 I sent your letter to Col. Town[e]s to read, because I wanted him to see what kind of person Mr. Jones was, who I dare say he had begun to think highly of, merely because on the Southern question he pretended to agree with him, & there was nothing in your letter to prevent my showing it to him, except that Genl Thompson had written you in connection with the paper, & as I knew there was such a prejudice against him, I saved a\'85paper on that fact so he could not read it.\'a0 There was nothing else in the letter but what could with propriety be published to the world.\'a0 There was no domestic matter discussed, nothing that would have been indelicate to show. It is raining now & has been all day.\'a0 It puts a stop to the servants doing any work.\'a0 The clothes are not even dry enough to iron.\'a0 The roads are too muddy to haul wood.\'a0 Our groundnuts cannot be dried.\'a0 Eliza is doing pretty well.\'a0 Minerva is out of her room but I gave her very little to do. Dr. Simons exhibition took place yesterday at the Methodist church.\'a0 Susan Hoke attended & gave me an account of it.\'a0 He himself made a long speech & praised himself greatly for having performed his part so conscientiously to his scholars.\'a0 He read the Essays of the young ladies.\'a0 One of them was on the impropriety educating children at the North & using the\'85of their imbibing Northern principles, that at the North they received but a superficial education; encouraging \ul Northern\ulnone  \ul Teachers\ulnone  at the \ul South \ulnone ought also to have been treated of, but of course that was understood.\'a0 Dr. Simons gave the Degrees to four young ladies, to each of whom he made a speech in Latin. & strange to say those very young ladies are coming back to his school next year, & yet are called the graduating class, rather different from colleges in general. Tonight two letters have come from the Post Office, one from Mr. G.W.P. Pool, Dekalb Kemper County Mississippi.\'a0 He says he is a native of this District.\'a0 He understands\'a0 you have established a paper for the purpose of advocating the principles of the Union party, not only in your State, but in the South generally.\'a0 He knows you by reputation, & is satisfied the principles of any \ul party\ulnone , will not suffer in such hands.\'a0 He knows nothing of the terms, or even the name of your paper, but you will please send it to him, & he will remit the amount of subscription as soon as he knows the amount due. The other letter is dated Harrisburg, S.C.\'a0 The name I cannot decipher, but I will write it as he has, & perhaps you will find it out.\'a0 It is signed D.W.C. L\'85son.\'a0 The letter says Mr. Isaac Kennedy wishes you to send him the prospectus of the Southern Patriot & he will try & get subscribers for you.\'a0 The person who writes the letter is the Post Master at Harrisburg, S.C. So as Miss Anderson said, subscribers are springing up, one place & another.\'a0 I think you have received encouragement already.\'a0 I am thinking, suppose a Southern Convention does assemble & determines to go for a Dissolution of the Union, you will be\'85the very thing you wish to avoid, whereas letting the other States alone, South Caroline will find it impossible to dissolve the Union herself & therefore will have to give it up so do you not think it best to let her take her own course, & see what she is going to do.\'a0 Of course you not assisting her but maintaining your position, disapproving of separate State action 7c.\'a0 But you know not.\'a0 I merely tell my thoughts.\'a0 But I wish you would be quietly enrolled among Chancellors & Judges, one of whom I hope to see you, if not now, at another time.\'a0 Do you really think now, if you \ul tried\ulnone  for it, that you would be elected; you ought to let Col. Dudley find out for you.\'a0 I am\'85Willie & Frank are doing well.\'a0 E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter this morning.\'a0 I carried Mamma to see Mrs. Senious, & on our way back stopped at the Post Office & saw a good many gentlemen there.\'a0 Butler Thompson came to the carri[a]ge & spoke to us.\'a0 He looks badly, his face thin & his eyes red.\'a0 If he were not a \ul Son\ulnone  \ul of\ulnone  \ul Temperance\ulnone , I would think he had been \ul indulging\ulnone  \ul freely\ulnone .\'a0 He says he hardly thinks he will be able to move in all winter, the roads are so shockingly bad.\'a0 He says he is glad his father is married, & he knows his sister has good sense enough\'a0 to be reconciled too.\'a0 He thinks that in 6 months the \ul Union\ulnone  party in this State will be in the \ul ascendancy\ulnone , that all the firey resolutions are introduced by young men of no influence, & I thoroughly agree with him, but \ul since\ulnone  your letter I think differently, as you say it is a \ul fixed\ulnone  & \ul settled\ulnone  purpose among the Politicians to \ul dissolve\ulnone  the \ul Union\ulnone .\'a0 I think now they will go on, & that things look very gloomy.\'a0 Mamma is uneasy, for fear her little income even, may suffer in the general desolation, that the bank questions will be disturbed.\'a0 What do you think, tell me, so I can relieve her. So Genl Whitner is at last elected Judge.\'a0 His wishes are at length gratified & how little did he deserve it, when he is not even a superior lawyer, but \ul perseverance\ulnone  will gain anything, & ambition with it, & you are wanting certainly in the \ul latter\ulnone .\'a0 So you will never be, I am afraid more\'85than you are now, but I do hope you will try to be on the bench the first vacancy.\'a0 I am glad the children have dined at Mr. Taylors, for I would have felt very much provoked if they had not noticed them, & thought Mrs. Taylor wanting in every feeling of kindness & gratitude.\'a0 You must do as you think best about sending Frank home, but if he is behaving \ul well\ulnone , you had better keep him as a companion for Willie, who would be entirely dependent on \ul you\ulnone , if Frank leaves, & you will feel less at liberty to go where you please.\'a0 The next winter if nothing unforeseen occurs, \ul I\ulnone  will go with you, & leave the children at home.\'a0 Mamma says she will come in & take care of them.\'a0 Susan is glad to hear of Mr. McBee.\'a0 He has not written once, since he left; it is out of his way to write.\'a0 In your \ul next\ulnone , if he has not left, tell what time he will set off.\'a0 Old Mrs. Turpin is dead.\'a0 I heard it today, so if Mr. Felder wishes the land, he will have to apply to some of the family.\'a0 The old Man has been ill some time.\'a0 Miss Lewis, if is \ul said\ulnone . Is to be married the 12
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of this month tonight week. She & Mr. Campbell have made quick work of it, & will get acquainted after they are married. We went to see Mrs. Simons this morning.\'a0 She seems in good spirits.\'a0 She says next year their boarders will be entirely a \ul new\ulnone  set.\'a0 I thought to myself she would always find that the case.\'a0 Mrs. Temple she says is an old Sharper, that she sent in such extravagant bills to the Music scholars.\'a0 Dr. Simons had to interfere, that for instruction books that would get at Mr. Rowands for \ul 50\ulnone  \ul cts\ulnone , she bought at that price & \ul charged\ulnone \'85scholars for the Music they took.\'a0 She would charge at 5 dollars worth, when they had only taken 2 dollars worth &c, so in this instance I suppose Dr. Simons for a\'85was not to blame. Mrs. Choice asked Mrs. Temple to stay with her for a few days, & she took up her abode, so Mrs. Simons says, but I think Mrs. Choice could have gotr rid of her if she needed it.\'a0 She ertainly must have liked her company. Anna wrote a letter last night to Willie, which I enclose.\'a0 I hope you will think she has improved in penmanship.\'a0 Mamma got lately a letter from Aunt Eliza.\'a0 She alludes to Politics.\'a0 She forgets we were at the North during the Nullification excitement & therefore had not our feelings enlisted then as \ul she\ulnone  had, & most probably we would also, having but one side, & that we are at liberty now to think for ourselves, & she is so afraid Mamma will be influenced by \ul you \ulnone & think contrary to Uncle Robert\'92s old sentiments, who of course none of the family ought to be presumptuous enough to differ from, that she says, \'93I think of those who are gone, whose feelings & efforts would have been with us at this time, & by whose\'85& sentiments \ul mine\ulnone  were formed.\'a0 Our leading men will find it \ul hard\ulnone \'a0 to restrain the people, for \ul they\ulnone  are ready \ul every\ulnone  \ul where\ulnone  to peril \ul every\ulnone  thing rather than submit to their oppressors & the evil must be met at \ul some\ulnone  time.\'a0 I \ul know\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone  , nor can anyone \ul now\ulnone  what this lessor with bring forth.\'94\'a0 This is her great wisdom.\'a0 I would like to ask her \ul one\ulnone  question, if the \ul South\ulnone  is so \ul oppressed\ulnone  why not the other Southern States \ul feel\ulnone  it besides South Carolina.\'a0 They are really insensible to the great oppression they are labouring under, & are obliged to be told of it by South Carolina, but I suppose the Patriotism of the South has been monopolized so by this State, there is none left for the others.\'a0 If you make a speech in favour of your resolutions, do make a noble effort, one that will carry conviction to every mind.\'a0 As you have espoused the unpopular side, you must sustain yourself by unanswerable arguments.\'a0 The minority are not even given credit for \ul disinterestedness\ulnone , which they certainly deserve, for they lose all hopes of advancement to honour & distinction, & gain only ill will.\'a0 I am sorry now Col. Preston was reelected to the College, as he has such Disunion sentiments.\'a0 Genl Thompson is about the only Nullifier that has changed, & I wish he had not, for he has injured the cause, & I expect after all his change is from an interested motive.\'a0 I am sorry he subscribed for the paper.\'a0 Mr. Jones is not of as much importance as he thinks.\'a0 I hope Mr. Duncan will never have confidence in him again.\'a0 He ought to have had sense enough to have known before this what he was.\'a0 I suppose he will comfort himself with the idea, that if he \ul had\ulnone  \ul run\ulnone , he would have been \ul elected\ulnone .\'a0 There are some persons so conceited, nothing pulls down their vanity.\'a0 I suppose he thought the \ul head\ulnone  of the \ul ticket\ulnone  would aspire to anything. I hope you dined at Col. Hamptons, that Willie did not prevent your accepting invitations, as he did last Session.\'a0 \'a0 I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to buy me a sack or Polled\'85warm for the winter.\'a0 It will not amount to even 10 dollars & the shawl you bought me is too thin for the coolest weather.\'a0 I expect to pay for it out of some of the money you left me & what Reuben makes for hauling wood, so you may not feel the effects of it, & it is the only thing I am going to get this winter.\'a0 I have 3 dollars now independent of what you gave me, & I hope to make more.\'a0 Charles brought me 1 dollar for building a chimney, & Reuben 2 dollars. I wrote Aunt Mary to send it by someone going to Columbia, but if she could find no one to take it, to send it on the Rail Road to the \ul Depository\ulnone  in Columbia directed to \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 She will send it I suppose the \ul beginning\ulnone  of \ul next \ulnone week.\'a0 From \ul Monday \ulnone you must look in the Newspaper. Where I believe all things sent to the Depository are advertised.\'a0 The \ul names \ulnone of the persons to whom the things are sent, I believe are always mentioned, so you must be on the \ul look out from Monday\ulnone  & by the \ul first \ulnone opportunity send it to me, \ul before \ulnone you know if anyone can \ul bring \ulnone it but do not \ul trust \ulnone it , except by \ul some\ulnone  \ul person \ulnone sent otherwise I am afraid\'a0 it might get lost. Mamma wants you to inquire for her the price of nice writing desks.\'a0 Mention the different kinds you see that are very nice & the prices from 3 to 5 dollars.\'a0 She wishes to buy one, & she wishes you to buy her some \ul Clover\ulnone & \ul Blue Grass\ulnone  seed, enough to plant her lawn.\'a0 You must buy me \ul nothing at\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry you bought me the pen & pencil.\'a0 You know I have a pencil & I do not need a pen, & I would rather you have saved your money.\'a0 I wish the men would take it back.\'a0 Tell Willie & Frank to behave well & keep themselves neat & do credit to me.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today, & as usual was very much pleased to hear from you.\'a0 In the Courier that came today, I read a letter of Mr. Poinsetts.\'a0 I am \ul delighted \ulnone he is still for the Union.\'a0 That among the changes he is still the \ul same\ulnone .\'a0 How well he explains the position the State w\'85 to assume, like a person throwing \ul himself\ulnone  from a precipice with the expectation of hurting his \ul enemy\ulnone .\'a0 I sent it up tonight to Mr. Arthur to read, sent him word.\'a0 I knew he would like to read anything Mr. Poinsett wrote, & it was so good I could not keep it to myself.\'a0 He sent word he would be very glad to read it.\'a0 I carried it this afternoon to the Miss Andersons to read.\'a0 On the way I met Dr. Crook & told him I had just read a letter of Mr. Poinsett\'92s.\'a0 He asked on what subject.\'a0 I said the state of the times.\'a0 I wanted to add, that I was glad he was one who had remained firm, but I thought he would make me some pat answer, & the wind was blowing, & I had no time to argue.\'a0\'a0 I know he has changed thinking he is now in the \ul majority\ulnone  & will be elected to the Legislature now, & while he as a Union man he was not. I do long for your paper to begin, to publish Mr. Poinsetts letter & other good things, that if the people would only see would prevent their going astray from the old Union way.\'a0 Old Mr. Miller was here today.\'a0 He took a Prospectus & says he is trying to make up a club, says he will certainly take the paper.\'a0 Mr. Pickerell had showed him your prospectus.\'a0 Do try & get a great many subscribers.\'a0 Do as much as you can for the paper, as you say in Greenville not many take a paper.\'a0 I am sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.\'a0 You ought for once to have omitted going to the Board of Trustees. I cannot help feeling sorry for Mr. Burt, & after you told me he was defeated, felt glad when you told me, you had voted for him, & if you had not. & he had been beaten only by two votes, he would have felt that you were almost the cause of his defeat, that your vote might have influenced another vote, & elected him.\'a0 I dare say if he had been elected, I would have still felt \ul vexed\ulnone  with him, but now I feel very sorry for him, with his large family, but he certainly in future ought to treat\ul  you\ulnone  \ul better\ulnone .\'a0 Frank is wise, he ought not to fast so long between dinner & breakfast.\'a0 He is right to take his lunch at \'bd past 1.\'a0 I hope he will get fat.\'a0 He is determined to take the worth of his board.\'a0 I am glad you have not sent him home.\'a0 He will run in the yard with John, & get ruined, & without him Willie would be lonely, & cling so to you, you could not go where you chose.\'a0 I am afraid he is a favorite with the Members.\'a0\'a0 The Ch\'85\'a0 Doll I expect may be for someone here, directed to me, but I do not know.\'a0 I am provoked you will buy so many books.\'a0 I wish several but do not get them, for fear you cannot afford it, but you buy any kind of books, you have such a\'85on the subject & your books are not suited for the children.\'a0 They are too deep, so in future divide the money in half, & let me select some\'a0 for myself.\'a0\'a0 I wish Mrs. Opie\'92s works, Mrs. Sherwood, Mrs. Howitt, Miss jewett\'92s Miss Bremer\'92s & many others.\'a0 I am saving as much as possible, to buy something warm to wear, & without any thought you lavish your money on books, half of which you do not read.\'a0 It is too provoking. When you come back you have Anna\'92s schooling to pay, which will be a very large bill.\'a0 You have butchers bills to pay.\'a0 Mr. Randolph sent in one of 5 dollars the other day.\'a0 I did not pay it.\'a0 You have Saddlers & Blacksmiths bills, Doctors bills 200 for the paper, Rail Installments 100 dollars to Mr. Rosemond.\'a0 Think of all this & wonder where the money is coming from & then perhaps you will be more prescient.\'a0 I will go with you next winter to keep your purse. It was just as well for you \ul not\ulnone  to speak to Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.\'a0 They do not deserve it, for any attention they have ever paid you. Mrs. Taylor has slighted you always, & if I were to go to Columbia, I would take care to see very little of her \ul myself\ulnone .\'a0 When you speak on the Southern question, make a \ul good \ulnone speech, one that will do you \ul credit\ulnone . Filled with \'85table arguments that will settle the question at once.\'a0 Mr. Poinsett thinks the North has not augg\'85, even in prohibiting the Slave trade in the District of Columbia.\'a0 That is what \ul I\ulnone  \ul think\ulnone .\'a0 I think there is no cause for a Southern Convention even.\'a0 Nothing has occurred as yet to call for one.\'a0 This State seems to think herself so important that it is really an honor for \ul her\ulnone  to remain in the Union.\'a0 I see she is backing out.\'a0 The resolutions say, \'93South Carolina only remains at \ul present\ulnone  in the Union, &c &c.\'a0 I feel vexed with the \ul State\ulnone , as I do with a person.\'a0 She is \ul self\ulnone  \ul conceited\ulnone  & \ul vain\ulnone  & \ul foolish\ulnone , like one of \ul your\ulnone  \ul colleagues\ulnone .\'a0 I think what Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma about politics, was very\'85, knowing that \ul you\ulnone , who were so nearly connected with her, differed entirely from her.\'a0 She speaks as if of course \ul her\ulnone  \ul party\ulnone  was right.\'a0 I was so afraid she might think, my family always having been on the other side, that I felt mortified at your acting differently, that I wrote to Aunt Harriett McCall my views on the subject.\'a0 She has no politicians in her family, & I knew would sisters patient\'85, & I told her I approved of \ul your\ulnone  \ul course\ulnone .\'a0 I \ul agreed\ulnone  with you \ul entirely\ulnone , & if she heard anyone mention your name, to say \ul I \ulnone was with you \ul heart\ulnone  & \ul soul\ulnone , & I was not ashamed of my sentiments.\'a0 I wrote her a \ul long\ulnone  letter, & I wish she would show it to Aunt Eliza.\'a0 I do not wish her to think that I differ with you, & have any sympathy with her.\'a0 The North ought to \ul make\ulnone  S. Carolina \ul leave\ulnone  the Union, & be glad to get rid of her, important as she thinks herself.\'a0 Mr. Moses is really ready for War, talking of defending with swords, & appealing to the god of battle, & the almighty smiling on such a good cause. I want you to buy me some Hops in Columbia, or soon I will not be able to have bread.\'a0 Mamma & myself both wish some.\'a0 I do not see Mr. Thurston\'92s name mentioned as being admitted to practice Law. Old M\'85 Turpin was buried yesterday afternoon in the midst of a \ul hard\ulnone  \ul rain\ulnone .\'a0 The weather is now clear, the wind blowing, & it is getting cold.\'a0 Monday I hope we can kill hogs.\'a0 You must watch for my bundle, for I dare say it will be sent to the Depository, & send it to me the first chance.\'a0 A great many papers are sent now to you directed\'a0 to the Southern Baptist, some today from Louisville, the Washington Republican.\'a0 Thank Willie for his letters.\'a0 You will receive Anna\'92s tonight to him.\'a0 If I have anything more to add tomorrow\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will begin another sheet.\'a0 Mr. Arthur gave out, there would be service Fast day, but he had \ul none\ulnone .\'a0 I did not intend going.\'a0 E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today , & Anna Willie\'92s, for both of which we thank you.\'a0 I am glad to hear so many are opposed to Separate State action, but from the preparations the State is making for arms & Navies, she seems serious.\'a0 Tomorrow you think you will make your speech.\'a0 I hope it will be a good one, & that your resolutions for a Southern Convention will be carried.\'a0 You must have your speech published either in one of the Columbia papers or in pamphlet form, & send it all over the District.\'a0 It is the only way the people can know your views, for in the Mountaineer they will not publish that or anything in your favour.\'a0 I am afraid it will be a long time yet, before the Southern Patriot makes its appearance, for Mr. Elford has not even come yet.\'a0 I suppose Mr. Jones wished to make a speech, so as to turn the attention of the Legislature towards himself, & see how great a man he is, & in consequence elect him Solicitor.\'a0 He will do all Electioneering can do, to gain his ends, but I do hope he will \ul not\ulnone  succeed.\'a0 He also wishes his speech published in the Mountaineer, which strange to say a vain fool like himself now rules, & Mr. Campbell to allude to it as follows, \'93We publish today the \ul able\ulnone  & \ul patriotic\ulnone  speech of our \ul distinguished\ulnone  representative, who stood at the \ul head\ulnone  of the \ul ticket\ulnone .\'94\'a0 Yesterday the invitations for Miss Lewis\'92 wedding were sent out.\'a0 We received one.\'a0 Mamma & Ann & all of the \ul McBee\ulnone  family \ul except Susan\ulnone  & \ul Mr. Luther\ulnone .\'a0 They certainly seem to have slighted them \ul intentionally\ulnone , & how a Minister & his family should act so, is most unchristian like, & though of itself, it is but a little matter, still the motive is not.\'a0 They are evidently vexed with Susan & have taken this opportunity of resenting it, & she could not attend a church with pleasure, whose Minister has unjustly treated her.\'a0 At the time of the baptism as I told you Mrs. Arthur was vexed without \ul any\ulnone  \ul cause\ulnone , but since then they have taken tea at Mamma\'92s, been invited to Susan\'92s, & they seemed friendly.\'a0 Mamma attributes it to Mrs. Jones, who does not speak to Mr. Luther now, because he did not vote for Mr. Jones, & Mr. Luther also (Mr. Campbell I dare say knows) has encouraged the new paper; so Mamma thinks Mrs. Jones told Mr. Campbell to tell Miss Lewis\'a0 not to invite Mr. McBee & Susan.\'a0 But it is all conjecture.\'a0 We only know from whatever came, it is unchristian like to show resentment.\'a0 A \ul great\ulnone  many persons are invited.\'a0 It will be a very \ul large\ulnone  \ul wedding\ulnone , & to be at \ul home\ulnone , not at \ul church\ulnone .\'a0 I never had any thoughts of going.\'a0 I have a contemptible opinion of Mr. Campbell.\'a0 He looks so \ul vain\ulnone  & \ul trifling\ulnone , always laughing\'85.\'a0 The hogs are at Last killed.\'a0 10 were killed yesterday, & 5 today.\'a0 2 of them were so bruised & injured by the other hogs, that Charles has let them out of the pen, one small one we killed soon after you left.\'a0 I am glad now your Corn will be saved.\'a0 Mr. Foster has sent it several times.\'a0 I do not know how much.\'a0 Mr. Davis wrote a letter to you today & got Anna to put it in the Post office, about the time the examination is to take place I believe.\'a0 Susan Hoke was here last night, & she said her Father had written to you.\'a0 I hope that is a good sign, & that he has come out on your side, & it is important to gain him.\'a0 You must write to him, on the subject of Politics in general.\'a0 I sent him Mr. Poinsett\'92s letter to read.\'a0 I have not seen Genl Hamilton\'92s.\'a0 I think you say \ul he\ulnone  has written one.\'a0 I thought you were going to elect Mr. Barnwell \ul again\ulnone  to the Senate.\'a0 I now much prefer him to Mr. Rhett.\'a0 Mr. Rhett is too ambitious, would ruin his county to attain his object, & is too violent a Disunionist to send as Senator.\'a0 I thought also Mr. Pickens had\'85his claims for Governor. No letters have come for you since I wrote, unless some come tonight by the Augusta Mail.\'a0 I hope you will avail yourself of the opportunity of seeing people from so many different places, & get them to interest themselves for the Southern Patriot.\'a0 Keep a list & put down the names of all the subscribers. You must buy some Hops for Mamma & myself, 1 dollars worth between us, if they are to be got in Columbia, also try blue grass & Clover seed for Mamma to sow her lawn, & mention the prices of writing Desks for Mamma, & buy a toy for Vardry.\'a0 As he is you Godson, you ought to remember him sometimes, and it is not the \ul value\ulnone  of the present but the \ul remembrance\ulnone  that Susan likes.\'a0 Susan today has dreadful headache, & her baby is sick constantly, & screams & fatigues her so.\'a0 If Mrs. Arthur knew her every trials, it would give her no pleasure to slight & mortify her, how \ul unchristian\ulnone  like.\'a0 Even I felt sorry for Mr. Burt, who has for years only \ul injured\ulnone  you, & \ul you\ulnone  returned good for evil, so I say if Susan \ul had\ulnone  offended in any way, they ought to forgive, & though it is no great thing to be invited to a wedding, still the not inviting in this instance shows a bad feeling.\'a0 The \ul whole\ulnone  congregation are invited but her, even some of the children of the village, Mr. & Mrs. Davis, & young ladies, Mrs. Arthur dews not even know.\'a0 I thought on account of Mrs. Arthurs ill health, her Mother having died so recently, & in a Ministers family the wedding taking place, it would have been in church & private, but the motive in having so large a one is to make friends for Mr. Campbell. I am glad you were pleased with Anna\'92s letter.\'a0 I expect Mr. David takes more pain with her, than Mr. Irvin does with Willie, but Mr. Davis\'92 account I know will be enormous\'85says Sally Crooks was more than 90 dollars, so think of this when you are buying books.\'a0 Our children are not worse I suppose than others. I wish I could bring them up well, & counteract what failings they have.\'a0 Their chief fault is quarreling with each other, so they appear worse when together, & better when separate, but this visit to Columbia will improve Willie & Frank so much, that when they return home, they will never quarrel again.\'a0 Charles says he will attend to H\'85, who I have no doubt will be very glad to see Willie.\'a0 I have not caught a glimpse of him since you left.\'a0 You must inquire for my bundle, that Aunt Mary McCall is to send me, if not by a private opportunity,\'a0 then to the Depository directed to you, so inquire at the Depository every day, unless you see the advertisement in the paper, of a bundle directed to your care.\'a0 I \ul think \ulnone they used to put them in the paper, but I am not certain.\'a0 You can send Willie & Frank to the Depository every evening. A letter has come tonight from Mr. Burket.\'a0 He says he has now 3 cribs full of Corn, which he thinks is 400 barrels.\'a0 He has sown his wheat, & had a fine season for it.\'a0 He has got the Cotton, & ginned 32 thousand pounds of it.\'a0 He has got up 50 head of hogs.\'a0 They are fat now, & he is going to slaughter some of them now.\'a0 He is getting timber for the Cotton screw & will try to have it done by Christmas.\'a0 He would like to buy some Pork from you & would like to know at what price.\'a0 The negroes are well, the Stocks are well; this is all the news.\

	The weather is still cold.\'a0 Russel Middleton used to be a particular friend of Mamma\'92s.\'a0 His Mother & his Aunt Mrs. Dehon were both intimate friends of Mamma\'92s.\'a0 We staid in the country at his Fathers once, & he was from a child \ul good\ulnone  & \ul pious\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Hutson is some kind of cousin of ours, related to the Colcocks.\'a0 Mr. Burnett we knew at N. Haven, also Nat Heyward we knew there.\'a0 He & his mother are our cousins.\'a0 I am very sorry cousin Frederick Ford was defeated.\'a0 He is good & poor.\'a0 There is not a particle of news to tell you beyond Miss Lewis wedding.\'a0 I\'85, even the Mrs. Gowers, who Mrs. Arthur does not visit which makes it more accountable Susan\'92s not being; from this time we will all certainly have very little to do with them.\'a0 Christians so \ul calling\ulnone  \ul themselves \ulnone have certainly less of kindness, charity & love than any others, but they are \ul not\ulnone  \ul Christians\ulnone  & have no right to the cause.\'a0 Today I suppose you will speak, & I pray may have some effect & present your state\'85herself.\'a0 I hope your resolutions will be adopted.\'a0 E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today.\'a0 I was sorry you had not made your speech, & so been able to give me an account of it.\'a0 I hope they will not cut you out, as Mr. Memminger was last year.\'a0 I see by Mr. Jones remarks he also goes for a Southern Congress, but then adds he is ready to go with the State, & can answer for his constituents.\'a0 Of \ul course\ulnone  as he was \ul head\ulnone  of the ticket, he does not oppose \ul you\ulnone , & as usual goes with \ul both\ulnone  sides.\'a0 That is the politic way.\'a0 He always manages to keep with you, gain \ul your\ulnone  friends, & have his own friends, & the other side too.\'a0 I wonder his vanity did not make him run for Solicitor.\'a0 You say the majority agree with you in reality.\'a0 It seems\'85then,\'a0 You should be the only one abused.\'a0 You ought then to pursue the course they do.\'a0 But what made so much opposition to you in Greenville, was your siding with Genl Thompson, & as he is here so little it is a pity, you should be injured by \ul him\ulnone , but in truth I do dislike him. & think not one of the name to be trusted.\'a0 I hope he will never pay more than 200 towards the paper, & \ul that\ulnone  you will return to him as soon as possible. I am really sorry you will throw away your money as you do.\'a0 It gives me no pleasure to hear of your useless purchases.\'a0 A pistol you should have no use for.\'a0 The plaster of Paris ornaments we have no place in the Drawing room for. We have so many little ornaments there now, we have no use for more.\'a0 Two or three books would have been quite enough.\'a0 You never get the kind I like, & you do not read half of them yourself.\'a0 We have much need for money.\'a0 It distresses me to see you fling it away actually as you do.\'a0 I have been living with the greatest economy to enable me to save 10 dollars to buy something warm to wear when I go out this winter, & without thought you spend dollar after dollar for the most useless things.\'a0 If you were \ul rich\ulnone  you might indulge your taste for books but you are not rich, & your family get more expensive every year.\'a0 But I may as well stop.\'a0 If I preached until Doomsday, it would not make you prudent & economical.\'a0 Perhaps tel[l]ing you of \ul facts\ulnone  that will ere long make you \ul feel\ulnone  the \ul want\ulnone  of money may have some effect so listen. Poor Scott is in a \ul very\ulnone  \ul bad\ulnone  \ul way\ulnone .\'a0 Reuben says at Laurens on his return, Scott in the morning found it difficult to get up.\'a0 So when he got home he rested, & has been used I believe but \ul once \ulnone since he seems to be weak in the \ul loins\ulnone .\'a0 There is a particular spot in the small of the back, that when you touch, he winces & grunts.\'a0 Reuben washes it with salt & water, & is doing all he can for it, but he has been sick so long in this way, that I should rather think, he will not be well again, & am afraid even his days are numbered.\'a0 One morning Reuben thought he had\'85himself against the Stable in getting up.\'a0 His leg seemed \ul sprained\ulnone  but I do not know if it was so, but I think your Stable is \ul too\ulnone  \ul small\ulnone , & that may be one reason your horses are so often lame.\'a0 Often I hear them knocking against the stable.\'a0 You had better have the partition between the Stable & the cutting room taken down.\'a0 I hope Scott will get well, but it is best to prepare for the worst, & then where will be the money to get another horse.\'a0 How much better to save what you can for such emergencies.\'a0 I believe if Col. Irby were to pay you the 1100 which I hope & pray for \ul many\ulnone  a \ul long\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone  he will not.\'a0 In a few weeks you would spend every dollar of it, & with no capital yielding interest what in future would your wife & children do, if left without you. As Scott is sick, Selim & Byron will have to go for you.\'a0 Reuben says they are quite well.\'a0 He thinks the journey is too long to be made in two days.\'a0 The days are short; the roads perhaps bad so that three days Reuben thinks it will take.\'a0 He thinks it was such long days rides that has made Scott so much worse.\'a0 Write me what you think.\'a0 Reuben shall go for you with Selim & Byron & if the journey shall be made in two or three days going & coming.\'a0 You will get this letter Saturday, answer it Sunday, & I will get your answer Tuesday in time to send Reuben Wednesday or Thursday whichever you say.\'a0 If I were \ul not\ulnone  to hear from you, I will send him one of those days, whichever \ul he\ulnone  thinks, so as to meet you at Fulkes \ul Friday\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone .\'a0 Tonight Mr. Campbell & Miss Lewis are married.\'a0 I suppose by this time they are man & wife.\'a0 I had no inclination to go to the wedding, having no looking for \ul him\ulnone , or to a crowd either.\'a0 I believe they leave tomorrow for Augusta or somewhere.\'a0 I must not forget to tell you, that Susan \ul was\ulnone  invited to the wedding.\'a0 The invitation was sent to old Mrs. McBee\'92s, & she neglected sending it to Susan, so there is an end to what would always have been a mystery to me.\'a0 When Mamma first told me of the slight I told her, she might depend upon it, it was a \ul mistake\ulnone .\'a0 The invitation had been written, & in some way mislaid,, for otherwise there was no accounting for the neglect, for Mr. Arthur would hardly be so unchristian like, as to resent a little mistake, as the Baptism was in this way, after for so long a time being friendly, & if it had been Mrs. Jones she would have influenced against you & me as well as Susan & Mr. McBee, & she is too \ul cat\ulnone  \ul like\ulnone & stealthy to revenge herself openly, so I am glad it has turned out, as I first thought. Anna Williams has lost her oldest child her daughter.\'a0 It died yesterday.\'a0 The funeral took place this afternoon, so Mr. Arthur attended two very different ceremonies\'a0 the same evening.\'a0 Last Sunday Mrs. D\'85 who I carried home, told me the little girl was sick with putrid sore throat.\'a0 She had the worse throat she ever saw,\'a0 In the afternoon Mrs. Williams was at church, so I thought it must be better, but yesterday it died & I dare say it is better for it.\'a0 Mrs. Williams has now only one little boy left. You must try & enjoy yourself the rest of the Session & it has not been as stormy for you as I supposed it would be.\'a0 Stay until the Legislature adjourns.\'a0 Do not come a \ul moment\ulnone  sooner, & I will have a good Christmas dinner ready for you.\'a0 You know best how long you ought to take to travel home.\'a0 Reuben says the two horses Byron & Selim are well, so if you think so, you can come in two days.\'a0 I only thought I would tell you Reubens opinion.\'a0 We will be very glad to see you all.\'a0 Ann begs me to ask you to buy her a viol of Otto of Rose 50 cts, such as you once bought me.\'a0 I think you bought it at the Confectioners.\'a0 I hope you have looked at the Desks for Mamma, & that you will get my bundle safely Aunt Mary McCall is to send, either by private opportunity or to the Depository directed to you. No ploughing has been done yet.\'a0 Until \ul this\ulnone  \ul week \ulnone it has rained incessantly.\'a0 Killing the hogs, cutting them up, making Sausage meat &c has taken until today.\'a0 Charles, Mary & Lindy are even \ul now\ulnone , cleaning the feet, & Scott has required attention, so I thought the rest of this week Reuben had better haul wood for us, & a few persons who had asked for it.\'a0 Then as next week, he goes for you, it is not worthwhile for so few days ploughing, so he will go on hauling wood, & plough after you come back.\'a0 I do not expect to use the horses much this winter.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 I hope your resolutions will pass, & in your next you will give me an account of your speech.\'a0 You must not let yourself be prevented from making a speech.\'a0 You do differ, how the outs, not going for Disunion, so they do not wish you to have the opportunity of expressing your \ul opinion\ulnone .\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\'a0 Howd\'85 to Willie & Frank\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today, in which you mentioned you had spoken, but only an hour, & had not said half you wished, that you had astounded the Legislature, & your speech been poorly quoted, misrepresented &c.\'a0 All this is so different from what I had expected, that I feel disappointed.\'a0 As you have said the majority of the Members \ul agreed \ulnone with you.\'a0 I did not know your opinions would astonish them so, but the truth is you only agree in wishing a Southern Convention, but \ul they \ulnone wish it for the purpose of \ul dissolving\ulnone  the Union; \ul you\ulnone  to \ul preserve\ulnone  it, & that is a great difference.\'a0 I knew I would not like the notes of your speech in the papers, as they have not done you \ul justice\ulnone . So I thought it best today, not to look at the papers.\'a0 All the speeches on the other side, never mind how poor they all are \ul praised\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Pickerell told me. The correspondent of the Mountaineer spoke highly of Mr. Leitner\'92s speech.\'a0 I hope you will have yours published just as soon as possible; that justice may be done you, but I am thinking in what paper you can get it published; that perhaps none will publish it.\'a0 If all \ul refuse\ulnone , you must have it published in pamphlet form, even if you have to send it to Augusta. My greatest comfort during you absence has been to go every Saturday afternoon to the Miss Andersons & tell them the news from Columbia.\'a0 They are so few now with whom I can converse freely, & meet sympathy.\'a0 They are the finest ladies I know of.\'a0 They are so conscientious & act so on principle.\'a0 They are \ul poor\ulnone , & yet live respectably.\'a0 At one time they were afraid they would have to give up their house, & if they would get no other board out, & if so, they would be obliged to apply to their brothers for aid, which they were very reluctant to do, but for the present they can keep the house. Mr. & Mrs. Campbell left the morning after the wedding.\'a0 I believe for Augusta, but I am not certain.\'a0 They did not wait for the sister to return from Virginia, though she is expected every day.\'a0 Mr. Luther went to the wedding, & says though many were invited, there were only a few there.\'a0 Mrs. Arthur today sent each of us some cake. I am sorry you make no mention of a bundle having been sent to you from Charleston.\'a0 I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to get me a Sashe, & send it by someone to you, or if no private opportunity occurred to send it on the Rail Road directed to the Columbia Depository to your care, & I have \ul repeatedly\ulnone  written to you to send to the Depository & see about it, but you give me no answer on the subject, & now the time approaches for you to leave Columbia.\'a0 I feel very uneasy, for fear you will leave without seeing about it.\'a0 Though a little matter to \ul you\ulnone , it is a \ul great\ulnone  matter to me, for I have nothing warm to wear to church.\'a0 My cloak is too old.\'a0 I have had it now 15 years, & my shawl is too \ul thin\ulnone , so I beg you to interest yourself & send the children down to the Depository every day to see if the bundle has come.\'a0 It will be a pleasant walk for them, & keep them from annoying you with their company, which I am afraid they do, as you say they are constantly with you.\'a0 I thought Willie having Frank as his companion would have been independent of you, that they would have spent the greater part of their time in walking about the town.\'a0 Today a letter came from Mr. Spartan Goodlett, inclosing a list of 10 subscribers, & wishing you success, & his best wishes.\'a0 The names are Wm J. Pennington, James K. Dickson, W.J. Gilreath, W.D.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 \ul As\ulnone  I \ul thought\ulnone , I have many things to write about.\'a0 I did not go to church this morning, but I did this afternoon.\'a0 Next Sunday Mr. Arthur gave out, he would handle preaching morning & afternoon on the subject of \ul Slavery\ulnone .\'a0 As I have no doubts on the subject, & think it a very \ul inappropriate\ulnone  subject for a \ul Sermon\ulnone , I am not going to church to hear him.\'a0 I dare say it will have a political bearing.\'a0 It is hard that those in the \ul minority\ulnone  who dare to express their opinion are branded as Traitors, & it is \ul impertinent\ulnone  for persons to be writing to Mamma in that strain, when they know you think as the minority does.\'a0 Today Mamma showed me a letter from Miss Drayton, & of course she must allude to Politics, & she expresses herself as follows.\'a0 \'93I suppose you are as much interested in the state of public affairs as I am; things are coming to a crisis, which might all have been prevented by fairness & unanimity in ourselves a few years back & even now unanimity would not only save us, but place us on a better understanding & finer position than we have possessed for years, but alas! Traitors within the camp are often exhibiting their satanic\'85some bought with Texan lands, with Northern dinners & flattery, or the hope of preferment.\'a0 They do not feel, \'93this is my own, my native land.\'94\'a0 I will say the reward attendant on their course.\'94\'a0 I suppose she alludes to Genl Hamilton & Mr. Poinsett.\'a0 I have not seen the letter of the former, but the latter I am sure, if he had not felt \'93this is my own my native land.\'94\'a0 Would have kept quiet, & not exposed himself to be assailed & persecuted as all who express their opinion on that side are.\'a0 Mamma says in the Mountaineer Mr. Poinsetts peice is answered & he is made out to be certainly wrong.\'a0 It is signed Tyger & Mr. McBee says Dr. Crook wrote it, & Mamma says Genl Hamiltons letter is ridiculed & spoken of as showing so little sense, that the writer does not believe Genl Hamilton wrote it.\'a0 I suppose you will also be scored.\'a0 If it were not for the Southern Patriot I believe the Mountaineer governed as it is now & nothing to counteract it, would not leave you a friend in Greenville.\'a0 Mr. Pickerell says it is an \ul incendiary\ulnone  paper.\'a0 I am more provoked with Dr. Crook than anyone.\'a0 He priding himself on his \ul patriotism \ulnone when he is a \ul selfish\ulnone  \ul designing\ulnone  \ul deceitful\ulnone  \ul hypocrite\ulnone , nothing but \ul self\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone  has changed him.\'a0 I am sorry I spoke to him the other day.\'a0 I never will again, & as for being our Physician, he never enters this house again in that capacity, if I can help it.\'a0 He is a Traitor. Mr. Croft leaves tomorrow.\'a0 I saw him after church.\'a0 I forgot to tell him why you had not written to him.\'a0 He will be in Charleston before long.\'a0 If you choose you can write to him there.\'a0\'a0 I have given him some Prospectus\'92 to distribute.\'a0 I rode with Mr. Croft over to Mamma\'92s in his carri[a]ge.\'a0 He was at Miss Lewis wedding.\'a0 He says only about 30 were at it.\'a0 Mr. Campbell has rented his house, so he says.\'a0 Genl Thompsons wife he told me was neither rich or handsome, that he married her because he wants a family, that his children are outrageous, that Genl Thompson is coming here in January, that he chooses to he can be happy, & if he is not loyal & faithful, her family will take it up.\'a0 I hope it is not true that Genl Thompson is to be here in January.\'a0 He will ruin the paper.\'a0 There never was a man so disliked & thought so dishonourable, & I am truly sorry he is not your enemy as he used to be.\'a0 You then flourished, but leagued with him, you will fall with him.\'a0Miss Drayton says Jenny Lind is to be in Charleston about the 19
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 That will be about Thursday.\'a0 Do you not wish to go to town to & hear her.\'a0 If I had known it, I would have proposed going down in the carri[a]ge to meet you in Columbia, & gone on with you to Charleston to hear her sing.\'a0 Mrs. Erwin Jones I hear is going down, will meet Mr. Jones in Columbia & go with him to Charleston to hear Jenny Lind,\'a0 They have money enough to do anything.\'a0 Do not speak of this to Mr. Jones.\'a0 I do not wish him to know that I think of her or mention her name for I despise her, & think her as malevolent & bad as ever be.\'a0 They are well matched.\'a0 Mr. Arthur has some as \ul bad\ulnone  \ul Christians\ulnone  in his church, as you can find anywhere, some who if they do not commit murder, are murderers in heart. Scott all today has been lying down.\'a0 He eats & drinks\'a0 but is too weak to stand well.\'a0 The stable is so small he hurts himself when he gets up, strikes against the stable.\'a0 You made a great mistake in hav[ing]\'a0 so little room for the horses.\'a0 I believe that is one reason they are lame & sick so constantly.\'a0 They did better in the old sable which was larger. You must not forget to buy the few things I have mentioned.\'a0 1 dollars worth of Hops, or fewer if you cannot bring so large a bundle.\'a0 Some Clover & Blue grass seed for Mamma, a bottle of Otto of Rose for Ann, 50 cts.\'a0 You got it at the confectioners I think.\'a0 Try & find my bundle that I have told you was to be sent to the Depository.\'a0 I am sorry you have said nothing of the writing desks I begged you to inquire the prices of for Mamma.\'a0 I would like you to have given me an answer.\'a0 I have not looked in the last papers, so I do not know the last news from Columbia, who were run for Governor even.\'a0 I was afraid I would see you spoken of as I would not like.\'a0 I thought as the majority agreed with you in wishing a Southern Congress, that you though you differed somewhat would on the whole please them.\'a0 I expect now you are more coldly treated as Dr. Lieber is, you ought to get those few who do agree with you, to do more for the Southern Patriot than merely take one copy.\'a0 They ought to take a dozen & help you sustain it at the commencement when it will need the exertions of every friend.\'a0 They ought to tally around you, come to your support.\'a0 Your attached [Wife], E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter today.\'a0 I am sorry to see how anxious you are to get home, for though I wish you to \ul love\ulnone  home; still I like you to pass your time pleasantly away from it, & I am afraid your great anxiety to get from Columbia, shows you are not treated well by those around you.\'a0 I expect since you have made your speech, & declared your love for the Union, you are looked coldly upon as Dr. Lieber is.\'a0 Before they knew you went for a Southern Convention & in that they agreed with you, & were disposed to treat you as a friend, but now having declared your motive for going for it, \'93\ul Love of the Union\ulnone ,\'94 they find it just the reverse of the reason they go for it, to \'93Dissolve the Union,\'94 so they look upon you as an alien, an enemy.\'a0 I have not read the papers since you made your speech, for fear I might see you spoken of in a way I did not like.\'a0 Today I was mostly looking in the Charleston Courier for the deaths & marriages, &\'85glanced at a paragraph containing your name & the expressions of your attachment to the Union.\'a0 I did not care to see what followed, so closed the paper immediately.\'a0 I am sorry you did not say in your letter today, anything about publishing your speech.\'a0 I am afraid the papers have refused to publish it.\'a0 If so it is a pity you made it, as you did not say \ul half\ulnone  you wished & have been misrepresented in that half.\'a0 I am very glad the Senate has passed a resolution for a State Convention, & hope it will pass the house.\'a0 I would prefer they should \ul Secede\ulnone  at \ul once\ulnone , this very moment let us have the Crisis \ul now\ulnone .\'a0 Until it comes,\'a0 the people will be kept in a constant state of excitement, so I wish it to \ul come\ulnone  & be \ul over\ulnone .\'a0 How unlooked for these times are.\'a0 You had just got over the Stigma attached to you as a \ul Union\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone , & now your position is worse than it was then. You have fewer to bear you company.\'a0 If it had not been for Col. Memminger interfering in Greenville, things there would have been more as they were during Nullification times.\'a0 There would not have been so many renegades as there are now.\'a0 His change gave the others courage to follow.\'a0 But I must now speak of what \ul immediately\ulnone  concerns yourself.\'a0 Scott is still \ul alive\ulnone , & that is about as much as I can say.\'a0 He has entirely lost the use of his \ul hind\ulnone  \ul legs\ulnone .\'a0 He has been laying down for several days.\'a0 When he eats & drinks he raises himself on his front legs.\'a0 Today Reuben said he seemed liv[e]lier than usual. & if he could be raised up, & supported by ropes, he would do better, so I bought a rope & they managed to raise him up, but he had no strength in his hinder parts, & dropped down again.\'a0 It is sad to think of such a fine horse, dying as he is.\'a0 I was at the Stable yesterday & heard him \ul groaning\ulnone .\'a0 I shed tears now when I think of it; how different his situation from when I used to see you mounted on him.\'a0 I beg you ride on Byron & he the finest & largest & strongest looking horse I ever saw, & I believe his death is owing to his superiority.\'a0 He was too fat, & noble to have been worked as he was, ploughing all summer in the hot sun.\'a0 A poor, mean, thin horse could have borne it, but Scott was not born to be treated in that way, worked lightly, he would have been well now.\'a0 About a week ago during the night I could hear him knocking himself against the Stable, but now he lays perfectly quiet, so every morning, I expect to hear he is dead.\'a0 I am afraid it is the journey to & from the Rail Road that has knocked him up so completely.\'a0 After telling you how sick Scott was, I thought of your own accord, you would be afraid the other horses would be injured, & propose coming back in the Stage.\'a0 I did not like to propose it to you, for fear after being so extravagant as I knew you had been, that you might not have funds.\'a0 So I asked Reuben while I was \ul writing\ulnone  to \ul you\ulnone , if the other horses were \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 He said yes, there were \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 This morning Charles came in & told me that Byron was too lame almost to go to the river.\'a0 I went to the Stable & saw him walk, & his leg seemed very lame, & when he stood still he would hold it up, as if it hurt to touch the ground & when Reuben touched the soft part of his foot above the hoof, he would wince.\'a0 Mr. Cauble shod them yesterday, & he says Byrons lameness is owing to Mr. Westfields having made the shoes too small particularly at the back foot, & that has cramped the foot & lamed it.\'a0 You know Byron has been lame for a long time & it is very provoking that it should be owing to the Shoeing, so I have told Reuben to say nothing about it to Mr. Westfield, but not to go there again to have them shod.\'a0 This morning we waited anxiously to receive your letter to know what you would direct, & finding that you still said Reuben must go for you, Byron being entirely too lame to travel 100 miles almost.\'a0 I sent Reuben to Mr. Pecks to hire a horse to put with Selim, for Selim is perfectly well, & he has hired one at 50 cts a day, & will set off Thursday morning, & meet you at Fulkes Saturday morning.\'a0 Queen Mary in writing to William\'85 is very anxious he would approve of what she is doing. So in the same way I am anxious you should approve of my acts, but I am not in much fear of \ul you\ulnone  as she is of him, & she had\'85too loving in her expressions, when you recollect she had a rival. I am sorry Willie & Frank have been so much in your way, another time you will carry only one, or carry me instead, & think you had better make it a rule, always when you go to Columbia to carry \ul me\ulnone , & what I prevent your spending extravagantly, can pay my board. I am very glad to tell you that I today received a letter from Aunt Mary McCall in which she says she has sent my Sacks or\'85to Columbia to \ul you\ulnone , by William Johnston, son of Mr. Andrew Johnston, a student in Columbia College.\'a0 She wrote Friday & said Mr. Johnston was to go to Columbia that day.\'a0 You wrote Friday & yet you do not mention having received the package so I feel quite uneasy.\'a0 It was directed to you at Maybins Hotel.\'a0 I suppose it will be sent to the bar to you, but if it is not, you must find out through Prof. Leiber or Williams where Mr. William Johnston is & ascertain from him what he has done with the bundle.\'a0 You must not leave Columbia without it.\'a0 Aunt Mary had it made after one a cousin of hers had just brought from Europe.\'a0 It cost $10.25 cts, & I have made independent of you, since you were away 8 & 9 dollars, almost enough to pay for it.\'a0 The 15 dollars you left me is barely enough for household expenses.\'a0 I wish you to live well after you return for a while at least, so I have bought 6 Turkeys, 5 ducks & plenty of Eggs.\'a0 Christmas I have invited Mamma & Susan\'92s families to dine with us, so you may tell them all the \ul news\ulnone .\'a0 New Years day Susan says we must dine there.\'a0 Today Mrs. Fields bought some very nice Socks 25 cts a pr & as you had only 3 pr, I bought 3 pr from her for you.\'a0 I paid Mr. Paynes bill $1.70 cts.\'a0 I bought 3 pounds of tea all Pinckney Mr. Bee has left.\'a0 I bought 150 worth of Candles yesterday; so in all these ways the 15 dollars has gone, & I was obliged to borrow 1 dollar from Mamma to add to 9 I have to enclose to Aunt Mary McCall, & for the remainder of this week I intend to spend nothing at all. I will have some provisions wo\'85 & send by Reuben for you to eat coming up; some cakes for the children & some bread & meat; & apples.\'a0 I wish you had sent the tin box back in the carriage to hold it. Yesterday Mary came in from the Portico & said to me Dr. Crooks asks if Fanny had ever been vaxinated.\'a0 I thought he was very \ul officious\ulnone , & I said no, & I do not wish her either.\'a0 About an hour after he made his appearance at the door & came in & asked me the same question & I asked him, if it ought to be done.\'a0 He said yes, the Small pox was at Hendersonville, & Mrs. Clayton had died of it.\'a0 Her husband had brought the infection in his goods from Hamburg & in all probability it would come here & everybody ought to be vaccinated, \ul myself\ulnone  included.\'a0 I asked him where he got the matter from.\'a0 He said it was some he had had \ul two\ulnone  or \ul three\ulnone  years & vaccinated \ul about\ulnone  200 persons with it, & out of that number only \ul one\ulnone  had taken & he kept the scab of that one.\'a0 I thought it must be very poor matter indeed to have effect in \ul one\ulnone  case out of \ul 200\ulnone , & besides it was very officious in him to be prescribing unasked as if of a matter of course he was always to be one Physician so I did not encourage him to vaccinate Fanny.\'a0 He asked her if she would be frightened, & she said \ul yes\ulnone ; & he said fright prevented its taking, & he would go over to Mrs. Hokes & vaccinate Sally Hoke, & if that took use matter from her sore; so he went off.\'a0 I told Mamma to ask Dr. Earle, if all to be vaccinated, & if so he can do it.\'a0 Dr. Crooks before did it so badly he made your arm so sore I was afraid it would have to be cut off, & after all I believe none he did took.\'a0 He is so deceitful & hypocritical & fawning, & pre\'85 at the same time, that he is all openness & warmth & sincerity, that I have a perfect contempt for him. Mrs. Michael Hoke is at Mrs. Hokes, & tonight Mrs. Hoke asked me to take a sociable cup of Tea\'a0\'a0 with her.\'a0 I asked the servant who was going, & as soon as she mentioned \ul Dr.\ulnone  \ul Crooks\ulnone  name, I determined I would not go, so said I did not think I would be able to; & this afternoon I sent word I expected to be particularly engaged at \ul home\ulnone .\'a0 My engagement is writing to \ul you\ulnone , which I prefer to being in Dr. Crooks company, where I would be obliged to play the hypocrite, & listen to his \ul hypocritical\ulnone  \ul patriotism\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Dr. Williams came to see me this afternoon.\'a0 She says Hetty D\'92Oyley went to see her Mother the day Anna Williams child died.\'a0 She thinks they will be reconciled now.\'a0 The little girl was 8 years old. Anna is now preparing for the Examination which takes place next Friday, so you will not be here.\'a0 I have been hearing Anna her lessons, to see if she knew them well enough so I would not be afraid to be present when she is examined.\'a0 This afternoon she said 20 pages in the Scholars companion which is a hard kind of Spelling with meaning, where there are two of every word that is pronounced alike.\'a0 Yet I felt difficulty, & with different meanings & she hardly missed a word, & sometimes would say a column herself, without my calling out the words she has such a good memory.\'a0 I have heard all she has been learning in History, & to every question, she gives an answer that does very well.\'a0 I am going on to hear her Geography & her other studies & if she does as well, I can go with confidence to the examination.\'a0 The Music is to be at night.\'a0 This winter will be so cold for Anna to practice in the Drawing room without fire, I think she may as well stop with her Music until the warm weather comes again.\'a0 I will make her practice what she has learnt, w[hich] she may not forget.\'a0 Both Fanny & herself long to see you.\'a0 Fanny says \'93Pa stays too long.\'94\'a0 Anna says you promised her a \ul book\ulnone .\'a0 If you choose to, you may buy her a simple book costing not much, or give one of Willie\'92s to her.\'a0 Write her name in it.\'a0 Tell Frank his cousin Susan Hayne has sent him a very pretty book called \'93Simple Ballads.\'94\'a0 Tell Willie I have not seen H\'85 yet, & I expect H\'85 has not seen the \ul outside\ulnone  of the Stable.\'a0 I have neglected to tell you that one night the Calf of the white faced Cow was gored so Reuben thinks, by the Cow; that it died in consequence, but the Cow still gives Milk, & that the old Cow that for a while was left at the Farm with her Calf gives Milk now too, so when the Cow with the young Calf is milked, which will be next Tuesday, we will have the Milk of four Cows.\'a0 Some of them this winter you can dispose of.\'a0 Perhaps you can winter them at Mr. Fosters,\'a0 if not sell some. I will stop now it is late & finish tomorrow.\'a0 You must write me so I can hear twice more, Thursday & Saturday.\'a0 A letter came today from a Mr. Brown a merchant in Marion Alabama enclosing a note against Mr. Sam Town[e]s for 53 dollars, due for goods he had bought for himself & family.\'a0 Mrs. S. Town[e]s once told me the dearest friend she had, was in the Lunatic asylum in Columbia, & that when you went there, she would like you to go & see her & inquire about her.\'a0 I have forgotten her name.\'a0 I think she was originally from Spartanburg.\'a0 Mrs. Town[e]s became intimate with her in Alabama.\'a0 Wednesday morning Scott is still the same.\'a0\'a0 Reuben is going to set off this afternoon for you; for the journey is too long for two days, particularly if you come back in 2 days.\'a0 They must have a while to rest at Fulkes.\'a0 He will take Selim & Mr. Pecks horse.\'a0 It is strange Genl Thompson does not mention his bride.\'a0 Mr. Luther heard he bought her 2 rings in Charleston 1000 dollars apeice.\'a0 If so he was very \ul foolish\ulnone  & his children ought to be \ul angry\ulnone .\'a0 I do hope in your next letter you will tell me, you have received my package, & not keep me in such suspense.\'a0 Buy the \ul hops\ulnone , a \ul bottle\ulnone  of \ul Otto\ulnone  of \ul Rose\ulnone  for Ann.\'a0 I believe that is all; except tell Willie to buy a \ul toy\ulnone  for Vardry & the \ul blue\ulnone  \ul grass\ulnone  & \ul Clover\ulnone  \ul seed\ulnone  for Mamma.\'a0 I wish you a pleasant journey.\'a0 I will expect you Sunday night, or sometime Monday.\'a0 Then you will have a long time to stay at home, & get \ul tired\ulnone  of it, & \ul scold\ulnone  your wife, & \ul fret\ulnone  at the \ul children\ulnone .\'a0 I hope after awhile all the excitement will pass away, but I do hope the politicians will bring things to a crisis at once.\'a0 I wish them to secede.\'a0 Until they do, they will use the excitement for their own interest.\'a0 E.F.P.\

Mr. Luther McBee & Alexander returned yesterday.\'a0 Mr. Luther called here while I was at church this afternoon, & told Anna would Frank would come home tonight with Mr. \'85, but you had written that he was not coming, so I do not expect him.\'a0 You must tell Willie to eat at \'bd past 1 with Frank, as well as at 4, for it is too long to fast, from breakfast until 4, & it will make Willie sick & he will grow thin.\'a0 I went to see Susan before church this afternoon.\'a0 Her baby is\'85ailing.\'a0 She says Mr. Luther says, \ul you\ulnone  are almost the only \ul true\ulnone  man in the State.\'a0 He said it was ridiculous to listen to Mr. Memmingers boasts of what \ul he \ulnone would do rather than submit & recollect how tamely he bore Genl Thompsons \ul lie\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Luther dines at Aunt Eliza\'92s, & says Eliza & Sue are violent on Politics., that they took the first chance of saying \ul they\ulnone  are for \ul Disunion\ulnone .\'a0 They would not submit to their \ul oppressors\ulnone , so he took the \ul first\ulnone  chance of \ul leaving\ulnone .\'a0 Uncle Arthur called to see him, & invited him to dine, & he liked Uncle Arthurs wife.\'a0 He did not go to see Aunt Turnbull or Aunt Haynes.\'a0 His feet he said hurt him, & Paul passed him & Alexander in the street without speaking, but afterwards left his card.\'a0 That was all they saw of h\ul im\ulnone , & Mr. Henry Peronneau met Mr. Luther in the street, & very\'85said he would be glad if he would call & see him.\'a0 Aunt Eliza sent up some little presents to the children, Bible words for Willie, a book for Frank & Fanny, some little flower pots for Anna, & a peice of ribbon for myself.\'a0 If you go to town the only persons I wish you to go & see are Aunt Anna Turnbull & my Aunt McCall.\'a0 They are my Fathers relations, & I love them.\'a0 He Mamma says was different in politics from \ul her\ulnone  \ul mothers\ulnone , which was certainly in his favour.\'a0 Our family woke upon all\'a0 on the opposite side as \ul Traitors\ulnone .\'a0 I hope never mind when you see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor, that you will \ul not\ulnone  \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 speak to them.\'a0 Mr. Taylor has often \ul avoided\ulnone  speaking to you.\'a0 Mr. Croft says Miss B\'85 wrote word that every \ul child\ulnone  in Charleston \ul even\ulnone , was a Politician.\'a0 I hope that all read Mr. Poinsetts letter.\'a0 He certainly put the State in a most \'85tous light, & explained California better than I have heard it yet,\'a0 & though if Genl Taylor as you thought interfered in forming it into a State, still he says, that would have made no difference.\'a0 The people would have done the same. When you make your speech study it well beforehand & make a \ul good\ulnone  one.\'a0 Say nothing that must be borne out.\'a0 I would be very glad if your resolutions are adopted but to me it seems no use to have a Southern Convention, for the other States are \ul satisfied\ulnone , so why should there be one.\'a0 But you know best; I mention my ideas only, & I wish you to be right in all you propose. Mr. Croft says Genl Thompson is a compound of evil.\'a0 He said there was no confidence to be placed in him, & his friends had found it out, & therefore given him up.\'a0 He says his wife was neither handsome or rich.\'a0 I am so sorry Genl Thompson has anything to do with the paper, that he subscribed for it.\'a0 It can never get along with him as a Stockholder.\'a0 You must buy him out as soon as possible.\'a0 He will be a dead weight to the paper, & you must never allow \ul him\ulnone  to write for it.\'a0 It was most unfortunate you asking \ul him\ulnone  to \ul join\ulnone .\'a0 Last night I did not send to the office after the Augusta Mail came, so I do not know what came for you.\'a0 The weather turned very cold last night, & it continues so.\'a0 I hope tomorrow the hogs will be killed.\'a0 Mr. Luther bought for Susan a \ul beautiful \ulnone Carpet for her Dining room & oil Cloth for her Stair case & Entry.\'a0 Elizabeth Jones chose them.\'a0 I would much rather have such things than all the \ul books\ulnone  \ul you\ulnone  buy.\'a0 I would much rather have a Carpet to keep my chamber warm & comfortable, & one for The little Dining room which is in \ul rags\ulnone ; but you will buy books, & then there is no money left for anything else.\'a0 You are not satisfied with a few, but if you begin there is no end to them.\'a0 I wish I had half the money you have spent in books, , & you have so many expenses to meet, & you do not prepare for them.\'a0 If you will spend the money, then always carry the \ul whole \ulnone of us to Columbia with you & spend your money in paying our board. I was sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.\'a0 I know you would have spent a pleasant day, & now he will not ask you again.\'a0 You will be tired of my letter, but it is a relief to me to write & now I am going upstairs to read to Mary.\'a0 Good night.\'a0 Young Barnwell who graduated is engaged already to a Miss Ball, a pious young ledy, attending his fathers church.\'a0\

	I will not finish, & only say once more, that I will be very thankful if your resolution for a Southern Convention is adopted, for the State will have something, & that is the \ul safest\ulnone  mode of\'85, but I doubt if they will be adopted, but I hope it will.\'a0Reuben has gone for a load of wood, & I hope by the time he returns Charles will be here to kill the hogs for it is very cold.\'a0 Charles is at Mr. Deans, & I am afraid from his not coming in, he is killing hogs for him instead, which will be very provoking.\'a0 I have sent Lindy to bring him in.\'a0 My pen needs mending.\'a0 I can hardly write.\'a0 My next shall be shorter & neater.\'a0 Lindy has just come back.\'a0 She met Charles coming in, so the hogs will be killed today.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Since I sealed my letter an event has occurred, which I must inform you of.\'a0 This morning about 4 oclock I was awoke[n] by a wrapping at the back door, & Edward came to say his Mother was sick, & wanted Mom Phillis.\'a0 She must be sent for.\'a0 She had not expected to be confined until after Christmas, & she fell back in her chair yesterday, which I suppose must have caused her to be sick prematurely, so I was dreading the dangerous time she would have.\'a0 Not half an hour after I sent Lindy to know she was, & she said Mom Phillis was there, & the baby too, & that the baby had been born \ul before\ulnone  Mom Phillis came.\'a0 May who I had sent to stay with Elisa, says she went down in the kitchen to get a longer candle, & while there the baby was born.\'a0 Only Charles was in the room with her, so I suppose he acted the part of Midwife.\'a0 The baby is very small, which I suppose is the reason she had so good a time, & weakly sickly persons always suffer up, than the healthy & strong.\'a0 So I am very glad & thankful it is safely over with her.\'a0 It is a boy, so it will be Fanny\'92s waiting man. I forgot to tell you, that you must write letters to as many persons here as you possibly can.\'a0 I think Mr. Nicol would be glad to hear from you; write to Mr. Hoke, Mr. Croft, old Mr. McBee & other persons in the village & county.\'a0 Col. Jones goes to Columbia today, but I send my letter by Mail, as you once told me always to, as they were not delivered to you so soon. No letters except those two I mentioned the contents to you have come; 3 pages from Philadelphia begging you to exchange with them came yesterday.\'a0 When you are Editor I hope you will receive books & periodicals in abundance.\'a0 Mr. Burt\'92s order to have the Prospectus published for what he was to be \ul paid\ulnone , was not forgotten, strange the workmen forgot to publish the explanation, but not the Prospectus, & I expect he has forgotten it to this day.\'a0 Do you remember.\'a0 I will never forgive you, if you vote for Mr. Burt, or Mr. Memminger, or Mr. Rhett for I suppose someone besides Mr. Hammond will oppose Mr. Rhett.\'a0 Poor man whenever Mr. Hammond comes forward before the public, his bad conduct is mentioned.\'a0 It would be well if all wickedness brought its punishment, as his has done.\'a0 I expect he will be afraid to run, for fear of developments.\'a0 It is a gloomy day, again, but not raining at this moment.\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s sent to ask me to go & see her, but I am not going, on account of Mr. Sam Town[e]s, who has acted dishonorably to you,\'a0 I sent Mr. O\'92Hanlon\'92s letter & Mr. Petigru\'92s to Mr. Arthur to read.\'a0 He told me he would be glad to see them.\'a0 I hope he read[s] them to Mr. Campbell.\'a0 I wish my dear husband you could be elected President of the College or Bank, or have some honorable office bestowed on you, as Law is getting scarce.\'a0 Write me who you think will be elected Solicitor.\'a0 I do hope Mr. Young will; even Mr. Duncan ought to vote for him. after such an\'85ful conduct in the Greenville Candidate.\'a0 In haste, E.F.P.\

My dear Aunt\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Your letter to Maj. Perry enclosing mine to you arrived yesterday, & as he will [be] busy all this week Court & not be able to answer it immediately, I feel compelled to do so.\'a0 My love for him almost prompts me to remain silent & bear all the blame that has fallen on me & which though the \ul weaker\ulnone  \ul vessel \ulnone I would gladly sustain for his sake; for there is no sacrifice for me to make to secure his happiness & the good opinion of others for him; but as Mr. Peronneau in his letter to Mamma said, it was sincere affection alone, that induced him\'a0 to notice what otherwise he would not, so the same feeling prompts me to place myself in a correct position before you.\'a0 Maj. Perry is at this moment in Court pleading for the \ul life\ulnone  of a poor man.\'a0 I at the same time am pleading his cause & mine, & am thankful it is a more just one than he is engaged in.\'a0 It is a little singular that a discourteous act shown toward \ul us\ulnone , should be turned \ul against\ulnone  \ul us\ulnone , & \ul we\ulnone  made the party who has offended.\'a0 That returning a paper is a want of courtesy & not an ordinary thing, is proved by the paper not having been returned by \ul any \ulnone of the Disunionists to whom it was sent, on whom Maj. Perry had \ul any\ulnone  claim, \ul except\ulnone  my two cousins.\'a0 All with their exceptions have kept it; nrt do I see why they should not for what contamination is there in \ul receiving\ulnone  & even \ul reading\ulnone  a paper edited by a sensible, sincere & disinterested Party, one who is universally esteemed to be prompted by love of his country & acting conscientiously for her best interests, & who time will show whether he is not more correct in his views than those who op[p]ose him.\'a0 Such a paper would be read with profit, & when published by a connexion, & in a place where those dear to you live, & giving information of a most flourishing & interesting part of the State.\'a0 It seems strange when such a paper should be turned away as if it was contamination to look at it.\'a0 A paper edited by Wm Ed or any of my relations or friends in whom I felt an interest, never mind how it differed with me in Politics; I would keep out of courtesy if sent to me if from no other motive, & think I would read it with interest, & perhaps have my own views enlightened by it.\'a0 As what we look upon as a want of courtesy we find was not meant as such we are willing to forget & forgive.\'a0 I do not suppose Mr. Peronneau \ul told\ulnone  Wm Henry to return the paper, but I supposed that as Wm Henry knew the paper was meant for his Father, he of course showed it to him, & told him how he intended to dispose of it, & received his Fathers\'85.\'a0 I tried to \ul excuse\ulnone  this act to Maj. Perry, instead of irritating him, & he told me it was an act of discourtesy.\'a0 It was very strange a thing meant as a compliment, should not be taken as such.\'a0 I will now correct a mistake under which both yourself & Mr. Isaac Hayne are labouring.\'a0 You think I wrote my letter in a state of irritation caused by the attack in the Mercury on my husband, so far from it, I did not know of the peice until I was about \ul closing\ulnone  my letter.\'a0 I only knew of the two slights I mentioned ; was not aware that a much greater one was even then on the way.\'a0 The Mercury need not have been\'85.; even if \ul I\ulnone  \ul intercepted\ulnone  it as supposed; for there are many Mercury\'92s taken here, so my husband would be sure to have seen it, & he takes it himself now.\'a0 He takes papers of both parties.\'a0 He wishes to see both sides, that his mind may be enlightened, & he be able to judge correctly, & come to right conclusions, which he could not if he confined himself to only one side of the question.\'a0 My letter need not have been returned with the idea that I was acting in an underhand manner.\'a0 For fear that I might be making the matter of too much importance I asked my husband first, if he had any objections to my writing on the subject, & he said \ul none\ulnone  at \ul all\ulnone , & to be certain I had written nothing\'a0 \ul he\ulnone  disapproved of, I gave it to him to read before I sealed it, & he approved of it entirely.\'a0 I hope next week he will write to you & tell you this \ul himself\ulnone , for he does not regard the case as at all \ul difficult\ulnone , or treat with the least severity, the \'85ullation of his Wifes feelings, & how can he, when those feelings originated from his \ul own\ulnone .\'a0 I intend however to submit this letter to him, so when you receive it you will know that he has endorsed it.\'a0 It would be a matter of pain to me, to write one line that he disapproved. To enable you to judge correctly, I will have to go as far back as your \ul last\ulnone  letter to Mamma.\'a0 I read it with pleasure, & said to Maj. Perry, Aunt Eliza has sent me a kind message & begged me to write & speaks well of you.\'a0 I hardly think she knows Cousin Isaac sent back the paper.\'a0 I am sure she would not have approved of it, so I believe I will write to her & if you have no objection I will mention how hurt we have been.\'a0 He said he had none at all, so a few days after I wrote, he came in while I was writing, & I told him to whom I was writing.\'a0 He went to his Office & to my surprise returned in a very short time with a newspaper in his hand & indignation expressed in his countenance.\'a0 The Mail had just arrived & I saw he had received something that displeased him.\'a0 He said just see what an insolent peice Col. Isaac Hayne has written in reply to that incidental remark of mine about him in the Patriot, & he has sent it to me \ul himself\ulnone .\'a0 I ought to send it \ul back\ulnone  to him, but that would be making it of too much importance.\'a0 I said is the peice disrespectful to you.\'a0 He said he calls the \ul Greenville\ulnone  \ul paper\ulnone  instead of the Southern Patriot, & instead of the Citizens of Greenville, says the Greenville people.\'a0 It is written in a sneering tone throughout, & does not contradict once the assertion I made that he was opposed to secession, but quotes long extracts from old speeches of Judge Cheves & others proving they hate the Union, which I knew before, & begs to have it published in the Southern Patriot, but of course I will not do that.\'a0 I gleaned over the peice & saw it \ul very\ulnone  \ul disrespectful\ulnone , as the manner in which he asks why were not Mr. Memmingers opinions mentioned, & hinting that his could not be misrepresented as the others were, as the Greenville people had heard him themselves, so I gave the paper back & said I do not care to read it.\'a0 I am about closing Aunt Eliza\'92s letter.\'a0 I have no room to mention this peice & have no time to write another letter, as I wish you to read this before you go to Anderson tomorrow, so he took the paper back to his Office & I finished in a few moments my letter.\'a0 After I had done I began to think of the peice, & I was so afraid Maj. Perry would answer it & express his indignant feelings, & trouble would come, that I thought the best plan would be to treat the Mercury after the fashion the Southern Patriot had been treated.\'a0 As the views we did not concur in, & sent by me with my compliments it would not be making it a matter of too much importance or give offence either, so I sent Willie to the Office to tell his Papa to send me the paper & not reply to it in any way.\'a0 He sent me the paper & said he would not reply to it.\'a0 I sealed the paper up & put my compliments on it to show I sent it back & there the matter would rest as I hoped.\'a0 When Maj. Perry came home he asked me what I had done with the paper, I told him, & he said very well I have another at my Office if I need it.\'a0 I then gave him my letter to read & he approved it.\'a0 The next morning early he went to the Office & returned in a few minutes & asked me for the Mercury, that the one he had at his office Mr. Elford had taken away & as he did not intend to publish Col. Haynes peice in the Patriot, it would be necessary to make a few remarks about it.\'a0 I gave it to him & he afterwards returned it to me & he drew his pen across my writing to prevent he said my being indicted\'a0 for writing on a newspaper.\'a0 He that day went to Anderson, & the next day I sent the letter & paper by the same Mail.\'a0 I was sorry to send them together knowing it would be thought the letter was the consequence of the paper, but I was loth to keep the paper until the next Mail so despatched them.\'a0 When Maj. Perry returned from Anderson, he said the Lawyers & Members of the Legislature & other who were in Columbia last winter told him that it was generally understood there that Col. Hayne was opposed to Secession.\'a0 His peice was considered an evasion of the question & Mr. Burt the Editor of the Disunion paper in Pendleton said he felt inclined to give him a\'85himself, but as it might be the means of sending him\'a0 back to the position he first occupied he would not, for he was glad for him to come over to Secession if possible as the party was getting so weak, the whole State seemed to be changing.\'a0 I have heard also that Mr. Filmore\'92s Organ had published the peice & claims Col. Haynes as a Union man.\'a0 So Maj. Perry was certainly not far from wrong in the assertion he made, & none of the other gentlemen thought proper to contradict it, & if they had it would [have] been in a different tone, for they would in reality have been actuated by kind feelings & former personal relations.\'a0 So far from believing \ul you\ulnone  would approve of the peice , Mamma told me I ought to send it to you to show you how disrespectful it was, & she has been constantly urging me to send you the paper, knowing as she said\'a0 you would read with interest anything Maj. Perry wrote, so little can we\'85of the feelings of each other.\'a0 Until you mentioned it I had no idea Wm Ed took the Mountaineer, & if he has taken it for months past, I would know you could have retained your high opinion of Maj. Perry, for until lately, ever since the Memminger meeting, it has been filled up with abuse & misstatements of Maj. Perry.\'a0 So the people at last said they were tired of the same subject, & reading the abuse heaped on one man, & many at the last Election voted for him, who never had before\'a0 because they said the Mountaineer was so unjust to him.\'a0 As you agree with that paper in principle, of course you believe all that is in it, so I am surprised you have a good opinion of one it has so misrepresented.\'a0 I am indeed astonished at Wm Ed selecting that paper & supporting it.\'a0 Maj. Perry has not admitted it into his house since the Memminger meeting.\'a0 It was supposed when he commenced his paper, he would return all the malice & abuse that had been heaped on him, but he has treated them with silent contempt, & though they felt at first relieved to escape what they were dreading, they feel now mortified at no notice being taken of them, & are compelled to be silent themselves.\'a0 It is only to know the Editors of the two papers to decide which is most worthy of patronage.\'a0 In the Southern Patriot next week there will be extracts from\'a0 25 letters from different parts of the Country showing the state of public feeling, some of them from distinguished men.\'a0 This gives a more correct idea than anything an Editor can say.\'a0 I have been led into a controversy very much against my will.\'a0 I am me, for I am no Politician, & do not pretend or wish to be one.\'a0 From hearing the subject discussed every day by my husband & others, I do understand the state of parties, & do feel very much interested on the subject, & was very anxious a paper should be established in Greenville advocating views which seemed to me correct, but I trust I am liberal to those who differ from the one I most honor.\'a0 I am sure he is, & many think he is not as staunch for the Union as he ought to be, that he speaks of the rights of the South too strongly\'a0 & ought to go for the Union above everything, but he pursues the course that he thinks will ensure justice to the South & the stability of the Union also.\'a0I have now expressed the motives under which I acted, as they were sanctioned by one superior in wisdom to myself.\'a0 I hope now I will be better understood, than I have been, & I feel relieved that what by most here was considered discourteous\'a0 & uncalled for, was not looked upon in that light by those from whom the acts proceeded & whom I have been accustomed to respect & love for myself & relations alone even if a stranger to me & regarded in a sacred light & have always tried to serve.\'a0 Your niece, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 It is raining today.\'a0 We indeed have unpleasant weather,\'a0 I hope it is more cheerful where you are. Mr. Suddeth has not been to look at the Cows, so the first good day Reuben will carry them off. The Carpet came yesterday.\'a0 I think it a \ul beautiful\ulnone  one, & the Rug very pretty, & matches the Carpet exactly.\'a0 I will make up the carpets as soon as I can, but the days are so short, by the time the house is fixed, the day is gone.\'a0 It will take me a long time to do it.\'a0 I never had so much to do as I have now.\'a0 Your Shirts have taken so long to make, that all the other work has been neglected, & I now feel as if I never can get through particularly as Elisa helps so little, but I will not fill up my letters with complaints.\'a0 I will only add that yesterday I got warm dresses for Anna, Hext & myself, & though very reasonable only 20 cts a yd still they amounted to nearly 8 dollars & have made such an inroad in my purse.\'a0 I would not be surprised if my funds failed too soon.\'a0 If so, I will have to \ul draw\ulnone  on \ul you \ulnone & hope you will not be displeased.\'a0 You have no idea how expensive the clothes a Lady & 5 children amount to, dressed in the most economical manner & without many necessary comforts for \ul Flannel\ulnone I have not known for years.\'a0 I have bought myself two cheap dresses to wear at home the whole winter & part of the Spring.\'a0 My other dresses are not suitable for home as they are Silk or too light, & would get ruined immediately.\'a0 Anna wrote a long letter to Aunt Mary Hayne last night.\'a0 She has just come home from school, & is practicing on the Piano.\'a0 Only 3 girls at school, so she came home early.\'a0 Willie & Frank have not come yet.\'a0 The umbrella\'92s are so broken, Willie was to stop at Mr. Nicols & buy a new one.\'a0 Mr. Irwin told Frank he thought he had gone to Columbia.\'a0 Perhaps he sent in his bill from that thought, that he might get his money before Frank left, & not seem so unreasonable as to send in an account afterwards for schooling which he had not given. Mary seems pretty well now, & I am thankful for we live in confusion when she is sick.\'a0 Minerva & herself are our most useful servants, & we miss more when they are sick.\'a0 All of our colds are better.\'a0 I hope yours is.\'a0 I long to hear from you.\'a0 I am glad you will not be here in the confusion of taking up & putting down Carpets.\'a0 You will enjoy only the comfort of them. Mary says the Bull that has come back, is ours.\'a0 I have not been out since you left & have seen no one, so have no news to tell you.\'a0 I hope to see the Southern Patriot tonight.\'a0 I think I am its youngest admirer, perhaps because \ul I\ulnone  was the originator of it.\'a0I have now to write two letters to Aunt Mary McCall & Aunt Harriet McCall.\'a0 I am glad the 73 dollars for the carpet she received safely. Minerva is out of bed now & better.\'a0 John came in yesterday.\'a0 Charles is still there.\'a0 Reuben hauled Mrs. Cauble two loads of wood yesterday.\'a0 Today he burned the chimneys.\'a0 Minerva is making some Cake & Lindy helping her.\'a0 Elisa is making Willie a Jacket.\'a0 Sarah is cleaning the knives, & Fanny helping her.\'a0 Charlotte is holding Hext & trying to get him to sleep.\'a0 Anna is practicing, & I have just finished my letter to my dear husband.\'a0 E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am very busy making up the Carpet, & intended Willie should write to you today, but he had not returned from school yet, & I am afraid would not write in time for the Mail, so I am writing in a great hurry you may be sure. I was glad to see by the Southern Patriot last night that you had arrived \ul safely\ulnone , Rail road accidents occurring so frequently made me uneasy until I heard.\'a0 In your letters to me mention all the compliments paid you.\'a0 You are my hero, & I wish to hear a great deal about yourself. A letter came to you from old Mr. Reese last night.\'a0 He was at Anderson C.H. on his way to Georgia, leaving this State forever, & wrote you a kind gratifying letter.\'a0 I sent it to Mr. Elford to \ul Publish\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Elford sent word he would leave Monday morning.\'a0I see in the paper a notice that Judge Wardlaw should be appointed President of the College.\'a0 If he is, I hope you will receive your reward by \ul taking\ulnone  his place on the \ul Bench\ulnone .\'a0 I am waiting anxiously for you to be rewarded in some form or other.\'a0 You have saved the State [&] are entitled to the highest honors in the gift of the State. Mrs. Collins came here Monday to know if her husband could rent your farm.\'a0 Says Mr. Canon & Mr. Luther McBee know them well.\'a0 She has a large family of children the eldest a daughter of 13 years old so only the Father would work on the Farm.\'a0 They have a child born \ul without\ulnone  legs & only one arm, which would be a dreadful sight to look at when we went to the Farm.\'a0 She said she would raise chickens attend Cows & do anything in that way.\'a0 She was so anxious. I promised to write to you, & she was to come next week to hear your answer, so you must write me something in answer, but you had better not engage to anyone until you come back & consider well whether you will rent at all. We are all better of our colds.\'a0 Hext is now crying to be nursed so I will stop to attend to him & then go on with the Carpet.\'a0I hope to hear from you tonight\'a0 & \ul every\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone  but you must write only when perfectly \ul convenient\ulnone .\'a0 Do not put aside \ul business\ulnone  to write to me.\'a0 Willie Has bought himself a \ul knife\ulnone , so says you need not buy him any.\'a0 Believe me as Ever, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I was really disappointed I did not hear from you last night, & uneasy as I cannot conceive why you did not write, for Monday night you would have spared a few moments to me.\'a0 This is the fifth day since you left, & I have not received one letter, & this is the fifth I have written to you.\'a0 Mr. Elford did not hear either, which makes me more uneasy.\'a0 I hope I will hear tonight. An extra of the Southern Patriot was issued today, containing the Governor\'92s Message.\'a0 I see he still thinks Secession the \ul rightful\ulnone  remedy.\'a0 I hope there\'85a division still, will make your independence conspicuous.\'a0 I was afraid you would be lost sight of in the mingling of parties, but I hope you will in the end be rewarded, though I am afraid the ambitious & aspiring will outstrip you. I have just finished putting down the carpet.\'a0 It looks quite handsome.\'a0 I am afraid it will be injured before you return.\'a0 It makes the rest of the house look shabby.\'a0 I have not made the carpet for the little room yet.\'a0 Aunt Mary sent 2 peices of binding more than was necessary, & the thread we paid 50 cts for never came, so 2 dollars we might have \ul saved\ulnone , was spent. Charles has staid at home today for the first time.\'a0 Mamma no longer needs him.\'a0 He is now spading the garden, Reuben is hauling wood.\'a0 Tomorrow I will tell him to drive off the Cows.\'a0 He ought to have done it today.\'a0\'a0 The weather is now good, & much warmer & pleasanter than it has been.\'a0 Today Willie & Frank go to school the last time for 4 weeks.\'a0 Anna will not have holiday yet for 2 weeks to come. Mamma is better, but we are all so busy we have not been able to see each other.\'a0 I have no news to tell you, as I have not been out, & have seen no one.\'a0We are all pretty well.\'a0 Willie will write to you now [that] he has holiday. Charles says Burrill Ferguson who has only a Wife & two children would like to rent your Farm & that he would make a good crop for you [&] would cultivate your swamp land, that he would do better than Mr. Collins, who has so many children.\'a0 I think the dreadful sight of the unfortunate child would be objection enough to them. I must now close, & you scarcely deserve this letter but I return you\'85for evil.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Anna wrote to you yesterday.\'a0 I was very busy making up the little room carpet, & I am happy to say, little Carpets are made, & put down, & the two rooms look very neat, but I am afraid, before you see them, the dirty feet of so many servants & children will have ruined them.\'a0 The old Carpet is put down in my room, & I have moved the set of Drawers & Basin stand from the large room into ours, & the Curtains, for we are entitled to the best in the house, you especially, who works hard & makes all the money, so I thought I would have a very nice room ready for you on your return, & I assure you it looks so nice & comfortable, you will be very much pleased with it, & the carpet makes it so much warmer. I was disappointed again last night in not hearing from you.\'a0 I hope you were busy, or the Postmaster as usual careless.\'a0 Mr. Elford did not hear either.\'a0 I thought you were to write to the Patriot every Mail.\'a0 You ought to write \ul longer\ulnone  letters for the paper, & I am disappointed at their being so short.\'a0 Perhaps you have not had much to write about yet. I hope you interceded for Mrs. Hughes, after all the trouble she has taken to go so far.\'a0 She deserves to succeed in getting her son pardoned, so for her sake at least I hope the Governor will show mercy to him, & hope he will be merciful to all for whom you carried petitions. I am glad Mr. Isaac Hayne & yourself have met & spoken; nothing more is necessary.\'a0 He & his sisters are very disagreeable, I think, & though Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor lived with us, & we were brought up in intimacy, I now regard them as \ul Strangers\ulnone .\'a0 They seem cold hearted & selfish.\'a0 I am glad your cold is better.\'a0 You must give yourself no uneasiness about us.\'a0 I write to you \ul daily\ulnone , in order to make you \ul easy\ulnone  & \ul satisfied\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you to enjoy yourself & attend to your duties as a Legislator & Patriot.\'a0 I will attend to home & everything is going on well. Mr. Elford paid me a visit this morning.\'a0 He goes Monday morning in the Stage.\'a0 I will write by him.\'a0 He says Mr. Duncan & yourself are going to Charleston with him.\'a0 You must do as you please, but I think you had better go some other time, & not leave your Legislative duties now.\'a0 It will be an unnecessary expense, & when you go, there are many things I wish you to purchase which I cannot tell you now.\'a0 You had better go down in February during the Races.\'a0 You will then have been at home & wish for a change again. Aunt Mary McCall has sent 2 yds of Carpeting less than the room needs.\'a0 Mr. Elford looked at the Carpet & says he will buy it for me.\'a0 I will get him to buy a Straw carri[a]ge & chair for Hext, which I am very anxious for, & wrote to Aunt Mary to inquire the price., but I will get Mr. Elford who is so good a judge & has offered to buy anything.\'a0 To buy them for him the carri[a]ge will be 3 or 4 dollars, the chair 1 or 2.\'a0 I mention it to you, so that if Mr. Elford tells you, you need not be surprised.\'a0 I suppose you will have no objection to his getting them.\'a0 Hext needs both careri[a]ge & chair now.\'a0 Lindy hardly ever has time to hold him, & it is so much better for him to be drawn about, than held by \'85 & Charlotte. You would stay so short a time in Charleston now only a day or two, that I think it is not worth the expense going down.\'a0 Some other time you can stay longer, & carry Willie & Frank with you.\'a0 If you were to stay any time now, you would be neglecting your duties.\'a0 Mr. Elford says someone asked him if you did not feel more at home in Columbia \ul this\ulnone  winter than the last, & he said yes & that next winter you would still be more at home for the Legislature would be a new one, scarce one of the Members in it, that is now he says the Secessionists in their \ul hearts\ulnone  \ul thank\ulnone  you for getting them out of the scrape.\'a0 I think the Cooperationists are a cowardly set.\'a0 They have not the boldness to come out as Union men.\'a0 They cannot bear what you did.\'a0 I am sure you deserve to be rewarded., but not being ambitious. I am afraid you never will be.\'a0 You ought to try to advance yourself for the sake of your children. Young \ul Powell\ulnone  brought Col. Picket\'92s history of Alabama, that he gave Uncle Arthur for Mamma, & Uncle Arthur gave Aunt Eliza to send, & a bundle of Shoes, Susan sent for, & a little worsted bonnet apeice for Hext & Susan.\'a0 I wrote to Aunt Martha to buy Hext one. & she sent it as a present, but it is not pretty, & does not fit him, is too small. I have been interrupted so that the dinner hour has arrived, & dinner is coming in, so I must soon close. I sat with Anna while she practiced today, the first time for a month or more.\'a0 I am too busy to go out.\'a0I bought Reuben a pr of shoes yesterday.\'a0 He asked for them.\'a0 Mary & himself are quite well now, & Elisa as well as she ever is. The children are behaving pretty well.\'a0 Willie drove to the Farm today & Reuben brought home\'a0 a load of wood.\'a0 Willies cold is well; so is Franks.\'a0 We are all pretty well & hope you are too.\'a0 Yours as Ever, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Today is just such a day as last Sunday, except it is raining more, so none of us have gone to church.\'a0 We are all seated in the little dining room, & Willie & Anna are also writing to you, but I do not know that their letters will be worth reading.\'a0 They seem at a loss what to write about, & appeal to me every moment.\'a0 We have had some good weather, but as usual it has not continued long.\'a0 Hext is in Charlottes arms, & Fanny & Frank are plaguing us all. I received \ul two \ulnone letters from you last night.\'a0 I suppose as usual the Postmaster was careless about Mailing one of them the day before.\'a0 So in future I will not be uneasy when I do not hear from you.\'a0 I am glad everyone is so kind to you.\'a0 I hope you are spending today pleasantly at Mr. Latta\'92s.\'a0 You must accept all your invitations. I wonder what Col. Brockman wishes with 200 dollars, for he does not bring 15 dollar bibles to his Wife.\'a0 I thank you for your remembrance, but I must say I would rather you show your love by saving your money for our future support, for though it is very pleasant to spend it, you ought to recollect that you are our sole support, & now when you make, you ought to try & lay up something for the time when you will not be able to make, so you ought to deny your generous inclinations, so do not be extravagant, buy only what is necessary, & only buy such books as are really interesting.\'a0 The Bible is the best book, but the pictorial bible I have seen, the pictures are small, & not very interesting.\'a0 If you see any pretty present that Ann would like I would be pleased at your getting it, but only\'a0 something \ul reasonable\ulnone , & in buying for the children get a little present for Vardry.\'a0 You are his Godfather, & never give him anything.\'a0 Susan is grateful at your merely \ul remembering\ulnone  him, not the value of the present does she care for. I have had to buy Reuben Shoes, & an Umbrella, & sent some money to town I owed, so if you would send me 10 dollars I would be obliged to you.\'a0 My money has not given out, but it may, so I would be obliged to you to replenish my purse.\'a0 I read your letter in the Southern Patriot today.\'a0 You provoked me by mentioning Mr. Jones name.\'a0 You ought to treat him as you do the \ul Mountaineer\ulnone , & not deign to let his name appear in your paper.\'a0 The little he does in the Legislature is not worth recording.\'a0 Only in one instance ought you to have named him. & that is you ought to have mentioned \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Jones \ulnone said there were not 300 Union men in Greenville District.\'a0 His conceit & vanity provoke me beyond endurance.\'a0 He cannot forget that he stood at the head of the ticket & is still saying I suppose that \ul he\ulnone  represents the District not \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I suppose he says, \ul he\ulnone  governs it, that you have no influence at all, & then at the next election he will wan\'85 & get the votes of your friends again.\'a0 Col. Brockman & Mr. Duncan & yourself ought to keep aloof from him, & not condescend to notice him & except to mention his \ul folly\ulnone  & \ul conceit\ulnone  which should be known to the people of Greenville, I wish you to mention him in no other way.\'a0 You ought to mention how he tried to put down the 4
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of July meeting.\'a0 Mr. Jones self conceit, & a toothache I now have, have put me in a bad humour for the present & Hext is crying, so I will stop & nurse him & begin again in a better mood. Margaret H\'85 left the Jail this morning.\'a0 Mr. Elford will take this letter.\'a0 I think you had much better not go to Charleston until the Spring when you go down to the Court of Appeals.\'a0 Now if you go, you will be neglecting your duties, & you would not stay long enough to warrant the expense of going down & coming up on the Rail Road.\'a0 In the Spring you can buy Groceries & other things we need, & take one or two of the children. I hope you will be appointed a Delegate to the Baltimore Convention.\'a0 It will be a pleasant trip for you.\'a0 So that you enjoy yourself, I am wil[l]ing to remain at home \ul quietly\ulnone , & think only of you, & wish you advanced, because you have always acted so disinterestedly & nobly you deserve it & unless one is rewarded by \ul office\ulnone  & \ul honor\ulnone , they are not appreciated for their conduct by the world, they are the same men, but they are not esteemed\'a0 as they are, when they meet with reward. I see Mr. Hopkins is going to keep a school, so there will be 3 schools, besides the Academies & Mr. Arthurs.\'a0 Mr. Elford says Mr. Arthur takes the Patriot.\'a0 I felt vexed when I thought he did not; for as you go to his church, & pay him so much, I thought he was in duty bound to take your paper, but it does not seem to have enlightened him. Dr. Koch was here yesterday a little while.\'a0 He begged me to ask you to attend to the business he asked you about, says he could pay some of the money required to board Mrs. \'85 at the Asylum, that he wishes to know how much they would charge for boarding her \ul 3\ulnone  \ul months\ulnone , so attend to it for him, do not think it too little a matter.\'a0 It is important to him.\'a0 I am glad you have introduced a bill for giving the Election of President to the people.\'a0 All the Anderson petitions were good.\'a0 You must introduce their petitions as bills, give election of Governor to the people, have basis of representation altered, the free school fund more equally distributed, & taxes more justly levied, & in short\'85South Carolina a free State, & the Upper country equal to the Lower. I like to read your letters in the Patriot, & always wish they were longer & contained more.\'a0 I have written to you every day now since you left but one, when Anna wrote.\'a0I have told Mr. Elford to buy Hext a Straw carri[a]ge & chair & 2 yds of Carpeting that is needed.\'a0 He is to buy a Carpet for Mamma.\'a0 He is obliging & a good judgement, & I would rather him shop for me than anyone, so let him make the purchases I have mentioned.\'a0 They are necessary & will be very useful, & I would rather buy these things for Hext than you should buy anything for me.\'a0 Hext needs both carri[a]ge & chair now.\'a0 I intended writing to Aunt Mary to buy them, but I much prefer Mr. Elford should.\'a0 He knows exactly the kind & will send them up quickly.\'a0 I will pay for them out of the next money you make for me, rather than he should not have them.\'a0 I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0\'a0 I hope you will mention all Mr. Jones falsehoods in your letters.\'a0 They ought to be known.\'a0 Yours truly. E.F.P. I thought you were going to vote for Mr. Ashmore as Commissioner.\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 According to promise I have taken up my pen to write to you, but with literally \ul nothing\ulnone  to write about.\'a0 The clock struck 4 as the stage drove off, so you really got up unnecessarily early.\'a0 Another time I will not arouse you as I did.\'a0 I slept soundly until morning, when I awoke feeling very much fatigued from my disturbance in the night.\'a0 The children slept late, & as it proved to be a very unpleasant day, we resolved not to go to church, to hear one of Mr. Arthurs old sermons, so we read the services at home, & got through only a little while ago. Mr. Tindall left an advertisement about his writing in the walk, with a bird drawn on paper with a pen.\'a0 I told the children whichever of them behaved the best should have the bird so I put their names on paper & whenever they misbehaved gave them a mark.\'a0 Thus far Willie & Fanny have behaved the best, & bid fair one of them to get the bird. I received a note from Susan [a] little while ago.\'a0 She asked if you had left, & said you had gloomy weather.\'a0 It has been cloudy all day, gloomy & dull.\'a0 I hope you are wrapped up warm, & getting along comfortably.\'a0 I told Reuben to go to Mr. Suddeths & ask him to come tomorrow to look at the Cows, that if he went this morning, this afternoon he would go to church.\'a0 He said he would, but I have not seen him since, & do not know if he went or not. I have had the dining table moved into the small dining room, & we will take our meals there now.\'a0 It makes it so pleasant to have the table in a different room from the one we sit in.\'a0 When you come back I hope the rooms will both be fixed nicely carpeted & cleaned, & our chamber also looks more comfortable with a carpet which it has needed so long.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 We have eat[en] dinner, & it is now raining a little.\'a0 The winter has continued gloomily.\'a0 I hope the end will be pleasanter than the beginning.\'a0 If you would like Willie & Anna or one of them to commence writing under Mr. Tindall let me know & I will let them begin.\'a0 I see from his advertisement\'a0 that he does not charge unless you \ul improve\ulnone .\'a0 Hext is doing pretty well, seems not have experienced any bad effects from the Magnesia. My eyes hurt me in consequence of my loss of sleep last night.\'a0 I can hardly keep them open, & as soon as I have done writing, I will lay down on the sofa & take a nap. Take care of yourself & come back quite well.\'a0 I have read the Patriot through, your Editorial twice.\'a0 Bill Smith\'92s letter is an amusing one, & the peice on the Union from the Louisville Journal very good.\'a0 I hope Mr. Duncan, Col. Brockman & yourself are getting along in friendship & harmony.\'a0 You have stood by each other too long, to be separated easily. The children are talking, Anna is writing to you, but I do not know that she will send her letter.\'a0 I will finish before her. I believe I have nothing more to write, having parted so recently.\'a0 I will conclude as usual with a little advice.\'a0 Distinguish yourself this Session, as I think you generally do, introduce all the improvements you mentioned in your Editorial last night.\'a0 I think the road tax for the poor man is unjust.\'a0 The Election of the Commissioner ought to be given to the people, as well as President & Governor, & indeed all the changes you named ought to be adopted by the State.\'a0 Do all you can for the best interests of the State & your District Greenville, get money to build a new Court House, & in short prove yourself to be as hitherto the best member ever sent from Greenville, & I hope you may yet meet the reward you deserve, & which you have not got yet.\'a0 Adieu.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am sorry I have not better pens to write with, but as they are very bad, you must make many excuses.\'a0 Mr. Elford I suppose left this morning.\'a0 He will take you a letter from Anna & myself.\'a0 Willie thought his not worth sending.\'a0 He will write to you soon. I received a letter from you last night.\'a0 I was very glad to hear, & wish you would write every Mail.\'a0 I am pleased you are treated so well by the Secessionists.\'a0 I suppose, as Mr. Elford says, they thank you in their \ul heart\ulnone , & look upon you as one who has saved them from disgrace, though for their own credit, they feel compelled to \ul abuse\ulnone  you.\'a0 I hope they will reward you, for the good you have done them.\'a0 Mr. Memminger is a \ul mean\ulnone  man, & you have not been \ul half\ulnone  \ul hard\ulnone  enough upon him.\'a0 You ought in your paper to bring all inconsistent, selfish people to the view of the people.\'a0 I hope all such speeches as the \ul Representative\ulnone  from \ul Greenville\ulnone  lately made about their being so few Union men in Greenville, you will make known to the people, who are so \ul misrepresented\ulnone , through your paper.\'a0 I cannot bear for deceitfulness & falsehoods to pass unnoticed, & not injure the person who acts so\'85but\'85get him along prosperously & favorably.\'a0 Such people ought to be disgraced at once.\'a0 It is a wonder how such should have been honored by the people.\'a0 I hope the \ul days\ulnone  of such are \ul numbered\ulnone . The servants tell me Mr. Walker & family have left for Georgia this morning.\'a0 I hope you will not be grieved to hear the sad news.\'a0 I wish others of the same description would follow.\'a0 Yesterday was a damp, rainy, disagreeable Day.\'a0 I had toothache almost all day, & the cold penetrated me, & I have to wear a large shawl & flannel over my face; but today I feel \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , & this first day of winter has made its appearance \ul bright\ulnone  & \ul cheerful\ulnone , & most \ul charming\ulnone  for the washing of clothes, that most necessary business every Monday.\'a0 Anna is at school, & will have holiday in a week.\'a0 Willie has driven the horse & wagon to the Farm to help Reuben bring home a load of wood.\'a0 Charles is spading the garden.\'a0 Frank cut some wood, & then went in the streets to see some playmates.\'a0 Fanny makes herself very useful helping lay the table & put away the dishes.\'a0 I told her I would write you word \ul she\ulnone  was the best & you must bring her a doll, or some pretty present. I believe Green Hughes is just passing now to receive his sentence.\'a0 I suppose the Governor has not pardoned him.\'a0 I am glad you are getting along very well.\'a0 I wish you to be \ul happy\ulnone  & \ul contented\ulnone , as it is possible for you to be, without your wife by your side. Hext is well, & as sweet as ever, & waiting patiently for his Carri[a]ge & chair to arrive. Our colds are quite well.\'a0 That is the childrens & mine.\'a0 Lindy is a little hoarse; the rest of the servants are pretty well.  I have not been out once since you left, & am so busy, I do not know when I will go out.\'a0 The winter clothes for the children, are not hardly commenced making yet.\'a0 The rooms at present look very neat.\'a0 The Piano [is] in the dining room, where the Sideboard stood. The Sideboard looked so shabby, & got broke a little in moving.\'a0 I sent it to Mr. Waddil to do up, & when it returns will put it in the little dining room, as that is the place for it, when we eat, & it will save a great deal of dirt, from the servants not coming in & out constantly to it. Willie looks quite well & hearty.\'a0 Next Spring you can carry Frank & himself down with you.\'a0 You recollect in a few years Willie ought to be at college, so your expenses will then increase, so you must save your money now, for those times.\'a0 Col. Brockman must give you his note bearing interest, & then he may keep the 200 dollars as long as he wishes.\'a0Your review of Mr. Calhoun\'92s works has not been published yet in the Patriot,\'a0 I hope they will soon print Mr. F\'85\'92s peice of poetry addressed to you.\'a0 You must write & tell them to.\'a0 The paper will do badly with neither of its Editors here.\'a0 Old Mr. Reese\'92s letter has not been published either. I hope you are feeling well & looking well.\'a0 Tomorrow you must make a good speech on giving the Election of President to the people, & after that introduce some more important bills.\'a0 The basis of representation ought also to be given to the people, & you know all that ought to be done, to put South Carolina on a footing with the other States. I do not think the College will flourish under Mr. Manly as it has done under Col. Preston.\'a0 I am sorry Col. Preston has to resign.\'a0 I thought Mr. Thornwell or Mr. Henry would be elected President. I know of nothing new to tell you.\'a0 I hope you will put off your visit to Charleston till the Spring, & then Willie & Anna can go down with you.\'a0 You are sent to the Legislature by the people to attend to their business, & ought not to leave it, even for a day.\'a0 If you will go to town, go after the Session.\'a0 You can then stay longer, & will not be neglecting your duty.\'a0 The expense of going on the Railroad up & down is not worth incurring for the short time you will stay now. I write so often, I have nothing to write about & am sure you think so too, & will not be sorry I have come to the end of my sheet. Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 As I heard from you last night, & consequently have more than usual to say to you, I will write before I commence my work.\'a0 Willie, Anna, Frank & myself all received your letters last night, & were very much pleased to get them.\'a0 In all your letters you ask what you must bring me, so now I will tell you.\'a0 I love to make presents, as much as you do, so do bring me, a pair of \ul Indian\ulnone  \ul Shoes\ulnone , such as you have bought for \ul Hext\ulnone .\'a0 I wish to give them to \ul little\ulnone  \ul Susan\ulnone .\'a0 I have never made her a present yet, & would like to give her a pr of Shoes just like \ul Hexts\ulnone , & buy me also another \ul Indian\ulnone  \ul pocket\ulnone  book, that I may give it to Ann.\'a0 She is at present very poorly, & would be pleased to be noticed kindly by me in some way.\'a0 I would like \ul one\ulnone  or something else for Susan also.\'a0 If they are not very expensive, buy one of the \ul pocket\ulnone  \ul books\ulnone  for \ul Susan\ulnone , or I will instead give it to Vardry as a present.\'a0 So remember these are the things I wish you to bring me, \ul two\ulnone  \ul Indian\ulnone  \ul pocket\ulnone  books, & a pr of Indian Shoes, anything made by Indians is a curiosity, & even if not useful, is interesting to keep.\'a0 My bag is of no use.\'a0 It is too large, & the beads come out constantly.\'a0 I hope Anna\'92s is prettier than mine, & a \ul smaller\ulnone  \ul size\ulnone .\'a0 Now do not forget to bring me three things if the Indian has not gone.\'a0 These are all the presents I wish, & you must not bring many things to the children, save your money to clothe & feed us this winter, & to pay your Doctors bill, Blacksmith\'92s, Saddler\'92s &c &c to buy a new carri[a]ge & horses next Spring, & to take me to Columbia with you.\'a0 The children if you gave them a Carte blanche, would very easily fill it up, but you cannot think of gratifying all their desires.\'a0 They will each write to you, & you can select out of them what you choose to bring them.\'a0\'a0I am sorry you could not dine at Mr. Latta\'92s, & particularly the cause that prevented you.\'a0 If you see him, Mamma says you may tell him, she has not forgotten his kindness, to her on board the vessel as she was going to Philadelphia, & if he has a pretty place, & any suitable seeds to plant on a Lawn & improve \ul her\ulnone  place, she would be much obliged to him.\'a0 I read your letter in the Patriot.\'a0 I am afraid you are too kind to the Secessionists,\'a0 When you mention a Secessionist, you praise them up too much.\'a0 A Secessionist who has the heart to ruin his State & principally for his own selfish views, or the bad judgment to think he is right in wishing the State to Secede does not deserve \ul praise\ulnone .\'a0 The Cooperationists are the safest of the \ul two\ulnone  \ul parties\ulnone , as they can do no injury, have to wait for the other States to join them, but the Secessionists would ruin the State now at once.\'a0 I like Mr. Owens bill, that the people have resolved \ul against\ulnone  \ul Secession\ulnone .\'a0 I hope you will make an able speech on his side.\'a0 If the Convention does meet, arrange it, that it will not meet when the Baltimore Convention meets to nominate President, as you\'85to go to that, & will have to go to the Columbia Convention.\'a0 I do not understand how it is that Mississippi has no Governor, as the Patriot says, & I suppose she has not, as I see Mr. Footes name mentioned in Washington. If Mr. Burt wishes you Governor, I am sorry he does not edit a newspaper now, for if he did, he would make known his wishes to the people.\'a0 He commenced editing at the wrong time, when he \ul injured\ulnone  you, & stops when he would \ul benefit\ulnone  you.\'a0 If you tried for Office, I expect you would get it, but I hope you may still get it one day. I am sorry a Baptist will be elected President of the College.\'a0 My idea of that Sect is always associated with ignorance & cont\'85[word faded], & a Minister, the young men will feel a \ul prejudice\ulnone  against.\'a0 They are generally so sanctimonious, & put on the appearance of religion, where very often it is wanting.\'a0 Willie is again hauling wood.\'a0 He drives the wagon.\'a0 The children all talk constantly of you.\'a0 Your letters pleased them very much.\'a0 Fanny & Hext the next time you must write to.\'a0 Mamma has a bad cold & Ann poorly.\'a0 I rode in the Buggy yesterday for the first time to see them.\'a0 Mamma has made an arrangement with Mr. Saterfield who has been overseeing for Mr. McBee to cultivate her place next year, & make everything for her, & attend to the \ul whole\ulnone  place.\'a0 He has a wife but no children.\'a0 I wish you would get such a person.\'a0 I do not wish ever to rent your place to a large family.\'a0 They will burn too much wood.\'a0 Mr. Saterfield says your place well attended to, would yield so well you would have to buy very little provision, or none at all.\'a0 He is a friend of yours, says it is not easy to find another like \ul you\ulnone  & he takes the \ul Patriot\ulnone , so of course he will have me for a friend.\'a0 He will cut wood, raise hogs, work in the garden.\'a0 His wife [word faded] Chickens & Eggs, attend[s] to the Cow, & do[es] just Mr. P\'85 white overseers & family do.\'a0 So I hope Mamma will be more comfortably fixed than heretofore.\'a0 Negroes hire is so dear now 105 dollars a year for a man.\'a0 She is obliged to take Mr. John Townes woman, who has just been confined, so will have a young infant along with her.\'a0 She can get no other.\'a0 She will go in a few weeks. We have bright cheerful weather now, & even Commencement day turned out better than you supposed.\'a0 At least it was a charming day here. I have read the Patriot through.\'a0 It is the only paper I see.\'a0 I hope you will get some subscribers to it, while in Columbia. You made your speech yesterday I suppose, on the Election of President.\'a0 You can improve it, & write it out, & publish it in the Patriot, or publish the one you made before.\'a0 You occupy an independent position.\'a0 You are between the two parties Cooperation & Secession, can see the faults & virtues of each, & write of them accordingly. I am glad you are to dine\'a0 with old Mr. \'85.\'a0 Tell him \ul I\ulnone  am the \ul Originator\ulnone  of the \ul Southern\ulnone  \ul Patriot\ulnone , & even the Editors themselves were about to give up, I \ul encouraged\ulnone  & \ul made\ulnone  them \ul go\ulnone  \ul on\ulnone .\'a0 He ought to hand down \ul my\ulnone  \ul name\ulnone  to posterity in \ul poetry\ulnone . Do not be extravagant, my dear husband, bring me a present in \ul money \ulnone when you come home if you wish it.\'a0 So instead of buying so many things now, come home with a pocket full of money, but buy the Shoes & pocket books I have told you.\'a0 E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a short letter from you last night.\'a0 You mentioned your Bill for giving the Election of the President to the people was \ul lost\ulnone  you did not say; you made a \ul good\ulnone  speech, but I hope you were \ul satisfied\ulnone  with your effort, & not \ul mortified\ulnone  at your ill \ul success\ulnone .\'a0 You know \ul nothing\ulnone  is to be expected from the \ul present\ulnone  \ul Legislature\ulnone .\'a0 They were elected before the people were \ul enlightened\ulnone  & go against \ul all\ulnone  \ul reform\ulnone .\'a0 The \ul next\ulnone  \ul Legislature\ulnone  will be \ul different\ulnone .\'a0 You can then introduce all the reforms you wish, & be \ul supported\ulnone .\'a0 You are now rowing \ul against\ulnone  the \ul current\ulnone .\'a0 Next Session the current will \ul go\ulnone  \ul along\ulnone  with you. I read your letter in the Patriot.\'a0 I am glad Dr. Thornwell was elected President of the College.\'a0 I am sorry a \ul Baptist\ulnone  for Dr. Thornwell\'92s place was elected, for I should think \ul he\ulnone  would interpret the Bible according to the \ul Baptist\ulnone  creed, which of all creeds is the most \ul illiberal\ulnone , & he will pervert the minds of the Students.\'a0 It is too small a denomination to be represented in College.\'a0 The students are generally of other denominations.\'a0 Mr. Wilkes\'92 bill to \ul repeal\ulnone  the \ul Convention\ulnone  I like, & Mr. Owen\'92s bill \'93that the people have declared against Secession &c.\'94\'a0 They are just such bills as I suppose \ul you\ulnone  would have introduced.\'a0 The Secessionists had better do all they wish \ul now\ulnone  before another Session.\'a0 I hope their power will have departed, & all their acts repealed.\'a0 \ul Then\ulnone  I hope \ul you\ulnone  will be the Leader, & for \ul once\ulnone  in a \ul majority\ulnone , & I hope you will be rewarded so do not be discouraged, if \ul now\ulnone  you fail in your endeavors to free the \ul Upper\ulnone  \ul Country\ulnone  from the bondage of the \ul lower\ulnone .\'a0 All Reformers you know have to \ul persevere\ulnone , meet with \ul opposition\ulnone  at \ul first\ulnone , but in the \ul end\ulnone  are \ul appreciated\ulnone .\'a0 Next winter I \ul must\ulnone  go down with you.\'a0 I love to hear public speaking, but above all else my \ul husband\ulnone  \ul speaking\ulnone .\'a0 I would like to have been among the ladies in the Gallery listening to you.\'a0 Hext will be a fine boy to introduce next winter.\'a0 He will surpass Willie & Frank.\'a0 I kissed him for you, & delivered your messages to the children. Willie all day is so busy hauling wood.\'a0 He has very little time left for reading, & the exercise seems to agree with him.\'a0 He looks \ul healthy\ulnone  & \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 When you return he can sit in your Office & read, & resume his studies, & the 1
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super st
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of January he will again go to school, & Mr. Leary will have I suppose so few scholars he can attend \ul well\ulnone  to \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 Anna\'92s school breaks up today.\'a0 Mr. Capers sent her bill yesterday for 6 weeks, 3 dollars.\'a0 My money had not given out, but except for your timely assistance last night of 10 dollars, I would not have ventured to have paid it, but this morning as my fund was replenished, I did pay it, sent 3 dollars by Anna, & felt quite \ul independent\ulnone .\'a0 There will be so many schools to choose from, when Anna begins again, I am as uncertain who she will go to, as who will be next President. Mr. Chalmers being a \ul Secessionist\ulnone , I would not have listened with pleasure to his speech; the \ul Union\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone  only would have pleased me.\'a0 \ul They\ulnone  are to be admired for their \ul independence\ulnone  if nothing else.\'a0 I love the \ul Union\ulnone  \ul men\ulnone , those who come out \ul openly\ulnone  for the \ul Union\ulnone .\'a0 The \ul Cooperationists\ulnone  & \ul Secessionists\ulnone  I have no sympathy for, they are \ul both\ulnone  \ul equally\ulnone  \ul bad\ulnone , but the \ul latter\ulnone  more dangerous.\'a0 They both act from \ul selfish\ulnone  \ul motives\ulnone , for their own \ul aggrandizement\ulnone , where they do not, they are ignorant & under a delusion that amounts to derangement. I would be glad for you to do something for Dr. Koch\'92s \ul wife\ulnone , but when you return, do not let him annoy you.\'a0 He is a perfect \ul bore\ulnone .\'a0 He has been here repeatedly after wood, which he has no idea of paying for, or he would go somewhere else, tells all manner of stories about his not being able to get anyone to haul it, & came yesterday to borrow \ul Meal\ulnone .\'a0 I sent him a little sausage, said I \ul gave\ulnone  it , but would spare no more, & I do not \ul see\ulnone  him now when he comes.\'a0 One or two loads of wood does not satisfy him.\'a0 He wishes us to supply him altogether.\'a0 Our horses are not equal to such a task, & I am not going to send him any more.\'a0 I do not believe he has a single scholar now, & he loses them by his own misconduct.\'a0 I think him so poor a Teacher, that I would hardly consent he should teach Anna for \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 He has disgusted her with Music, from the really \ul hard\ulnone  peices he has given her which she \ul plays\ulnone , but more as a \ul task\ulnone  than anything else.\'a0 Today is very pleasant, bright & cheerful.\'a0 I hope you have the same weather. \'a0We sit altogether in the little Dining room, which is very comfortable.\'a0 The larger room we are keeping clean for \ul you\ulnone , but I have a fire made in it every day, in case anyone calls.\'a0 Mr. Elford seemed to admire the Carpet very much.\'a0 If he writes from Charleston, & you from Columbia, the Patriot will be interesting.\'a0 Mr. Reese\'92s letter & Mr. F\'85\'92s poetry are published in this mornings paper.\'a0 I am afraid they will be published in the Weekly if next week, too late for the Session.\'a0 They put off publishing it so long, I was afraid they were not going to publish it, so I wrote yesterday to ask them to, & accordingly they did.\'a0 I wished you to see C\'85 Reese\'92s letter at once, as I knew it would gratify you.\'a0 I am still staying at home, busy all the time, not one moment to spare.\'a0 The afternoons are generally windy,, or I would go over to see Mamma.\'a0 I must soon make one desperate effort, & return all my visits, & then stay at home with a \ul clear\ulnone  \ul conscience\ulnone .\'a0 I have written to you every Mail but one or two when I got Anna to write, so you have heard every Mail.\'a0 It is a great comfort, & I begrudge the not hearing Monday night. The children have not commenced under Mr. Tisdale.\'a0 They seem disinclined to.\'a0 When you return if he is here, they can commence.\'a0 As I have not much to write about I will conclude with some \ul advice\ulnone .\'a0 You know I am very generous to you in furnishing a constant supply \ul free\ulnone  of \ul charge\ulnone .\'a0 I do not wish you to be in debt to me, as you certainly would, if I charged.\'a0 So this is it.\'a0 Do your duty as a \ul Legislator\ulnone & a \ul Patriot\ulnone  a \ul Member\ulnone  from the \ul Upper\ulnone  \ul Country\ulnone .\'a0 Do all your \ul Constituents\ulnone  \ul expect\ulnone  of \ul you\ulnone , & which you are so well able to do.\'a0 Satisfy your conscience, do not be disheartened at ill success.\'a0 Expect it now, sow the seed & after awhile it will appear & yield abundantly & though I am \ul much\ulnone  \ul afraid\ulnone  you will \ul never\ulnone  be rewarded\'a0 in a \ul tangible\ulnone  \ul form\ulnone , yet I will \ul hope\ulnone  even \ul against\ulnone  \ul hope\ulnone , & try to think you \ul will\ulnone  \ul be\ulnone .\'a0 I appreciate you, but that does not \ul satisfy\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you to be appreciated by \ul others\ulnone , & you will never be, unless you meet with honor & Office. In Greenville Village particularly, I wish you to be held in the consideration you \ul deserve\ulnone .\'a0 I cannot bear that \ul all\ulnone  should not \ul see \ulnone & be \ul made to feel\ulnone  how \ul much\ulnone  you are their \ul Superior\ulnone , I hope you will one day occupy a \ul position\ulnone  that will \ul make\ulnone  them feel it.\'a0 Then I will be \ul satisfied\ulnone , for \ul you\ulnone  will then be \ul appreciated\ulnone  & your \ul children after you\ulnone .\'a0 This winter you are treated better in Columbia than you were last winter, & next winter as Mr. Elford says, you will be treated still better, for those who are making themselves so important now, I hope will be at home, & an entirely different set, more of your own views will surround you, so good bye, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you last night, short as usual, but as I know you are \ul busy\ulnone , I will not \ul complain\ulnone .\'a0 It is a \ul great\ulnone  \ul satisfaction\ulnone  to hear \ul every\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone .\'a0 I dare say it would surprise many \ul old\ulnone  \ul married\ulnone  \ul couples\ulnone  to know how \ul essential\ulnone  \ul we\ulnone  find it to our comfort, to hear of each others welfare \ul every\ulnone  day when \ul once\ulnone  a \ul week\ulnone , or \ul not\ulnone  at \ul all\ulnone  would satisfy them, but I believe \ul we\ulnone  are an exception to the general rule & our love \ul increases\ulnone , instead of diminishing.\'a0 I hope you will \ul never\ulnone  find one to supply \ul my\ulnone  place, & I do not think I would ever find one to supply yours. I am sorry you did not intend to take part in the discussion on the Convention bill.\'a0 You ought to have done what you could, & perhaps you could have said something to influence the vote, & then you would have written out your speech & published it, so the people would see it.\'a0 Your speech last winter, had not much influence in the Legislature, but when published\'a0 & read by those who did \ul not\ulnone  \ul hear\ulnone  it, it had its \ul effect\ulnone .\'a0 Whenever you can be of service by expressing your thoughts you ought not to remain silent.\'a0 Publish your Electoral Bill speech, & let the people read it, & they will think differently from the contemptible Politicians like Mr. Hutson, & in the end express their rights. I will tell Mr. Koch the terms of admittance into the Asylum when I next see him.\'a0 Susan says she hears he beats his Wife with his fist. I told Reuben this week to kill hogs, & he said they have not been up long enough in the pen, to make them fit to eat, that \ul next\ulnone  week he would kill them.\'a0 The weather has been very suitable for killing hogs, & everybody seems to have killed.\'a0 We have not been in want of meat yet.\'a0 We have commenced today to use the Beef that was smoking & have [word faded] a little bacon & some Fowls. Last night I bought some Fodder from Mr. Fosters negro, 185 bundles, for $1.85 cts.\'a0 I was sorry to have to pay the money, for I need all I have to supply the family with clothes.\'a0 The clothing of a family of 19 comes to a great deal, a weight of responsibility rests on you. Mamma at present has a girl of Mrs. Pearsons.\'a0 She went to tea yesterday, & seems clever.\'a0 She is \ul young\ulnone  & she said her wages were 6 dollars a month, but if she could not get that, they would be 5.\'a0 She looks not older than Mary, & has already been Mr. Crofts cook.\'a0 I hope Mamma can get her for 5,\'a0 It is so much better to have a servant without children, & if she does not get Mrs. Parsons servant, she knows of no other than Mr. John Town[e]s, who will have with her, a child or two.\'a0 Susan walked in this morning to shop a little & paid me a visit, but she told me no particular news that I could tell you. Willie is again hauling wood today.\'a0 He likes to drive the wagon very much & as exercise in this fine weather is good for him, I let him go with Reuben.\'a0 Little Annie is dining here, & Anna is busy with her, or she would write to you; perhaps she will tomorrow.\'a0 The \'93Cadet of Temperance\'94 was sent here yesterday for the first time.\'a0 It is an interesting little paper.\'a0 If you have no objection I will let Willie subscribe for it.\'a0 You are entitled I suppose to it, being an Editor yourself, & as it is published in your Printing office, but as it will be an encouragement to them to have an additional subscriber, I thought I would send Willie\'92s name, with 50 cts.\'a0 You must notice \'93the Cadet of Temperance\'94 in your paper. Mr. Foster I forgot to tell you will haul the Corn next week.\'a0 Our Corn has not given out yet.\'a0 Charles is still spading the garden.\'a0 We are \ul all\ulnone  \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 I have no \ul complaints\ulnone .\'a0 I must soon stop, so I will as usual give you some advice.\'a0 I wish you to let no opportunity \ul pass\ulnone  in the Legislature, when your opinion can be of service, that you do not \ul express\ulnone  it.\'a0 Do what you can to benefit your \ul Constituents\ulnone .\'a0 There are not many Members from the Upper Country who are able to \ul speak \ulnone & be of service to the people, & from the lower Country there are always a plenty to stand up & encourage her in her encroachments.\'a0 So those few who are able to be of service & to speak in defense\'a0 of the Upper Country must do it, but you know your duty, & do not need me to tell you, so I must stop. Do not put yourself to any expense to bring presents\'a0 for the children.\'a0 They break & destroy everything so soon, & your expenses at home are so great, particularly now, provisions of every kind are high, that you must keep your money to \ul support\ulnone  \ul us\ulnone .\'a0 Bring them some little things & bring the 2 pocket books & the Indian Shoes I mentioned.\'a0 Your true & faithful wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This afternoon I wrote you a few hurried lines to go by tomorrows mail, & prevent your being uneasy.\'a0 Until this now, I have not had a moment to spare today to write to you.\'a0 The children & myself went to church this morning.\'a0 It was Communion Sunday, so when I got home it was so late dinner was ready.\'a0 Mamma & Ann Susan & the children dined here, & just after dinner we went to the Episcopal church to attend the funeral of Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Ioor\'92s daughter, whose death I am sure would greatly surprise you.\'a0 If Mr. McBee had not mentioned that she was in the last stage of Consumption.\'a0 Your telling me that alone prevented me from being greatly shocked when the invitation to her funeral was brought here this morning.\'a0 Mr. Arthur mentioned in his discourse that he believed she had safely gone to heaven, that last Wednesday she partook of Communion & seemed to derive great comfort from it.\'a0 Mrs. Ioor was not at the funeral.\'a0 Her brother & a person who I suppose was Mr. Evans, were the only mourners.\'a0 So lately we saw Mrs. Evans go up to the Altar to be confirmed, & in so short a time after she has been carried to the same altar in her coffin. Mrs. John Jones is very low.\'a0 It is said she cannot hold on long.\'a0 When Mr. Henning\'92s funeral took place, she requested the bell might not be tolled, & this afternoon it as not tolled on her account.\'a0 Mr. Tom Butlers son the \ul second\ulnone , is very ill, not expected to live.\'a0 Mrs. Carson has has one sick but he is getting better. I saw Mrs. Perry Duncan at church this afternoon.\'a0 She told me she only returned from Georgia yesterday.\'a0 She has altered in her appearance so much.\'a0 She used to look \ul fair\ulnone  & \ul delicate\ulnone , now she looks \ul coarse\ulnone  & \ul ugly\ulnone , & her eyes seem affected, but do not \ul mention\ulnone  this \ul opinion\ulnone  to Mr. Duncan.\'a0 I told her I heard of Mr. Duncan constantly, & he was quite well.\'a0 I saw Mrs. Elford also at church, & told her she must not be \ul jealous\ulnone , but I had been writing to Mr. Elford.\'a0 Mamma begged me to write to him to buy her some Clover & O\'85 grass seed, & I did, & told him if he could get some pretty reasonable Dining Table covers, to get me some.\'a0 The Carpet & Piano in the Dining room has made the old ones look to shabby.\'a0 I told Mr. Elford that I wrote to \ul him\ulnone  instead of \ul you\ulnone , because I had written to \ul you\ulnone , \ul not\ulnone  to go to town, as you had heretofore been a \ul very\ulnone  \ul obedient\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone .\'a0 I knew you would not go, & these things we wished purchased in Charleston, but the letter will have arrived so long before he does, that I am afraid it may be returned here, & he may not get it.\'a0 I read your letter in the Patriot.\'a0 I am sorry you remain so \ul inactive\ulnone  in the \ul Legislature\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to \ul speak\ulnone  & do your best to have \ul influence\ulnone  & to be listened to with \ul respect\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to express your views & not be \ul silent\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to speak so the whole State can hear you, & not express your views merely in private conversation, but I see you need \ul me\ulnone  to direct you in future.\'a0 I will always go down with you\'a0 Never was\'a0 husband blessed with so \ul wise\ulnone  a \ul wife\ulnone .\'a0 Do you not in your heart think I have more wisdom in affairs generally than most of the female sex.\'a0 I must be more than ordinary, for \ul you\ulnone  to be satisfied with me. I was very much provoked this morning to see Mr. Campbell not only in \ul front\ulnone  of us, but \ul exactly\ulnone  in front almost \ul touching\ulnone  where \ul you\ulnone  sit.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Arthur were in Dr. Simons pew, which I suppose they are to occupy now.\'a0 I think it a great peice of \ul impertinence\ulnone  in him to put himself in that place, & that Mr. Arthur knowing how he has treated you, ought to have told him it was improper in him to put himself in contact with you, & ought not to have let Mrs. Arthur taken that pew.\'a0 \ul Mamma\ulnone  & \ul myself \ulnone both think it \ul derogatory\ulnone  to your dignity to be seated just \ul behind\ulnone  \ul Mr. Campbell\ulnone , so we both think that \ul you\ulnone  must change our pew for Mr. Poinsetts, the pew we first sat in.\'a0 We can occupy it until he comes up, but I rather think he will \ul never\ulnone  come up again, so we can keep the pew altogether.\'a0 Mamma says \ul she\ulnone  likes to be far back.\'a0 It suits her, but that Mr. Poinsetts pew is the one suited for you, & that you ought to sit in, so you must not object to my proposition:\'a0 I can take no company in going to church, if Mr. Campbell is to be stuck in front of us every Sunday. Mr. Arthur\'92s sermon this morning was a Missionary one.\'a0 A collection is to be taken up next Sunday for the cause, & Mr. Arthur is to preach at Spartanburg, & there will be Lay reading, so he gave us the sermon today, that he would have preached next Sunday if here.\'a0 He proved that the \ul Episcopal\ulnone  was the first denomination of religion preached in this country, that years after the Pilgrim fathers came over, & afterwards the Catholics under Lord Baltimore & they had no right to come over & cause Schism.\'a0 His whole sermon as usual was to prove that the Episcopal was the best, & the only true church.\'a0 These sermons I do not like, for I have always felt, that one church was as good as another, but the \ul form\ulnone  of Worship in the Episcopal church I like.\'a0 The Baptists I disapprove of, because they will permit no other Christians to commune with them.\'a0 They are illiberal.\'a0 During the Communion service Mr. Arthur said he \ul earnestly \ulnone requested the Communicants to take off their \ul gloves\ulnone  when they received the Communion, that it was much more \ul respectful\ulnone  than to keep them on.\'a0 Mamma says it is a custom in the Episcopal church to commune \ul without\ulnone  gloves, but she had never regarded it as of any importance, but Mr. Arthur now regards \ul form\ulnone  altogether & perhaps he believes in \ul Transubstantiation\ulnone .\

My dear husband\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just returned from Mrs. John Jones funeral & will write to you.\'a0 Genl Thompson it was thought would have returned last night, but he did not.\'a0 The funeral was at the Baptist church.\'a0 Mr. Hopkins preached a strange sermon for a funeral one.\'a0 It was on St. Paul, his belief in the gospel.\'a0 If you had not seen the \ul Coffin\ulnone , you would not have known it was over a corpse he was preaching.\'a0 It was a \ul long\ulnone  \ul sermon\ulnone , & when he had finished it, for it was \ul written\ulnone , he closed the Bible, & made a few remarks on the character of the deceased, said she was perfectly resigned to die, & in her last moments said she was not \ul afraid\ulnone , only that she might not have \ul patience\ulnone  to bear the \ul lingering\ulnone  approach\'a0 of the dread monster, & begged her friends to improve her death, & prepare to follow her.\'a0 Mr. Tom Butler\'92s son William is dead, died last night, so Mrs. Whiteford Smith told me today.\'a0 Only one son is left & 3 daughters, & Mrs. Butler expects before long to be confined.\'a0 Mrs. Stone & some of her daughters were packed & ready to start to town when a servant being sick detained them.\'a0 Then the little boy was taken sick.\'a0 The servant got well, & the little boy died.\'a0 I know of no other sickness at present. Now that I think of it, do my dear husband when you return, take your seat in the \ul safest\ulnone  Car.\'a0 So many Rail Road accidents are happening.\'a0 I think it dangerous traveling on the Road, & be careful also not to have your pocket picked of the little money you will have left.\'a0 I see in the last Patriot someone on taking his seat in the Cars leaving Charleston, had his pocket robbed containing 500 dollars. The children & myself received your letters last night & thank you for them.\'a0 They are very much pleased at the presents you have bought them, but \ul I\ulnone  am \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 You must mean to make them \ul sick\ulnone  with sugar plums.\'a0 I wish you would keep your money to buy necessaries we need, & to support your family, & pay your yearly bills.\'a0 So do not buy anything more for the children or myself.\'a0 I you really wish me to go to Columbia with you in the Spring, keep your money to pay any expenses, for I am afraid you will not have enough to carry me. Only one commission I will give you, & that is to buy me a Receipt book called \'93\ul Miss Leslie\'92s 75 receipt book\ulnone .\'94\'a0 By me \ul two\ulnone  of them.\'a0 They are \ul small\ulnone  books & do not \ul cost\ulnone  much.\'a0 One of them I wish for Susan.\'a0 They are the best receipts published, so if you can get them, bring me \ul two\ulnone .\'a0 The hogs were killed yesterday.\'a0 It was so warm, we had no fire & windows up, & I disapproved entirely of having them killed, but today is rather cooler, & Charles says there is no danger of the Meat spoiling. Mr. Foster sent a load of Corn today 8 barrels, so Willie says.\'a0 It came when I was away. You have before this received the letter in which I told you of Mr. Campbell\'92s impertinence, in sitting exactly in front of \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I now \ul seriously\ulnone  tell you, that unless you change your pew & take Mr. Poinsetts, I will give up the Episcopal church, for when I go to church I wish to feel pleased & composed, no disagreeable thoughts intruding themselves on my mind, & to have a person who I look upon as one of your greatest enemies, sitting exactly in front of me, so I cannot move my head, without having my thoughts disturbed by him, is out of the question, & I do not intend to put up with.\'a0 It is a peice of insolence we can render ineffective by outwitting.\'a0 He wishes to be just in front of you, that you may \ul see\ulnone  him, & \ul think\ulnone  of him, but he will find he is mistaken.\'a0 That your dignity is not\'a0 [to] be treated in that way by a vain, \ul conceited\ulnone  creature.\'a0 Our pew is too near the Stove, which will be a good excuse for changing it, but I now say \ul distinctly\ulnone , that I give up our pew.\'a0 I am not going to occupy it again.\'a0 I read the peice of Newspaper you enclosed in your letter.\'a0 I was not pleased with it.\'a0 What it said in your favor, was so short of what you \ul deserve\ulnone , that I set no value on it, & I did not know there was such a bitter feeling against you, as the Writer states.\'a0 I thought Secession being dead, that you were looked upon with kindness, & did not know anything you proposed, would be opposed.\'a0 I hope this is not so. You ought to have spoken on the Convention bill, as it was of so much importance, you ought to have been able to say, that you did all you could to prevent its passing.\'a0 The older members ought to have spoken, &\'85left it to the younger. Mr. Hutson, as a boy, was a bragger & boaster & self conceited & insignificant.\'a0 My relations have been your enemies as well as ours, & my relations are the last persons I would apply to if in want. My relations I look upon as enemies, & it is \ul they \ulnone alone, that prevent my having any wish to visit Charleston.\'a0 I wish to go to \ul New\ulnone  \ul Haven\ulnone , but I do not care to see \ul Charleston\ulnone .\'a0 Hext, Wilie & myself can go to Columbia with you next Spring, Willie to escort me about\'a0 when you are engaged.\'a0 Hext of necessity has to go with me.\'a0I am glad you thought of Susan\'92s children in buying Sugar plumbs.\'a0 I am sorry for those children, & wish to give them something to show my regard.\'a0 Susan will be pleased at your remembering them. Frank cannot read your letter to him, but he knows what presents you have bought him, so he takes up the letter & begins, \'93my dear Frank, I have bought you some crackers, & a gold pen & some sugar plumbs,\'94 & then he comes to a pause, then begins again.\'a0 Fanny is very much pleased with the Mouse, & her stomach full of sugar plumbs. I am going over this afternoon to help Mamma do some work.\'a0 We all long to see you.\'a0 Do not leave until the Legislature adjourns. I hope you do all you ought to do, & do not remain inactive, when you ought to be active.\'a0 You may tell Mr. Ashmore the Upper country is my home.\'a0 I go for it \ul entirely\ulnone  & for the Upper country Candidates on all occasions.\'a0 I wish he had told you, the compliments the ladies paid you.\'a0 I hope Mr. Richards & the pupil are married now.\'a0 In haste, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I did not hear from you last night, which disappointed me greatly.\'a0 I hope it is the Postmaster in Columbia\'92s fault, & that tonight I will get \ul two\ulnone  letters, at any rate \ul one\ulnone .\'a0 When I receive no letter, I have not much to write about, as I write so often. Yesterday the children & myself all went over to Mamma\'92s & spent the afternoon.\'a0 Susan was there with a bad headache.\'a0 She suffers with them almost all the time.\'a0 Ann also feels poorly. Mamma says Mr. Hutson is so \ul distantly\ulnone  related to us, she does not look upon him as a relatiall.\'a0 His con\'85 is so \ul remote\ulnone , I do not even know what degree it is. Mamma has at present a girl of Mrs. Pearsons, who she likes very much.\'a0 The girl says her wages are 6 dollars a month, but if she cannot get that, she is to take 5 dollars, & that she has tried all over the village, & cannot get a place.\'a0 When Mamma heard of her she was working for Dr. Koch for nothing.\'a0 She told Anna yesterday that Dr. Koch had got wood from so many persons, & not paid for it.\'a0 Now, no one would carry him any, & some \ul cold\ulnone  days had been \ul without\ulnone  \ul fire\ulnone , that he had but one mattress for his whole family, & \ul two\ulnone  blankets.\'a0 She told Mary at the Spring, that Dr. Koch bought a Possum, & one day he would cut off \ul one\ulnone  \ul leg\ulnone , & give it to cooked, & the next day another, & so on, until it was all gone, that his Wife sits down & cries.\'a0 The law is that if a man is strong enough to support his Wife & family they are to look to him alone for support.\'a0 But there ought to be a law for families situated like Dr. Koch where the father \ul will\ulnone  not work to support them.\'a0 The son & daughter ought to be taken from him, & put to trades, & the Wife & young children sent to the poor house.\'a0 Dr. Koch is a \ul worthless\ulnone  \ul creature\ulnone  .\'a0 He sets up for a \ul gentleman\ulnone , so he is \ul above\ulnone  working.\'a0 It was presumptuous in him to charge 1 dollar a lesson for Music when he is as \ul poor\ulnone  a \ul teacher\ulnone  as can be.\'a0 Anna[\'91s] improvement is owing only to me.\'a0 If \ul I\ulnone  had not attended to her she would have learnt \ul nothing\ulnone . Fanny came running in just now to say Anna said I must tell you, she was teaching her, her lesson.\'a0 Fanny got her spelling book out of the Library, & carried it to Anna to teach her.\'a0 Willie was seated in the room looking over a little book.\'a0 I told him he had better read Baker\'92s\'85, so I might give a good account of him.\'a0 He went in the Library to get it, & I have been rattling some bones, & I sent to tell him, I would write you word he was shaking bones, instead of reading, so he stopped, & I hope now he is reading.\'a0Mrs. Walker I believe goes today.\'a0 Her negroes have already passed\'a0 I have heard so often she was going.\'a0 I won\'92t believe it until she is actually gone. I wish you would ask Col. Ashmore what the ladies said about you.\'a0 I love to hear you complimented. Mary says Mrs. Barnard Cleveland\'92s father, old Mr. Jim Cleveland is dead.\'a0The weather now & for several days past, is like Spring.\'a0 I hope you will have such to come home in.\'a0 The nights are as light almost as day.\'a0 I wish you would consult the best Physician in Columbia about your cold, & ask if your \ul tooth\ulnone  has anything to do with the flowing from your nose, & if you had better have it drawn, & you can have the gold to be artificial tooth fixed in a way to do without the decayed tooth.\'a0 No one is better off for a decayed tooth in their mouth.\'a0 It is best to get rid of it.\'a0 Do attend to this matter now while you are in Columbia, & can ask advice of a good Physician.\'a0 For \ul my\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone  do it, for if your cold is not put a stop to at once, you will go into Consumption. We are all well.\'a0 I see Miss Cornelia Crittenden & Dr. Blackman walking together every now & then.\'a0 I once heard Mr. Walker tell her, she would be satisfied only as a \ul Princess\ulnone , but I think she has lowered her pride, instead of a Prince to take an unknown Dentist.\'a0I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0 I suppose no Election has been made to the Female Academy.\'a0 Mr. Erwin I believe is the only Candidate, so I hope he will be elected.\'a0 Frank can then get rid of him, & there are so many Female schools, we are not obliged to send Anna to him  must now close after writing a letter literally about nothing.\'a0 When I commenced I did not know I would fill a page. Do your duty. The next Legislature I suppose will be composed of Members of entirely different politics from the present.\'a0 Since the people have been enlightened by the Patriot, & you can then carry your measures \ul triumphantly\ulnone , without any difficulty, so do not be \ul discouraged\ulnone .\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have been visiting this morning, & have just returned.\'a0 It is 1 oclock so I have not much time to write to you.\'a0 After dinner I am going to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.\'a0 Willie is going to drive me in the Buggy.\'a0 Reuben is at the Farm cutting wood, & Charles wants Jock to plough some beds in the garden this afternoon.\'a0 This morning Willie drove me in the carri[a]ge.\'a0 I received your letter last night, in which you mention you had to be in three places at the same time.\'a0 I wish to know how you managed.\'a0 I expect \ul self\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone  governed you, & you went to Court. Frank says you must bring each of them, that is Willie & himself a pack of Crackers, but I expect you can get them cheaper here. Some of the news I heard this morning is, that Mrs. Campbell has a daughter.\'a0 Two weeks ago it was born.\'a0 I am glad Mr. Campbell had not a \ul son \ulnone to boast of as a \ul Secession\ulnone  \ul boy\ulnone .\'a0 Miss Lewis is engaged to Mr. Ioor, to be married the 30
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of this month.\'a0 Perhaps you will recollect I predicted this match, when I saw them together at Professor Hale\'92s lecture.\'a0 I said \ul he\ulnone  would be glad of a \ul little\ulnone  \ul property\ulnone  & she would be glad of a \ul husband\ulnone .\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Arthur this morning, as I am going to change the pew.\'a0 I thought I would go just to see her, to show her I was not vexed with \ul her\ulnone , though knowing you do not \ul speak\ulnone  to Mr. Campbell.\'a0 She had no business to take the pew she has.\'a0 Mr. Campbell does not wish to sit behind you, you who have never \ul illtreated\ulnone  \ul him\ulnone , & yet wishes you to sit behind him, \ul he\ulnone  who has abused you.\'a0 You will say it is a \ul little\ulnone  matter, & it is, but it is matter enough to make me feel very disagreeable at church, a place where I ought to feel pleasant, so I will arrange matters, that my seat may be pleasant & free from insolence & impertinence.\'a0 Mr. Campbell last Sunday sat with his face turned entirely towards our pew, so we could see the whole of his face.\'a0 I think he is the most \ul vain\ulnone , \ul conceited\ulnone  person I ever saw.\'a0 He \ul beats\ulnone  Mr. Jones.\'a0 Next Sunday, his self conceit will be pulled down.\'a0 I found Mr. Arthur reading the Patriot.\'a0 He said the \ul verses\ulnone  were very complimentary to you.\'a0 I Iold him the Author wrote word.\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  ought to be proud of my position as a Wife.\'a0 I like \ul him\ulnone , much better than Mrs. Arthur.\'a0 I hope to hear tonight from you.\'a0 I read your letter in the Patriot this morning.\'a0 It was such a short one.\'a0 I am really surprised you do not take part in the Convention bill, & the Bank bill, that you do not raise your voice to defeat them.\'a0 It is what you owe your Constituents. To do all you can for them, to relieve them from Taxes, & oppression.\'a0 I am glad you are grateful for my advice.\'a0 If I had time, I would put you under further obligations, but I am obliged now to stop.\'a0 I will write you a longer letter tomorrow.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received two letters from you. & though I wrote to you [to]day, I was so hurried, I wrote but a few lines, & as I have more leisure at night, than in the day, I will write to you now, instead of tomorrow.\'a0 If anything occurs tomorrow worth relating, I can write again.\'a0 I am truly sorry to hear you have been sick.\'a0\'a0 I will be very anxious until tomorrow night, when I hope to hear from you, that you are \ul getting\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 If I do \ul not\ulnone  hear, I will be \ul very\ulnone  \ul uneasy\ulnone .\'a0 You ought to have attended to yourself \ul long ago\ulnone .\'a0 You have been so long threatened with sickness, you are too careless about you health when you know how important you are to your wife & children, sickness can often be kept off with a little care.\'a0 I had a headache day before yesterday.\'a0 I took a dose of Salts & Cream of Tartar, & it carried off my headache & did me good, & I feel now quite well.\'a0 If you had had the headache, I would have induced you to take medicine.\'a0 You would have left it to nature , & perhaps been \ul sick\ulnone  in \ul consequence\ulnone .\'a0 Do write me every Mail, & keep me informed of your health.\'a0 I will be very anxious to hear every night of your welfare.\'a0 Sunday I was able to write you but a line, but I knew \ul that\ulnone  \ul line\ulnone  would be a comfort to you, so wrote it.\'a0 Mr. Elford has not written very lately to his family as they are uneasy about him.\'a0 If you have heard anything of him, write me that I may tell Mrs. Elford.\'a0 I sent tonight to the Printing office to tell them you received no papers now, & beg them to send you one of all hereafter published.\'a0 They sent word they thought you were receiving them.\'a0 They often send me 4 Tri weeklys.\'a0 I would easily have sent you one every Mail.\'a0 I have kept \ul two\ulnone  of every paper.\'a0 I will send you the papers, whie you remain away, though I am thankful it will be only a few days now.\'a0 If the Legislature adjourns Tuesday, I will write you but once more.\'a0 You will get this letter Monday, & I will write on Sunday so you can hear Tuesday.\'a0 I hope & trust my next letter from you. will say you are \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 Do consult a Physician about your cold.\'a0 It ought to be cured at \ul once\ulnone .\'a0 You have trifled with it too long. This morning I went to see Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. Beattie, Mrs. Turpin, Mrs. Wm Roberts, Mrs. Crooks, & Mrs. Dr. Irvine, Mrs. Beattie was out, Mrs. Wm Roberts at Union, Mrs. Dr. Irvine sick, so I only saw her sister Miss McMahon.\'a0 This afternoon I went to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.\'a0 Yesterday I went to see Mrs. Dr. Williams.\'a0 Mrs. Brooks I was going to see, but met her in the road.\'a0 I went to see Mrs. Westfield.\'a0 So I am making now an effort to get through with my visits.\'a0 Everywhere I am greeted with a scold, for not having gone sooner. I met Mrs. Hopkins the Minister\'92s mother & Miss Hopkins the sister, at Mrs. Thompsons.\'a0 I have owed them a visit for years, & Mrs. Farr I also met there, & owe her a visit of long standing.\'a0 I like Mrs. Hopkins & her daughter much.\'a0 Miss Hopkins will make a good teacher for children.\'a0 Mr. Capers they say, lets the children play too much.\'a0 Mr. Gailliard is to have both boys & girls, which I disapprove of, so perhaps we had better send Anna to Mr. Hopkins.\'a0 It makes girls \ul bold\ulnone  to go to a school with boys.\'a0 I think they should be kept at a respectful distance from each other.\'a0 None of us now have colds.\'a0 We are all well, & if you only are well, I will be thankful.\'a0 Going out at night does not agree with you.\'a0 When you return you must not go out at night.\'a0 The papers must be brought to you here.\'a0 It is the night air perhaps that has kept up your cold. Mr. Wardell brought home the Sideboard today, done up beautifully, looks like new.\'a0 He was to ask $3.50 if I was not entirely pleased, 4 if I was, , so I gave him a Table to varnish, & said he must do that, & then I would give him 4, at least that \ul you \ulnone would give it, for I had not the money to give.\'a0 I had no idea I would need so much money when you left, , but the necessaries of a family amount to so much,\'a0 If the money spent was not put down, it would be impossible to believe that it was all gone. Mamma is very much pleased with Mrs. Pearsons servant.\'a0 She sent to ask Mr. Elford about her, before you left, but Mrs. Elford never sent an answer.\'a0 The servant was staying at Dr. Koch\'92s working for \ul nothing\ulnone .\'a0 When Mamma heard of her & took her at \ul once\ulnone , & strange to say, Mrs. Buice sent word today that \ul she\ulnone  had engaged her, Maria says \ul she\ulnone  never heard of it, & that she had looked all about for a place, & when she was at Dr. Koch\'92s so near Mrs. Buice, it is strange Mrs. Buice did not send for her.\'a0 I hope Mamma will be able to keep her.\'a0 Mrs. Williams says Dr. Koch beats his Wife & children, that the neighbors have to go in to prevent him.\'a0 Mrs. Turpin says he taught a young lady who staid there. & he begged her to pay in advance, which she did.\'a0 The whole 36 dollars she paid him.\'a0\'a0 He told me he taught Mrs. Turpin, but I expect it was a story.\'a0\'a0 He told me he\'85nothing at Dr. Turpins which surprised me.\'a0 Mrs. Turpin says, he wished Dr. Turpin to give him supper before anyone else, & that he was intoxicated. Anna says I must tell you, she is making a quilt for Hext, for his cradle, as a Christmas present.\'a0 How glad you will be to kiss little Hext again.\'a0 He eats bread & biscuits & sucks chicken bones & spareribs, & likes all these things better than nursing, except when he is sleepy. & at night, then nothing satisfies him but nursing. Miss Crittenden & Dr. Blackman are engaged I expect.\'a0 Anna told me she saw them pass yesterday locking arms, & she was looking up in his face & talking to him.\'a0 Genl Thompson is expected, but has not returned yet.\'a0 Mr. Jones I hear will keep the children, as I should suppose he would, for he has the best right to them.\'a0 Mrs. Genl Thompson is sick in bed.\'a0 Her sister is still with her.\'a0 One of Genl Thompsons fine horses, Willie says, he heard was dead.\'a0 Mr. Latta must be a kind old man.\'a0 Miss McMahan today, told me he was very kind.\'a0 Mrs. Latta she says passed through Greenville not long ago, on her way to Pendleton to see her son.\'a0 Mr. Latta has been married twice she says.\'a0 I wish the son had purchased here.\'a0 He would have been an acquisition.\'a0 Miss Lucy Brockman is engaged to Mr. Julius Earle.\'a0 Mrs. Young her sister, told Mrs. Henry Thompson so, & she is to be married soon.\'a0 The weather is now cooler, so I think there is no danger of the meat spoiling now.\'a0I long to see you, & when you get safe home, you can remain here for four months, & when you leave I will go with you.\'a0 I believe though, the Circuit commences again in the Spring.\'a0 Take care of yourself for my \ul sake\ulnone .\'a0 Your dear Wife, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a short letter from you.\'a0 I was in hopes to hear you were quite well, & am uneasy at your saying, your cold & feverish symptoms were not much better.\'a0 I hope Lee\'92s pills which you say you were to take again, will do you good.\'a0 I write tonight because tomorrow I go to church.\'a0 I may not have time.\'a0 I hope & trust this is my last letter to you for a long time.\'a0 If we had arranged it beforehand, I would have written a letter to you at Newberry Wednesday evening or wherever you will be that evening, but it is now too late for that.\'a0 I am glad your speech had effect & was listened to with attention.\'a0 I hope the exertion will not injure you.\'a0 Tomorrow you can have a quiet day, free from fatigue & excitement. I am glad you think you will gain your Rail Road cases.\'a0 Mrs. Elford was uneasy at not hearing from Mr. Elford, but tonight she has heard, & he is well.\'a0 At 9 oclock I will send to the Patriot office for the paper, & read your letters which give me great pleasure.\'a0 No one enjoys the Patriot more than I do.\'a0 Mr. N\'85 tonight sent me a Jury ticket to send to you, & get you to bring him up the money.\'a0 I enclose it in this letter, & hope you will receive it in time to get the money for him. This morning I went to see Mrs. Elford, Mrs. Harvey Cleveland, & Mrs. Col. Irvine.\'a0 The latter lady was out.\'a0 Mrs. Elford says Mrs. Bruce had engaged Mrs. Pearsons servant Maria, so Mamma will be obliged to give her up & hire Mrs. Town[e]s\'92 who has children. A great trial has been going on today in Mr. Stokes Office, of negroes for gambling.\'a0 Mr. Erwin Jones watchman Lem, Mr. Douglas man, Mr. Washington Green\'92s, Mr. McBee\'92s & others.\'a0 Some were found innocent, some whipped & dismissed, others sent to jail.\'a0 Mr. Elias Alexander had his man Adam tried, & it was said, if he was whipped Mr. Alexander would have gone \ul crazy\ulnone .\'a0 I believe he was cleared.\'a0 Cass with the wooden leg was also cleared.\'a0 Maj. Earle Mamma tells me is ill, perhaps near his end.\'a0 How he has destroyed himself. I rode in the Buggy this afternoon to see Mrs. Brooks & afterwards to Mamma\'92s, so I am visiting in earnest.\'a0 I long to get through, & be able to stay at home as much as I please.\'a0 I hope to finish almost before you return & then devote myself to you. Hext tomorrow is six months old.\'a0 He is now seated in Lindy\'92s lap by the fire.\'a0 I am writing upstairs in my chamber.\'a0 The children are all asleep.\'a0 Fanny has not progressed much in her book.\'a0 Anna gave her two almonds in advance to learn a lesson, which she has not learnt yet.\'a0 She would be a good little girl, if it were not for the teasing of the servants & children, which ruins her temper.\'a0 Anna has been busy making a quilt, so stays satisfied at home.\'a0 Willie has been hauling wood again today.\'a0 Frank knows all the hogs that have been killed, the negroes whipped &c.\'a0 It is worth leaving home to have the pleasure of returning to it as you will have.\'a0 You leave it often enough to value it.\'a0 I stay at it too much, to value it.\'a0 In future you will have to carry me to Columbia with you, then you will be satisfied.\'a0 Next winter the Rail Road will be so far advanced, the journey will be nothing. The weather tonight is quite cold.\'a0 The meat is safe.\'a0 Several persons killed today.\'a0 Mr. Foster has sent 3 loads of Corn, 8 barrels in each load, the servant says.\'a0 Mr. Brooks told me Mr. Furman would most likely be elected to the Baptist church as Preacher, & that he is a hot \ul Secessionist\ulnone .\'a0 Last summer, went about making stump speeches.\'a0 How weak minded ministers are. Mary has not brought the Patriot yet.\'a0 I will stop writing & go to bed, & finish tomorrow.\'a0 I slept very little last night.\'a0 Was kept awake thinking of you, so I am very sleepy now.\'a0 I hope tomorrow night to hear \ul better\ulnone  news.\

My dear husband, I have just done dinner, & will finish my letter to you.\'a0 I went to church this morning, all of us.\'a0 I took possession of Mr. Poinsetts pew, & like it very much.\'a0 It is more private than ours.\'a0 We will keep it until Mr. Poinsett comes up, but I rather expect he will \ul never\ulnone  come.\'a0 If he does, we will take some other vacant pew in church.\'a0 There are several unoccupied.\'a0 Mr. Arthur preached.\'a0 He did not go to Spartanburg as he expected.\'a0 A horse fell with him & lamed him which prevented him.\'a0 Mr. Cox read the prayers.\'a0 Mr. Arthur\'92s was extempore, & as poor a one, as I ever heard, tedious & laboured, & really teaches us one virtue \ul patience\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Westfield says Mr. Ioor has addressed several young ladies on the Grove, & they all refused him, but Miss Lewis with her little property, thinks him good enough for her.\'a0 Mamma says he looks quite sad.\'a0 He must know that his object in choosing such a lady is wid\'85.\'a0 She is very unloveable, with her one eye.\'a0 Mrs. Ioor has taken the house Mr. Walker the merchant has been living in, so we will have her for a neighbor.\'a0It was a house of Butler Thompson\'92s I believe that is\'85not Genl Thompsons.\'a0 Edward told Mamma a tale of Butler Thompson\'92s being thrown out of a Buggy, his horse killed & himself hurt, but I do not know how \ul true\ulnone  it is.\'a0 Reports are so false I am afraid to mention them.\'a0The weather today is very cold.\'a0 Do be \ul careful\ulnone  of yourself as you come home, wrap up warm, & do not \ul increase\ulnone  your cold.\'a0 I hope & pray you may be \ul well\ulnone  when I hear from you tonight.\'a0\'a0 I am miserable when I hear you are feverish.\'a0 If you are sick you must be at home, where every moment, I can know how you are. I do not know whether you will be here Wednesday or Thursday.\'a0 Mr. Goodlet says the Legislature adjourns Tuesday 12 oclock & that you will set off in the Cars the same day.\'a0 Be careful to get a \ul safe\ulnone  seat in the Cars, & take care of your pocket book.\'a0 What a strange law to pass for a man when in debt to have so much of his own property secured to him.\'a0 Business will have to be stopped for no one will give him credit. This afternoon Willie is to drive us out in the carri[a]ge.\'a0 There is no service at church.\'a0 It is so cold I can hardly write.\'a0 My hands are cold.\'a0 I have not time to read over my letter,\'a0 Your must excusae mistakes.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Willie wrote to you last night, & I cannot seal up his letter, without adding a few lines.\'a0 I always have so much to say.\'a0 Anna is very much pleased at your praises.\'a0 Frank is anxious to write to you, but does not yet write legibly.\'a0 Fanny is very busy & industrious & often asks if she is not the best.\'a0 Hext is well & sweet, & will be very much pleased with his Indian Shoes.\'a0 He wears Shoes & Stockings now, , & the Indian Shoes if he does not wear much, he can keep in remembrance of you.\'a0\'a0 You must be \ul sure\ulnone  & buy me another pr to give to Susans baby, & the \ul two\ulnone  \ul pocket\ulnone  \ul books\ulnone .\'a0 These are all I wish you to bring me.\'a0 For the children anything you bring will please them.\'a0 Toys & candy is so dear in Columbia, you cannot bring much of either.\'a0It seems to me the State is getting in a more dangerous position than ever, for after the people have declared against Secession, the leaders are determined to go on with their designs.\'a0 The Patriot has yet an \ul important \ulnone part to act.\'a0 The danger is not over, as Judge O\'92Neal[l] said.\'a0 You have still to open the eyes of the people, & save them from disgrace & ruin.\'a0 What a pity we cannot have peace like the other States.\'a0 I am sure we would not know we were ill treated & dishonoured, if the Politiciasns did not tell us so.\'a0 Well after they have Seceded, I hope they will be satisfied.\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  will do your \ul duty\ulnone , & that is \ul all\ulnone  you \ul can do\ulnone .\'a0 But what is most provoking is that \ul all\ulnone  will be taxed, even those who are opposed to contemplated action, so I hope you will try & exempt those who are \ul opposed\ulnone , from taxation.\'a0 They should not bear the burden.\'a0 Even Mamma, whose income is only sufficient for her necessary expenses.\'a0 Mr. Barnwell, Mr. Rhett, & such should hear it. I hope to hear tonight from you, & to see the Patriot.\'a0 It is the only paper I have seen since you left. I am sorry you did not dine with Professor Brumby.\'a0 Whether busy or not you ought to have gone. The weather is charming today.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 I have now a particle of news to tell you.\'a0 I have been out but once to Mamma\'92s, & owe everybody a visit, so nobody comes to see me.\'a0 I am very busy seeing for the children. If you saw a suitable present for Mamma, I would love you to bring it.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.\'a0 Soon after receiving it, I set off & came to Mamma\'92s, where I am spending the day but fearing you may be disappointed if you do not hear from me.\'a0 I have begged writing materials of Mamma.\'a0 I wrote a note to Mr. Elford, requesting him to send you the Patriot tonight, as I will return home too late to send it.\'a0 I hope he will not forget it. I hope Mr. Dyson will offer you a fee large enough to induce you to go to Newberry.\'a0 I would like very much for you to return with your pocket book filled with 100 dollar bills.\'a0 You might go to Newberry, attend to the case, & return here the middle of the week, & be in time to receive business here.\'a0 I could have your Office opened, so that everyone that went in, would come down to the house, & I would tell them to keep their business until you returned, that you would be here the end of the week.\'a0 I am glad Mr. Jones is somewhat humbled, though I am afraid, it is not really so.\'a0 I am delighted at what has occurred, as now you will never let him be on the footing he was before.\'a0 You will never again condescend\'a0 to speak to him.\'a0 Have you heard that Mrs. Eliza Dawkins is married to Mr. Poole of Spartanburg a clerk in a store there.\'a0 He was \ul 20\ulnone  the night he was married & she is about 40 I suppose.\'a0 Mrs. Choice I hear was very angry when she heard of it.\'a0 I suppose the family objected, as I believe none were at the wedding. You will be surprised to hear that Fanny commenced going to school yesterday afternoon.\'a0 In the morning Vardry & Annie went, & Fanny felt that she was debarred of a \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone  & fretted so, that I let her go in the afternoon, & she came home perfectly delighted, & has gone today.\'a0 I am glad for her to be kept from servants, for often she was seated on the ground playing with John & behaving & speaking badly.\'a0 This morning she dressed with pleasure at the thought of going to school, & took up her bucket & walked about the house delighted, her sweet face glowing with pleasure.\'a0 Hext is well & crawls over the floor.\'a0 All are well.\'a0Reuben & Charles are ploughing Oats.\'a0 No one has been to see you, that I know of.\'a0 Gov. Cobb\'92s Secretary wrote a letter last night saying he had received neither receipt for the money he sent, or the Patriot either, & begging you to inquire into the matter, & to acknowledge his letter & send the Patriot regularly.\'a0 I sent the letter to Mr. Elford.\'a0\'a0 Write again to me, & I hope that you will write that Mr. Dyson offered you the large fee you said you would accept.\'a0 Attend to the case the beginning of the weeks.\'a0 They can try it Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday at least.\'a0 Return quickly in the Stage & attend to your business here also.\'a0 I will make Willie sit in the office if you wish it. I must now stop.\'a0 If you do not get a Patriot, borrow one, & feast on it.\'a0 Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P. P.S. Mr. Carson talks of carrying all his family to California, but I expect it will all end in toil\'85.\'a0 A Pension for Mrs. Paris has come & an Eclectic. [page torn]\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mr. Elford does not go until Monday but for fear tomorrow I may not have time to write, I will tonight write as much as I can. I will begin by telling you the news that Lindy this morning after breakfast was taken sick, & after dinner gave birth to an infant a girl.\'a0 She suffered I expect a great deal, but I am glad the event is safely over, & hope she & her child will do well.\'a0 It is a good\'85baby.\'a0 Fanny wishes upon having it as her maid instead of Sarah.\'a0 I think we will name it Caroline or Emily after one of Lindy\'92s sisters.\'a0 I sent first for Mom Phillis, & Mom Phillis afterwards begged me to send for Dr. Crooks so he was with her. I received your letter this afternoon by Mr. B\'85.\'a0 I sent your Editorial to the Printing office.\'a0\'a0 I am very sorry you fixed upon this time to have the sale at Tugaloo, instead of coming home.\'a0 I told you it was unwise.\'a0 A Mr. Cunningham came today to see you.\'a0 He thought a case had been brought against him which he wished you to defend, but looking at the records, thinks the case has \ul not\ulnone  been brought. You have heard I suppose of the death of Mrs. Washington Earle.\'a0 She was sick only 2 or 3 days I believe with Cholic & I heard was speechless.\'a0 These are all [the] particulars I know. Mamma Ann Susan & the children [page torn]were with me.\'a0 Lucinda is sick\'85& the servant Mamma hires from Dr. Williams is sick.\'a0 My family are all well.\'a0 Fanny still goes to school.\'a0 She knows all her letters, says she is the smartest girl in school.\'a0 Anna & Willie took tea at Mrs. Hopkins last night & enjoyed themselves so much, they staid until after 11.\'a0 Frank went to the Court House to hear a blind girl play on the piano & sing.\'a0 He had no invitation to the party. Mamma Susan & myself called to see Mrs. Hoyt the other day, on account of her coming from Charleston, & knowing Aunt Hayne\'92s well.\'a0 She calls Mr. Hoyt & herself & the \ul young\ulnone  couple.\'a0 They stay at Mr. Randolph\'92s. I hear Mr. Tom Lowndes & family are not coming up next summer.\'a0 They are going to \ul France\ulnone .\'a0 Dr. Dickson it is said wishes to purchase again in Greenville \ul near\ulnone  the village or \ul in\ulnone  the village. Mr. Carson has postponed his trip to California for some months.\'a0 He cannot get a passage I believe.\'a0 Old Mrs. McBee says she does not know where he will get the money from to carry them.\'a0 I hear Chandler has returned.\'a0 Got as far as the isthmus where he found too many \ul waiting\ulnone  to get across. I am glad to hear of your professional good luck in these hard times.\'a0 A large fee is very acceptable.\'a0 I heard Mr. Wynn was going to bring suit for his daughter, so when you mentioned you\'a0 were employed I felt glad, but that feeling has passed away, & I wish it were on the \ul other\ulnone  side you were employed.\'a0 I have no patience with a bold impudent girl encouraging a young man, or at any rate yielding to his wishes, & then [page torn] round & seeing him for what she is as much to blame [page torn] girl would never be in the situation of Miss Wynn.\'a0 Her father may be good, but I expect she inherits \ul badness\ulnone  from her mother.\'a0 The whole family I believe are a worthless set.\'a0 Kelly while at Mamma\'92s spoke of this same Miss Wynn & said her \ul husband\ulnone  a \ul Mulatto\ulnone  man had connexion with her, & her master had a daughter who lived with a man without marrying, had a child & the man afterwards left her & she herself she said had children by her master & her masters son.\'a0 Someone told Mamma at the time that the servants & overseers are all alike.\'a0 I expect Miss Wynns character will be proved to be so bad (for so many were named as the father of her child) that you will \ul lose\ulnone  the case.\'a0 So if you bring such a case, so \ul demoralizing\ulnone \'a0 to the community, & one that makes you so \ul many\ulnone  \ul enemies\ulnone , you need to make up\'a0 for all you will suffer, secure to yourself a \ul large\ulnone  \ul fee\ulnone , whether you [word botted] or \ul not\ulnone , 1000 dollars if you lose, 2000 if you gain.\'a0 I think you laid the damages \ul too\ulnone  \ul high\ulnone .\'a0 She is not worth paying \ul one\ulnone  \ul cent\ulnone  to get rid of.\'a0 Make Mr. Wynn beforehand give his note.\'a0 I hope you will gain Mrs. \'85 case & get well paid by Mr. Brown.\'a0\'a0 Now you are an old Lawyer & of some reputation\'a0 you ought to charge high fees where you have rich clients.\'a0 Write me about Miss Wynns case whether it is for breach of marriage promise you are suing? Or what? & whether it is to be tried this Court?\'a0 Mr. Barnwell Rhett has sent you Espy\'92s report on Meteorology, the Smithsonian report & Patent office reports on Agriculture.\'a0 No letters have come.\'a0 You have two of Espy just alike.\'a0\'a0\'a0 You can give one away. Have you heard Mr. Jones is a candidate for Con[gress].\'a0 I hardly like to make him of so [page torn] to mention it, but wish to know \ul your\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  as to whether \ul he\ulnone  \ul will\ulnone  be elected.\'a0 I am sure I hope not, do not you think perhaps he may, those opposed to Mr. Orr & not knowing what a contemptible character Mr. Jones is, may take him up.\'a0 This does not look as if he was \ul humbled\ulnone  by \ul your\ulnone  \ul exposure\ulnone  of him, or his \ul bankruptcy\ulnone ; but as if he would show to the world at least, that he thought \ul more\ulnone  of \ul himself\ulnone  than ever.\'a0 Write me your opinion on the subject, what you think his motives are in offering, if he really thinks he will be elected or thinks it will give him importance even if defeated.\'a0 Mr. Luther says at Mrs. Earles funeral he was figuring about, giving himself \ul great\ulnone  a[page torn] \ul not\ulnone  looking like a \ul broken\ulnone  \ul man\ulnone .\'a0 Tomorrow we will go to church for the last time in the building we have been going to for so many years.\'a0 It is to be pulled down & Mr. Arthur will preach in the Academy or McBee\'92s Hall.\'a0 I am sure he is not worth building a new church for.\'a0 I am sorry you have to give one cent for a person who I do not even regard as your friend. Susan says Mr. Campbell & Ioor are going to Florida to speculate in lands, \ul not\ulnone  to \ul live\ulnone .\'a0 I wish they were going there to \ul live\ulnone .  If I have anything new to write you tomorrow I will write again.\'a0 The children are all asleep, & I will now follow their example.\'a0 [page torn] I expect is coming on well.\'a0 Reuben & Charles [page torn] [E.F.P.]\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Except to let you know we are well my letters can afford you very little interest, for I have nothing to write you about.\'a0 Today the Convention meets.\'a0 I hope you will have a pleasant time, that no unpleasant excitement or difficulty of any kind will occur.\'a0 Write me how long you will remain in Columbia, for I have a box in Charleston which I will wish sent to you, if it is ready in time.\'a0 I do not wish it sent after you leave, so as soon as you can ascertain let me know. Tell Willie I am glad he is with you, & hope he will return improved, & behave like a gentleman & set a good example to his brothers & sisters & not quarrel with them Yesterday was a fine day; today it is cloudy & looks like rain. I get along pleasantly in my household now cleaning is away, & it is a satisfaction as each week passes away to know that a few dollars have been added to your little income, & that the increase has been added without our denying ourselves, so it is a clean gain.\'a0 I do not think you will ever know what I suffered while under Minervas dominion.\'a0 If ever I wish[ed] you punished I will wish you in that situation.\'a0 Frank has just come from the Office & brought a pardon from the Governor for Mr. Nash for as much as relates to the imprisonment.\'a0 I have sent him to the Goal with Mr. Beaufort Watts letter, & will send the Pardon to Mr. McDaniel or Mr. Hoke.\'a0 Mr. Nash has just sent to know if he can come [word faded] of Goal just as soon as he wants to, & I have sent word just as soon as I have sent him the pardon.\'a0 I suppose he will go immediately to his family & surprise them. A letter came from Mr. Willis Brown asking your influence in electing him Treasurer of the Upper Division.\'a0 He says he is encouraged to ask your aid on account of your friendship for his deceased brother John G. Brown, together with himself, that it is only necessity\'a0 [that] induces him to apply for the Office.\'a0 The letter is dated Spring Grove, Laurens.\'a0 Says in his old age he is left with a helpless family to provide for, & except the assistance he receives from his son M.L. Brown of Columbia, they are dependant upon his individual exertions.\'a0 He writes early, before other applications are made to you.\'a0 A letter came desiring the Patriot to be sent to a different Post office.\'a0 I will send it to Mr. Elford.\'a0 The Metropolitan the newspaper sent to me came.\'a0 This is all. It is now raining.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 When I hear from you I will have more to write about. Mr. McDaniel has just come & taken the pardon so you see since I commenced writing a good deal has taken place. I hope to hear tomorrow this time from you.\'a0 Give my love to Willie.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter a few hours ago & for fear of being prevented answering if I postpone to later in the day, will answer it now.\'a0 I was very glad to hear from you, to know you had arrived safely, & met with no disagreeable incident.\'a0 The Patriot I am gratified to hear is noticed, & its Editorials made of importance.\'a0 If I were a member of the Convention, I would propose the State should \ul leave\ulnone  the Union, & remain out of the Union \ul forever\ulnone , the Secessionists remain in her, & henceforth remain devoted to \ul her\ulnone , & \ul her\ulnone  \ul only\ulnone .\'a0 The Union men remove to some other State where they can have \ul peace\ulnone  & quiet, their principle be appreciated, & themselves have an equal share of honors & office with their fellow citizens.\'a0 South Carolina will be no \ul loss\ulnone  to the Union, but a \ul good\ulnone  \ul riddance\ulnone , & she & her \ul selfish\ulnone  & \ul vainglorious\ulnone  sons.\'a0 The Union can go on prosperously without her, & she has abused it so long, it is time now she should leave it.\'a0 I am glad Willie is satisfied & hope he is enjoying himself.\'a0 Tell him though he will not be here May day to participate in its pleasures.\'a0 He will be represented by his \ul second\ulnone  \ul self\ulnone  \ul Hocky\ulnone .\'a0 Frank Hoke has asked Frank to let Rudd have Hocky to ride on May day, as he is one of the \ul Marshall[s]\ulnone , & I have given my consent, that if he is \ul alive\ulnone  then, for being now under the \ul sole\ulnone  \ul care\ulnone  of \ul Reuben\ulnone  the \ul Horse\ulnone  \ul killer\ulnone , I am under daily apprehension of some morning hearing the news, \'93Hocky is in the stable lying down & cannot get up.\'94\'a0 Reuben has a mysterious way of getting rid of all our horses.\'a0 Charles says he killed 7 pair of Mrs. Harrisons.\'a0 So I am forgetting next Spring, new carri[a]ge, new horses, a new Coachman , all at the same time. Yesterday I wrote you word that we were all well.\'a0 A few hours later, I would have written, there are \ul three\ulnone  of your family sick, for at night Mary came from the Spring complaining of pain in her \ul chest\ulnone , Charlotte pain in her \ul stomach\ulnone , & this morning Minerva came from the Mansion house with pain in her \ul head\ulnone .\'a0 Charlotte I gave a dose of oil to, & she is now well.\'a0 Mary is so useful, I dread her being sick, & for fear of Pneumonia which is so fatal, I sent her at once to Dr. Dean\'92s & he gave her some pills, & said he thought the pain proceeded from her liver.\'a0 This morning I gave her Castor oil, & when the medicine has effect she will I think be better.\'a0 She is at her work, says the\'a0 pain is not as bad as it was.\'a0 Her habits being so irregular, & she so careless about herself, I expect is what makes her so often unwell.\'a0 Minerva had taken medicine from Mrs. Irwin before she came over, & is now in her room.\'a0 I am sorry whenever I see her come in the yard.\'a0 I never intend to have her as my servant again, if I can help it.\'a0 I went in to see her & found her the same \ul impudent\ulnone  \ul creature\ulnone  still.\'a0 I left her room in \ul thankfulness\ulnone  that she was sewing \ul others\ulnone  & not \ul myself\ulnone .\'a0 Your wife & children are at any rate well, & I hope will continue so.\'a0 Frank commences school tomorrow. Mr. Ward came yesterday to see you.\'a0 Mr. Hoke came over Saturday morning, thought you were not to leave until Saturday night.\'a0 He had Mrs. Blassingame\'92s marriage settlement, which had been sent him from Columbia, & he did not know what to do with it.\'a0 This morning your letter, the Lady\'92s book, & the Southern Review were all that came from the Post office.\'a0 I wish at Newberry you had seen \ul Mr. Williams\ulnone , & he had performed his promise.\'a0 Be economical, recollect this time next Spring, I will be with you on my way to Charleston, to buy new Carri[a]ge, & many necessaries we need, & you must save now for that purpose, & some summer before I get old, I do wish to go to New Haven, & look once again at places I will never forget.\'a0 If I were rich, I would wish for us all to go & end our days there.\'a0 I have no love for Carolina, where you will never meet with your reward.\'a0 You labour you save the State, others know it in their hearts, & are ever glad of it, but they give you publicly no credit for, & as for \ul honoring\ulnone  you with Office & Distinction, they never \ul dream\ulnone  of it, but to the end of your days, will heap abuse on you, & stigmatize you as a Submissionist, a \ul term\ulnone  that at once \ul excludes\ulnone  you from \ul honor\ulnone , & this is their \ul object\ulnone  in \ul applying \ulnone \'a0it.\'a0 They are thankful to you for \ul being\ulnone  a \ul Submissionist\ulnone , & yet try to \ul disgrace\ulnone  you\'a0 by the Epithet. You must not forget to see old Mr. Hearn.\'a0 Dr. Irvine must indeed have been anxious to be elected as he had determined to go to Columbia.\'a0 He would like to have been honored as a Delegate, & had his expenses paid.\'a0 I suppose he will expect great attention from the Governor, in return for his hospitality, selfish hospitality truly.\'a0 Hext looks well, & I believe does not miss you at all, & yet will be delighted to see you.\'a0 If it were not for him I would have been in Columbia with you,\'a0 Old Mr. Miller was here this morning, inquired about the Convention that the Leaders who boasted of \ul State\ulnone  \ul Right\ulnone  were \ul State\ulnone  \ul Wrong\ulnone , that Mr. Hunter had not gone to the Convention when now was the time for him to benefit the people.\'a0 He was electioneering for Clerk, & he hoped he would be beaten.\'a0 He mentioned your\'85about Genl Wallace.\'a0 He is a sensible old man.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just read your letter to Anna.\'a0 She is at school, & will be pleased when she comes home to hear from you.\'a0 I write only because later in the day, I am generally interrupted. I am glad to tell you that the \ul blacks\ulnone  portion of your household are almost well.\'a0 Minerva yesterday after dinner, returned to the Mansion House where I hope she will remain.\'a0 Charlotte recovered entirely of her pain.\'a0 Mary while I was writing I believe stopped ironing. & lay down, & looked so stupid\'85& complained of the pain in her chest. & the medicine not acting much, I sent for Dr. Crooks.\'a0 He was at Laurens so I sent for Dr. Dean, & he said the pain proceeded from improper eating, that it was not Pneumonia, & he gave her Blue pills, prescribed Mustard plaster & Sage tea, & this morning she is up, & says she feels well.\'a0 I always like Dr. Deans prescriptions.\'a0 He says he would rather treat any disease than Pneumonia, that the lungs are effected (or affected) a vital part, & before you are aware the Patient is in danger, he dies. This morning Frank while dressing came into the room crying, with his face swollen, & said his cheeks being\'85, I expect he has the Measles which are all about.\'a0 So I have not sent him to school, but he is playing now, & seems in no pain.\'a0 He was afraid at first, they would kill him.\'a0 If the children will only wait & take them after May day I will not be sorry, as it is as well to have them now, as any other time, but I have fitted them in clothes for May day, so do not wish to lose my trouble.\'a0 Frank I expect will be well by then, so I am not troubled on that account.\'a0 He is grieving over the loss of his \ul last\ulnone  \ul pigeon\ulnone  which Charlotte with delight told him Minervas cat had eaten. Fanny complained of costiveness last Saturday, & I gave her a dose of Oil & last night again, & I gave her Rhubarb.\'a0 I am afraid at school she does not go out as often as she wishes, which will be very bad for her, so I dare say I will keep her at home, if she complains often in this way; otherwise she is well.\'a0 I have kept her at home today. Hext is quite well & steps about holding to something.\'a0 He crawled upstairs yesterday.\'a0 I followed after him.\'a0 He had a flower he wished to put in his mouth, & was going upstairs where I would not see him, & when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the flower, a fit emblem of what comes often in life.\'a0 I believe I have no news at all to tell you.\'a0 Except to church I have not been out.\'a0 Mrs. Col. Irvine & Susan Hoke are the only persons who have been to see me.\'a0 I owe almost everyone visits, so I expect few visitors until I visit myself.\'a0 I am glad everything in the Convention goes on well, that the Members are cordial to you, & you are passing your time agreeably.\'a0 If you are enjoying yourself & treated with the respect you deserve, it is all I wish, I am happy.\'a0 I would be willing to be shut up in the Penitentiary you wish to build, if at the same time, you were receiving some deserts from your fellow men; but what makes me unhappy, is, that \ul you\ulnone  should be \ul unrewarded\ulnone , & \ul others \ulnone so far your inferiors, in merit & ability should receive the prize you have won.\'a0 My. Orr so much your inferior in every respect, beat you for Congress & so it will be to the end of your life.\'a0 I must see you rewarded with some high Office or Honour before I leave this world.\'a0 I am thankful however for my many blessings, & first of all for my \ul dear\ulnone  \ul kind\ulnone  \ul husband\ulnone .\'a0 You have not mentioned Judge O\'92Neal[l] & your Daguerreotype.\'a0 How is your life & likeness progressing.\'a0 I hope you will have a \ul good\ulnone  \ul Daguerreotype\ulnone  taken\'a0 to transmit your intellectual features to posterity & that Judge O\'92Neal[l] will do your \ul character\ulnone  justice & write with more \ul warmth\ulnone  & \ul spirit\ulnone  than you did of yourself & as regards one incident of your life, explains it in such a way as to \ul exonerate\ulnone  you from \ul blame\ulnone , more than \ul you\ulnone  did \ul yourself\ulnone . From what you say yourself & the Greenville Delegates except old Mr. McBee must be rooming together.\'a0 Is it so.\'a0 Mr. C\'85 ought not to be unwell.\'a0 I suppose the life he now leads is so new to him, it does not agree with him.The poem you mention ought not to class you with Mr. Memminger Butler Orr & such who are influenced only by personal feelings, to keep themselves in power & gain Office & honor.\'a0 You stand apart, one the only one of prominence, who have acted from \ul disinterested\ulnone  \ul motives\ulnone .\'a0 You lose everything, gain nothing, & have the independence to be stigmatized as a Submissionist, which deprives you of all hope of advancement & which str\'85 prevents the others coming out as Union men.\'a0 I do hope though such nobleness will be rewarded.\'a0I saw Genl Thompson\'92s carri[a]ge pass out of the village this morning, I suppose going to bring up himself & family.\'a0 I am sorry, wish he would always remain away, particularly now he courts you, & you are so foolish as to unite your prospects with his.\'a0 No one likes him, & it is his going over to your side that caused all the excitement at the Memminger meeting, & your predicted downfall.\'a0 He will never be of any good to you.\'a0 In his\'85he would not advance you if he could. I am glad Willie is enjoying himself.\'a0 It is a great pleasure to hear from you, but if you are too busy to write, let Willie write one line, to say you are \ul well\ulnone .\'a0 Truly, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter, & am very glad to hear from you.\'a0 I will write at once, because Susan is coming in to try on a dress Eliza is making, & she may stay the remainder of the day.\'a0 At any rate something will occur to interrupt me.\'a0 I believe as I read the other day in a newspaper, that \ul one\ulnone  \ul hour\ulnone  in the \ul morning\ulnone  is worth \ul two\ulnone  in the \ul afternoon\ulnone  & whatever I wish done well, I do in the morning, when I feel most capable of exertion.\'a0 I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly, & Willie is behaving well.\'a0 I hope your dinner at Col. Williams will end with the \ul fee\ulnone  being \ul paid\ulnone  you. but as he is not \ul obliged\ulnone  to pay, \ul I\ulnone  know he \ul will\ulnone  \ul not\ulnone , \ul you\ulnone  say he \ul will\ulnone , if he does, I will give you credit, for a better judgment than \ul I\ulnone  have. As for my relations, no neglect from them surprises me.\'a0 Mr. Taylor has never asked you to his house, since you have been going to Columbia, & if he were ever to ask you, I hope you would not accept the invitation.\'a0 I know when I go to Columbia, \ul I\ulnone  will not enter his house, & I would like you to go to Columbia, if it were only for the purpose of refusing any attention from Mrs. Taylor to show her my feelings.\'a0 It was giving vent to my true feelings that made me write so literally to Aunt Eliza, & she either deceitfully, or certainly knowing very little of the matter said \ul everyone\ulnone  connected with \ul her\ulnone , had always without any exception entertained the \ul kindest\ulnone  feelings to \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 She could with truth have said \ul exactly\ulnone  the \ul reverse\ulnone ,\'a0 I have learnt to expect nothing but \ul unkindness\ulnone  from my relations, & unkindness from those who you ought to receive kindness from, can neither be \ul forgiven\ulnone  or \ul forgotten\ulnone , & make your feelings more bitter, than towards strangers who you have no claim on.\'a0 In a political view my relations have always, before you entered the family I suppose & will always dislike you, for they being contracted & selfish in their views, of course will be on an opposite side from you & they look upon you as the chief cause of preventing Harmony in the State, the one who has opened the eyes of the people, & prevented them from carrying out their selfish views, prevented their aggrandizing themselves on the peoples ruin.\'a0 Of course you will be the object of dislike to such persons.\'a0 Mrs. Taylor never paid Willie any attention in Columbia, & then deceitfully turned the tables on \ul me\ulnone , & told Mrs. Thomas she was very much \ul hurt\ulnone  that \ul I \ulnone had not sent Willie immediately to her house to \ul stay\ulnone , that it was what \ul she\ulnone  would have done if \ul her\ulnone  \ul son\ulnone  had come to Greenville; but enough of them we are not dependent on them.\'a0 Your friends are certainly a distinct set from\'85.\'a0 Mr. Pettigru, Judge Huger &c.\'a0 They have not heretofore assimilated with.\'a0 I am delighted to hear of the\'85as regards your being United States Senator.\'a0 I will live on that \ul hope\ulnone , & will be\ul  satisfied\ulnone , when \ul that\ulnone  is realized. Frank when I told him of your pleasure at Hext\'92s improvement asked what you said about \ul him\ulnone . He has the Mumps.\'a0 Dr. Dean looked at his face this morning, but said nothing need be done for it.\'a0 He must not run in the yard when it was cold.\'a0 Fanny is well.\'a0 Mary looks ailing, but goes about.\'a0 Dr. Dean said she must take Blue pills again tonight.\'a0 She still has the pain in her chest, which shows disordered stomach.\'a0 The rest of the household are well, & I do assure you I keep house delightfully with my former illtempered cook away.\'a0 Lindy makes good bread, rolls, tea, cake, & above all she does whatever I tell her.\'a0 Whoever will give 1000 dollars for Minerva may have her.\'a0 Bad temper does not lessen her value to those who have the power (which I never had) of\ul  \ulnone governing her & she is as capable a servant as ever was.\'a0I am glad you are honoured in the Convention.\'a0 You I hoped would be one of the Committee.\'a0 I am afraid you will not remain in Columbia long enough to receive my box.\'a0 You must have my \ul thimble\ulnone  \ul mended\ulnone \'a0 & \ul after\ulnone  the Convention attend to your \ul tooth\ulnone .\'a0 Yesterday a letter from Mr. Verner came, one from Mr. Cochran about his Law case against Charles, one from Mr. Sawyer of Asheville about a suit he wished you to bring for some land near Union left to a family named F\'85, but who have never had it in possession.\'a0 He wishes the suit brought if you think they can gain it.\'a0 The land is worth 10,000 & you would get he says a good fee if recovered.\'a0 You would have to use the very \ul opposite\ulnone  \ul arguments\ulnone  you used for the Paris\'92s. Susan is now here, & I am writing while talking to her.\'a0 The children all have holiday until Tuesday.\'a0 Now to prepare for May day, & Monday to clean up.\'a0 I will be glad to hear from Willie.\'a0 I will write an account of May day, & how Hochy performs his part.\'a0 I have not a particle of news to tell you.\'a0 Charles & Reuben go every day to the Farm, & I hope are doing well.\'a0 In the morning Charles hoes in the garden. Though I expect no attention from our family, I am still glad that Isaac Hayne & yourself are friendly, & in the first instance he wrote you an apologetic letter, & what vexed him was that he had done it, & we did not accept it, so I think he at first was disposed to conciliate.\'a0 Mr. Perroneau I hardly know.\'a0 Politics now makes him treat you coldly, for he used to call on you in town & seemed to like you. Always write the \ul hour\ulnone  in which you are writing.\'a0 Then I can understand better at what time all you write about occurs.\'a0 The Duncans being with Willie must make him enjoy himself more than if he was alone.\'a0 Let him do as he pleases about returning with them.\'a0 I read your Editorials in the Patriot.\'a0 Dr. M\'85 I thought [word faded] Senator from Newberry, you said he had never before represented the people.\'a0 I am sorry your feet hurt you.\'a0 You must have your \ul likeness\ulnone  taken, & send me the doggerel poem.

Dear Willie\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter & your Papa\'92s last night, & this time will write to you.\'a0 I am sorry you did not write a longer letter, but thank you for the short one.\'a0 Your Papa is so busy I make allowance for his short letters. Mary is still sick.\'a0 As she did not get better I sent for Dr. Crooks , who I always feel has a right to be our Physician & who was out, when I first sent, which made me send for Dr. Dean.\'a0 He is now prescribing for Mary, & she says she feels better today.\'a0 Mary being sick, & Minerva hired out, & Lindy taken up with her baby, has made us all depend on ourselves for fixing the house almost entirely.\'a0 I am glad to tell you Anna has excited herself, & with Charlottes help, has fixed the \ul whole\ulnone  \ul house\ulnone  \ul already\ulnone , & now gone up to the Academy to help dress it with flowers.\'a0 Lindy has to finish ironing, & Charlotte has gone to the Spring to wash, & Sarah is minding Hext.\'a0 John has gone to Mama\'92s to carry some chickens to Susan, to bring in two Chairs to send to the Academy to dress with flowers for Fanny & Anna to sit in at Flora\'92s.\'a0 A Ham that was boiled yesterday will serve us for dinner, so you see even when in a straight like the present, if the children perform their duty we can get along.\'a0 The House cleaning has not commenced yet.\'a0 John Smith was engaged this week & cannot come to Whitewash until Monday, so we will have very little time to clean up before you return.\'a0 It will have to go on slowly, even after you come back. Frank still has the Mumps, & is very much afraid he will not be able to march tomorrow.\'a0 He plays about as usual, & this morning when I told him he must not go out, he cried & said he promised to meet Alex Hunter at some corner of the street, & he must go.\'a0 He has escaped & gone.\'a0 This morning Dr. Crooks was examining his cheeks, & Frank resisted, & Dr. Crooks said, \'93you must not do so, don\'92t you know when your Papa is gone, I am a kind of papa to you all.\'94\'a0 Frank says if he does not participate in the May day pleasures, he may get back his 15 cts.\'a0 If you were here, after all you might have had the Mumps, & been obliged to stay at home, for you would have been for \ul concealing\ulnone  your swollen cheeks, not \ul displaying\ulnone  them like Frank.I have not had a glimpse of Hochy since you left, but I make frequent inquiries after him, & give cautions concerning his good treatment.\'a0 I hope tomorrow he will behave himself well.\'a0 My interest will be divided between Hochy & the Flora\'92s.\'a0 Next year you can ride on him as a Marshall. Hext looks well.\'a0 He does not walk yet alone, but walks about with very little assistance.\'a0 He gets more interesting every day.\'a0 This morning I taught him how to kiss.\'a0 There came from the Mail this morning a long communication from Asheville, contradicting the assertion Mr. Wh\'85 made in his Temperance lecture about the Scripture use of wine, that in some parts of the Bible it was \ul unfermented\ulnone  Wine, in others fermented.\'a0 It proved from the original Hebrew, that \ul Wine\ulnone  is \ul always\ulnone  \ul fermented\ulnone , that there is no such thing as \ul unfermented\ulnone  Wine, & where it is \ul denounced\ulnone , it is the immoderate use of it.\'a0 He says \ul temperance\ulnone  is a \ul Christian\ulnone  \ul virtue\ulnone , which can never be \ul too\ulnone  sedulously inculcated, but the lame attempt to wrest the scriptures will injure not benefit the cause.\'a0 He says he admires St. Paul who \ul voluntarily\ulnone  would abstain from anything on his brothers account, but when it was sought to ensnare his conscience, & to tamper with his Christian liberty & discretion on \ul false\ulnone  \ul grounds\ulnone , he would submit, \ul no\ulnone , not for an hour.\'a0 This is my opinion, I will not take wine, on account of my childrens sake, I will \ul voluntarily\ulnone  abstain from it, that \ul they\ulnone  may follow my example.\'a0 I will follow the dictates of my \ul conscience\ulnone , which is more noble, than promising a few individuals, who in all probability you care not for, & whose opinion you do not respect, promise \ul them\ulnone  not to do \ul wrong\ulnone .\'a0 I do not desire you should ever drink a drop of wine, & particularly until you are of your Papas age, & there is no danger of your indulging too freely.\'a0 I wish you to follow your Papas example & be actuated by a good conscience, & a sense of \ul morality\ulnone , \ul virtue\ulnone  & \ul religion\ulnone .\'a0 These must govern you.\'a0 These are \ul noble\ulnone  motives, & I have confidence in you, that your character is one to be influenced by such motives, & not by the far less noble of one. Of a promise to a few boys trifling ones for the most part, but I have said more than I intended & will tell you of something amusing.\'a0 Last Sunday at the Hall, I forgot to carry my prayer book so when I went in church, I took \ul Annas\ulnone  from her.\'a0 While the Prayers were being read, Willie Earle who was in \ul front\ulnone  of Anna, took the opportunity \ul very\ulnone  \ul slyly\ulnone  as he thought, to hand Anna \ul his\ulnone  Prayer book, which she had the \ul ill\ulnone  \ul manners\ulnone  to \ul refuse\ulnone .\'a0 A short time after, she removed her seat to \ul another\ulnone  desk.\'a0 I noticed Anna moved her [word faded] & wondered why, & noticed that Willie Earle looked rather vexed.\'a0 I had not seen the offer of the prayer book.\'a0 Susan saw it & told me afterwards.\'a0 Is it not amusing to see a little girl, \ul vexed\ulnone  at attentions, that in a few years \ul later\ulnone , she will \ul covet\ulnone , & displaying \ul rudeness\ulnone , which before long, she will be \ul surprised \ulnone at.\'a0 I mention this little incident to \ul amuse\ulnone  you.\'a0 Do not \ul mention\ulnone  it, as Anna will be vexed if you do. Tell your Papa I am glad his resolutions were approved of.\'a0 I have seen no paper mentioning the Convention, except the Patriot.\'a0 I am sorry the Duncans have left you.\'a0 Your Papa forgot to carry down the Tea nuts for Dr. Blanding & the other gentlemen. I have come to the end of my sheet, so must stop.\'a0 E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just sent off Anna, Fanny, & Frank to Church, & before I read to myself, will perform my duty to you.\'a0 Yesterday was May day, & getting ready so many children, Mary being still sick, & having to do it principally myself, fatigued me & gave me a headache, which though I partly slept off last night, I still have a little left & preferred staying at home this morning & resting, & go to church this afternoon. Dr. Crooks went to his farm Friday morning & said he might not return soon as he might find more of his servants sick.\'a0 I think he must have done so, as last night he had not come back.\'a0 Mary is getting better, & comes down into the kitchen. But she has not come into the house yet.\'a0 This put me to great inconvenience, so I live in great discomfort & make me reconciled & even pleased \ul you\ulnone  are not here & I would rather live as I do than [to] have Minerva back again.\'a0 Since she is away, the \ul other\ulnone  servants do better.\'a0 This morning while Lindy was fixing the house, Edward made some biscuits, & Eliza washed the dishes.\'a0 A general happiness has been diffused throughout the household since Minerva\'92s departure. Yesterday I received no letter from you, which disappointed me greatly.\'a0 This morning before I was up, Mr. Duncan sent you packages, & after breakfast when I sent to the Office a letter of yours came, which I expect I ought to have received yesterday, as it was written \ul before\ulnone  the one Mr. Duncan brought.\'a0 I suppose there was some carelessness in the Columbia Post office. I will have scarcely room to tell of May day.\'a0 Frank was at the School House all day, until 10 oclock at night, looking at the Tableaux & eating.\'a0 Very different from last May was this, for everybody I hear had \ul plenty\ulnone  to eat.\'a0 Frank asked this morning how long it would be before May day would come \ul again\ulnone , so he must have enjoyed it.\'a0 Anna also did.\'a0 She returned home in the afternoon. Dressed anew, went back again, & staid until 10 oclock at night.\'a0 The little H\'85 I think had very little pleasure, their poor little feet had to paddle along so fast, they were quite worn out.\'a0 Fanny dwells on the \'85ness of the \ul Queen\ulnone , who said she wished she had a \ul stick\ulnone  to make them go \ul faster\ulnone .\'a0 The Queen if she noticed \ul us\ulnone , must have been mortified at observing our attention was entirely on the H\'85, not on her.\'a0 Her iron rule it is well bestowed only for a day, & her subjects were rebellious, for they would have the Tableaux, which \ul she\ulnone  objected to.\'a0 I looked at them from the carri[a]ge, did not go into the schoolyard.\'a0 All of the Marshalls \ul walked\ulnone , so Hocky was not used,\'a0 Rudd strutted about in a \ul cocked\ulnone  hat.\'a0 The sun was so hot, it was enough to give them all fevers.\'a0 Hext was out, & looked \ul sweetly\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad the Convention adjourned in \ul harmony\ulnone .\'a0 I wish your resolutions had been adopted by the \ul whole\ulnone , but they paid you more respect that Mr. Memminger.\'a0 I long to read the account of the Convention in the next Patriot.\'a0 I read your Editorial this morning, & sent it to Mr. Elford with your printed Resolution & Mr. Greggs. You must be \ul sure\ulnone  & have your likeness taken, for without these the \ul life\ulnone  is far less interesting.\'a0 You must stay in Columbia for the purpose if necessary. I recollect in Columbia the servant at Maybins saying Mrs. Hemming a widow kept a boarding house opposite.\'a0 I suppose it is her son Miss Walker married.\'a0 I thought when she kept school she would meet with someone, as schoolteachers always manage to make a match.\'a0 As she is so unpleasantly situated at home with a stepmother. It is a \ul providential\ulnone  thing for her to get a husband. Mr. Burketts business being of less interest to me, than your\'a0 own,\'a0 I did not mention it. as I had not room for all, but I have opened the letter now, & will tell you what is in it.\'a0 Mr. Verner says he obtained a note on Mr. Hunnicut for 4 dollars, at a Muster, which he agreed to have paid in the fall; that Mr. Burkett says all are well & progressing at the Farm.\'a0\'a0 The Corn short 40 bushels, Lard 50 lbs.\'a0 Shucks one load which he paid for himself, which amount can lie, until he has some settlement about the notes in his hand for collection.\'a0 The country generally healthy.\'a0 One of the Mares at Burkett has a fine mule, & something about R\'85 Susan Perry was here.\'a0 Friday, her Grandmother had toothache\'85\'a0 A letter came this morning about some change in Post office & one from John C. Sullivan about some Law business.\'a0 You must try your best for the Paris\'92 \ul not\ulnone  to get a new trial.\'a0 Mr. Luther I am afraid & Susan never can be happy.\'a0 An un\'85 wife wife perhaps might be able to resign herself, but no other.\'a0 What do you think of his sitting down almost \ul naked\ulnone  to breakfast \ul only\ulnone  in his \ul shirt\ulnone , & going over the house before children & servants, & strange servants in that condition.\'a0 Vardry even asked if it was \ul right\ulnone  for Pa to come down naked.\'a0 He is still harping on the Joyce estate.\'a0 Mr. Hoke told him the estate was 160000 dollars, & he had given security only for 20 .\'a0 Mr. Luther told him he \ul could\ulnone  \ul give\ulnone  security for 500000 dollars.\'a0 Soon after Mr. Joyce died, old Mr. McBee sent for Mr. Luther to go to see him, & when he refused to go, sent again, & Mr. Luther went, & on his return home Susan asked him for what he was sent, & he said to talk about Mr. \ul Joyne\'92s\ulnone  \ul will\ulnone , so Susan thinks \ul his\ulnone  \ul father\ulnone  put it into his head to try & get it.\'a0 You know he persuaded him to run for Ordinary, an Office he was \ul entirely\ulnone  unfitted for.\'a0 So if this is so. You make old \ul Mr. McBee\ulnone  give security to \ul you\ulnone , that \ul you\ulnone  may not lose.\'a0 Pinckney is not as bad as Mr. Luther & is better off.\'a0 He has \ul carri[a]ge\ulnone , \ul buggy\ulnone  & 3 horses.\'a0 Tell Willie when he returns I am going to have a May day in the orchard, so he must bring me a pound of cocoa nut & one dozen nice oranges.\'a0 This will do instead of any presents for the children.\'a0 Anna will be Queen & he must deliver an address.\'a0 It will be pleasanter than the Academy May day.\'a0 I have come to a close.\'a0 Hext is now playing on the floor.

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter & Wilie\'92s & am obliged to you for them.\'a0 I was holding Hext while reading them, & gave him the envelopes to play with.\'a0 Mary was taken sick two days after you left, & though almost well now, does nothing in the house, & very little of anything in the kitchen.\'a0 Lindy works, Milks, minds her child[,] helps wash & iron, so of course can do nothing in the house.\'a0 Eliza works for Mamma, Susan, Ann as well as my family, so I can take her as seldom as possible from her sewing.\'a0 Sarah or Charlotte have to mind Hext, so it leaves you perceive almost \ul nobody\ulnone  to clean the house.\'a0 So I have lived in greater discomfort than I have known at housekeeping, & the house is dirtier than I have \ul ever\ulnone  seen it, but I am \ul far\ulnone  \ul happier\ulnone  than if Minerva were here with her insolent tongue & things were cleaner.\'a0 John Smith disappointed me & did not come yesterday to whitewash. & says he cannot come until Thursday.\'a0 If so the house will be confusion the night you return, but I have sent to ask him to come tomorrow, & allow me one day to clean up before you come back.\'a0 If he cannot come tomorrow, I will have to put off the whitewashing until next week.\'a0 I like it done every year, because we are obliged to clean every corner, & cleanliness promotes wealth.\'a0 But when I tell you it was fever Dr. Crooks thought Mary had, you will be thankful that she is soon getting well, & that all the rest of us have continued well.\'a0 All of Dr. Crooks negroes are getting well, & Mary is almost well.\'a0 She only takes Bitters to strengthen her.\'a0 She is so careless I expect her to be sick as long as we have her.\'a0 Frank is well, & none of the others have as yet taken the Mumps.\'a0 You tantalize me when you tell me of Mr. Rhett\'92s resignation.\'a0 He is right, for as a Secessionist, he \ul misrepresents\ulnone  the State, but no other Secessionist ought to be elected his \ul Sucessor\ulnone .\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  of course ought to be, but as you do not try for yourself, & have no friends so disinterested as to try for you, your claim will \ul always \ulnone be passed over.\'a0 If you had only got some friends to bring you to the Governors notice, I am certain you would have received the appointment, & what a triumph after being defeated for the other house, but of course you will be overlooked, so I am provoked as I am always with you, for doing \ul nothing\ulnone  to promote your interest, but as usual letting others get ahead of you.\'a0 Some honor of this kind would be the \ul making\ulnone  of your family in \ul this\ulnone \'a0 \ul world\ulnone , so you ought to make every honorable exertion for your advancement.\'a0 Persons like Mr. Martin of Abbeville always express what you \ul ought\ulnone  to have & what is \ul due\ulnone  you, but no one \ul tries\ulnone  to \ul get\ulnone  you your \ul due\ulnone . I am glad your Daguerreotype is taken & so fine a one.\'a0 \ul Copys\ulnone  are always cheaper after taking \ul one\ulnone , so I wish as \ul my\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone , you would have a Daguerreotype taken like the one you are to send to Mr. Livingston, only \ul finished\ulnone , & \ul bring\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 A \ul second\ulnone  one should be taken for far less than the \ul first\ulnone .\'a0 I hope Judge O\'92Neal[l]\'a0 will write your life \ul better\ulnone  than you did.\'a0 Altogether I was not satisfied with it, & look to \ul him\ulnone  to do you \ul justice\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad Mr. Finley spoke cordially to you.\'a0 I know our family in their \ul hearts\ulnone  \ul respect\ulnone  you, but in politics having been always on opposite sides, gives them a reserved feeling to you, & you yourself are reserved to them, for your manners, as I very often tell you are \ul repulsive\ulnone  & you think \ul others\ulnone  cold to you, when it is only a reflection of \ul your\ulnone  \ul unintentional\ulnone  coldness to them, you need \ul me\ulnone  by to \ul soften\ulnone  things.\'a0 Politics creates bitter feelings as \ul I\ulnone  know by experience.\'a0 Think of the Cunningham family who formerly were your \ul best\ulnone  friends, have now changed into enemies.\'a0 You say you did not \ul recognize\ulnone  Mr. Finley, so \ul he\ulnone  might have thought \ul you\ulnone  rude, when you did not mean to be rude at all. You must not forget to have my \ul thimble\ulnone  mended.\'a0 I hope Willie will come back very much improved.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon we had a fine rain, which was \ul greatly\ulnone  needed, & today Charles & Reuben are ploughing the bottom land & planting it, as it is in good condition to be done.\'a0 Charles attends to the garden every now & then. Mrs. Poinsett is now at her place.\'a0 I believe her son is with her.\'a0 Last Sunday afternoon Mr. Arthur had no service, & we went to the Baptist church to hear Mr. Furman, but he is away. & there was a Prayer meeting held instead of preaching.\'a0 Mr. Elford made a prayer a \ul very\ulnone  \ul good\ulnone  one.\'a0 After service he called to me as I came out of church, & said he had an Editorial sent him that morning of yours, which he would send to \ul me\ulnone  to read.\'a0 I told him \ul I\ulnone  had \ul read\ulnone  it, & \ul sent\ulnone  it to \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 He said he thought it had been sent by mistake to him.\'a0 You know Mr. Duncan brought it & sent to me, & I sent to Mr. Elford, & he was \ul not\ulnone  up, & seeing the Envelope directed to me, & not knowing who sent it to him, thought there was some mistake .\'a0 I have not sent him the \ul Temperance\ulnone  communication yet.\'a0 It is directed to \ul you\ulnone , & he I expect will not publish it, & I want you to read it. \ul I\ulnone  like \ul you\ulnone , wish Anna to be \ul modesty\ulnone  itself, but at the same time \ul polite\ulnone , & I think it was \ul rude\ulnone  to refuse the prayer book.\'a0 If a fan is offered me & I do not wish it, for fear if I refuse I will hurt the persons feelings.\'a0 Little attentions ought to be accepted with \ul politeness\ulnone  & at the same time \ul modestly\ulnone .\'a0 A little girl who is afraid it shows her to be \ul bold\ulnone .\'a0 If she \ul looks\ulnone  at a \ul boy\ulnone , perhaps is \ul bolder\ulnone  than one who \ul looks\ulnone  at him with \ul perfect\ulnone  \ul indifference\ulnone .\'a0 I wish our children to be \ul modest\ulnone , \ul easy\ulnone  & \ul polite\ulnone , but not \ul forward\ulnone  & \ul bold\ulnone  & \ul rude\ulnone .\'a0 I think with \ul our\ulnone  \ul training\ulnone  they will pursue the \ul right\ulnone  \ul course\ulnone , as \ul we\ulnone  \ul ourselves\ulnone  have.\'a0 If I have time I will write to Willie.\'a0 We will all be very glad to see you.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

Dear Willie\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have written to your Papa, & as you are now at leisure, & not much to occupy you, it may give you pleasure to read a letter from me. So I will write to you.\'a0 I will first tell you of Hochy, who you are \ul most\ulnone  interested in.\'a0 He was not used May day, as I have informed you.\'a0 I saw Rudd strutting about with a cocked hat on, & though he would not have graced Hochy much.\'a0 Aunt Anne inquired what plain looking person he was.\'a0 I dare say he is \ul good\ulnone , which is far better than good \ul looks\ulnone , but he is not as \ul handsome\ulnone  as \ul Hochy\ulnone .\'a0 Sunday afternoon Reuben put Hochy & Selim in the carri[a]ge & drove us a little way.\'a0 It seemed to me both horses looked \ul thin\ulnone .\'a0 It may be I only \ul imagined\ulnone  it, for I expect no horse under Reuben\'92s care\'a0 to do \ul well\ulnone , & I am aways expecting to see them looking thinner & thinner.\'a0 Reuben said Hochy was quite well, & had been used very little to haul wood.\'a0 He is so young, it gives no pleasure to use him, for fear it hurts him, so I determined not to use him often in the carri[a]ge.\'a0 Anna wrote you a letter Sunday.\'a0 She would not let me read it, so you must make allowances for mistakes, as she composed & wrote it entirely herself.\'a0 Yesterday she wrote to her Papa, & I read that.\'a0 I was amused at her arrangements for the May day she is to have; at everyone having a part assigned them, & when it came to Alex\'92s carrying the May pole, I laughed aloud.\'a0 Hext will be an odd little H\'85, unless he walks alone before that time.\'a0 There will have to be a third H\'85 to lead him & the Procession will have to make a very short circuit, in consideration of his little feet.\'a0 I hope you will acquit yourself well on the occasion, & that your first \ul effort\ulnone  as a \ul public\ulnone  \ul speaker\ulnone , will foreshadow who you are to be in after life. The boys gave a party last night to the girls.\'a0 Anna wished to go, but as \ul you\ulnone  were not here to go with her, I was very glad it rained so \ul hard\ulnone , that she \ul could\ulnone \'a0 \ul not\ulnone  go.\'a0 I hardly think any girl could have gone, & it was not in the favor of any who did go.\'a0 Until girls grow up, they should show themselves very little in public, & even then only occasionally.\'a0 They should be retired & modest, though at the same time polite. Franks mumps have troubled him very little.\'a0 He has gone about as usual except the first day he stayed from school.\'a0 He has gone to school this week. Mr. Wallace Thompson\'92s judgment I think very bad, to tell you, you ran about too much & neglected your school.\'a0 Judge Butler would have told you \ul differently\ulnone .\'a0 The foundation you lay out at school is very important, but the knowledge you gain in the occasional trips you make from home, are of great benefit to you, & will be through life, & give you information, that probably you never would have. If you staid all the time at home, went to school, & devoted yourself to Grammar, Geography Arithmetic &c.\'a0 Perfection in these studies, would make you a good schoolmaster, enabling you to impart\'a0 the same knowledge to others, but as you are to be a Lawyer or Statesman or something of this kind, you must have a \ul knowledge\ulnone  of \ul mankind\ulnone , in \ul general\ulnone  \ul information\ulnone  matters & things which you can never gain at school only.\'a0 Your occasional association with the \ul good\ulnone  & great has already done I hope much for you; for you know Hugh Thompson told his mother you \ul knew\ulnone  \ul something\ulnone  on \ul every\ulnone  \ul subject\ulnone  mentioned.\'a0 Your character it seems to me is different from the other little Willie[s], who stay at home, & whose Papas are not like yours, who have not the advantages you have.\'a0 You are more enlightened, & ought to be better than they are, when you think of the trouble & expense your Papa puts himself to, to improve you, so you must come back a \ul man\ulnone  in \ul behaviour\ulnone , & such a thing as quarreling with Frank, & being rude & unkind to Anna & Fanny you must be above, & be respectful to your Mama & not scold the servants.\'a0 I would have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read, but as you forgot to send your \ul love\ulnone  to her, I thought she would be hurt at the neglect, so did not send it.\'a0 She takes great pride in you, as you are her oldest grandchild. The \ul Temperance\ulnone  Cadets turned out May day, & were very \ul intemperate \ulnone in eating.\'a0 I believe if it were not for the \ul marching\ulnone  \ul occasionally\ulnone , & the \ul scarfs\ulnone  & \ul banners\ulnone  the company would not be near as large as it is.\'a0 I hope \ul nobler\ulnone  motives than these will influence you to be \ul good\ulnone , \ul virtuous\ulnone  & \ul temperate\ulnone .\'a0 Read your \ul bible\ulnone  & be governed by the \ul principles\ulnone  there inculcated.\'a0 We are all born sinful creatures, but some certainly even by nature more virtuous than others.\'a0 Your Papa is \ul innately\ulnone  \ul virtuous\ulnone , & I hope his children may be like him. If you come home Thursday night, tomorrow I will write my last letter to Columbia.\'a0 When you return you must devote yourself with increased application to your studies. I hope Paul Hayne\'92s \ul talents\ulnone  will be of some \ul use\ulnone , & not like some of his cousins, but what was his end.\'a0 He had no energy & was wanting in many things, but he was sensitive & many allowances must be made for him.\'a0 I am glad your Papa dresses so well, as to be observed.\'a0 He loves you\'85, [E.F.P.]\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will write you a few lines, though with a shocking pen, to prevent your being more anxious than is necessary.\'a0 Dr. Crooks this morning said Edward was doing \ul reasonably\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , that with the fever he has, the patient one day is better, the next day perhaps worse, & sometimes so for 12 or 15 days, sometimes longer before they begin actually to get better.\'a0 He also says that there is not so much danger of the fever spreading in the yard, as if one of the servants about us had it, for then it would have originated on our premises, & the same cause would give it to others, but that Edward was not living here, his sickness originated elsewhere.\'a0 You know Mr. Dyer said he had 3 servants sick like him.\'a0 All the rest of the family are well, & I hear of no new sickness anywhere.\'a0 I expect certainly to see you Saturday night & wish you would come back sooner, as you are to leave Sunday.\'a0 You ought to give me one day at least.\'a0\'a0 Take care of yourself.\'a0 I hope Frank is behaving well.\'a0 You must not be uneasy about us.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 You only left yesterday, but I am certain your Paper will be gratified to hear from home as soon as he reaches Columbia, so I will write now, that you may hear the very moment you get there.\'a0 This letter will be travelling along the Rail Road the \ul same\ulnone  \ul time\ulnone  with yourself.\'a0 Little will you know of it, that there is a letter travelling along with you telling how we all are.\'a0 I am sorry you had such a bad day yesterday but am glad that today the weather is so fine.\'a0 I hope you are well & behaving well, & that your Papa feels better than when he left.\'a0 We are all the same, as we were yesterday morning.\'a0 I have been busy today helping Mary fix upstairs, which has been in great disorder for several weeks past.\'a0 I am now tired so thought I would rest & write to you.\'a0 You must tell me everything in your letters, who you see, what they say to you, how you enjoy yourself &c. &c.\'a0 I was gratified to see you display some feeling on leaving home, for though I wish you to enjoy yourself when you \ul leave\ulnone  home, I wish you to be attached to home & prefer it to every place.\'a0 I hope & believe you will spend your time pleasantly.\'a0 Everything will be new to you.\'a0 If you can get a very pretty Silver comb in Columbia at a reasonable price, get it, but if not, \ul wait\ulnone  until you get to \ul Charleston\ulnone .\'a0 After you have made all the purchases you \ul need\ulnone , write me word how much money you have \ul left\ulnone .\'a0 Your Papa had better give you \ul 30\ulnone  \ul dollars\ulnone .\'a0 Buy some \ul Castile\ulnone  \ul Soap\ulnone  to clean your \ul teeth\ulnone  with the morning after you get to Columbia. I forgot to give you any; 6 cts worth is enough, & you will find it very useful.\'a0 It \ul whitens\ulnone  the teeth, & cleans them easier in this cold weather, than the water alone.\'a0 I forgot to put up your Barege Sack,, & one nice pr of\'a0 fine tucked pantalets, I saw in your drawer today, which I ought to have packed up.\'a0 Do not forget the Castile Soap.\'a0 I am going to buy 3 peices this evening for each of the childrens room. \ul Nothing\ulnone  more from the Post office this morning.\'a0 Fanny missed you yesterday & wished you were here.\'a0 Willie little while ago came from school with your bucket in his hand, grumbling that he had to bring it\'85Mrs. Hopkins called him in as he passed & begged him to bring it home.\'a0 I am glad it has been found.\'a0 Fannys shoes were broken, & as it was so wet I let her stay at home today.\'a0 Frank has gone to school.\'a0 Willie is now learning his lessons.\'a0 Fanny is seated on the floor putting on her stockings which\'a0 she had taken off.\'a0 Hext is in the little dining room playing with the\'85to the stove.\'a0 Charlotte has gone to Mrs. Mauldins to carry Mary Mauldins book mark & pocket handkerchief you left for her; the other book marks for Mr. & Mrs. Hopkins Fanny will carry tomorrow.\'a0 I have no news to tell.\'a0 Charles has gone to the Farm to get wood.\'a0 I have been busy cutting out clothes for the servants & helping make them, but I go to bed regularly at 9 oclock. I hope you will not have to stay long in Columbia.\'a0 As you have gone down so late, you will have but a short time to stay in Charleston.\'a0I will write perhaps again tomorrow, but if I do not you may know I have nothing to write about.\'a0 Write to me & behave like a lady, & tell your Papa to write.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P. P.S. This is the first letter I believe I have ever written to you.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I take up my pen to write to you, with very little to write about.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Nothing more from the Post office this morning for you, a letter from Aunt Mary McCall to me, & letters from Aunt Eliza & Alston to Mamma is all that came.\'a0 Aunt Eliza is expecting Anna down, & says Mr. Taylor & Sarah requested her, to ask you to carry her to stay with them.\'a0 If they ask her in Columbia, let her stay with them.\'a0 Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Isaac Hayne are to be in Columbia & if they are at Sarahs, Anna will find it pleasant having companions among their children, & less lonely than at the boarding house, where she will be \ul alone\ulnone , while you are away all day. Col. Town[e]s came this morning for your office key.\'a0 He has brought it back again.\'a0 He says he sets off for Columbia tomorrow with his brother Augustus in a private conveyance, so he will not get as quickly as the Mail, or I would write by him. The Spotted Cow has a Calf, a few days old.\'a0 Charles says he will let it remain at the Farm until we can use the Milk.\'a0 Charles is today hauling wood with Mamma\'92s horse.\'a0 I suppose Reuben will be back tomorrow.\'a0 I hope you have arrived safely in Columbia & feel better than when you left.\'a0 I am glad you now have fine weather.\'a0 Today I hope you are going on safely to the end of your journey. Write me how Anna behaves, & if she enjoys herself.\'a0 Willie\'92s school breaks up tomorrow.\'a0 I will ride to Mr. McClanahans & pay him as soon as the horses have rested on their return.\'a0I have no news to tell you.\'a0 Write me everything you know I am interested in all that goes on.\'a0 I will have more to write about when I hear from you.\'a0\'a0\'a0 I will then give you advice, which I know you are longing for. We are getting on quite well.\'a0 I hope Anna & yourself are also.\'a0 I write only to keep you from being uneasy, for I have literally nothing to write about.\'a0 I hope tomorrow or the next day to hear from you or Anna.\'a0 My love to her.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

Willie has come from school.\'a0 He has now done with Mr. Leary.\'a0 He brought his bill 10.25 which I will pay.\'a0 Frank is the only one who will be going to school.\'a0 Fanny\'92s breaks up tomorrow.\'a0 She staid at home today on account of the rain.\'a0 \ul Nothing\ulnone  came from the Post office this morning.\'a0 I have no news to tell you.\'a0 Mamma & Susan came in yesterday.\'a0 They are well.\'a0 Reuben is cleaning carriage & harness, Charles shelling corn.\'a0 As soon as Reuben returned, Charles accused him of carrying off one night last week a load of Potatoes.

I am glad to tell you the missing Heifer came up yesterday, little aware of its fate, & at this moment the rain having ceased awhile Charles, Reuben & Willie are all engaged dispatching it.\'a0 Our last Ham gave out at breakfast so we were absolutely in need of meat.\'a0 This now will last us a long time.\'a0 We will with the different Beeves we can kill, have a supply for a long time.\'a0 \ul Nothing\ulnone  came from the Post office this morning.\'a0 As Willie will have holiday for some time, I have told him he ought to improve his time systematically, read something improving first, then something interesting & afterwards making himself useful in cutting wood, hauling it &c., so he has commenced Bancrofts History of the United States, & read a good way in it.\'a0 John wets himself going to the Spring. & takes off his Shoes constantly, so he has taken cold, & Minerva makes such a fuss about him.\'a0 Came over late last night & early this morning, that I sent for Dr. Crooks.\'a0 He said he only had bad cold, must take Castor oil & Toddy & that was all that was necessary.\'a0 So he is in the cellar today.\'a0 But when the weather is good, he will come out.\'a0 The shoes you gave him, have shrunk so he cannot get them on.\'a0 I gave him a pr of Franks, & when they go will have to buy him a pr. I sent for Mr. Chandler to look at the leak in the floor of the balcony.\'a0 He says he will put a peice of tin against the house where the floor of the balcony joins & that will stop the leaking. I know of nothing new to tell you.\'a0 I have not been out since you left, & seen no one but Mamma & Susan once, & Col. Town[e]s for a few moments. I am afraid Anna has not enjoyed herself yet. As the weather if it is as bad in Columbia as here must prevent her going out. Fanny would not go to school today on account of the rain.\'a0 Frank has just returned.\'a0 He says Mr. Hillhouse the boys say is to be married to a Lady in Union.\'a0 I believe I have nothing more to write about.\'a0 This is the fourth letter I have written & have not heard once yet.\'a0 I hope you are well, & getting along comfortably.\'a0 I have put by two Patriots.\'a0 There was not as much Editorial as usual.\'a0 I will now close with love for Anna.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is a bright pleasant day, but as I am not altogether prepared to go to church, I will stay at home, write to you, take care of Hext, as Charlotte is going to church, & read the services to Fanny.\'a0 Willie & Frank are going to church. I have not received a line from you yet.\'a0 Yesterday I expected certainly to hear but did not.\'a0 Today I supposed I would but no Mail came from beyond Newberry.\'a0 Tomorrow no Mail comes at all, so until Tuesday, the ninth day since you left, I will not hear, but I bear it patiently, hoping it is your business, that has prevented your writing, or the irregularity of the Mail that has prevented my receiving what you \ul have\ulnone  written.\'a0 It will be a great satisfaction when I do hear that you have arrived safely in Columbia & are well & Anna enjoying herself.\'a0 This is the fifth letter that I have written, so you have heard every day since you reached Columbia. The weather cleared Friday evening & is now very fine.\'a0 Charles is anxious for you to buy some Kentucky hogs before you come back, says those that pass by now are better & cheaper than they will be later.\'a0 Shall I tell Mr. Hoke to buy some? or wait until you return.\'a0 He has not bought the Hog yet.\'a0 We do not need it for immediate use, as we have a supply of Beef.\'a0 It would only be to put away for future use,\'a0 John is better of his cold, & was out yesterday, but complaining of Earache, which he sometimes has.\'a0 He is going to church this morning, so must feel well.\'a0 The rest of us are well.  Fanny amuses herself as well as she can, but often wishes someone to play with, but is better alone, as she then cannot quarrel.\'a0 Yesterday she & Hext went up to Mrs. Hopkins to carry two little presents to Miss Eliza & Rosa.\'a0 She returned with two presents for herself, a pincushion & little tiger, & is anxious to give more presents, that she may get a return.\'a0 She wishes Anna had gone long ago & come back so as to show her all the pretties.\'a0 \ul Nothing\ulnone  \ul at\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone  has come from the Post office for you since you left. I have nothing new to tell you, have not been out once, & seen no one but those I told you of before.\'a0 I am busy working all the time for the servants.\'a0 Baylis & Becky have Prayer meetings every night in their room, except Friday night, when they have it in Eliza\'92s room.\'a0 I hope they will cause a reformation in the yard. You must write me everything, whether you think Jones will be elected Treasurer.\'a0 I wont feel easy until he is beaten, for he is too unprincipled to be rewarded, & if he is, I will think it only requires a person to be \ul vain\ulnone , \ul presumptuous\ulnone , a \ul fool\ulnone  & \ul unprincipled\ulnone  to succeed in this world, for never has a man been more undeserving of success than him.\'a0 Merit & deserts do not meet with their reward & are not appreciated; that I know & feel from \ul your\ulnone  experience, but I trust & hope, you will \ul even\ulnone  \ul yet\ulnone  be \ul rewarded\ulnone  not by you \ul own\ulnone  conscience \ul alone\ulnone , but that the consciences of others will make them honor you, in some \ul tangible\ulnone  \ul shape\ulnone , give you an office or Honor that will show the \ul whole\ulnone  \ul world\ulnone  you have been \ul appreciated\ulnone . Give my love to Anna.\'a0 She forgot her \ul Veil\ulnone .\'a0 She must buy one.\'a0 I hope she is pleased, not disappointed in her anticipations, & able to get along alone, & been a good girl. Hext is now pulling me, & crying for me to take him, so I must stop.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

Tell Anna I am glad to hear from her.\'a0 I dare say she will receive no message from Mrs. Taylor.\'a0 She is sick in bed, has recently for the \ul fifth\ulnone  time lost an infant at its birth.\'a0 Aunt Eliza said both Mr. Taylor & herself requested \ul you\ulnone  to take Anna to their house & not doing so, they may not think it necessary to send to ask her, particularly if it is true as Mrs. Thomas told me that Sarah was hurt at Willie\'92s not going to stay with her, when he \ul first\ulnone  went to Columbia.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 John is well again.\'a0 The horses are quite well. & the stock generally I believe.\'a0 I will give particular directions about Genl Thompsons Heifer.\'a0 I rode yesterday to Mr. McClanahan\'92s & paid the money.\'a0 He was not at home & his daughter said, her Mother instead of receipting the bill, which I asked her to do, would send a receipt today, Yesterday old Mrs. John Stokes brought me some Butter 15 cts a pound, & the servant said, she would engage it to me all winter at that price, & I said I would be glad to.\'a0 Mrs. McClanahan asks 20 cts, , & does not send it.\'a0 So I will take from Mrs. Stokes. If Judge Evans is elected Senator, a judge will be elected in his place.\'a0 I wish \ul you\ulnone  would be a Candidate.\'a0 My ambition is to be a \ul Judges\ulnone  \ul wife\ulnone .\'a0 It will be easier for you to be elected to that office, than\'a0 to any political one, as a Judge has not much to do with politics, & then I can go to Charleston with you every year, so get some friends to interest themselves for you. The ride I took yesterday was quite pleasant. Susan, Ann & Fanny went with me.\'a0 This evening I intend to take another.\'a0 Reuben drives us.\'a0 I am sorry to mortify Willie, but I am afraid to trust him with the two horses.\'a0 Bill starts constantly, & it requires a a strong hand to keep him in.\'a0 You will have to buy a horse for Willie\'92s especial use. I will be very glad for you to pay Dr. Irvine for Becky.\'a0 It will save interest, & like you I like to pay my bills immediately, & if possible never go in debt.\'a0 He soon goes to Florida.\'a0 You had better send the Check at once.\'a0 Dr. Irvine I can beg to leave your note with someone, so it will be paid even in his absence.\'a0 I dare say he would like the money before he goes to Florida, as he is going there to purchase land.\'a0 When Mr. Hamilton pays you. you must pay all your debts, & then invest the rest profitably.\'a0 You see \ul I\ulnone  was right.\'a0 Mr. Williams has not paid you what he promised. Willie says the Mountaineer office is removed to that small house by Rutledge Stables, that Mr. Long had built over his Ice House.\'a0 I cannot say I am sorry for Mr. Sam Town[e]s sickness.\'a0 I instinctively dislike him.\'a0 He & Mr. Burt, both make a \ul tool\ulnone \'a0 of you for their \ul own\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone , but whenever an opportunity offers they injure you.\'a0 For 100 dollars a year Mr. Town[e]s would abuse you as much as your enemies would wish, but when he wishes \ul you\ulnone  to \ul write\ulnone  his \ul book\ulnone  for him his abuse then stops for the time.\'a0 Mamma says she hears he is going to purchase the house Mr. Lynn Watson is building near her. Luther lately wrote a note to Susan begging her to return, but she declined.\'a0 He told her not to mention to anyone, particularly to Mamma, that he had written.\'a0 She told it to me in \ul confidence\ulnone , & I tell it to \ul you\ulnone  as we are one.\'a0 I know of nothing new to tell you.\'a0 An Eclectic is all that has come for you.\'a0 Tell Anna I will write soon to her.\'a0 I hope she will go to Charleston before long.\'a0 Yours, E.F.P.\'a0\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received two letters from you this morning, & one from Anna.\'a0 I was very glad to hear from you.\'a0 Your letters are the only comfort I have while you are away.\'a0 I was really \ul provoked\ulnone  to hear that \ul Jones \ulnone was elected by the Legislature, Treasurer.\'a0 If anyone deserved defeat it was \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 It has given me a bad opinion of mankind, for I see now that \ul duplicity\ulnone , want of \ul principle\ulnone , \ul meanness\ulnone , \ul vanity\ulnone , \ul presumption\ulnone , & \ul being a fool\ulnone , is all that is needed now to succeed in this world; that \ul merit\ulnone  & \ul good\ulnone  \ul conduct\ulnone  & \ul sense\ulnone  stand \ul no\ulnone  \ul chance\ulnone .\'a0 I would have given a \ul large\ulnone  sum to have defeated Jones.\'a0 I believe how he will appropriate the money he receives in his Office to his own \ul use\ulnone , pay his debts, live in style, & never breaks, & even if he does this, I suppose he will be elected again.\'a0 He is now made for life, & will hold his head higher than ever.\'a0 I am sorry too, your \ul enemy\ulnone  should have succeeded.\'a0 It seems as if your exposure of him failed of its \ul effect\ulnone .\'a0 I thought he was \ul put\ulnone  \ul down\ulnone  forever, instead of which he has risen \ul higher\ulnone  than ever, & your \ul judgement\ulnone  too is out, for you thought he stood no chance of success.\'a0 What a pity Mr. Ashmore or some prominent man had not been a Candidate.\'a0What a dreadful Rail Road accident.\'a0 I am afraid for you to come back on it.\'a0 You must hire a hack or have the carri[a]ge sent down for you.\'a0 The Rail Road will never be safe.\'a0 It will be constantly under \'85ing.\'a0 All the rains will injure it.\'a0 At the South they cannot manage as at the North. Isaac Hayne\'92s election was really close.\'a0 You were obliged on account of my relation to Aunt Eliza to vote for him, but I would not have been sorry if he had been defeated.\'a0 You are the only magnanimous\'a0 person I know of, & the only one that meets with no reward.\'a0 It makes me heartsick to think of Jones election.\'a0 He \ul deserved\ulnone  \ul defeat\ulnone  \ul so\ulnone .\'a0 Dr. Crooks says he borrowed one thousand dollars to pay for his Piano & Carriage, that he cannot hold up much longer, & that John Jones will break along with him, for he is security for all his debts, but I do not believe either will break.\'a0 Mr. Hopkins has just brought me a letter from you.\'a0 I will stop & read it. I have read your letter & am very glad to hear again from you.\'a0 I hope Anna has gone to Charleston by this time, as she will have so short a time to stay, if she remains longer in Columbia. The white faced Cow has a calf also.\'a0 Reuben says they had better all remain in the field, that there is plenty there for them to eat.\'a0 They were brought home yesterday & Charles has carried them back today.\'a0 In two weeks the oldest Calf & Cow will be brought home & milked.\'a0 John is quite well now, Edward goes to his work, Mary is well, & Lindy seems pretty well, hobbles a little.\'a0 I would be thankful if I could get rid of Eliza.\'a0 She calls Joe Powel her husband, says she has been living with him five years, sends her children on messages to him, abuses me, wont let her children work for us, & she is an \ul abominable\ulnone  \ul creature\ulnone , a \ul pollution\ulnone  to any yard, & Mary could & would have married, if it had not been for Eliza\'92s abusing her, to those who wished to marry her, but these things we will speak of on your return. I am glad Anna is behaving well & enjoying herself.\'a0 I will write to her when she gets to Charleston, & she must write to me often, & do you write whenever you can.\'a0 I have written by \ul every\ulnone  Mail.\'a0 I know of nothing new at all.\'a0 The village seems very quiet.\'a0 When you are away, I hear nothing.\'a0 I have nothing at all to write about.\'a0 Becky is ding well.\'a0 If I can get rid of Eliza, & take home Clara as the seamstress, I think then our yard will be purified. I am sorry the Mails are so irregular.\'a0 I will be very uneasy when you are coming home\'a0 I would rather send the carriage for you all the way to Columbia.\'a0 The road curves so.\'a0 I think the Cars will constantly run off.\'a0 How sad for Col. Singleton & his Grandson to be killed.\'a0 The road must be badly managed, & I suppose the freshet undermined it so, that many parts will yet give way.\'a0 Next winter I will go with you. Hext will be weaned, & I would like to stay in Mrs. Janney\'92s room as Anna does, not go to the public table.\'a0 I am glad she does not.\'a0 She is too young to go much into public.\'a0 Mrs. Janneys family have been kind.\'a0 I rode yesterday to Mrs. Dr. Williams to carry home her Can she had sent for.\'a0 She has had 30 cases of sickness.\'a0 She expects to be confined.\'a0 What a pity.\'a0 She is having her house plastered, & going to add an addition in front.\'a0 We rode also to the College Hill, & saw the building more than 3 stories high.\'a0 I do not hear of any sickness now in Greenville.\'a0 I hope it will be healthier. I am glad you are treated with \ul respect\ulnone .\'a0 That is all the reward \ul you\ulnone  will meet with.\'a0 I wish you would be Judge.\'a0 If you think you can be elected you must try for it.\'a0 The Legislature would be inclined perhaps to bestow the honor on you, for your disinterested conduct, through life, but you have no \ul ambition\ulnone .\'a0 I wish you honored for your \ul childrens\ulnone  sake.\'a0 It will be an advantage to \ul them\ulnone . Write me long letters, & tell me everything.\'a0 All the letters I received today were dated 27
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 You must have written one on Sunday.\'a0 I now see your last was Sunday, but you dated 27
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  instead of 28
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you.\'a0 I am pleased at your being thought of as Governor, & provoked that you should \ul decline\ulnone  the honor.\'a0 If you ran & were not elected \ul this\ulnone  \ul time\ulnone , you might be \ul another\ulnone , & it would then seem as if you had at last been so rewarded & appreciated by your State.\'a0 Your position in the State for yourself & family would be established forever.\'a0 You would then be ranked among the \ul highest\ulnone .\'a0 Why do you \ul act\ulnone  so \ul strangely\ulnone , & not avail yourself of the offers made to honor you.\'a0 You are always holding back, & let others take, what you could easily have.\'a0 Why do you not think of your \ul own\ulnone  & your \ul wife\ulnone  & \ul childrens\ulnone  \ul interest\ulnone .\'a0 It has provoked me ever since I have been married, this disposition of yours, to do for \ul others\ulnone , what you wont do for yourself.\'a0 As your honors all end in nothing, it is tantalizing to me, only to have suggestions made & not carried out, that it gives me no satisfaction.\'a0 I would be much happier if you had some ambition.\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  \ul have\ulnone , & your not having any, is a constant source of annoyance to me.\'a0 You had better for \ul my\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone  be elected to some Office.\'a0 Until you are I will give you no peace.\'a0 I will then get over my disappointment at your Congressional defeat.\'a0 You ought to have said \ul yes\ulnone  you would run for \ul Governor\ulnone .\'a0 You know you \ul deserve\ulnone  it, & would discharge the duties \ul better\ulnone  than \ul anybody\ulnone  & in Greenville where so many look \ul down\ulnone  on you & \ul dislike\ulnone  you, I would be so pleased to make them henceforward feel differently.\'a0 I hope you will be elected; for my sake \ul do\ulnone , it will make me \ul so\ulnone  \ul happy\ulnone .\'a0 I will never worry at anything again, & I will feel so pleased at your being appreciated, & after the term is over you can practice law again.\'a0 It will cause you to have higher honors & make your children stand so \ul high in the world\ulnone ; for their sakes, consent to run. I am glad Anna is enjoying herself, & that Mrs. Martin asked her to stay with her.\'a0 I suppose she is today in Charleston.\'a0 I am sorry you bought her so useless & extravagant\'a0 a present as a medallion.\'a0 A Silver comb which is ornamental & \ul useful\ulnone  I wished her to get.\'a0 She has no chain to wear the Medallion with.\'a0 Do not spend your money so uselessly.\'a0 All of mine here goes for servants clothes.\'a0 In winter it costs a great deal to clothe them & I only give them what is absolutely necessary but try to provide for one a great many.\'a0 I try to save but it is no use, what \ul I\ulnone  \ul save\ulnone , \ul you\ulnone  \ul throw\ulnone  \ul away\ulnone .\'a0 \ul We are all well\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Stuart was here yesterday, came to borrow books.\'a0 She said she wished Mr. Thompson would get an Office; that he wished to be Superintendent of roads, that the present incumbent did not wish the Office.\'a0 I told her you were going to try & get it for Mr. Thompson.\'a0 You must not forget it.\'a0 When you are \ul Governor\ulnone  you can \ul give\ulnone  him an Office.\'a0 How delightful to have it in the power to help others.\'a0 Susan Hoke says Mrs. Trimmier was a run away match; says the family are so small in size, \ul dwarfs\ulnone  I should think.\'a0 I am sorry Anna witnessed such \ul boldness\ulnone .\'a0 I hope to hear every day from you.\'a0 It is my only comfort.\'a0 I have nothing new to write about.\'a0I would be very sorry if the Commons in College is dispensed with.\'a0 I think the young men should eat & sleep in the College.\'a0 If the Fare is bad, make them pay more, & have better. Isaac Hayne\'92s was really a close vote.\'a0 If the Greenville Delegation had not voted for him, he would have been defeated.\'a0 I am really sorry Jones was elected, but if you are elected Governor, I will be able to get over Jones undeserved reward.\'a0 It worries me so, the fear that you will not run, that I am almost sorry you mentioned the subject to me.\'a0 From Mr. DeTrevilles vote there must be a great many Secessionists in the Legislature.\'a0 You will get also the Union & some of the Cooperationists, so if you will only run, you will \ul certainly\ulnone  be elected, so I will live on hope & do you run I never will again repine at you not hav[ing] been rewarded as you deserve if you Are Elected Governor.\'a0 It seems to me if you are only a Candidate, the Legislature will be glad to show their esteem by electing you.\'a0 So I new certainly look forward to my dear husband being a Governor, not that it will make him higher in \ul my\ulnone  \ul esteem\ulnone , but in the \ul World\ulnone  it will, & will be a mark of esteem he \ul deserves\ulnone  & \ul merits\ulnone , & through the whole United States he will be honored, but \ul alas\ulnone  I fear my wishes will not be \ul realized\ulnone .\'a0 If not, a Seat on the bench is what next I wish. I will write soon to Anna.\'a0 I hope she will pass her time pleasantly in Charleston.\'a0 I am glad she behaves well.\'a0 Willie reads, & hauls wood.\'a0 He misses the driving the carri[a]ge, & wont drive \ul one\ulnone  \ul horse\ulnone  unless he can drive both.\'a0 Frank goes to school.\'a0 Fanny & Hext\'85amuse themselves at home.\'a0 Fanny also goes to Mamma\'92s. & Annie comes here.\'a0 I am too busy to visit, have rode out twice only.\'a0 I am glad you are employed, but wish you had a little more time to write.\'a0 Write every day.\'a0 I miss your letters if you do not.\'a0 Ever yours, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter mentioning Anna had left, & I am very glad to hear from you.\'a0 I hope the Mail will continue to come regularly, & you to write every day.\'a0 If you do not, I will miss the letters so much.\'a0 It gives me something to think of each day, but you must not again mention honors offered you, & \ul declined\ulnone  by you.\'a0 You must if it is only for my \ul sake\ulnone , accept them, for you know I expect to be unhappy, until you are elected to some \ul Office\ulnone , that will make me feel, you are appreciated by your \ul fellow\ulnone  \ul men\ulnone , that your noble independence & disinterestedness, has been rewarded.\'a0 So I hope you will be run for Governor, even if you are defeated, it will be of benefit to you at some \ul future\ulnone  time.\'a0 Your name will be brought forward, & the next time you will be elected to that or some other office.\'a0 But I hope you will \ul now\ulnone  be elected, & if \ul you\ulnone  \ul consent\ulnone  that your friends\'a0 should interest themselves for you, you will,\'a0 you must not be so \ul indifferent\ulnone  to these worldly honors.\'a0 For the sake of your childrens \ul future\ulnone  \ul benefit\ulnone , you should exert yourself more to advance your name & reputation.\'a0 If you had been married to a Lady like Mrs. Brockman you might remain satisfied as you are.\'a0 She would have had no aspirations\'a0 for you, & would have been contented & happy, but I am different.\'a0 My desire is to have you \ul exalted\ulnone  in \ul Station\ulnone , for you are of a \ul superior\ulnone  \ul order\ulnone  of \ul being\ulnone , & deserve the \ul highest\ulnone  honors in the gift of the people, & until you get \ul one\ulnone  \ul Honor\ulnone  that will show to the \ul world\ulnone , that your fellow men have appreciated you as you deserve, I cannot be satisfied.\'a0 It is not for myself that I wish it but for \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 I am contented to remain in \ul obscurity\ulnone  so \ul you\ulnone  meet your \ul reward\ulnone .\'a0 But I cannot be satisfied until you are rewarded in the way I wish, not as you say a good conscience, is all you look for.\'a0 I look for something more.\'a0\'a0\'a0 So I hope you will be elected Governor.\'a0 If you are not, as you have elected Judge Evans a Senator, you ought to be elected Judge in his place.\'a0 So you must return either Governor or Judge. In one other thing also you have acted as you usually do, giving place to others,\'a0 the bill giving the Presidential Election to the people, \ul you\ulnone  first introduced, & have made the people \ul determine\ulnone  to have this Session when the bill \ul can\ulnone  pass, & \ul you\ulnone  ought to have the \ul credit\ulnone  of, you have let Mr. \ul Poppenheim\ulnone  \ul take\ulnone  from you, so instead of \ul your\ulnone  \ul name\ulnone  going down to posterity as the Author of this great reformation, you quietly give it to another, when \ul you\ulnone  are the one who deserve it.  I will write to Anna today.\'a0 I am glad she enjoyed herself in Charleston, & received so much kindness.\'a0 I am willing for her to remain several weeks in Charleston & even the whole winter if her friends wish it.\'a0 Two weeks is too short a time for her to stay.\'a0 You can come home, & she come up with someone who will be coming.\'a0 Mrs. Elford goes down Monday & will stay 3 weeks.\'a0 Anna can come back with her or someone else, after the trouble & expense\'a0 of getting ready & sending her down she ought to stay 3, 4, or 5 weeks at least.\'a0 I do not know when she will go again.\'a0 But I dare say Aunt Eliza will write to me about her staying, & I can then determine how long she had best stay.\'a0 I know there will be plenty of opportunities for her to return. I will speak to Mr. Hoke about the Hogs, & the first cold weather get him to buy some.\'a0 At present it is too warm.\'a0 It is today raining, but I dare say it will clear up cold.\'a0 We are all well, & coming on quite well.\'a0 I keep house in more comfort than I did, & when you return, hope to live systematically, & have everything in order. Frank goes to school.\'a0 He seems a favorite with everybody.\'a0 Willie reads & cuts & hauls wood.\'a0 I would much rather him be with you.\'a0 He would improve in character & manners more than here.\'a0 In future you had better carry him.\'a0 I dare say Mr. Janney would not charge for Willie, if he occupied the same room with you.\'a0You must have been pleased at Gov. Swains remembering you so kindly.\'a0 It is a pity you had not both met as \ul Governors\ulnone .\'a0 It would have been an interesting incident.\'a0 Two school mates being elevated to the same office, & meeting after 30 years had elapsed.\'a0I never know of any news to tell you.\'a0 A letter came from Mr. Hamilton today enclosing a second check for 300 dollars, In place of the one that you wrote word you had not received.\'a0 I suppose this second one will be of no use to you now.\'a0 But I will keep it carefully until you return.\'a0 If you have 400 dollars in your pocket book, & Mr. Gladden pays you 100, you can pay for Becky.\'a0 What next you receive pay your other debts with, & I hope next year being the\'85of debt, & even have some to invest profitably for future use. I am afraid the Railroad will constantly be injured by these rains.\'a0 It passes over so many water courses.\'a0 I should think it was not built well, or managed well.\'a0 You had better have the carri[a]ge sent for you to Columbia or hire a conveyance.\'a0 The horses are quite well & the animals generally.\'a0 Charles until the rain was digging ground nuts, & Reuben hauling wood.\'a0 Mr. Lasly is cutting down trees for the Log house.\'a0\'a0I write to you every day.\'a0 As you were so extravagant in buying Anna a Medallion, I was induced to buy something for the house which we much need, an Entry carpet 21 yds at 1 dollar a yd.\'a0 The Oil Cloth is completely worn out, & I have bought a beautiful Carpet, only two thirds more than the Medallion cost, & will be much more useful, & add to the beauty & comfort of the house.\'a0 It would take all of my money to pay for it, so I will not pay until you return.\'a0 I have only bought what servants clothes was necessary, but it costs a great deal, & to keep the house for so large a family.\'a0I am glad you are spending your time pleasantly with congenial spirits.\'a0 It is what I wish you would \ul always\ulnone  enjoy.\'a0 Greenville is too little & contracted & narrow a sphere for you.\'a0 I must now conclude.\'a0 Ever Truly Yours, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from your Papa today, in which he mentions your having left that morning for Charleston.\'a0 That you went off in good spirits, & had enjoyed yourself very much in Columbia.\'a0 I have time now to write you only a short letter, my next one will be longer.\'a0 I was gratified to hear you had been a good girl & given your Papa no trouble.\'a0 He wrote word, you were as good a girl as he knew of.\'a0 I was sorry he bought you so useless & extravagant a present as a Medallion.\'a0 You have no chain to wear it with.\'a0 I will send you by Mr. Elford who goes down on Monday, some of my hair, that I have had a long time.\'a0 I kept it at a time when it came out very fast, to make a chain with.\'a0 You can use what is necessary to make a chain to go round your throat to wear your Medallion to, sometime.\'a0 I will have my likeness & your Papa\'92s taken & put it in the medallion, so it will then be valuable, more so than it is now.\'a0 Your Papa\'92s heart overflows so with love for his wife & children, that he would spend his last cent in gratifying even an extravagant wish of theirs particularly when he is absent from them.\'a0 He then loses his prudence, & his generosity gets the better of him.\'a0 Whatever you need in the way of clothes to make yourself neat & comfortable you must get it.\'a0 Cloak of some kind I wish you to have, a bonnet either of drab stram, or any pretty kind children of your age wear, perhaps another dress.\'a0 Shoes, gloves &c.\'a0 A Silver Comb will be useful not only to you, but also to Fanny when you are done with it. And your Earrings you can have bored & buy Earrings.\'a0 Your money I expect will not be enough.\'a0 Your Papa wrote that it was all the change he had, & you could draw on him for more.\'a0 When you have made your purchases, write me word, & then I will write for a few things for myself & the children. I would like to know the price of a hat for Fanny either beaver or a bonnet.\'a0 Inquire the price of a dinner set of China for children.\'a0 Let me know how much a bracelet of hair could be made for, & a long chain & a short chain for the neck.\'a0 Your cousin Eliza beg[s] to let me know. I hope you will be a good girl, & return improved & benefitted, & pass your time pleasantly among friends.\'a0 Give my love to all of my Aunts, & particularly Aunt Eli\'85, Eliza & Susan.\'a0 Tell Aunt Eliza I am wondering why she has not written to me.\'a0 I expect she does not think my letters worth answering.\'a0 I write in such a hurry generally, that I am really ashamed to send my letters.\'a0 After writing to your Papa as I do every day, I am tired & hurried, for I am very busy now making clothes for the servants.\'a0 Your Aunt Susan is with me today, Annie & Fanny are playing about the room, & Hext as usual making a noise, & trying to break the window glass with a yd stick.\'a0 Poor little fellow.\'a0 I have not told your Papa because I knew it would make him so unhappy, more than he ought to be, but I will tell you that the other day I had a great fright about him.\'a0 He was at the wood pile, & Frank was cutting wood, & not seeing him behind him, raised his axe & struck him above his Eye, exactly across his Eyebrow.\'a0 He was brought in moaning, with his eye covered with blood, & I was afraid to look to see what injury was done, but the eye was not at all injured & Dr. Dean put Court plaster on the cut, & it is almost well.\'a0 I would have told your Papa, but he is so anxious about us all when he is away, that he would be needlessly made unhappy even miserable, & imagine the accident worse than it was, & perhaps even hasten home to see about it. I have written you a long letter.\'a0 Your Aunt is kind to have asked you to visit her, & you must behave yourself so as to not make her regret it.\'a0 If you can in any way make yourself useful to her you must Perform all of your duties.\'a0 Begin the day by praying to be kept from evil, & directed in the right way & reading in your Prayer book if it is only a few verses.\'a0 Give all of my messages to your Aunt & cousins, but I have written so hurriedly, I prefer their not \ul reading\ulnone  my letter.\'a0 Write me of everything that interests you, & of all of my friends. Your Grandmama stays constantly with your Aunt Annie who is very poorly.\'a0 Mr. Hopkins has returned.\'a0 Fanny speaks constantly of you, & wishes you would return with her Sugar dogs.\'a0 Annie & herself wish you to buy them a doll.\'a0 They have a great many wishes.\'a0 I must now close, in great haste.\'a0 Your attached Mother, E.F.

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have come from church, eaten dinner & will now write to you.\'a0 I received a letter from you this morning dated Dec. 3rd.\'a0 Yesterday I did not hear, which disappointed me greatly.\'a0 But your todays letter pleases me, with the exception that you ought to \ul express\ulnone  a \ul wish\ulnone  to \ul be\ulnone  Governor, for if you \ul wished\ulnone  for \ul success,\ulnone  you would be apt to be successful, though personally you should do nothing, you should get some \ul friends\ulnone  to do for you.\'a0 I am certain if you let your \ul friends\ulnone  interest themselves for you you will be elected.\'a0 Either this, or if you fail here, an office from the President you \ul must\ulnone  have.\'a0 Judge I suppose you are not going to try for, though I would like that too. The letter you mention Mr. Keith would bring, Mr. Hopkins brought to the door.\'a0 I did not see him, but suppose Mr. Keith & himself had come in the Stage together, & Mr. Keith was hurried & begged Mr. Hopkins to deliver the letter.\'a0 Perhaps he did the same with your letter to the Patriot.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage.\'a0 I will write by them again to Anna.\'a0 They remain from one to three weeks in Charleston.\'a0 It will be a good opportunity for Anna to come back, but if she enjoys herself I am willing she should stay longer.\'a0 Mamma got a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday.\'a0 In the beginning she expresses a wish that Anna may arrive that day with Judge Butler who was expected, says Sarah Taylor intended sending for Anna as soon as she heard of her arrival in Columbia, though very feeble, that Mr. Taylor was not in Columbia, & that Eloisa also intended to take charge of her.\'a0 Aunt Eliza said they were thankful Isaac Hayne was reelected , but were still anxious about the office that they were more immediately interested in.\'a0 At the close of the letter, Aunt Eliza says Anna has just arrived looking well & pretty, & she makes Anna sign her \ul name\ulnone  that \ul I\ulnone  may see it.\'a0 I am not worrying about servants.\'a0 When I wrote Eliza had been very impertinent, seated in the kitchen all the time cursing & swearing & abusing me to Becky, refusing to work for Reuben & Charles, & if she did making the clothes so that they \ul ripped \ulnone immediately, not letting Edward work for them & preventing Johnny doing anything for us.\'a0 I called in Becky & told her, Eliza she must not let sit in the kitchen & behave so, for it would make \ul her\ulnone  even disrespectful to me.\'a0 I told Eliza to go up & stay in her room, called Johnny in to wait, & my noticing her conduct has done good.\'a0 Johnny now comes in every day without being called, & I do not hear of Eliza\'92s speaking so impertinently.\'a0 I do think it is\'85to have a character like her in the yd.\'a0 She ruined Lindy, & will her children, but I hope so pious a person as Baylis & as I hope Becky is will soon counteract Eliza\'92s example.\'a0 Becky says she thinks Lindy & Edward are trying to be good.\'a0 Charles is delighted with her, says he does not hear himself cursed & abused as formerly, & gets plenty to eat, even say for to go to his supper.\'a0 I hope our yard will be happier & better now.\'a0 I dare say Becky has faults, & that I will find them out, but I think to be at the head of the servants, she will do much better than Minerva or Lindy.\'a0 I am not \ul worrying\ulnone , except about \ul honors\ulnone  for \ul you\ulnone , & your not \ul warmly\ulnone  \ul interesting\ulnone  yourself to get them, or getting your \ul friends\ulnone  to. I am glad you have become acquainted with Mr. Ravenel.\'a0 He is a \ul good\ulnone  man, an old friend of Mamma\'92s.\'a0 He is a \ul widower\ulnone  who has not \ul forgotten\ulnone  his \ul Wife\ulnone .\'a0 They were attached to each other as children, & she said if she died, she knew he would have to marry again, because he was so \ul domestic\ulnone  but he has not married.\'a0 He has no daughter, only sons.\'a0 His daughter in law keeps house for him.\'a0 One of his sons was engaged to Uncle Arthur\'92s daughter but died. I am pleased at Mr. Thompsons making you a present of boots.\'a0 Keep your money to pay your debts.\'a0 Dr. Irvine has not gone to Florida yet.\'a0 You must get the Black Dye for your Whiskers.\'a0 I think Mr. Cox\'92s at church this morning looked dyed. I am glad you made a good speech.\'a0 When published you must send it to me to read, & you must publish it in the Patriot.\'a0 I would like to have heard you deliver it.\'a0 How does Pinckney McBee come on.\'a0 How sad for Mr. Mauldin to be as he is.\'a0 How afflicted his family must be if true. As you were the originator of the Electoral bill, you ought to make a speech on it.\'a0 You ought to have introduced the bill this Session.\'a0 You must make Mr. Gladden pay you, & you ought to get Mr. Watts to \ul tell\ulnone  Mr. Williams that he ought to pay you the 500 & am surprised he has not paid it. The weather is so warm Mr. Hoke had better not buy any Hogs until it becomes colder.\'a0 We are eating the Beef still.\'a0 I will have one Cow & Calf brought home tomorrow & begin to use the Milk. Mrs. Genl Thompson I believe is not confined yet.\'a0 Mamma thinks she never will be, that it is a mistake, which sometimes happens.\'a0 I know of nothing new at all to tell you, except an Eclectic & the letter from Mr. Hamilton containing the second Check, nothing has come from the Mail for you. Mr. Elford will be in Columbia Tuesday night.\'a0 He told me he heard from you yesterday.\'a0 He came to let me know he was going & would take anything.\'a0 The bells for church are now ringing, & I must stop & get ready to go.\'a0Willie & Frank are going to ride on horseback.\'a0 Willie must in future go with you.\'a0 It improved & benefits him. Do my dear husband if it is only for \ul my\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone , accept any honor that is offered you.\'a0 Do not decline beforehand as you always do.\'a0 Think what gratification it would give me to see \ul you\ulnone  who so well deserve it when no one deserves it so well as you.\'a0 Your Wife, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mamma received a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday, in which at the close\'a0 she mentions your having just arrived, & to prove it she made you sign your name.\'a0 I was much gratified to see it, & to hear you had reached Charleston \ul safely\ulnone , for the late R. Road accidents made me uneasy.\'a0 I appreciate the kindness of your friends in Columbia, & also those in Charleston.\'a0 This visit will be long remembered by you, & afford an interesting subject of conversation for a long time.\'a0 We were all pleased with Aunt Eliza\'92s letter & grateful for the kindness of herself & others near to us. I was in hopes to have received a letter from you by the mornings Mail, but suppose you have not had time to write.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage for Charleston.\'a0 I will write by them, & send you a pr of pantalets & a veil you left & which you may find useful.\'a0 I will also send a bundle of my hair.\'a0 If your Medallion will be wo\'85 to a hair chain, you can have a chain made for yourself suitable for the purpose of getting your cousin Eliza to have it done.\'a0 With the hair that is left I wish a pretty chain made for \ul Willie \ulnone to wear with my watch.\'a0 I intend lending it to Willie.\'a0 If any is left have a chain made for Frank; if not enough for that, a bracelet to give to Fanny hereafter have as many things made out of the hair as it will admit, but I wish them all \ul pretty\ulnone , so if the hair will not allow of it, make only one or two of what I have mentioned.\'a0 These are presents for you to keep always in remembrance of me, & I leave it to your cousin Eliza\'92s taste & judgment to have the hair made in chains & bracelets as far as it will go.\'a0 \ul Read\ulnone  \ul this\ulnone  to \ul her\ulnone .\'a0 You can write to your Papa for what money is necessary.\'a0 Before you return I will write for several things.\'a0Mrs. Elford will be in town one, two or three weeks.\'a0 It will be a very good opportunity for you to return with her.\'a0 Mr. Elford will call & see you, & you may go & see Mrs. Elford.\'a0 Anything Aunt Eliza wishes sent up Mrs. Elford will bring.\'a0 In packing up again, you can put your clothes except your dresses & thick Sashes in the carpet bag & fill your trunk with what you buy.\'a0 I leave to your judgement to get what you need.\'a0 I hope you practice on the Piano, so as not to forget what you have learnt. Give my love to Aunt Mary & tell her she can now perform her promise & give you the Canary birds.\'a0 I would like very much you should have a pair.\'a0 I will help take care of them, & it would delight Fanny & Hext.\'a0 Give my love also to Aunt Anna. Give my love to my Aunts in Logan st.\'a0 Tell my Aunt Har\'85 she must answer my letter & beg my other Aunts also to write.\'a0 I am sorry you missed seeing Aunt Sarah Matthews. Each Aunt remember me kindly to & my friends generally.\'a0 Mrs. O\'92Driscoll you must not forget. When I told Fanny what Aunt Eliza wished she had gone down with you, she said, \'93I would be so glad, I would \ul scream \ulnone not to come back.\'94\'a0 She thinks her dollars you have will buy everything, a doll, & 7 Sugar dogs, a baby house furniture &c. Susan has been almost [every] day, & spent with me.\'a0 We work together, & Annie sometimes stays for the night, but she cries when bedtime comes.\'a0 Vardry & Alex come to the gate, but on account of the prohibitions they come no further. Luther has written to your Aunt Susy to return & says he will be willing to lose if she will return, & sends repeated messages.\'a0 Miss McBee wrote a note saying he was overwhelmed, & she did all she could to comfort him.\'a0 I got a letter from your Papa this morning.\'a0 He says he misses you a great deal, that you were a \ul great\ulnone  comfort to him that he likes always when from home, to have someone near to him he loves.\'a0 I am always better satisfied too to have one of the children with him, to contribute to his happiness, & to their improvement.\'a0 Another time Willie must go, as he used to.\'a0 I think he\'85a great deal, & is one reason why he has such general information; that it has been remarked, there was no subject mentioned, that he was not informed on.\'a0 I am sorry he did not go this time. Frank still goes to school.\'a0 All have holiday but him.\'a0 I am very busy making servants clothes & sewing up\'85for comfortables, which I find are more\'a0 reasonable than blankets.\'a0 I have been out very little since you left. Becky & her husband have prayer meeting every night in their room, which the servants with the exception of Eliza attend.\'a0 I hope there will be a reform in the yard.\'a0 It seems purer already.\'a0 Becky I hope by her example benefit them, more than precept alone can do. Mr. McKay has been prevented by a lame foot from going to town, & does not know when he can go.\'a0 Susan Hoke desired her love to you.\'a0 Said Augustus would go & see you.\'a0 Frank says you must write to him & he will write to you.\'a0 Fanny says you must bring her a head for her large doll.\'a0 The present head is broken.\'a0 She says you must bring her a set of furniture & a Cloak & hat.\'a0 I would like you to get a Worsted Cloak for both Fannie & Annie if they can be got of their sizes, & a hat & bonnet for Fanny.\'a0 If the Drab Beavers are not \ul very\ulnone  \ul dear\ulnone  & are worn, & you like them, perhaps one would be pretty, but I leave it to your taste & Eliza\'92s.\'a0 I wish a worsted Cloak & a hat for Hext.\'a0 Perhaps a Beaver would be pretty for him.\'a0I hope you are behaving well, & performing all of your duties, & never forget that hereafter an account is to be given of all our thoughts, words, & deeds, & that we must pray for help & strength to act\'85, & to\'85even as we ought to, for our hearts by nature are sinful & need a thorough change.\'a0 Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, El\'85 & Sue & W. Ed.\'a0 Write to me & believe me your attached Mother, E.F.P.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have written to Eliza Hayne & Anna by Mr. Elford who goes this evening & I will now write to you.\'a0 My whole time now almost is taken up in writing. You said I might send you a bill of Groceries, so I have made out one which I think you had better give to Mr. Elford to get for us\'a0 at the same time he does for himself.\'a0 It is much better for someone to select them than to leave it to the Grocer.\'a0 I have lost a bill I intended to make it out by.\'a0 I have put down the necessaries, & only a few of the luxuries, not as many if it were summer.\'a0 In the Spring we can get more luxuries.\'a0 We have so many servants we use a great deal of Sugar, so what I have put down is not too much but you can make \ul any\ulnone  \ul alteration\ulnone  you wish.\'a0 We need a pr of fine dogs, a Fender Shovel & Tongs.\'a0 Perhaps Mr. Elford had better get them.\'a0 A \ul neat\ulnone  \ul set \ulnone will do, not the \ul handsomest\ulnone  do I care for.\'a0 Aunt Mary McCall has a box for Susan & myself.\'a0 Mr. Elford will either send it to you to bring, or send it by someone coming \ul before\ulnone  you do or bring it up himself, whichever is the \ul quickest\ulnone  way for we need the box now.\'a0 It contains the only dress I intend to buy for myself this winter, & a bonnet, & a few other things, which I stand in immediate use of.\'a0 I have written to Anna that if she wishes it, she can return with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & save you going down for her, for you will be anxious to get home as soon as the Session is over, & \ul I\ulnone  would like to go down with you in the Spring.\'a0 I would like Anna to be in town a few weeks longer & not return as soon as you do.\'a0 Mr. Elford may return he says in 10 days, or may stay 3 weeks.\'a0 He will go & see Anna, & she will go & see Mrs. Elford.\'a0 Aunt Eliza wrote word that she had wished that Fanny was with Anna.\'a0 It was a pity Anna could not have been with Mrs. Martin sooner in Columbia, & not only the last day; Mrs. Martin intended to have her the whole time, or she & Sarah together have her.\'a0 Mrs. Martin borrowed a house ready furnished. No Mail came today, so of course would not hear from you, but I hope you wrote me a long letter yesterday & that I will get it tomorrow.\'a0 I think of the contents of one letter until I get another.\'a0 The letter yesterday I liked.\'a0 I do hope either the State or the Presidency will give you some Office.\'a0 If you \ul try\ulnone  you will get an Office, but you have to feel an \ul interest\ulnone  in it \ul yourself\ulnone , & get others also to interest themselves also. Edward mentioned at Mamma\'92s that Mr. Sam Mauldin was deranged & had taken Laudanum, because he thought his family all wished to get rid of him.\'a0 So I dare say there is some truth in the rumour you heard. I have not heard from Anna since you mentioned you had seen her off.\'a0 I hope to hear soon from her & also about her from Aunt Eliza, who I am sure will write.\'a0 I dare say she will need more money. This is Sale Day.\'a0 I do not know if many persons are in.\'a0 Mr. Hoke has not bought the Hogs yet.\'a0 The weather is mild & cheerful now.\'a0\'a0\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Lindy\'92s baby is improving.\'a0 She has more time to attend to it, than she used to have.\'a0 When the child gets older we will not need both Charlotte & Lindy.\'a0 I wish Johnny would be put to some trade at once. But I suppose if Eliza\'92s child lives, he will have to mind that.\'a0In these holidays Willie has so little to improve him I wish he was with you.\'a0 In future he always shall go down with you.\'a0 It improved him to associate with gentlemen. I believe I have nothing new to write you.\'a0 I wrote yesterday except the Patriot I have not seen a single paper since you left.\'a0 I have rode out 3 times, & paid not a single visit.\'a0 I am busy all the time at home.\'a0 I will write again tomorrow.\'a0 After hearing from you I have more to write about. I hope the Secessionists will run you for Governor, vote for you & elect you.\'a0 If I were with you, to have urged your acceptance when they first proposed it to you there would have been no difficulty.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F. Perry I enclose the Grocery bill & added a few things I wish Mr. Elford to get, but you can leave out anything you think best, & make any alterations.\'a0 The Calico is for comfortable.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote a long letter to you yesterday, & have just written to Eliza, so can write you only a few lines.\'a0 I send you a veil & a pr of pantalets that I forgot to put up for you, & which you may even now find useful.\'a0 I am anxious to hear how you are, & how you feel, in the \ul City\ulnone , away from those you have always been with from your birth.\'a0 While in Columbia with your Papa, were not seeing him, you knew he was not far off, & did not feel lonely, but now you are even without him.\'a0 I am afraid you feel strangely.\'a0 I dare say by this time however you begin to feel at home, & are passing your time quite pleasantly, & surrounded by so many to whom you can claim relationship, gives you a home feeling.\'a0 I hope to hear a good account of you.\'a0 I would like to know what you have bought for yourself, that I may then determine what other things to get.\'a0 The silver comb if not too dear you must get.\'a0 I suppose one would be got for 3 or 4 dollars & it will last always, will be useful to Fanny after you are done with it.\'a0 Just before you leave I will write for a few presents for Christmas.\'a0 It will be cheaper buying them in town than here, particularly the Candy.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Elford will remain in town one two or three weeks.\'a0 That will be only a little longer than you & Papa will be in Columbia.\'a0 He will be anxious to get home as soon as the Legislature adjourns, & I would be glad for him to be saved the trip to Charleston, so you can if you like it return with Mr. Elford.\'a0 I am certain there will be opportunities constantly offering.\'a0 The Gradys I believe go down with him. It is reported that Mr. Sam Mauldin is quite melancholy & took Laudanum to destroy himself under the idea that his family wished to get rid of him.\'a0 How sad for his wife & children to have him in that state. You must go & see Mrs. Elford if you can & Mary Crayton if she is in town.\'a0 Be a good girl. I am going to have some Ginger nuts made for you, to remind you of home, & send by Mr. Elford if they are nice.\'a0 If you do not receive them, you will know they were not made well enough to send.\'a0 Mr. Elford will send or bring anything.\'a0 Buy the\'85for Becky, & some little present for each servant.\'a0 Inquire the price of dolls ready dressed for Fanny & Annie, & also dolls not dressed.\'a0Be a good girl.\'a0 Mr. Wardel is today fixing the peice to the Piano, Mr. Bacon spoke of.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\

All of aunt Eliza\'92s family are well.\'a0 Aunt Eliza thanks you & mama for letting me come down and begs to be remembered.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received two letters from you this morning. & one from Anna which I will enclose to you.\'a0 I was glad to see the one Anna wrote you.\'a0 I was reading your letter aloud to Willie but when I got in the \ul midst\ulnone  of the \ul scold\ulnone , I stopped \ul horror\ulnone  \ul struck\ulnone , merely glanced at it, went into the rest of the letter, & have not read the scold yet.\'a0 When you know it is my \ul love\ulnone  for \ul you\ulnone , my \ul exalted\ulnone  \ul opinion\ulnone  of your \ul character\ulnone  that is my opinion you surpass even the \'93Father of his Country\'94 that is \ul this\ulnone  \ul feeling\ulnone  that makes me dissatisfied . that you who are so far \ul above\ulnone  others have not received the rewards & honors, that your \ul inferiors\ulnone  have.\'a0 You ought not to \ul scold\ulnone  me, but \ul sympathize\ulnone  with & try & \ul gratify\ulnone  me.\'a0 I must say with the exception of \ul scolding\ulnone  you \ul wife\ulnone  now & then, you are the best \ul husband\ulnone  that ever was.\'a0 You have retained more of the spirit of a \ul Lover\ulnone , than husbands generally do.\'a0 I feel that I am \ul first\ulnone  in your \ul heart\ulnone , & perhaps if I were not quite so confident, it would be better for you, for if I were not, I would be more careful to retain your heart & perhaps would never dare to resort\'a0 to scolding, but now I am so well satisfied of your love, that I try it as I please. My dear husband if you had been in Congress, you would have been the admiration of the United States, & I believe you would then have aspired even to the Presidential Chair, but now what can you attain to nothing at all, & will be never more than a Member of the Legislature, & a Village Lawyer toiling for meat & clothes for his family.\'a0 This is beneath your deserts, your fellow men know it, & therefore they \ul talk\ulnone  of elevating you, but never do, & I cannot help being provoked, but I \ul wont\ulnone  be \ul again\ulnone .\'a0 I will \ul live\ulnone  on \ul hope\ulnone .\'a0 I like Mr. Morgans feeling, & wish the people of Greenville would have heard you.\'a0 You are so well fitted to serve & benefit them, which is the reason I feel grieved when you hint at abandoning your present position.\'a0 You are by nature meant to serve your fellow\'85, Frank Pierces\'92s destiny was meant to be yours, somehow a mistake has been made, & you have not fulfilled your destiny, & I am afraid it is marrying that has prevented it.\'a0 It is the single men that are advanced most easily,\'a0 Mr. King for instance the Vice President.  Last Sunday in church I looked at some of the Wives, & I thought to myself, none have such a husband as I have.\'a0 Mrs. Choice looked so cross & unhappy.\'a0 Mrs. Arthur looked vexed & strange.\'a0 Mrs. Butler Thompson they say has trouble with her husband; Susan at my side had so little to make her happy.\'a0 Mrs. Car\'85 husband & indeed all so different from you.\'a0 It is your \ul superiority\ulnone  that has made me repine.\'a0 I wish you in an enlarged sphere, known & appreciated.\'a0 If you would have been in a City & constantly associated with minds on an equality with your own, you would be \ul happier\ulnone .\'a0 You will call this scolding, but you have brought it forth by \ul scolding\ulnone  \ul me\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Sam Mauldins condition is truly sad.\'a0 I do not think he ought to have been left in the Asylum against his wishes.\'a0 If he is so miserable, even as to destroy himself, he would not be accountable for the act.\'a0 He could be guarded & go at large.\'a0 It seems so sad, to have him in the Asylum, when he is as \ul conscious\ulnone  as he is now.\'a0 He ought to be confined in a room in his own house.\'a0 If he recovers it will make him miserable to think where he has been.\'a0 I am sorry for his Wife & children.\'a0 Mrs. Bollings daughter (Mrs. Childs) Mrs. Westfield told Ann was perfectly deranged, & is in Greenville at her Mothers.\'a0 Mrs. Hugh Stokes is very ill.\'a0 Mr. Joab Maudin is to be married at a sad time.\'a0 Mrs. Mims is getting better, but I heard had not recovered her mind yet,\'a0 Mr. Hillhouse is to be married to Mrs. Clines Sister.\'a0 Mr. W[iiia[m Easley is to be married to Mrs. Tom Sloan\'92s daughter at Pendleton.\'a0 I am \ul glad\ulnone , I hope he will have enough to occupy him at home, & not meddle with the business of others\'a0\'a0 The Easley you had a suit against married in Georgia & has gone to Texas.\'a0 Mrs. Rosemond\'a0 whose sister married an Easley. & cannot bear the Easleys, says they have cheated her sister, says Miss Winn is a \ul bad\ulnone  \ul girl\ulnone ,\'a0 Col. Town[e]s came for your office key yesterday to attend to some business he was concerned in with you, but I was out.\'a0 I see Sam Town[e]s & Campbell back again.\'a0 Tom Butler I hear has moved his family to Mrs. Stones, & Campbell has bought his place & moved to it.\'a0 I am sorry to have such a person on our Farm road.\'a0 Mr. Carson has given up going to California, & bought a Farm on the Saluda river, & going to move there the 1

\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of Jany.\'a0 I am sorry in your Patriot letter you mentioned Dr. \'85lands opinion of California.\'a0 I wish nothing said to discourage the vagrants & ragamuffins from going.\'a0 Mr. Carson I know had not energy enough to go so far.  I will certainly go to Columbia with you next winter, & carry Willie & Anna.\'a0 Hext will then be out of the way, which he is not now as he nurses at night so much he keeps me awake.\'a0 Next Tuesday he will be 18 months old.\'a0 He is quite well, so are all the rest.\'a0 I know of no sickness now in Greenville. The two Cows & Calves are now at home, & today we commenced using the Milk of the one first Calved.\'a0 The short tailed one we expected to kill when fat, Charles says is with Calf, so we will have enough milk. \'a0I will try & live in comfort when you come back.\'a0Mrs. Westfielfd told Ann that at the Mansion house the other night Mr. Cureton said Luther & Mr. Leary were both intoxicated.\'a0 Do not mention it of\'a0 Mr. \ul Leary\ulnone , but if true, how sad.\'a0 He was not at church Sunday, which seems strange, for he is in the village.\'a0 I hope he will not give way, for he is a good man.\'a0 I will tell Willie to try & prepare for college next Fall.\'a0 Hamlin Beattie is 17, Willie only 13, but much smarter I expect than the former. I am glad your arm is so much better.\'a0 I suppose Dr. Kent feels proud of his in a sling, as much so as Genl Shields.\'a0 Nothing comes from the Post office for you.\'a0 I am sorry accidents come so often on the Rail Road.\'a0 Do be careful when \ul you \ulnone come up.\'a0 Take a \ul safe\ulnone  \ul seat\ulnone , & be on your guard.\'a0 Bill is a noble horse & will bring you back with Selim with ease.\'a0 You must try & watch him.\'a0 If my bill of groceries is too large \ul curtail\ulnone  it; leave out \ul anything\ulnone  you wish. The 15

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Willie has just returned from the Post office & with no letter from you, which has disappointed me \ul greatly\ulnone .\'a0 To make up he brought me a letter from Aunt Eliza which contains a most gratifying account of Anna, & which therefore I enclose to you that you may also be gratified at the pleasing [im]pression she has made.\'a0 Though the letter contains nothing to bring tears to the eyes, yet in reading it aloud I had to stop several times.\'a0 These are feelings I suppose peculiar to a parent.\'a0 Any mention made of their children when \ul absent\ulnone  from them affects them, & for the sake of the \ul parent\ulnone , children ought to try & do well.  I am very sorry not to hear from you.\'a0 I dare say the Post Master did not Mail the letter, or you were too busy to write.\'a0 It gives me less to write about, not hearing. Mr. Hoke came over this morning to say, as soon as the weather cleared he would buy the hogs, that next week the moon will be on the \ul increase\ulnone , which will be the time to kill.\'a0 We have not needed Bacon, having Beef enough. & we now have more Milk which is a comfort.\'a0 The Legislature adjourns so soon, that you have not been long enough in Columbia to get tired.\'a0 You must not engage a room at Janney\'92s for me next winter.\'a0 It will be time enough then, & if the weather happened to be very cold & rainy, I might not wish to do down until the Spring, but it seems to me now I would like to go, so as to hear \ul you\ulnone  speak in the Legislature.\'a0 That would be my purpose in going. I hope you will let Anna stay in town until Mr. & Mrs. Elford come up.\'a0 She passes her time so pleasantly there & her friends are so much pleased with her, that two or three weeks will not be too long for her.\'a0 I am sure she will improve.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote to Mamma yesterday & mentions Anna in gratifying terms & was quite affectionate.\'a0 I would like Anna to be in Charleston after Eloisa Martin goes down to see her family. I paid Mr. Hillhouse\'92s bill for Frank today.\'a0 [page torn] Mamma Susan & Ann\'a0 are here & in the room with me, so I cannot write a very long letter.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 Reuben is hauling leaves for the stable.\'a0 I know of nothing new. I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & to see the Patriot today.\'a0 I must now close & write to Aunt Eliza.\'a0 I am glad for \ul her\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone  you voted for Isaac Hayne, & hope Wm Ed will retain his office, for she is kind. Anna will have enough to talk of for a long time.\'a0 How much more important a visit of a girl to town, is than a boy.\'a0 Anna enjoys it more than Willie would have done.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull asked Anna why Willie did not go to town, & she said Willie was quite tired of going down, not very complimentary.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you today, for which I am very thankful, for yesterday I did not hear & was getting uneasy.\'a0 I am pleased at your being made the heroe of the Poem at College Commencement.\'a0 You must get a copy of it for me to read, & publish it in the Patriot. I am sorry for poor Mr. Mauldin.\'a0 Is he really deranged or miserable from taking opium.\'a0 He seems too conscious to be altogether deranged & to be out in the Asylum. But I may be mistaken.\'a0 An old lady named Mrs. Wiliams who sells Butter was here yesterday & seemed to think that the whole family drank, says the Father was a dreadful man, & never drew a sober breath, & at last shot himself, that several brothers killed themselves drinking, & insinuating that all the brothers living drank, but I think this latter suspicion is not true, so only mention it to you.\'a0 Mr. Easley was to have been married last night to Miss Sloan of Pendleton.\'a0 I hope he will now have trouble enough at home to keep him from troubling others.\'a0 Mr. Joab Mauldin is to be married tonight. The Collegiates must have acted very badly at the Commencement ball.\'a0 The Ladies were not rewarded for going so far to attend a Ball. Mrs. Barclay was rather forward I think.\'a0 I heard Mr. Barclay had left her, & she had to take in work.\'a0 I did not know he was dead.\'a0 She is a northern lady.\'a0I received a letter from Anna today.\'a0 She is well & enjoying herself very much she says.\'a0 I wrote to Aunt Eliza that Mr. Elford would be a good opportunity for her to come up, that she would be long enough in town to see all her friends, & not too long to inconvenience her.\'a0 Aunt Eliza\'92s letter about her was gratifying.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote word that Anna was so much altered & improved since her former visit, that if she had entered the room alone, she would not have recognized her, that she thought her quite pretty, & she was sociable. Last night it commenced raining, & today is gloomy & drizzling.\'a0 I rode to Mrs. Stokes yesterday to know if she had engaged her Butter to me, as her servant had said, & Mrs. Stokes said yes.\'a0 The road was so bad.\'a0 I thought of your journey home, & I am afraid you will find the roads after so much rain dreadful.\'a0 You must consider whether it will be best for you to come in the Stage or have the carri[a]ge sent for you.\'a0 If you come in the carri[a]ge you had best if you have heavy baggage send it in the Stage to make the load lighter for the horses.\'a0 If you feel \ul quite\ulnone  \ul well\ulnone , the Stage journey perhaps will be best.\'a0 You will come \ul quicker\ulnone  & save your horses, which the bad roads may injure, as they have heretofore.\'a0My dear husband I think with you that our happiness depends a good deal on ourselves, but some persons have much more to make them happy than others.\'a0 I don\'92t think Mrs. Mauldin now can be happy.\'a0 We who are so blessed in each other, may talk of happiness, but I can mention numbers who I should think were only miserable.  Frank at last has holiday.\'a0 His school broke up yesterday.\'a0 Willie & himself cut wood, not a very \ul elevating\ulnone  employment, but very useful.\'a0 Fanny & Hext are quite well.\'a0 Mr. Lasly paid me a visit yesterday to consult about his house, says he will finish planting Wheat, cut logs, & commence raising the house when you return.\'a0 Dinner is now ready, so I will have to stop. I was very busy, so could not write as soon as usual.\'a0 I will write again tomorrow, & hope to hear from you again.\'a0 I want if possible to write to Anna after dinner. I know of no news to tell you.\'a0 I read the Patriot yesterday, was sorry you had not written on to a later date, later than you had written to me.\'a0 I think the last anecdote might have been left out, but perhaps it would please some tastes.\'a0I have now done dinner.\'a0 Becky this far does well, works well, & makes the servants happy.\'a0 I hope we will find her a comfort.\'a0 The prayer meetings I hope will have a good influence on the servants.\'a0 I have not time to read over my letter.\'a0 I am so anxious to send it to the Post office in time.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received your letter this morning, & was very much pleased to hear from you.\'a0 I would like to write you a long letter, but I have not time now.\'a0 I have been writing to your Papa, & your Grandmama,\'a0 Aunt Susy, Aunt Annie, Fanny & Annie are all in the room, & I cannot collect my ideas well.\'a0 Your Aunt Susy & Annie have .been spending several days & nights with me, & your Grandmama & Aunt Ann come in for the day.\'a0 They as well as myself are gratified to hear that you are behaving well, enjoying yourself, & kindly received by your friends.\'a0 Opportunities are constantly offering up, I expect, so exercise your own wishes about coming back.\'a0 If it is more convenient for you to return \ul before\ulnone  Mr. Elford does, you must. I leave it to you & to Aunt Eliza whose hospitality you must not impose upon.\'a0 Your Papa in his letter today says you must suit your pleasure about returning, & your friends, that it will make no difference to him, if Mr. Elford does not stay longer than he told me he would.\'a0 He seems a good person for you to come back with, but I wish you to do as you & your Aunt think best. I wish you had written me a list of what you had bought, & the prices.\'a0 I was waiting for that to decide what to get myself.\'a0 A small pair of Cuff pins perhaps you had best get, two pr of Gaiters for yourself.\'a0 Have you bought a bonnet? & what kind?\'a0 A dress & the Silver Comb, what is the price of the Comb.\'a0 I wish particularly to know.\'a0 Buy a Cornelian ring for Fanny & Annie such as Fanny had & Mary lost.\'a0 Tell me the price of a bonnet such as little girls of her age wear & a cloak of some kind & a hat & Cloak for Hext such as the old one he wears of Franks, or any other kind.\'a0 I wish some Stockings for Hext & Fanny, two pr of \'85for me to wear in the house, two pr of undersleeves for me to wear to church, two aprons for myself, a pr of Gaiter boots for Fanny, & gloves, but these things I would rather know the price first, before I decide to get them.\'a0 A dress for Fanny to wear to church also I wish, & if you can bring any pretty patterns of Aprons & Sashes for Fanny & Hext you must, & any pretty apron you see for yourself, or Sashe or Sun bonnet & either buy & have made for yourself or bring the patterns; a waist apron if you wish it get.\'a0 When you return home for a long time now, you will need to buy nothing more.\'a0 You will be well supplied for an age to come.\'a0 I am thankful that your Aunt is pleased with your deportment.\'a0 Continue to act as you have done, & when you return set a good example to your brothers & sister. Give my love to Aunt Eliza, El\'85 & Wm Ed.\'a0 Write to me & beg Aunt Eliza & El\'85 also to.\'a0 Your Grandmama & Aunts send their love, & say you will have a great deal to tell on your return.\'a0 I write in great haste.\'a0 Excuse all mistakes & bad writing, & write better than I do.\'a0 Do not follow my example.\'a0 I write every day to your Papa which fatigues me &\'85is talking in the room now, which confuses me.\'a0 Give my love to all of my Aunts & friends, & beg Aunt Mary for the Canary birds. Be a good girl.\'a0 You have a great deal to be thankful for.\'a0 Not many little girls have had such an enjoyment as you have at present.\'a0 It was kind in your Aunt to invite you to stay with her.\'a0 Do not forget to get a present of some kind for your Aunt, to remember you by; one according to your means, & something for Eliza & Sue.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P. P.S. Give Mamma Susan & Anna love to all.\'a0 I will write you about the Candy & Cocoa next week, & also all I wish got.\'a0 I would like to hear the price of what I have mentioned first, but if I if I do not hear soon, will not wait. Your Aunt Susan wishes two aprons of plaid Alpaca or such as your cousin Susan says are worn & a peice of black silk braid to sew round a skirt.\'a0 She wishes strings for the apron.\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter about an hour ago from you.\'a0 A Servant brought it to the door & said, \'93Mr. Jones sends his respects, & sends you this letter.\'94\'a0 I took it & said nothing.\'a0 I knew \ul he\ulnone  had not brought it from \ul you\ulnone  that someone else had brought it, & begged him perhaps to send it to me.\'a0 In your letter you say \ul Dr.\ulnone  \ul Pasley\ulnone  will bring it.\'a0 I did not hear from you yesterday, nor today.\'a0 I mean this morning, no Mail it was said came from beyond Newberry, so I was glad to get the letter this evening.\'a0 I wish you had enclosed Anna\'92s to me.\'a0 She writes such short letters.\'a0 I would like to see all she writes to you.\'a0 Not being accustomed to writing, she finds it difficult to express herself & tell all I wish to hear, but what she does write, she writes well.\'a0 Aunt Eliza\'92s letter was very satisfactory, & she is fastidious & particular. & expects a good deal even from children.\'a0 So approbation from \ul her\ulnone  is worth something.\'a0 This has been a fine day.\'a0 It is getting cold, & by Monday I hope will be good weather to kill hogs.\'a0 Mr. Hoke yesterday bought 10 for you weighing 2306 pounds, some of them about 200 weight, & some a good deal more, but on an average 230 pounds.\'a0 All say it is the cheapest way of getting meat, & everybody seems to have bought.\'a0 Mr. Lasly came today to offer to help kill.\'a0 He & his sons, & offered his daughter to help clean & attend to stuffing Sausages, so we will get assistance from him.\'a0 He says he will be here Monday at daylight.\'a0 We are out of lard so I am very glad to have some soon.\'a0 Lard is selling 15 cts a pd.\'a0Charles has been suffering with Asthma, but is getting better & expects to be well Monday.\'a0 I told Becky to attend to him.\'a0 She said, \'93it was her duty to attend to Charles, for he was a good old man.\'94\'a0 So this shows her to be better disposed than some of our other servants.\'a0 The servants all seem happy now, & they respect Becky. & do not quarrel & abuse each other as they did.\'a0 Even Lindy\'92s child is beginning to thrive.\'a0 There is no complaint of not having enough to eat.\'a0 I dare say in consequence, that the eating will \ul cost\ulnone  a great deal more than heretofore, but I know you will not object.\'a0 Susan this week spent several days & nights with me.\'a0 It was quite unexpected.\'a0 She came in to pass the day, & I felt so sorry for her, & knew it would be a relief to Ann to have her away, that I told her to stay for the night.\'a0 She, Annie, & Susy, so she staid three or four nights, & went back to Mamma\'92s this morning to see Vardry & Alex.\'a0 Mamma & Ann have dined with me three days so I have not been lonely this week.\'a0 I feel so sorry for Susan.\'a0 She has had a hard fate.\'a0 She is sensitive & ill fitted to endure the trials she had.\'a0 If she had been differently constituted perhaps she might, but as it is, I know of no one more to be pitied.\'a0 She said she enjoyed being with me, that I had everything to make me happy, that if it were not sinful, one might almost be envious of me.\'a0 When I think that it was just something in my person & manners that struck \ul an\ulnone  old \ul Bachelors\ulnone  \ul fancy\ulnone , I realize how accidental our fates in life are. Susan has helped me a great deal in my work.\'a0 I have been trying to make the house look more comfortable, particularly the two rooms where we sit for the winter.\'a0 I have had them whitewashed & new curtains put up.\'a0 The Sofa Mr. Wardell has finished looks very comfortable.\'a0 It will suit you exactly to lounge on these winter evenings.\'a0 The new Carpet on the Staircase & Entry looks very pretty.\'a0 These improvements were so unexpected.\'a0 My money has not held out, but as Minerva\'92s wages this year I have spent for you.\'a0 I know you will not begrudge returning as much of that money as I need.\'a0 Another year Minerva\'92s wages will appropriate expressly for my clothes & to buy things for the house I wish, & you do not care for.\'a0 This year I have spent it for every purpose but myself.\'a0 In Jan[uar]y you will receive Bank Interest which will help you to pay your debts.  Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.\'a0 He inquired after you.\'a0 He says he went down on the R[ail] Road with Col. Dawkins last summer I think, & he was drunk the whole time.\'a0 His bold, vain aspiring Northern Wife I dare say has made him miserable.\'a0 She does not love him for himself, & therefore she wishes to gratify his vanity, that he should have honors & distinctions.\'a0 She has met with \ul more\ulnone  than her \ul deserts\ulnone  in marrying him & therefore she ought to be satisfied.\'a0 She ought to think that she was once a Music Teacher working for her bread, & now she has an independent fortune.\'a0 The bench must have been little in demand, so \ul few\ulnone  Candidates, & such \ul inferior\ulnone  ones.\'a0 I believe truly \ul you\ulnone  would have been elected.\'a0 The State is beginning to \ul appreciate\ulnone  you; if it does not, I hope the \ul President\ulnone  will.  Genl Thompson today sent for your office key to look at a\'85this afternoon.\'a0 I went to the office to shut it, & I saw Rices Digest open at a page relating to property given to children.\'a0 Mrs. Thompson is not confined yet.\'a0 I hope she will not be disappointed.\'a0 Perhaps the Legislature will not adjourn the 15
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub .\'a0 I almost wish you were coming in the Stage.\'a0 I am afraid the roads are so bad you will find the travelling in the carri[a]ge tedious, & the horses will get injured.\'a0 Mr. Elford would have gone down in his carri[a]ge but for the roads.\'a0 I do not wish you to follow my advice, \ul contrary\ulnone  to your judgement, but I wish you to inquire on the subject, & find out whether the Stage with the night traveling, or the carri[a]ge & horses with the risk of injuring horses is best, or whether the road from Cokesbury or from Laurens is best.\'a0 Mr. Arthur says the road from Cokesbury \ul generally\ulnone  travelled is \ul very\ulnone  \ul bad\ulnone , that there is a more private one that is better.\'a0 The Mails are so irregular.\'a0 I hope the letter in which you \ul tell\ulnone  me, how you have determined to come, will come directly to hand without any delay.\'a0 If it does not, it will be bad.\'a0 Only twice however the Mails have failed, though several times I have received no letter, but I suppose you did not write.  Except to hear \ul you\ulnone  \ul speak\ulnone , I would not care to be in Columbia during the Session.\'a0 The weather is so unpleasant, & the house so filled with ladies all seeking pleasure, but I think I will go next winter to hear you speak.\'a0 This Spring I would like to go to Charleston, when you go to Columbia, & if we are out of debt & have plenty of money, this summer we can go to the North.\'a0 You must send me a copy of your speech, \'93the Speech of the Session.\'94\'a0 I will read it with more interest now in your absence than when you are with me.\'a0 I hope you will soon have it published in the Patriot. I thought Anna would have to send for more money.\'a0 She will not have to buy anything again for a long time.\'a0 Going away from home, the softer sex require so many things to make them neat & comfortable, that they can at home do without, that it makes it quite expensive, but she is well fitted up & will need nothing more for some time.\'a0 I thought she would send for more than 10 dollars. Fanny says she longs for you to come back, but after you come back she will be sorry.\'a0 I asked her why.\'a0 She said because she would have to go \ul out\ulnone  of \ul my\ulnone  room, & sleep in the big room.\'a0 She already says Anna when she comes back must go up to bed with her after supper.\'a0Hext is well, & when I ask where Papa is, holds up his hand as if to say \ul gone\ulnone .\'a0 Willie & frank are well.\'a0 I have rode out three times, & been to church each Sunday, the rest of the time busy at home. I hope to hear tomorrow, if so I will write more.\'a0 You ought to have told me what you thought of the Grocery bill.\'a0 At this moment I hear the singing in Becky\'92s room.\'a0 Mr. Arthur says he does not approve of it.\'a0 I am sure I do, & hope it will bring religion near to the servants, make them feel its importance, & lead them in the way they should go.\

My dear husband.\'a0 The Mail this morning came very late, owing I suppose to the bad roads, to my \ul great\ulnone  \ul disappointment\ulnone  \ul no\ulnone  \ul letter\ulnone  has come from \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 One from Anna, & one from Aunt Mary McCall I received.\'a0 I think you must have written, but the Post master in Columbia has neglected sending it.\'a0 Tomorrow no Stage comes, so I cannot hear until Tuesday, & if you then write for the carri[a]ge, it may be too late for it to meet you.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says he thinks\'a0 the roads are too bad for a carri[a]ge to get along at all.\'a0 I wish you to come the way you prefer, but I hope you will come in the Stage.\'a0 It seems to me that will be the best way on account of the roads both for you & the horses, but if you write for the carri[a]ge I will send it, if the letter comes in time.\'a0 I am going after church to dine at Mamma\'92s so have to write to you now.\'a0 I am so sorry I did not hear from you.\'a0 I am afraid you were spending your evening so pleasantly with some of those bold ladies, it made you forget your Wife; perhaps Becky Sharpe you got introduced to. I have written to Mr. Elford to buy us a set of common knives for every day use.\'a0 Our old knives are lost & worn out, & the new set is too handsome for every day, & would soon get ruined, a common Butter knife I also begged him to get.\'a0 You\'a0 must bring us \ul nothing\ulnone  \ul at\ulnone  \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 Anna will bring us something.\'a0 Charleston is a cheaper place than Columbia.\'a0 The little things you get for the childrenare expensive & useless, so bring back nothing but \ul yourself\ulnone .\'a0 I must write to Anna now.\'a0 She says she enjoys herself \ul more\ulnone  than she expected, & that she will come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & that \ul I\ulnone  must write & tell \ul you\ulnone  so that I can make you understand better than she can, that she is not to go to Columbia & meet you, & come up with you, but she will come \ul all\ulnone  the \ul way\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  with Mr. & Mrs. Elford. I hope you will be careful on the R Road & take a safe scarf & wrap yourself up warm. I will now conclude.\'a0 I remain Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry I am glad you now like my letters.\'a0 \ul I\ulnone  like \ul you\ulnone  cannot bear to be \ul scolded\ulnone , especially by a husband.\'a0 The next time you begin, I will call in one of the servants & let you finish on one who \ul deserves \ulnone it.\'a0 But you think you are so certain of my \ul heart\ulnone , you can \ul impose\ulnone  on it, but you must not venture too far. If I had heard from you this morning I could have written you another sheet.\'a0 Now I have nothing more to write about, except to add I love you.\'a0 E.F.P. Anna\'92s letter today was a long one, a whole sheet.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I had written a long letter & sent it to the Post office & wrote I had \ul not\ulnone  heard from you, when Mr. Beattie sent me \ul two\ulnone  letters.\'a0 I can now only acknowledge them, for I expect Susan every moment to come from church & carry me to Mamma\'92s\'85I now hear the carri[a]ge. I know the sugar was more than we use, but it is economy to get a large quantity at \ul one\ulnone  \ul time\ulnone .\'a0 The barrels & commissions cost as much if they are \ul small\ulnone , as if they are large.\'a0 I thought & knew the Sugar would not last more than a year.\'a0 We have 14 servants.\'a0 We use more than a pound of Brown Sugar every day for them, more than a pound of white for ourTea & Coffee each day.\'a0 The loaf Sugar was for company, the Clarified for cake, the powdered for icing.\'a0 This was the reason there was such a variety. Susan has come & gone, & I must now get ready, for when the carri[a]ge comes back.\'a0 I will write again tomorrow.\'a0Mr. Brown was not the Soul of Honour as I had thought.\'a0 I am glad you are coming up with Mr. Duncan, but think you would find it pleasanter on account of the bad roads to come in the Stage.\'a0 Yours truly, E.F.P.\

\cf0 I have just written a long letter to Eliza Hayne, & am \ul tired\ulnone  writing, but will go on & write my daily letter to you.\'a0 Tomorrow I will write again, & then I will have a long rest, which I will be glad of, for writing takes up so much of my time I can do very little else now. I wrote in a great hurry yesterday after receiving the two letters by Mr. Beattie. Aunt Mary McCall has a box in town for us waiting to send.\'a0 I am so sorry I did not tell her to send it to Columbia, & you would have sent it on by someone.\'a0 It contains my winter clothes, but it will be so late before I get it, they will be my \ul next\ulnone  winter clothes, instead of this.\'a0 Mr. McKay was to have brought it up, & after all he has never gone.\'a0 Mr. Elford now will take charge of it, or it will come by Express.\'a0 I hoped to have saved money enough out of what you left me to help pay for them, but I have not been able to, so \ul you\ulnone  must be so good as to \ul lend\ulnone  me the money out of the Bank Interest you will receive in January, & I will give you Minerva\'92s wages as they are paid me, until I return you all.\'a0 I am sorry I did not keep Minerva\'92s wages this past summer to clothe myself with, but you were pressed for money, & so I spent it for you, which you must remember.\'a0 But I would rather feel \ul independent\ulnone  in this respect, & in\'a0 future I will not place myself in the situation I am now have to ask you for money for \ul myself\ulnone .\'a0 It makes me feel mean & sometimes the bills are higher than I expect, as it is in the present case, & then I am afraid you will \ul scold\ulnone  me, but you must \ul not\ulnone .\'a0 If you \ul do\ulnone , I will come down upon you about \ul Governor\ulnone  & \ul Judge\ulnone  & \ul President\ulnone  of the \ul United States\ulnone , & perfectly \ul overwhelm\ulnone  you.\'a0 But in future I intend to buy my clothes, & pay for them without \ul your\ulnone  knowing anything about it.\'a0 Last winter I bought nothing, so this winter I had to buy something, so sent to town,\'a0 but they will only come in time to be ready for me \ul next\ulnone  \ul winter\ulnone  when I go to Columbia with you. The hogs are being killed today.\'a0 The whole household is at the river except El\'85, Lindy\'92s baby & myself.\'a0 We still have some Stake & some corn beef, but we are all tired of it.\'a0 I hope to have a plenty for you to eat on your return of Sausages, Spare ribs &c. Willie says Mr. Memminger & his family were at church yesterday, I suppose on their way down.\'a0 Eliza Hayne said Mr. Memminger had a daughter sick like Ann, cannot sleep at night &c. You must find Janney\'92s far pleasanter than Maybins.\'a0 I am glad the Society is so pleasant there. \'a0I will take for \ul granted\ulnone  all the \ul sentiment\ulnone  & \ul love\ulnone  you would like to \ul express\ulnone  in your letters, & which I know is in your \ul heart\ulnone .\'a0 You are in Columbia to attend to \ul business\ulnone , & if you \ul let\ulnone  me occupy you instead, it would be to the detriment of the \ul State\ulnone , of which \ul you\ulnone  are the \ul chief\ulnone  \ul guardian\ulnone .\'a0 If your watchful eye is moved for one instant, the State suffers; so I do not wish to interfere. I thought you were going to run Mr. Elford for Clerk of the House.\'a0 Mr. Dean perhaps being a Member could more readily be elected.\'a0 It requires a person either to be, or have been a Member of the Legislature to be elected to office.\'a0 It is a great advantage.\'a0 Several wives have been gratified unexpectedly this Session.\'a0 Mrs. Dean, Mrs. Glover, & a \ul future\ulnone  Mrs. Evans, \ul one\ulnone  \ul other\ulnone  \ul Wife\ulnone  I \ul would\ulnone  name, who would like to be \ul gratified\ulnone  in the \ul same\ulnone  \ul way\ulnone , all she begs of her husband is when opportunities \ul offer\ulnone  to \ul advance\ulnone  himself, \ul not\ulnone  \ul to\ulnone  \ul decline\ulnone  it.\'a0 The husbands may be indifferent to these things, but the \ul Wives\ulnone  \ul never\ulnone  are. I am sorry yourself, Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford have so misunderstood my Grocery bill.\'a0 I knew the Sugar was \ul more\ulnone  than enough for \ul one\ulnone  year, but I thought it would be more economical to send for a \ul large\ulnone  quantity.\'a0 It saves commissions, barrels, drayage &c. , & we would not have to send for Groceries for a long time again. I am sorry it should have lead to a worse opinion of our servants characters than they deserve.\'a0 Reuben stole a ham, & I dare say, he steals your Corn, & steals our wood & sells for himself, & Mary has stolen my clothes, but the other servants I have no reason to suspect, & hardly think Mary will do the same again.\'a0 I am sorry Mr. Elford should think me so careless a housekeeper, & such a \ul fool\ulnone  as not to \ul lock\ulnone  up the Sugar that the simplest child would know ought to be done.\'a0 If my storehouse had groceries in it, I would never let anyone go in but myself, but it never had lard, only House Salt & such things, that it was not necessary for me to go always to take out.\'a0 So tell Mr. Elford I think as he does if Sugar was not locked up, it would go twice as fast, & if \ul Corn\ulnone  was locked up, it would last \ul twice \ulnone as long.\'a0 I know of nothing new & Hext has come now to be nursed, so I must stop, & close my letter without reading it over.\'a0 The weather is cloudy & cold.\'a0 I hope you will have a pleasant journey home the roads not impassable. I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & every day till you return.\'a0Willie & Frank are busy with the hogs.\'a0 Make Mr. Gladden & Mr. Hill pay you, & tell Mr. Watts to remind Mr. Williams of his promise.\'a0I will now close.\'a0 Your attached Wife, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you this morning, & am very glad to hear from you.\'a0 I have written to you very often.\'a0 I would have written oftener, but every day I write one letter to your Papa & sometimes two.\'a0 The Mail sometimes brings \ul no\ulnone  letter.\'a0 I write & \ul tell\ulnone  so, & afterwards, some gentleman sends me a letter \ul they\ulnone  have brought, & then I have to write again to say I \ul have\ulnone  heard.\'a0 I have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read.\'a0 This is a gloomy, cold day, & I think it will cheer them up, to hear a little news from Charleston.\'a0 Vardry & Alex are over there.\'a0 Alex has the Measles.\'a0 Vardry will be glad to hear about his knife & Sugar dogs that you have not \ul forgotten\ulnone  him, but I think a \ul knife\ulnone  a dangerous present for so little a boy.\'a0 You had better bring him something else.\'a0 If you can think of something better, a Story book he would like.\'a0 He is fond of hearing stories read, buy some suitable play thing he would like, a little wagon or something of that kind.\'a0 Annie will be glad of the Doll.\'a0 You had better bring both hers & Fanny\'92s \ul ready\ulnone  \ul dressed\ulnone , buy a \ul large\ulnone  \ul head\ulnone  for the \ul large\ulnone  \ul doll\ulnone , the largest you can find I expect will not be too large.\'a0 The present head is broke, & a head for the other body that once had a China head also get.\'a0 That one will be small & not cost much & will do for Fanny to play with \ul every\ulnone  \ul day\ulnone .\'a0 The doll ready dressed Fanny will use only on particular occasions.\'a0 The large doll is to teach you how to work, & as the body costs so much, it is a pity for it to be without a head, which is the reason I wish you to bring a head for it.\'a0 If your money gives out, get Aunt Eliza to lend you, & I will return it when I send money to pay for what I yesterday wrote Eliza to buy for me, or after your Papa can be done without, that it still takes a great deal more money than one at first supposes.\'a0 Now in town, it is such a good opportunity to buy what cannot be got here, & there is so much to tempt, that I am willing to gratify you \ul now\ulnone , knowing you will be willing to deny yourself hereafter.\'a0 The new bonnet you have bought will last a long time this winter, next summer & next winter you can wear it.\'a0 I am sorry your Cloak has not been made before.\'a0 You ought to have had it soon after your arrival, for the weather has been such as to make you need it.\'a0 I hope it is now made; it must be very pretty material, & your bonnet must be\'a0 very pretty also.\'a0 Tell your cousin Eliza she must get \ul me\ulnone  a pretty one.\'a0 I \ul wish\ulnone  you to get a \ul new\ulnone  \ul dress\ulnone , & am sorry you did not get it immediately after your arrival.\'a0 You ought to have had it to wear visiting among your friends, & you must get it \ul now \ulnone & have it made up \ul soon\ulnone , so it may be of use to you before you leave.\'a0 I wish it for your \ul dress\ulnone  \ul frock\ulnone  all winter.\'a0 A bonnet for Fanny like yours will be pretty, & if you can find a Worsted Cloak large enough for her, get it.\'a0 I intended buying one for Annie, but Susan has had a Cloak altered for her, which will answer for the winter, & she says she prefers my giving her something else. What was the \ul price\ulnone  of your Silver Comb?\'a0 I hope Eliza will write to me soon.\'a0 I have been expecting a letter from Aunt Eliza.\'a0 Ask her why she does not write.\'a0 I am glad you are enjoying yourself so much, & meet the approbation of your Aunts.\'a0 Tell Aunt Anna Hayne I am \ul gratified\ulnone  at her good opinion of you.\'a0 Icey Frank as soon as he was aware he had curls begged me to cut them off, as they were too girlish for him, that he is not the pretty \ul curly\ulnone  \ul headed\ulnone  \ul boy\ulnone  as she may see from his likeness, but a fine looking handsome manly boy, & his \ul appearance\ulnone  even if he does not \ul deserve\ulnone  it makes him a favorite with everyone.\'a0 Tell her the likenesses did justice to none of the children but you.\'a0 That Willie is a smart sensible boy, useful & manly, drives us, & hauls wood, & cuts wood, & then comes in the house & reads, but still has that mischievous temper that will indulge itself in teasing & playing.\'a0 He means no harm by it.\'a0 He is alive to the ridiculous, & has a satirical vein, which your Grandmama thinks he inherits from her family, and he cannot help amusing himself with his brothers & sisters but as he grows older he gets better, & your Papa says he is a good boy, & he is no flatterer.\'a0 Fanny is warm hearted & affectionate, lively, & your Papa says the \ul prettiest\ulnone  & \ul smartest\ulnone  of \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 She yesterday said, \'93if I die \ul first\ulnone , I give all my play things to Anna.\'94\'a0 She says she longs for you to return.\'a0 She came out of the kitchen this morning very much offended Becky had turned her out.\'a0 The Lard is drying in the kitchen & it is crowded & confused, & it is no place for her, so Becky was right, but she came in crying, & asked me if Papa had \ul given\ulnone  the children to Becky. & if Dr. Irvine had built that kitchen for even Priscilla had told her to go out.\'a0 Hext is today 18 months old, a baby yet, for he is not weaned, & nurses at night more than ever.\'a0 His eye is almost well.\'a0 At least his eyebrow there will be a little mark always on his eyebrow, but it will not be observed.\'a0 He is quite well.\'a0 Priscilla was here doing nothing, & in the way, so yesterday you Grandmama was here, & I told her she had better ask Mrs. Irvine to let her stay with her, so she did, & Mrs. Irvine said she might & this morning she went over.\'a0 She can bring in wood & wait on your Aunt Annie & come in on messages, & I hope will be useful.\'a0 Catherine is of no use at all except to mind her Mothers child, & yet your Grandmama pays 1 dollar a month for her & is obliged to, while she keeps B\'85.\'a0 Mary minds Isaac.\'a0 If Mama parts with \'85 & can get no one better, I am going to let her have Lindy.\'a0 As Becky is here, we have more servants than we can afford, so will hire out Lindy to your Grandmother for \ul less\ulnone  than to anyone else, so I hope she will do well, for it will be well for her to have a \ul family\ulnone  servant there, & one who cares for her, & make up to us the expense of buying Becky, which was very unexpected.\'a0 Lindy still has Rheumatism in her feet, but is able to work, & by Spring I hope will be able to go to your Grandmama\'92s.\'a0 I received two letters from your Papa today.\'a0 He says the Legislature may not adjourn until Friday.\'a0 He says he is anxious to return home to see his Wife & children who he loves better than fame, honors, distinction, property or anything besides, that though he has been passing his time very pleasantly, after \ul two\ulnone  weeks\'85he always gets homesick.\'a0 He mentions having heard from you.\'a0 Your visit to the City must not make you discontented with the country, but on your return you must contribute your share towards the happiness of the \ul home\ulnone  \ul circle\ulnone .\'a0 Your Papa had received a large box from town.\'a0 Your have seen Mrs. Elford I expect\'85your clothes.\'a0 E.F.P.\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just written a long letter to Anna & am tired, but will now write to you.\'a0 I was very glad to receive two letters from you today, & one from Anna.\'a0 I read Anna\'92s to you.\'a0 She writes well, & Aunt Anna Hayne tel[l]ing her to write me word; that she did credit to her parents, is \ul worth\ulnone  \ul something\ulnone , for Aunt Anna is \ul very\ulnone  \ul particular\ulnone  about the behaviour of children, expects \ul more\ulnone  from them, than anyone I know of.\'a0 Anna asks after Hexts eye.\'a0 She ought to say his eyebrow.\'a0 Frank one day in the yard accidentally struck him on his eyebrow, & it bled, but only for a little while, & is now quite well.\'a0 I explain, for you might wonder what Anna alluded to.\'a0 I am glad she enjoys herself so much.\'a0 I was afraid she would be homesick.\'a0 Her visit will be attended with expense, but I dare say it will be of permanent benefit to her, & she will be improved & so many relations I have in town ought to see the children to feel an interest in them.\'a0 What Anna has bought will last her \ul next\ulnone  winter.\'a0 I have written to her that there is so much to tempt her wishes, if they are gratified now, she must be willing to deny herself hereafter.\'a0 I think she will need more money.\'a0 If you would send her some just before you leave Columbia, I would be pleased, & it would please \ul her\ulnone  to be so thoughtfully remembered by her Father.\'a0 She will not for a long time again cause us so much expense.\'a0 I am glad you have received a box.\'a0 I hope it is the one from Aunt Mary McCall.\'a0 I would wish you to send it in the quickest way, for I ought to have had it weeks ago.\'a0 I have not made a single winter article of clothing yet.\'a0 Can it not come \ul immediately\ulnone  by the Stage.\'a0 Write on the box that it must be sent by the Stage.\'a0 If you have not sent it yet, or do not until you come, be sure to bring it. If it cannot come in Mr. Duncan\'92s carri[a]ge, send it by someone coming in the Stage.  am very much pleased at the good opinion the Members have of you.\'a0 It is only for you to be \ul known\ulnone  to be \ul appreciated\ulnone  at a distance your character is not understood, but those who know you best, respect you most.\'a0 It requires but very little exertion on your part to be rewarded with the honors others get, for I think the prejudice against you is passing away.\'a0 I hope your friends will still as they proposed show their estimate of your character by voting for you for Governor.\'a0 I do not expect you to be elected.\'a0 It will please me though for you to receive votes.\'a0 It will make them think of you \ul another\ulnone  time. Yesterday the hogs were killed.\'a0\'a0 Today Mr. Lasly & his daughter are helping cutting the meat, drying the Lard &c.\'a0 The daughter did not come in yesterday.\'a0 I thought she was at the river when I wrote to you.\'a0 The servants are all busy.\'a0 Mr. Lasly seems very obliging.\'a0\'a0 I have been several times to the L\'85 house since I have been writing to you.\'a0 He says we ought to have 10 Cans of Lard, but I do not think so.\'a0\'a0 Charles says we ought to have had Becky 10 years ago, that he likes her, so do all the servants. \'a0I have not yet seen any cause to regret buying her.\'a0 Lindy did not answer, even when she tried her best.\'a0 The servants did not respect her, so it was one constant state of confusion & Minerva who we would have been obliged to take home, makes everybody unhappy about her.\'a0 Lindy in the Spring we must hire out.\'a0 We now have plenty of Milk.\'a0\'a0 We milk three Cows, the last one only commenced today.\'a0 This winter we can either churn, or have rich Milk, Syllabub, Custard &c.\'a0 We will have plenty of Meat, Sausages, spareribs &c.\'a0 The parsnips in the Garden Becky cooks delightfully, so when you return, we will live better than when you left, particularly after our Groceries come.\'a0 If Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford let you get any Sugar, & I lock it up, so the servants cannot steal it. Today is cold, rainy, & gloomy.\'a0 The weather has not been suitable for cleaning the yard, scouring &c.\'a0 I will be almost glad the Legislature should sit a little longer, to allow you more time to pass important bills for the reformation of the State, & the Equality of the Upper county, & allow me more time to clean the house for your reception.\'a0 It is cold.\'a0 I can hardly write.\'a0 Hext wants me, & the children are making a noise.\'a0 I will be so glad not to have to write so much when you come back.\'a0 It takes up so much time & fatigues me, so that I can hardly do anything after but rest, but for your comfort I write every day.\'a0 
\f2\i \'a0
\f0\i0 I hope you dined with your old friend Mr. Hearn.\'a0 In inviting the Greenville Delegation, I think Pinckney McBee ought always to be excepted, for he would be out of his place, & would not even enjoy it, & does not deserve it either, so I hope he is not included.\'a0 I have not heard yet of Mrs. Thompsons being confined.\'a0 I am glad you have dyed your Whiskers.\'a0 I expect your look five years younger.\'a0 You ought to have done it when you first went down. Anything that adds to your comfort, convenience, & good looks, you must get. Be sure to bring the box with you or send it by the Stage.\'a0 I will be very glad to see you.\'a0 The weather is getting bad so cold cloudy & rainy, but I hope it will clear before you set off.\'a0 Be careful & not get hurt on the R[ail] Road. Hext if he has forgotten you, will soon remember you.\'a0 He calls Charlotte Oh Da, & when he is in my lap, & I say Oh Da come & take Hext, he clings close to me.\'a0I thought you were going to buy a new W[h]ig, but perhaps the present one will do until you go the North & get one there. I must now close.\'a0 I wish you could go & see Col. & Mrs. Preston before you leave.\'a0 If so give all of our love to you. I write in a great hurry & will write until you set off to come home.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\'a0\

My dear husband\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you & I cannot help saying, I feel \ul very\ulnone  \ul sorry\ulnone  when you are so respected by the Members, & appreciated by them that you should not aspire to some of the \ul honors\ulnone  in their gift.\'a0 Why do they elect such \ul inferior\ulnone  persons to office as Mr. \ul Glover\ulnone  & \ul Manning\ulnone , & not elect \ul you\ulnone  who are superior to them.\'a0 I believe if you \ul wished\ulnone  it they would elect you, & you ought to have been elected Judge.\'a0 The 3000 a year would be a certain income which you rarely ever make.\'a0 This Session you seem to have been better treated than usual, & you ought to have tried for something.\'a0 You seem to be more popular \ul out\ulnone  of your District now, than \ul in\ulnone  it, & I wish it was \ul known\ulnone  in \ul Greenville\ulnone , how well others think of you, for I wish everybody in Greenville where you live, to respect & look \ul up\ulnone  to you.\'a0 I will live on hope that \ul you\ulnone  will not always be \ul excepted\ulnone  in the distribution of honors, but it is your own fault, even Jones got what he tried for. This is another gloomy, rainy, cold day.\'a0 The roads will be dreadful.\'a0 It has given me no chance of cleaning the house & yard, which need it much.\'a0 I wished everything to look \ul nice\ulnone  for your return.\'a0 Even the washing cannot be done in this weather, which makes us very uncomfortable, having to do without handkerchiefs, towels &c.\'a0 This is no weather to leave home, at least for ladies, so much as I would like to hear you speak in the Legislature, I do not expect to go down, unless it is to see you \ul inaugurated\ulnone .\'a0 I hope the \ul Secessionists\ulnone  \ul voted\ulnone  for \ul you\ulnone , & another time that they will elect you.\'a0 It is strange there have not been more Candidates this time for Judge & Governor. The servants say Mrs. Thompson was confined Sunday night & has a \ul Son\ulnone .\'a0 I suppose it was in expectation of that, Genl Thompson was looking in Rice\'92s Digest at laws respecting property given to children. Mr. Rosemond yesterday sent some Lumber for the kitchen. Four Cans of Lard were dried yesterday, & five or six more there will be.\'a0 That alone at the price Lard is selling 15 cts a pd, is more than 60 dollars.\'a0 The Kentucky Hogs are so fat.\'a0 In future I would prefer buying a few of them expressly for Lard, the rest\'85meat.\'a0 We will have a good many Sausages.\'a0 The servants are stuffing them today.\'a0 We got a machine from Mr. Rutledge which \ul grinds\ulnone  the meat \ul fine\ulnone  instead of chopping it.\'a0 We gave Mr. Lasly some of the Back bones, Spare ribs &c.\'a0 He & two sons were here the first day; he & his daughter the second.\'a0 I would not have had him the second day, but Reuben said he himself would be obliged to haul wood, but it rained & he did not.\'a0 Mr. Lasly has 10 children, the youngest 7 months old.\'a0 They are too large a family for our small Farm.\'a0 I think he has made a \ul good\ulnone  \ul bargain\ulnone .\'a0 He ought to have \ul paid\ulnone  for the house himself. I wish you had sent me all of Anna\'92s letters she wrote you.\'a0 I would like to read them.\'a0 Letters are my chief comfort when those I love are absent.\'a0 My disappointed hopes make me unhappy for a while, but I get over it & hope on.\'a0 I now look to favors from the President for you.\'a0 I may not write again.\'a0 I suppose tomorrows letter will tell me when the Legislature adjourns.\'a0 If you do not hear from me again, you may know it is that I have not written, thinking you will leave Columbia before the letter reaches there. I do not suppose one wife besides myself has written to her husband every day as I have.\'a0 I assure you it interferes with my duties.\'a0 I am obliged often to send Hext away crying because he disturbs me, & after writing I am fatigued & unfit for cutting out work & sewing so it makes me waste my time which is precious, for there is sewing still to do for servants & children, & Eliza being near confinement, often feels unwell & has done nothing for me for weeks.\'a0 As for myself I have not done the first stick, & what I most need is in the box that has been sent to you & which I hope you will soon send up, or bring up with you.\'a0 I give up all to you, as my first wish is that \ul you\ulnone  should be happy, & if I do not write every day, I know you will be uneasy.\'a0 I wish your mind also kept calm & quiet so you can attend to your Legislative duties.\'a0 Since Mr. Memminger is away, I expect you are the most important member in the house. This is dreadful weather, so cold & cheerless, & raining slowly which makes the roads & yards so muddy.\'a0 I am glad you have heard from Mr. Livingston.\'a0 I was thinking the books had failed, & no more numbers would be forthcoming.\'a0 Nothing comes from the Post office for you.\'a0 I suppose it is known you are away from home. Charles this morning was speaking of Becky in such a satisfied manner, that I told him if \ul Baylis\ulnone  & \ul Peggy\ulnone  were out of the way, I believe he would try for Becky.\'a0 He laughed \ul immoderately\ulnone , & said if he was young he did not know what he would do.\'a0 He told Willie Mr. Dean was going to move into the village where Mr. Bacon has been living, so Peggy would be nearer.\'a0 He will be saved his long walks.\'a0 I hope you will have a safe & pleasant journey home & pleasanter weather than we now have. I will now conclude.\'a0 My hands are cold & go to the fire & warm.\'a0 I hope to hear every day until you return.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P. P.S.\'a0 I wish Willie had gone with you.\'a0 He always improves when with you.\'a0 I wish there were better schools than in Greenville.\'a0 The Baptist College is a poor affair.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you this morning, & also one from Eliza.\'a0 I received one from your Papa.\'a0 He leaves Columbia tomorrow morning, so I am not to write to him again & will be able now to write longer letters to you.\'a0 I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.\'a0 If you do not come home by Christmas, you will lose \ul nothing\ulnone , for you know at that time the servants having \ul holiday\ulnone , we live in \ul less\ulnone  \ul comfort\ulnone  than any other part of the year.\'a0 It reminds me of the way we are living at \ul present\ulnone .\'a0 This week Mr. Hoke bought some hogs for us, which have been killed, & instead of living in \ul abundance\ulnone  as one would think, we almost starve, & have our meals \ul irregular\ulnone , all the servants being engaged drying Lard, cutting up Sausage meat, cleaning feet, stuffing sausages &c, that they have no time to attend to us, so busy preparing for our \ul future\ulnone  comfort.\'a0 Susan Hoke said she would write to Augustus to call & see you, but as you have not mentioned him, I suppose you have not seen him.\'a0 She sends over to know if you mention him in your letters, for they were uneasy not having heard from him.\'a0 Fanny Hoke is quite sick with Measles & Scarletina. Perhaps you heard that Mr. Sam Mauldin was carried down to Columbia & put in the Lunatic Asylum.\'a0 He attempted several times to kill himself.\'a0 He took Laudanum in Greenville, going down he attempted to jump out of the Cars & when left in the Asylum, tried to beat his brains out.\'a0 He eats Opium which is worse than drink.\'a0 How sad for his Wife & family.\'a0 James Benson is married to a Lady in Abbeville. Mr. Wm Easely is married to Miss Sloan of Pendleton\'a0\'a0 Mr. Joab Mauldin is married to Miss McIver.\'a0 Mrs. Mims Sister Mrs. Genl Hampton has a Son.\'a0 This is all the Greenville news I know of to tell you.\'a0Frank commenced a letter to you, but I saw it would take so long to finish it, I told him he might stop.\'a0 Willie is generally busy reading, cutting & hauling wood, & as I write so often, he thinks he would have nothing to tell you.\'a0 Hext is quite well & when I ask where Anna is, holds up his hand, as if to say \ul gone\ulnone .\'a0 Fanny speaks often of you & calls you \ul my\ulnone  \ul sister\ulnone .\'a0 She longs for Papa & Sister to come back, & then adds, I will be \ul sorry\ulnone  too, & when I ask why says because I will have to go out of Mamma\'92s room & sleep with Anna.\'a0 Now I go upstairs & sit with her at night.\'a0 Then she thinks \ul that\ulnone  will be put a stop to, so she feels quite divided.\'a0 She wishes though she had gone to town with you, & says I ought to have let her.\'a0 I did not think of it, but the weather has been so bad ever since you left, that I think this is the very worst time to leave home for \ul enjoyment\ulnone .\'a0 The \ul Spring\ulnone  is much pleasanter & is always the time \ul I\ulnone  will choose.\'a0I am glad Uncle Arthur & all of your friends are so affectionate & enquire after us all so kindly.\'a0 They are kind to you not only for \ul your\ulnone  \ul sake\ulnone  & \ul mine\ulnone , but for your \ul Grandmama\ulnone  whom they all love.\'a0 You must go to see all of her \ul old\ulnone  \ul friends\ulnone .\'a0 I often wish \ul she \ulnone would see them once more.\'a0 I know she must miss their friendship & society.\'a0 You must buy a present for each servant.\'a0 I wish this Christmas to give each of the grown servants a Bible.\'a0 Reuben, Eliza & Becky I think can read.\'a0\'a0 Charles, Lindy, Mary, Edward & Clara can bring theirs to me or you at any time to read to them.\'a0 8 Bibles plain ones I will have to get.\'a0 If Eliza could get reasonable ones in Charleston, & have them packed in the box she is to send, I would like it, but if she thinks it will take up too much room, I will get them here from Mr. Elfords book store.\'a0 A prayer book get for yourself & one for Willie, a \ul neat\ulnone  \ul plain\ulnone  \ul one\ulnone  for him, of a convenient size to put in his pocket. Becky\'92s comb you must not forget & some little present for Ninny, Lucinda, John & each of our servants, either a handkerchief, apron, or something pretty if you prefer it, not the \ul value\ulnone  of the\'a0 \ul present,\ulnone  will they regard but \ul your\ulnone  \ul remembering\ulnone  them, & anything from \ul Charleston\ulnone  will seem to them \ul great\ulnone .\'a0 A little present for Mary Mauldin also get.\'a0 Little China ornaments can be got for 15 cts.\'a0 Those little baskets, cups & saucers &c. that we have had, were of that price.\'a0 Get a \ul little\ulnone  \ul present\ulnone  for your Grandmama, Aunt Susy & Aunt Annie, also for Vardry Alex Annie & Susy, a doll for the two latter & some toy or book for the former, a dress for Lindy\'92s baby of cheap calico, a knife for Willie & Frank, the dolls & sugar toys for Fanny, & with the \ul 2 dollars\ulnone  she gave you buy her a large \ul box\ulnone  of \ul Furniture\ulnone .\'a0 I wish her to begin having a \ul baby\ulnone  \ul house\ulnone , so as to keep all her things in order.\'a0 At some future time I wish you to get a \ul dinner\ulnone  \ul set\ulnone  of \ul China\ulnone  for yourself so inquire \ul now\ulnone  the price.\'a0 It will be useful when your young friends come to see you.\'a0 You can have a table set to yourselves.\'a0 I expect \ul now \ulnone you cannot afford it.\'a0 Some time hence you might get it.\'a0 If you need \'85rilla before you get back, you must buy some & take.\'a0 Mrs. Elford went down first, & I expect sent you the gingernuts.\'a0 Mr. Elford went down afterwards, I expect had the hair & a letter for Eliza.\'a0 You must get Eliza to buy two bottles of \'93preparation of Castor oil,\'94 one for Aunt Susy [&] one for me.\'a0 I am glad you got a new bonnet.\'a0 I would like one for Fanny, if it is as pretty as any others worn by little girls of her age.\'a0 I have bought a Worsted bonnet here for Hext, & given him Fanny\'92s cloak, so he can do without anything.\'a0 Buy a Cornelian ring for Annie & Fanny, & one for yourself.\'a0 I wish you to buy a dress, & have any \ul new\ulnone  \ul fashioned apron\ulnone ; \ul Sack\ulnone  \ul or\ulnone  \ul new\ulnone  \ul bonnet\ulnone , or anything else \ul pretty\ulnone  you see made up for yourself.\'a0 All the \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul patterns\ulnone  you\ul  \ulnone can get, \ul bring\ulnone .\'a0 I am sorry you will not see Aunt Harriet & Sarah, & that you have not seen either Aunt Emily or Aunt Susan, & that sickness is the cause of not seeing the two later.\'a0 This visit is an event in your life which you will never forget, & you are grateful I am sure to your friends for being so kind, & will always do what you can in your power to return it.\'a0 I hope you will see Eloisa\'92s family before you leave.\'a0 The Legislature adjourns today.\'a0 Your Papa sets off tomorrow, & will return in Mr. Duncan\'92s carri[a]ge, for one of the sons went down in it.\'a0 The roads must be very bad.\'a0 It is raining now, & has been for several days.\'a0 Give my love to my friends.\'a0 Go & see Mrs. Elford & write when she will return; also go & see Mary Crayton.\'a0 Your attached Mother, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you a long letter yesterday & did not expect to write to you today, but as tomorrow no Mail goes, I will write now.\'a0 I have just received a letter from your Papa.\'a0 He is to leave Columbia today, & hopes to be at home tomorrow evening.\'a0 He comes up on the R[ail] Road & from there in Mr. Duncans carri[a]ge.\'a0 As neither of us now have to write to him, we can write oftener to each other.\'a0 I would be glad if every morning you would write to me, & tell me everything that interests you.\'a0 You will in this way tell me more than I will otherwise hear, for you will write of what may escape your mind when you get home.\'a0\'a0\'a0 As soon as you know from Mr. Elford what \ul time\ulnone  he is to return, let me know. Four days in this week it has rained.\'a0 Today it seems as if the weather may clear.\'a0 I hope it will.\'a0 For your Papa\'92s sake who is coming home, for your sake, that you may be able to go about, & for my sake that I may have the house cleaned.\'a0 It is very dirty, so much mud is brought into the house by the servants. The carpets I have had turned, & whitewashed the two Dining rooms, & bought some \ul reasonable \ulnone furniture Calico at Crittendens & made new curtains for the dining room windows.\'a0 The Calico is beautiful & was only 9 1/4 cts a yd & everything looked \ul neat\ulnone , but the rainy weather has caused so much dirt to be brought into the house, that I now have to clean it all again.\'a0 The soil here is very bad, different from the City, & there the yards & streets are generally paved, which is so neat.\'a0 We are all well except Eliza.\'a0 She is sick in bed, & has been unwell a long time.\'a0 Dr. Crooks had to come & see her today.\'a0 Becky gets along well with all the servants.\'a0 They like her, & respect her, so I hear no more abuse & quarreling among them as I used to.\'a0 Baylies has Prayer meetings every evening in his room at\'85it is more of \ul family\ulnone  \ul prayers\ulnone  for the servants in the \ul yard\ulnone .\'a0 He thinks \ul Lindy\ulnone  is feeling an interest in religion.\'a0 I hope so, & that it will make her a \ul good\ulnone  \ul servant\ulnone .\'a0 Next Wednesday the 22
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super nd
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  Rutters time is up, & as your Grandmama does not like to hire Rutter with her \ul two\ulnone  children, & have to pay 1 dollar month for Catherine who does \ul nothing \ulnone for her, only minds Rutters child & cannot even \ul talk\ulnone  or go on a message, she intends to let Rutter & her children go home, & try Lindy instead.\'a0 If she does \ul well\ulnone , she will keep her.\'a0 If she does \ul not\ulnone , she will look for another servant.\'a0 Priscilla is there now, & I expect will stay there for her food & clothing.\'a0 She will help mind Lindy\'92s child.\'a0 Aunt Annie is very poorly.\'a0 Your Grandmama is not well today.\'a0 Alex & Vardry have been there since Saturday, on account of Alex being sick with Measles.\'a0 He has worms also.\'a0 The weather has been so bad, that since you left I have been out very little, once to your Grandmama\'92s, three times to ride on business, & twice to church.\'a0 Susan, Annie & Susy staid with me awhile.\'a0 Becky sent in word last night to say, I must write you word not to forget \ul her\ulnone  \ul comb\ulnone .\'a0 Your Aunt Susy says you must be \ul sure \ulnone & bring 4 Sugar dogs for her children, & if the 25 cts she gave you to buy them with is not \ul enough\ulnone , to get more money from Aunt Eliza, who has some of your Grandmama\'92s money.\'a0 She wishes \ul pretty\ulnone  dogs, & the children will be very much disappointed if you do not bring them, so you must not forget it.\'a0 Your Silver comb cost so much less than I expected, that I wish you to get one for Annie \ul just\ulnone  like yours.\'a0 I suppose your size she can wear \ul now\ulnone , & when she gets older too, she needs a comb always to keep back her hair.\'a0 The horn one she breaks, & one of the plated kind her Mamma got her, but it hurts her head & she cannot wear it, so as I intended to get her a \ul cloak\ulnone  but now she does not \ul need\ulnone  one.\'a0 I will instead get her a silver comb, which will be a lasting \ul useful\ulnone  present for her.\'a0 You I expect will not have money enough to buy it, so if your cousin Eliza will add it to the list I have already sent her, I will pay for it, when I pay for the other things.\'a0 Willie & Frank have bought have bought two pigs from me.\'a0 As soon as they can get at their Bank & \ul pay\ulnone  me, I will send you the money to invest in something for them, books perhaps.\'a0 The Candy & Cocoa & ground nut cakes you must not forget.\'a0 50 cts worth of Sugar ground nut cake, 50 cts worth of Cocoa nut cake, 50 cts worth of Candy of different kinds, & 50 cts worth of \ul Cakes\ulnone  of different kinds.\'a0 These things are instead of buying anything here for Christmas, & if \ul you are\ulnone  not here Christmas, we will put off the celebration till \ul you\ulnone  \ul return\ulnone , & it will be better, for at Christmas the servants have holiday, & cannot do much for \ul us\ulnone . After their holiday is over, they can wait on us, & Becky will make us something nice.\'a0 So do not regret if you are not here Christmas, we will wait for you.\'a0 I want you to buy a nice little bible for yourself, a larger size I wish for Willie & Frank.\'a0 If you choose you can buy the three Bibles in town. Beg Eliza to have a \ul Cloak\ulnone  made for Fanny & buy a \ul pretty\ulnone  bonnet & all I have written for.\'a0 Fanny has no cloak to wear to church.\'a0 I wish it \ul made\ulnone  up, for Eliza is sick, & cannot work, & I have no pattern to make it by.\'a0 Some little girl of Fanny\'92s age you will know of to fit by.\'a0 Be sure to bring the cloak \ul made\ulnone , & try & get patterns for yourself. Beg Aunt Anna Hayne to carry you to see \ul her\ulnone  friend, & \ul our\ulnone  friend \ul Elizabeth\ulnone  \ul Jones\ulnone .\'a0 I did not know until you mentioned it, that the Canaries were dead.\'a0 Gine my love to your Aunts & cousins.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you, & one from your Papa, the \ul last\ulnone  one I will get from him for a long time, for he will reach home today.\'a0 Mr. Hoke has just sent me word, that he heard of his just having left the head of the R[ail] Road, which I was thankful to hear, as so many accidents now happen.\'a0 He comes home through Abbeville, passes Cokesbury where Mrs. Holmes lives, & was to sleep at Col. Wares last night. I must begin & tell you of the \ul increases\ulnone  in the family which will surprise you.\'a0 Yesterday afternoon I rode over to Mamma\'92s, & as soon as I got back, the children came running to me, crying out, \'93Eliza has a baby, it is to be Hext\'92s maid,\'94 & so it was.\'a0 Eliza has a girl, the baby is well, but Eliza last night was \ul very\ulnone  \ul ill\ulnone .\'a0 She fainted, & was out of her head.\'a0 I went up to see her.\'a0 This morning she is better. Before I was out of bed this morning, Frank came running up saying \'93the Sow has five pigs.\'94\'a0 So I told him I would give each of you a pig, which you must each attend to, & when they grow up, you would sell them to your Papa.\'a0Since you left \ul two\ulnone  Cows have had Calves, so you see what an \ul increase\ulnone  there has been in the family.\'a0 Willie & Frank will soon have to help your Papa support them.\'a0 We now have plenty of Milk & Cream.\'a0 Willie & Frank enjoy it, & have given up Tea & Coffee which I am glad of.\'a0 Your not coming back with your Papa will give us \ul two\ulnone  pleasures.\'a0 We are now with pleasure expecting him, & afterwards we will have the pleasure of looking forward to your return.\'a0 Your Papa writes, he has directed you to get money from Mr. Elford if you need it.\'a0 Mr. Elford has money of his.\'a0 You can also tell your Cousin Eliza, that \ul she\ulnone  can get \ul money\ulnone  from \ul Mr. Elford\ulnone  to pay for the things she buys for me. I know I will like your Cloak, & all you have bought.\'a0 I may before you leave write for a few more things.\'a0 I hope Eliza will have a pretty cloak made for Fanny.\'a0 I would like you to get the \ul largest\ulnone  size box of \ul Furniture\ulnone \'a0 for Fanny.\'a0 I want her to have a baby house.\'a0 She gave you 2 dollars of hers.\'a0 If 150 the Furniture costs, with the 50 cts left, buy some other toy for the baby house.\'a0 I would like you to get a Bedstead for it, &\'a0\'a0 several other peices of Furniture also bring her that will be suitable for the baby house.\'a0 She is so fond of arranging things it will delight her to fix the house, & give her occupation, which we have to find for children to make them happy. I am glad you are making so pretty a quilt.\'a0 I wish you always to have one on hand.\'a0 Eliza said \ul Worsted\ulnone  Quilts were pretty, & they must be very warm for winter & suit Greenville.\'a0 I wish you would get her to make \ul one\ulnone  \ul patch\ulnone , buy \ul several\ulnone  \ul kinds\ulnone  of Worsted cloth, & you bring it up with you & make a quilt.\'a0 I am glad your Aunts think you behave well, & feel \ul young\ulnone  again.\'a0 In being with you, interest in the\ul  young\ulnone  is what prevents persons feeling their age as they grow older, & it is \ul wisely\ulnone  \ul ordered\ulnone .\'a0 So old age is not as sad as it otherwise would be.\'a0 We live over again in the \ul young\ulnone .\'a0 We are interested for \ul them\ulnone , as we once were for \ul ourselves\ulnone .\'a0 You must bring us any present you think proper.\'a0 I wish \ul two\ulnone  pair of \ul Mits\ulnone  to wear in the house & a \ul neck\ulnone  \ul ribbon\ulnone  to wear to church.\'a0 You may bring \ul me\ulnone  \ul these\ulnone  as presents.\'a0 For your Aunt Eliza\'92s present, ask your cousin Eliza what to get for her mother, & then ask Eliza what to get for Eliza & Sue. Mrs. Barnwell Rhett\'92s is a sad death, & she will be a great loss to her children.\'a0 Children require so the care of a Mother, that her loss is even greater than the Father.\'a0Tell your Aunts Willie is not quite so ungallant as he was.\'a0 As he grows older he feels the value of the Fair Sex & pays them more respect. Tell Aunt Eliza, no change for the \ul better\ulnone  takes place at your Grandmama, that Mammas situation is one of \ul constant\ulnone  trial, & I wonder her mind & body have been able to bear it.\'a0 A \ul living\ulnone  \ul trouble\ulnone  like hers is worse than death.\'a0 She tries to be cheerful & to bear up, but it is hard not to despond.\'a0 Aunt Eliza must write to her & try & comfort her.\'a0 Her letters are consoling.\'a0 She must also send messages to Susan to tell her to bear up. & to Ann to acquiesce in what has happened.\'a0 You must bring your Grandmama & Aunts whatever present you choose, either something useful or pretty.\'a0 Buy for yourself a few peices of Music, easy enough for you to learn. I wish you could learn to Crochet. Since I commenced writing Aunt Mary McCall\'92s box has arrived. It stopped in Columbia & your Papa sent it on by the Stage.\'a0 Tell your cousin Eliza the bonnet is prettier & fancier than I expected.\'a0 It is a \ul dark\ulnone  \ul Straw\ulnone  with a feather, so I will be able to wear it to \ul church\ulnone , but it is not suitable for \ul common\ulnone  occasions, so the one I wrote her to get, I will still be glad of, as I need one to wear on occasions that the other I would not wear the feather would look unsuitable, & it is \ul very\ulnone  \ul small\ulnone .\'a0 Tell her the \ul Cloak\ulnone  Aunt Mary has sent me is beautiful to \ul look\ulnone  at, but not useful.\'a0 It is the \ul lightest\ulnone  grey colour & so \ul small\ulnone , it cannot meet across the chest. So instead of the \ul bonnet\ulnone , the \ul Cloak\ulnone  I must try & dispose of.\'a0 Ask her what a Cloak like the kind she is now making for herself would \ul cost\ulnone  for \ul me\ulnone , the materials & the making it.\'a0 I like a \ul dark\ulnone  \ul Cloak\ulnone  that will not \ul soil\ulnone  easily, for even our carri[a]ges here are not always clean.\'a0 I will get \ul her\ulnone  to have a cloak made for me.\'a0 I am as \ul tall\ulnone  as Eloisa, but \ul much\ulnone  \ul stouter\ulnone  across the chest particularly & back.\'a0 [E.F.P.]\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received two letters from you, and one from Aunt Eliza.\'a0 I write to say as there is such a difficulty in having work done, I will \ul give\ulnone  \ul up\ulnone  having Fanny\'92s cloak made.\'a0 If the \ul materials\ulnone  are \ul bought\ulnone  & a \ul pattern\ulnone  \ul sent\ulnone , I will have the Cloak made \ul here\ulnone .\'a0 I will make it \ul myself\ulnone .\'a0 If a \ul ready\ulnone  \ul made\ulnone  \ul Worsted\ulnone  Cloak would have been got, it would have saved the trouble of making one.\'a0 If cloak patterns cannot be got, perhaps a S\'85 a large one will do.\'a0 If so get [page torn] materials for a S\'85 & a pattern. I wrote to Eliza to have a Cloak made for me; at least that I would wish one, but as there is such a delay, it will be best to inquire the prices of \ul ready\ulnone  \ul made\ulnone  \ul Cloaks\ulnone , black silk & other \ul dark\ulnone  \ul kinds\ulnone .\'a0 It will be better to give \ul more\ulnone , & be saved the trouble of buying materials & \ul waiting\ulnone  to have the Cloak ma[de].\'a0 There is such a delay in fitting oneself with suitable winter clothes, so that this winter I am \ul obliged\ulnone  to have some things.\'a0 Last Sunday I wore a hat with a feather, & an old black Silk dress, & felt very shabby indeed.\'a0 As Eliza wil[l] be confined to her room for a month I got Margaret [to] let Clara come & make a dress for me, the \ul first\ulnone  she has ever made \ul alone\ulnone .\'a0 She is now in the room with me making the dress. Tell Aunt Eliza Aunt Mary McCall sent me two beautiful dresses.\'a0 The blue one was got at Browning & Semans 25 cts a yd.\'a0 The whole peice looks \ul beautiful\ulnone , much prettier than yours at the same \ul price\ulnone .\'a0 The Cashmere is 75 [page torn] & is \ul embroidered\ulnone .\'a0 I send a pattern, but not of the part \ul embroidered\ulnone .\'a0 Mary said \ul belts\ulnone  were \ul not\ulnone  \ul worn\ulnone , the dresses were \ul peaked\ulnone , but I intend to have my dresses made my same favorite way & so need a belt for each dress.\'a0 Ask Eliza to buy me a belt for each.\'a0 They can come up in [page torn] \ul large\ulnone  \ul envelope\ulnone , if no opportunity occurs. There are a great many stores here, but the shopping is very \ul limited\ulnone .\'a0 If we get a dress, we cannot get \ul trimmings\ulnone  for it.\'a0 \ul You\ulnone  would not price a pr of Gaiter boots to fit, & some simple things we cannot get, & the Stores are so frequented by \ul Greenville\ulnone  \ul Loungers\ulnone , it is disagreeable\'a0 to go in them & the merchants are \ul acquaintances \ulnone , & they \ul talk\ulnone  & \ul press\ulnone  their goods on us, so it is very awkward to refuse.\'a0 The shopping [l]ine is more like disagreeable visiting in the City.\'a0 It is a business matter\{&\} I am surprised Mr. Elford did not deliver my packages\ul  immediately\ulnone .\'a0 He is more careless than I thought.\'a0 He is not as \ul punctual\ulnone  & \ul exact\ulnone  in \ul business\ulnone  as your \ul Papa\ulnone  is.\'a0 Mr. Elford\'92s little daughter is not expected to live.\'a0 He has been written for & may come back before he has time to let you know, before you can get ready to come.\'a0 If so I will let you know of the \ul first\ulnone  opportunity I hear of.\'a0 It may be \ul inconvenient\ulnone  for your Aunt to have you longer, & I do not wish you to \ul impose\ulnone  on her \ul hospitality\ulnone , so you must consult \ul her\ulnone  wishes about lengthening your visit.\'a0 She has been \ul very\ulnone  \ul kind\ulnone  indeed to you, & has afforded you a \ul great\ulnone  \ul pleasure\ulnone  by introducing you to your relations.\'a0 You cannot return her kindness [page torn] it \ul deserves\ulnone , but you must show your \ul value\ulnone  of it, by making her some useful present.\'a0 You must get money from Mr. Elford & pay for what \ul I\ulnone  wrote for, & also if you \ul need\ulnone  \ul any.\ulnone  [G]et at Klinckes a Jar of \ul preserved\ulnone  \ul Ginger \ulnone & give to your\'85in \ul my\ulnone  \ul name\ulnone  & get a present for \ul her\ulnone  \ul Eloisa\ulnone  & \ul Susan\ulnone .\'a0 If you buy the \ul dress\ulnone  & t\ul rimmings\ulnone  & bring it home, Eliza can make it when she gets well.\'a0 A dress for 25 cts a yd as pretty as the blue Aunt Mary has got me at that price, & which [pagetorn]\'a0 send a \ul pattern\ulnone  of will do.\'a0 Beg Eliza to get me two belts to suit [page torn] patterns I send.\'a0 I will write to Aunt Eliza soon.\'a0 Tell her I [w]ould be gratified if she would write to your Papa about you.\'a0 Your Mama, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just written to your cousin Eliza & will now write to you.\'a0 I expected you home this morning.\'a0 I heard Mr. Elford would be here.\'a0 Last night I heard a Stage as I thought stop at the gate.\'a0 The driver called out very loud, & then blew his horn.\'a0 I thought \ul you\ulnone  had come, & woke your Papa & he woke Charlotte.\'a0 By that time the horn sounded at a distance, & I discovered it was the Augusta Stage that had passed.\'a0 This morning Mr. Hoke told your Papa, Mr. & Mrs. Elford had arrived at 6 oclock.\'a0 Little Mary Elford died only a short time before.\'a0 She was at Mr. Perry Duncans.\'a0 Mr. Duncan sent in a servant to prepare Mr. & Mrs. Elford for the sad event.\'a0 The servant passed them on the road, but they were afraid to inquire of him about the child, so rode on, & knew not whether the child was alive or not until they got to Mr. Duncan\'92s & found it dead.\'a0 It was something like Scarlet fever, for yesterday an irruption broke out.\'a0 Fanny Hoke has also been sick in the same way, but is getting better.\'a0 How many little children have died lately in Greenville.\'a0 It must be a warning to those who are left.\'a0 Mrs. Harvey has moved into the County.\'a0 Her two oldest children will stay in the village & go to school.\'a0 Susan Hoke I see very often.\'a0 She sends her love.\'a0 She says she wrote to Augustus to go & see you, but as you have not mentioned his visit, I suppose he has not been.  I am sorry Mr. Elford was hurried home so much sooner than he expected, & that you did not come back with him.\'a0 Do inquire of Mary C\'85ton & anyone else from Greenville who may be in town of some opportunity, & let you know that you may return.\'a0 If you hear of none, in a little more than a week your Papa will go down for you.\'a0 He would set off at once, if it were not for some business that detains him at home.\'a0 I proposed that Willie should immediately go down for you, but your Papa said somebody would have to go to take care of Willie.\'a0 The\'a0 children are very much disappointed at not having their Christmas presents.\'a0 I have nothing to give them.\'a0 They will have to hang their Stockings after you come back.\'a0 I am sorry you are not here.\'a0 I put off making the Hogs feet into Jelly until you returned but now it is so warm I can wait no longer & am making the Jelly today.\'a0 I am sorry also you have been obliged to stay so much longer than we intended you should, & as your aunts house will soon be full, I feel uneasy at your putting her to inconvenience.\'a0 You must write to me every day until you return.\'a0 Do not forget the Candy & Cocoa nut cake for the children.\'a0 I am getting nothing of the kind for their Christmas here.\'a0 I have sent Eliza 20 dollars, & I have troubled her so much in shopping for me that except a\'85for Fanny, & something for a S\'85 or Cloak for her, & a pair of Gaiter boots for me, & a Prayer book for yourself, there is nothing more I wish at this time.\'a0 You know we pay our bills.\'a0 We have to contract during the year, at the Blacksmiths, Sadlers. Doctors &c, buy meat Corn &c, so I am more straightened than at any other time, or I would send for a great many things I need, & I have also a large bill to pay Aunt Mary McCall \ul 21\ulnone  dollars for the \ul Cloak\ulnone , which is almost \ul white\ulnone , & I never expect to wear, but I know she did the best for me, as she thought, & therefore I do not wish to hurt her feelings, & she has been kind to you, but it would have been better not to have got me my cloak.\'a0 The bonnet is \ul too\ulnone  \ul fashionable\ulnone  for Greenville, but I cannot dispose of it, so wear it.\'a0 If I had known there was so much difficulty in getting work done I would not have written to you to get a dress.\'a0 I am sorry I troubled your cousin so about work. Your friends have been kind to you, & I am sure you will never forget it.  I hope to see you soon, & to hear from you every day.\'a0 Frank says bring him some crackers, & Willie & himself a knife.\'a0 In haste.\'a0 Your affectionate mother  Mr. Hopkins & his family have just passed on their way to Florida.\'a0 Fanny is regretting she did not see them, & says she wishes Rosa had staid.\'a0 I think Fanny is almost crying.\'a0 She is now saying, \'93I want Anna.\'a0 I wish Anna would come.\'94 The Silver Comb I want for Annie like yours.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is Christmas day, & a very dull day it has been.\'a0 The weather continues very bad.\'a0 I never knew so long a spell of rainy warm weather in winter.\'a0 The streets & yards are very muddy, & the house looks as if it never could recover.\'a0 The Carpets I am afraid are ruined.\'a0 The roads must be dreadful.\'a0 Your Grandmama & family were not able on account of the weather to come in & spend the day with me.\'a0 I sent them some of our desert, as they could not come.\'a0 I let Becky have holiday, & Lindy cooked.\'a0 Tomorrow Lindy will have holiday.\'a0 The pleasure seems to be all among the servants.\'a0 Last night some of them went to a party; today they have dined out, & their having holiday seems to make them happy.\'a0 The children hung up their Stockings, so I was obliged to put something in.\'a0 I bought 5 cts worth of Candy apiece, a mug, a 5 cts doll, a cake, an apple, a \ul switch \ulnone & 10 cts apiece.\'a0 So St Nicholas they think has not forgotten them.\'a0 Fanny regrets very much that you are not here.\'a0 I hope when you return we will have pleasant cheerful weather or you will think Greenville very dull.\'a0 Your Papa will go down for you.\'a0 He may not have time to go & return before New Years day.\'a0 If he does not, he will go immediately after New Years Day & that will be as soon as Mr. Springer thinks of coming.\'a0 So by New Years day have everything ready.\'a0 I dare say he will spend a few days in town though, so you will have time to get ready after he gets down.\'a0 I expect he will take Willie with him. Mary Elford was buried this morning.\'a0 I hope she has spent her Christmas in a happy world with Laura McKay, who was so afflicted, that I think it was a blessing she was taken, as her life would certainly have been one of suffering. Fanny Hoke is getting better.\'a0 Fanny sent her a doll & she sent Fanny a box.\'a0 Susan Hoke told me she wrote to Augustus to go & see you.\'a0 I suppose he feels awkward about visiting.\'a0 Butler Tompson told your Papa his Fathers wifes son, weighed 13 \'bd pounds, & his father was very proud of it.\'a0I am always writing you something to get, & I expect as long as you remain in town it will be the case.\'a0 I wish you to get me a little \ul key\ulnone  \ul basket\ulnone , & 1 dozen \ul black\ulnone  \ul lacets\ulnone  for Gaiter boots.\'a0 The tines come off so soon, & then ties cannot be laced.\'a0 Mr. Westfield puts such large tines on they will not go through the holes, & then they cannot be laced, so buy one dozen black lacets for Gaiter boots. Some neat \ul dark\ulnone  Calico about 12 \'bd\'a0 cts a yd such as will \ul wash\ulnone  I also wish, & will write for before you leave.\'a0 A good many yds I would like, but I will wait until I get Eliza\'92s \ul next\ulnone  \ul list\ulnone .\'a0 Beg her to send me a list of the other things she has bought.\'a0 I know I will like the bonnet she has got, & will wear it constantly.\'a0 I see in my list Calico is mentioned for A\'85 the 1.37 \'bd for the Calico if Eliza \ul chooses\ulnone  & the 1.12 \'bd for Reedy House might be added to your money, & pay for some of the things you have got. I am obliged to your Aunts for making you such acceptable presents as the Bible & Prayer book, the very things you were going to buy.\'a0 Also to Aunt Eliza for the boxes & Aunt Emily.\'a0 Your friends are very kind & I am thankful for the good opinion they have of you.\'a0 I am greatly indebted to your cousin Eliza for all the trouble she has taken to shop for me.\'a0 I will never forget their kindness to you.\'a0 Aunt Mary McCall has been kind.\'a0 I hoped to have heard today from her about the Cloak but have not.\'a0 If the man will take it back, your Papa can carry it down, but I suppose he will not change it.\'a0Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily & my other Aunts.\'a0 I wish you would see about Sarah Matthews & Aunt Harriett but suppose you will not.\'a0 Give my love to cousin Sarah Gibbes, Mrs. Irvine Keith, Mrs. O\'92Driscoll, & my other family.\'a0 Have you seen Elizabeth Jones? It is 10 oclock.\'a0 I can hardly see to write.\'a0 Hext is well & fat & lively & good, better than he used to be.\'a0 Minerva is sick, over at the Mansion House, with cold & headache.\'a0 The rest are well.\'a0 Lindy is still lame from Rheumatism, & is not going at present to your Grandmama\'92s.\'a0 She has engaged Nancy Greens daughter.\'a0 While Lindy\'92s baby is young, I know she would not do well hired out.\'a0 She can hardly work but next summer, after her child can run about she will do better.\'a0 She is now only able to help the other servants.\'a0 I will stop now & finish my letter after the candles are lit. Dear Anna,
\f1\b  
\f0\b0 You had better buy the dolls not dressed & dress them yourself.\'a0 I hope Aunt Harriett will come down from Mrs. Wilkes to see you if you are in town when she is there.\'a0 I am sorry you have not dined with your Aunts in Meeting St. but hope you will now.\'a0 We used to spend pleasant days with them when we were children.\'a0 I hope Alston will name his son after his f\ul ather\ulnone .\'a0 He lost one named Robert, but I think he ought to name another after his father, & that it would please his Mother.\'a0 I am sorry Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha have gone in the country.\'a0 I hope you will see them again, & that they will be in town when your Papa & Willie go down.\'a0 Tuesday week I expect your Papa will go down for you.\'a0 Wednesday the day after he will stop at Newberry to attend a R[ail] Road meeting, Thursday he will go to Columbia, & Friday reach Charleston.\'a0 He will remain there a few days.\'a0 It is very \ul unexpected\ulnone  he is going down, but now he has determined to go, he is pleased with the trip, he is obliged to be back before the 15
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  Jany.\'a0 He would have gone down immediately, but all business men ought to be at home Sale Day, & he could not return in time.\'a0 So you will soon see him, & I expect Willie.\'a0 Write every day.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\'a0\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a very \ul pleasant\ulnone  letter from you.\'a0 Your friends are very kind to you, & the enjoyment you now have, must last you a long time.\'a0 In looking back to it, you can experience it over again.\'a0 Uncle Arthur & Aunt Elizabeth are kind.\'a0 The presents I will like to see.\'a0 You must get your cousin Eliza or Susan either to show \ul you\ulnone  or how to \ul finish\ulnone  the Mit, or to finish it for you.\'a0 As unfinished they will be useless, & perhaps you can learn how to knit a purse with the ball of Silk.\'a0 I am glad you have seen H\'85 Drayton.\'a0 You were right to speak to Miss Drayton, for she would have spoken to you if she had recognized you, & if you had not spoken, you would have missed seeing H\'85, who is a fine girl, & was kind to you in Greenville. & I am sure would have been very sorry not to have seen you.\'a0 Did you tell her the fate of the China doll? She bought? & dressed for you. Your dress I know is a pretty one, & you will find it useful.\'a0 You have remained so much longer in town than you expected, that your other dresses perhaps look shabby, so this new one is made just at the right time.\'a0 I am sorry you did not take down your other Flannel petticoat.\'a0 I will send you by your Papa a new Sun bonnet I have just made for Fanny, but it is large enough for you & send that blue silk apron I bought for myself at Cox & Gowers but have not worn.\'a0 Perhaps it may be useful to you, the few days you remain after you receive it\'a0 If Aunt Mary McCall could have returned me the money for my Cloak, I would have written to Eliza to get me one, as I need a cloak very much, but situated as I now am, with Aunt Mary\'92s cloak on hand, & not able to \ul dispose\ulnone  of it. & having bought so many other things & a second bonnet I am not able to get another Cloak.\'a0 I hope Aunt Mary will be able to get the man to give me another Cloak this winter or next.\'a0 I am going to send it down to her.\'a0 When I \ul first\ulnone  wrote to Eliza about another Cloak I thought I could dispose of the \ul light\ulnone  one, but I have not been able to, so for the present I must hope Aunt Mary can do something with it.\'a0I know I will like the bonnet Eliza has got.\'a0 I am glad the box was about to be sent when you wrote.\'a0 There are a few things I wished Mr. Elford to get, which his leaving town so soon, may have prevented his attending to.\'a0 If so, when your Papa goes down I will send a list not a long one, a dozen large & a dozen small knives \ul without\ulnone  forks, for every day use, two peices of the \ul cheapest\ulnone  \ul Calico \ulnone 4 or 5 cts a yd to make Comfortables,13 Stair case rods, are what Mr. Elford I expect has not got, & a Fender,\'85dogs, Shovel & Tongs, Broom & Bellows for the Dining room.\'a0 These things if your Papa cannot get, I will be glad for Eliza to, & I think \ul she\ulnone  will be the best judge.\'a0 Send a list of all you have got since the last list sent.\'a0 My hair not being able to be made into chains, for a small one I wished made, for you to wear your Medallion with.\'a0 I think you need some kind of chain.\'a0 What kind would be \ul suitable\ulnone .\'a0 Ask Eliza, & what is the price, write me, so I can tell your Papa, & you can get one after he goes down.\'a0 I think the 12 \'bd cts chain must look very unsuitable.\'a0 A pair of India rubber shoes you must get.\'a0 One thing I wish to know is the price of a \ul nest\ulnone  of \ul baskets\ulnone , beginning from the \ul largest\ulnone  \ul Market\ulnone  \ul basket\ulnone  to the \ul key\ulnone  \ul basket\ulnone .\'a0 Ask Eliza to let me know the price, so if I can get a nest I will send by your Papa for it.\'a0 Mr. Elford was to have inquired for me. You can work on your quilt when you return.\'a0 I am glad you practice regularly on the Piano.\'a0 I hope you will play better than when you left.\'a0 I am also thankful you do not forget to perform your religious duties, & that you have behaved so well as to gain the good opinion of your friends.\'a0 You must set a good example to the others when you return, & try to be a comfort to us & make us all happy by your good conduct. You are greatly indebted to Aunt Eliza as you may tell her, for it is through \ul her\ulnone  \ul kindness\ulnone , you have been put in the way of receiving kindness from your other relations.\'a0 She so kindly invited you to visit her, which has given you so much enjoyment.\'a0 Willie is sorry now, he did not accept the invitation given him.\'a0 Now that he hears how pleasantly you have passed your time; he thought it would be like Columbia, where he has no acquaintances & soon gets tired of, for there he is the whole time among grown persons, his Papa\'92s associates. & such society improves him, so I am always well pleased to have him there.\'a0 Today Willie is not well, has a sore throat, which many are complaining of.\'a0 Mary has, & Edward & Mrs. Hoke.\'a0 Susan Hoke was here yesterday.\'a0 She said she is certain Augustus did not get her letter telling him to go & see you, & that he cannot know you are in town, or he certainly would go & see you.\'a0 It has rained almost constantly since you have been away & yesterday was the eighth day it rained without intermission, & today it is not raining, but is still cloudy & warm, & not like clearing. If you do not know what to buy for the servants, I can tell you.\'a0 Becky\'92s comb & a handkerchief apiece for the five women, two Bibles I am going to give to Reuben & Charles two of those you have bought, a Bible to Eliza, for Eliza & Lindy\'92s babies buy a little Worsted bonnet apiece for 25 cts, or 25 cts worth of Calico for the little servants any little thing, some Candy if you can think of nothing else.\'a0 One of the Bibles you have bought you can give to John Macbeth for the servants at Mamma\'92s, for Lucinda a handkerchief, for the little servants candy; Ninny a handkerchief or apron. Do not forget the Sugar dogs for Vardry & the others.\'a0 When I know \ul all\ulnone  you have bought, I can then see whether I can get some \ul books\ulnone  or not.\'a0 I hope to be able to, but having to pay for Groceries & Doctors & other bills, I cannot ask for money at this time to buy many things I would like.\'a0 It is such a good opportunity, your being in town.\'a0 Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & your cousins & thank them for taking such kind care of you.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have been disappointed today at not hearing from you, but I suppose you have been so much engaged shopping or seeing your friends, you were not able to write by this Mail. Mr. Elford went to his office today for the first time since he returned.\'a0 He told your Papa he left orders with his brother to give you any money you wished, so I hope his brother has given you some.\'a0 If he has not, you can immediately send to him & ask for whatever money Eliza needs to pay for the things she has bought for us.\'a0 I prefer her doing so to waiting until your Papa goes down, as I would like her to have the money at \ul once\ulnone .\'a0 I am glad to say that Mr. Elford bought \ul all\ulnone  the things I requested him to, the Knives, Fender, Calico, & even the nest of Baskets, so I will not have to trouble your cousin Eliza to get them for me.\'a0 She has shopped so much already for me, I am unwilling to occupy her time in that way, more than I can help. It is reported the \ul Cholera\ulnone  is in Charleston, but I hope it is a mistake.\'a0 If it were so, you would have mentioned it, & Augustus Hoke would have made it an excuse to come home. Willie took some pills last night, & feels better today.\'a0 He has gone to the Farm to haul wood.\'a0 Franks only amusement is to cut wood.\'a0 Fanny is trying to make herself useful.\'a0 She has been pulling Sage, then asked what next she should do.\'a0 I told her to move Hexts carri[a]ge out of the front walk, then pick up towels lying about the yard.\'a0 Hext has gone to the Mansion House to ask for a bill of some Hams we got there this Fall. Yesterday after I wrote the wind blew, & the Sun came out & the weather became fine, & continues so.\'a0 I hope it is the same with you, & that you will have pleasant weather the remainder of your stay in town. This afternoon if I can, I will go & see your Grandmama.\'a0 She is interested in all you write about, & pleased \ul her\ulnone  friends have been so kind to you & that you are so affectionate in your remembrances of her, & forget no one at home. This visit to town is an Era in your Life.\'a0 I am sure you will never forget it, or the kindness of your friends.\'a0 I suppose you were surprised at finding how many relations you had there.\'a0 I hope you have dined with your Aunts in Meeting st.\'a0 I can imagine you spending a quiet, pleasant, improving day, seated in Aunt Mary\'92s chamber, working on your Quilt.\'a0 Are Mom Phillis & Minda still alive? Christmas has not been spent differently from any other time, except among the \ul servants\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Choices servants had dancing even in the \ul day\ulnone  & a party takes place every evening I believe somewhere.\'a0 Even Becky last night asked to go to a \ul Fair\ulnone  all the way at Mr. Goodletts.\'a0 I objected on account of the distance, for fear she would get sick. Baylis then came in to say he had procured a Buggy & intended to drive her there, & would come back soon, so I let her go.\'a0 Johnny came in for a ticket for Clara to go, said \ul two\ulnone  \ul gentlemen \ulnone had come to escort her.\'a0 The two gentlemen were Genl Thompsons servants,\'a0 Tonight Dr. Irvines servants give a party, & Charlotte asked to go, & Clara wishes to have a \ul Fair\ulnone  in this yard. The Mauldins yesterday inquired of your Papa when you would return.\'a0 He met them in the streets. The Piano has not been opened (except by Mr. Wardell) since you left.\'a0 You must buy a few pretty peices of Music, simple enough for you to learn. Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Sue, & beg them to write to me, & Eliza to send a list of her further purchases, my bonnet, Fannys &c.\'a0 I would like to see it, & a list of the Confectionary & toys.\'a0 I will open the box when it comes & take out the bonnet & such things, but the presents I will not take out or show the children until you return.\'a0 I hope the box will come soon.\'a0 The Rail Road being unfinished, our Groceries will come up by way of Hamburg.\'a0 The roads are so bad the freight by wagons is very high now, so we are sorry now we did not wait until Spring to get the Groceries, but often we cannot get even \ul necessaries\ulnone  here, such as Rice & Salt.\'a0 At present no Salt can be got in the village.\'a0 Many persons have to keep the Hogs they have bought & \ul feed\ulnone  them, until they can get Salt.\'a0 Genl Thompson is complaining of having to feed his hogs, on this account, says they are eating him out of everything.\'a0 It is near dinner time, so I must soon close.\'a0 I hope you spent a pleasant day with Miss Drayton.\'a0 In this fair weather it must be pleasant walking on the Battery. I hope to hear tomorrow from you.\'a0 Give my love to Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily, & Aunt Elizabeth, & my friends generally. I hope you will see Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha again.\'a0 I suppose you will not see Aunt Sarah & Aunt Harriet.\'a0 I am sorry you will not, & also Aunt Susan.\'a0 Thank Aunt Eliza & your cousins for their kindness to you, for which I feel very grateful, & believe me , Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P. P.S. I hope your cousin Eliza received the letter containing 20 dollars I sent last week.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just written to Aunt Eliza to say, you may remain longer in town, that my only fear was, you would put her to inconvenience. & be in the way, when the family became larger, but as she says this is not the case, & you are passing your time so pleasantly, & are anxious to remain longer, we have no objection at all to your remaining, & coming up with Mary Crayton, if she does not stay longer in town, than you think you \ul ought\ulnone  to stay.\'a0 Your Papa is better today, but will not be able at present to fix upon any time to go for you, & if you come up with Mary Crayton, or any other lady coming, he will not go down, as the traveling is too unpleasant at this season to visit town for pleasure.\'a0 We leave it to \ul you\ulnone  now & your \ul Aunt\ulnone  to return, at a suitable time.\'a0 Of course I would not object to your lengthening your visit, except that I thought you were trespassing on your Aunt\'92s hospitality, which she says is not the case.\'a0 I am very much pleased with the accounts Aunt Eliza & your cousin Eliza give of you, they say you have pleased \ul all\ulnone  your friends, behaved exceedingly well, & have all the virtues that adorn the female character.\'a0 I hope you will improve as you grow older, & not disappoint your friends, & be a comfort to all those kind friends, who are interested in you, & set a good example to Fanny.\'a0 The character of the oldest sister has great influence over the others, & therefore a great responsibility rests on you.\'a0 I am glad you perform all of your duties so regularly & do not forget the most important, the \ul religious\ulnone  one, you must keep yourself very \ul neat\ulnone , clean your teeth regularly, wash your hands, face, ears clean your nails, & be very nice in person, you know cleanliness is a virtue placed very high in the bible.\'a0 I see in the paper Charcoal recommended as the best \ul tooth\ulnone  powder, buy a box & use it every morning.\'a0 If I cannot get any here, I will get you to buy some for me.\'a0 I do not need the \ul key\ulnone  \ul basket\ulnone  now.\'a0 Mr. Elford has bought a \ul nest\ulnone , which I suppose includes the\'85for keys, so if you have not got it already, you need not. I much prefer Fanny\'92s cloak being made.\'a0 I countermanded the order thinking it could not be done conveniently, but Eliza has engaged the mantua maker, & says it can be done.\'a0 I will be very glad to have it made, & of a \ul large\ulnone  size, as the winter is so far advanced it will be more useful \ul next\ulnone  winter than \ul this\ulnone . Tell Eliza by Butler Thompson I will send down a Gaiter boot, so she can know exactly the kind I wish, & I may write for a pr of India rubber shoes, & she can put them over the Gaiter. Mamma asks Eliza with the money she has of hers to spend 2.25 or about that, for a Silver spoon for Sarah Taft\'92s child.\'a0 It is named after Mamma, Susan Hayne McCall Taft.\'a0 She wishes the four Initials marked on the spoon S.H.M.T.\'a0 Eliza will know what kind of spoon will be suitable. I am glad you spend Christmas so pleasantly, & am sorry as you were, that you could not have been at Mr. Wm Ravenel\'92s where I suppose the \ul tree\ulnone  was beautiful. But it was kind in Mrs. Drayton to ask you. I am pleased you remembered your Aunt & cousins with a little present.\'a0 If I had not a \ul large\ulnone  \ul debt\ulnone  to pay to Aunt Mary McCall, I would send you money to make them \ul handsome\ulnone  presents.\'a0 Minerva\'92s wages are due in two weeks & the \ul whole\ulnone  of it I have to send to Aunt Mary & more besides, & what is mortifying, the Cloak is useless, & the bonnet almost so.\'a0 I have worn it \ul once\ulnone  only, & am sorry I wore it then, as Eliza has got me one I know I will like better, & Aunt Mary\'92s, perhaps I might have disposed of it at a low price, or kept it for you to wear at a future time, taking out the \ul feather\ulnone .\'a0 But Aunt Mary meant to please me, but Ella being so much smaller than I am, if she had \ul thought\ulnone  about it, she would have known the bonnet was too small for me.\'a0 She has been kind to you, & I am \ul grateful\ulnone  to her, & will not let her know my disappointment. Ask Eliza the \ul price\ulnone  of \ul her\ulnone  cloak, materials & mating.\'a0 I can better judge by the \ul estimate\ulnone  she sent me, & wish to know what just such a one as hers costs.\'a0 I will be sure to get one, perhaps just like hers next winter.\'a0 Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Thompsons Aunt says she will take down mine, next week.\'a0 I will direct it to Aunt Eliza & get her to send it to Aunt Mary.\'a0 Perhaps I may send you a sun bonnet, apron, and flannel petticoat.\'a0 You may have use for them as you are to stay longer & I will send you my gold chain to wear with your medallion when you take tea out, as I think you have nothing suitable to wear with it.\'a0 I see Eliza bought you two Collars 12 \'bd apiece.\'a0 If you need it, get some more, & if Eliza thinks you need undersleeves, buy or make some.\'a0 Tell Eliza anything you really need, I wish her to get for you, if she can get it with \ul convenience\ulnone . I have written word you may get a wicker box.\'a0 If you can get one, you will find useful for \ul every
\fs32 \ulnone  day use.\'a0 Generally they are only for \ul show\ulnone , & the scissors, thimble &c in them only for \ul ornament\ulnone .\'a0 Perhaps you can get one without thimble scissors & buy for it all that is needed, but consult with Eliza, & beg her to get you a \ul useful\ulnone  one.\'a0 Another Christmas I will get you a Writing desk, as you must keep up a correspondence with the relations who have been so kind to you, & will need a desk.\'a0 Inquire the price & let me know of a neat writing desk. & when you get the\'85box, tell me the price.\'a0You must continue to behave well as you have done, & not make your Aunt regret having to ask you to stay longer.\'a0 She is very kind to you.\'a0 Give my love to all my Aunts.\'a0 I will let you know when the box comes.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just written two letters one to your Papa the other to Mr. Elford on business, & will write to you now.\'a0 My pen is \ul bent\ulnone , so I cannot write well.\'a0 I suppose you have seen Mr. Elford before this.\'a0 If he stays \ul longer\ulnone  in town than you wish, or ought to stay, you can come up by any other opportunity you hear of.\'a0 He told me he might be only 10 days in town, but \ul perhaps\ulnone  3 weeks, so I thought he & his Wife would be the very best persons you could come up with, & the Stage at the time \ul he\ulnone  comes, will not be so crowded, as at the time the Legislature adjourns.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I received a \ul long\ulnone  letter from you today.\'a0 I was glad to hear from you.\'a0 I am sorry your Cloak had not been made, as you must have needed it, ever since you have been in town.\'a0 I am sorry you did not mention the \ul price\ulnone  of the things you bought.\'a0 I your \ul next\ulnone  letter you must.\'a0 As you have written to your Papa for money I do not like you to write a second time for \ul me\ulnone  so unless you have money left, I may not send for the articles I wish until he returns \ul home\ulnone , & \ul then\ulnone  I will send the money.\'a0 I thought you would need more than 10 dollars.\'a0 He says you wrote for 10.\'a0 You write me if you have any money left, & then I can tell you what to get, but \ul first\ulnone  get all \ul you\ulnone  need, a \ul dress\ulnone  \ul frock\ulnone  for Fanny & a \ul cloak\ulnone  for her, are what I would first get, after you have supplied yourself, a pr of gaiters for yourself, myself, Fanny & Hext I wish, such as your cousin Eliza wears.\'a0 The price of a bonnet for Fanny, I would like to know.\'a0 The Candy if you do not write in time for, you can get as much as you think best.\'a0 Buy a pretty pair of Ear[r]ings, for yourself.\'a0 Eliza had best write the list of your purchases.\'a0 If you need more money send to your Papa.\'a0 He will send it to you, & I dare say you will need it.\'a0 I do not care to send to him for money for \ul myself\ulnone , but I wish you to get for \ul yourself\ulnone  all you need.\'a0 I can do without the things I intended sending for, for Aunt Maery McCall has got me what I most needed. I am glad you are enjoying yourself, & that your friends are so kind to you.\'a0 Remember me to them \ul all\ulnone .\'a0 I send you a little book to read\'a0 that your Aunt Eliza gave you.\'a0 I read it this morning to Fanny, & it contains just such advice as I would like to give you now, but I am obliged to stop, for since beginning this letter I have received by Mr. Beattie two letters from your Papa.\'a0 I had written to him & told him I had not heard, & now I must write again, which makes me shorten your letter.\'a0 I write so \ul badly\ulnone .\'a0 You must tell Aunt Eliza & your Cousins what I say, & can read \ul aloud\ulnone  \ul parts \ulnone but do not \ul show\ulnone  them the letters, for I am ashamed of them.\'a0 Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.\'a0Willie Frank & Fanny & Hext will all be glad to see you again, also your Grandmama Aunts Papa & myself.\'a0 Your attached Mother, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I do not know that I can get a cloak this winter.\'a0 I hope Aunt Mary\'92s can be changed.\'a0 If not I expect I will have to do without, as I cannot afford another, unless one could be got \ul reasonable\ulnone , so tell Eliza merely to let me know the prices.\'a0 I will then let her know.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 If she has not got the \ul second\ulnone  dress for Fanny, I expect one will be enough, for Aunt Mary\'92s bill is high.\'a0 Until I have paid for that, I find I must be economical.\'a0 Your dress I can have
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 made here. & materials for a S\'85 for Fanny & a \ul pattern\ulnone  will be sufficient.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 You will be so well supplied with clothes you will need nothing next winter.\'a0If I had known Aunt Mary\'92s bonnet I could wear \ul at\ulnone  all I would not have sent for another, but it is \ul very\ulnone  \ul small\ulnone .\'a0 Next summer I will have a peice added between the \ul crown\ulnone  & \ul front\ulnone , & cover it over with ribbon & wear it as a summer bonnet, & make up for my extravagance in get[t]ing two, but the one Eliza has got will be very useful.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Thank Aunt Eliza for her letter.\'a0 I write now in great haste, & when I have leisure I will write to her.\'a0 I am glad you pleased Mrs. O\'92Driscoll by your playing, & that your friends are satisfied & pleased with you.\'a0 I am sorry you have missed seeing so many.\'a0 The Spring is the pleasantest time for a visit. Tell Eliza I will not trouble her with shopping for a long time again, & when the Rail Road is finished I hope once in a while we can go down & shop for ourselves & not trouble our friends so often. The most economical way is not to send at all, but go without what we cannot get here, for when I once begin a list, I do not know where to end it.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 The weather is again bad.\'a0 You have had nearly 3 days together clear.\'a0 I am thankful that you have a happy contented disposition, & it is well , as you know in Greenville our happiness has to be found at home.\'a0 There is nothing beyond home to amuse & divert.\'a0 Everyone complains of the want of society, & the little sociability there is now, that there is less than there used to be.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Give my love to \ul all\ulnone  my friends, particularly those in the house with you Mr. Elford ought to have been to see you.\'a0 I suppose he was busy.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Today has been so unfavorable, that we did not go to church.\'a0 I have just done reading to the children, so will now write you a few lines.\'a0 One important matter I nearly forgot mentioning to you.\'a0 When you are away the servants have so much\'85to do, I thought this a good time to purchase their summer clothes, for them to make up, so the money you left, I first bought some necessaries, & the remainder spent in Homespun for servants, but it was not enough to pay for all.\'a0 Would you be so good as to send me by Mr. Elford \ul 10 dollars\ulnone , to finish paying for the Homespun & to carry me on in Housekeeping.\'a0 It will be more than is necessary but you had better send that sum.\'a0 I have to pay Mom Phillis 2 dollars for being with Lindy.\'a0 I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you & pay you for all the cases you have been engaged in with him.\'a0 In writing your Editorial from Pickens, do not mention \ul Mr.\ulnone  \ul Easley\'92s\ulnone  \ul name\ulnone  in connexion with the case you have against him, as his family are respectable, you must have some regard for their feelings.\'a0 If Miss Wynn were modest, she would now keep herself secluded & not wish to bring herself into public notice, as she is by bringing suit.\'a0 She is sufficiently disgraced & if a trial comes on, I am afraid other acts of indecency will be brought forward against her. So instead of \ul vindicating\ulnone  her fair fame, she will establish its infamy.\'a0 Her father perhaps does not know how bad she is.\'a0 Like Mrs. Rabe Dr. Rabe \ul before\ulnone  her trial did not know half of what was brought against her.\'a0Lindy & her baby are doing well.\'a0 Write me a long letter by Mr. Elford.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 The Patriot in which you mentioned Scurry\'92s case you ought to send to Belton Williams friends,, mother, Uncles, , & cousin.\'a0 I think it a shame Scurry should be acquitted.\'a0 It was almost deliberate murder.\'a0 Massey certainly then ought not to have been hung, & I hope Mr. Wiliams will still pay you the additional fee.\'a0 I am afraid the\'85spirit will pass over.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32  Mrs. Earle across the river, told Mamma she heard Mr. Sharpe was losing his property fast.\'a0 When will you be paid for Mr. Barnes Rail Road Case.\'a0 You will have been longer from home now than sometimes when you go to Columbia, & a Call was bad to have during Court week at Anderson.\'a0 Many are at Court, who would wish to attend.\'a0Good bye.\'a0 We all long to see you.\'a0 Ever yours, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received your letter mentioning your sad accident.\'a0 Mr. Beattie a short time previous had come to show me a letter from Mr. McKay who merely mentioned you had broken your arm at 10 oclock Monday morning & were doing comfortably well.\'a0 Mr. Beattie was afraid I might hear exaggerated accounts.\'a0 I was very much shocked & grieved , but was thankful it was not fever you had.\'a0 But I am afraid this accident may bring on fever, that you ought to come home at \ul once\ulnone .\'a0 Mr. Elford has just been here, & offered to send his carri[a]ge for you, & I have accepted the offer, so hope to see you tomorrow.\'a0 I have almost a mind to go in the carri[a]ge but am afraid you may not like it.\'a0 I am thankful it is your left arm, but truly sorry, it has occurred at all.\'a0 Edward Dr. Crooks said this morning was better that he regarded him now out of danger.\'a0 The symptoms at present were all favorable.\'a0 I was just going to write you about the Election when Mr. Beattie came.\'a0\'a0 I am sorry as yet the news is not encouraging.\'a0 The voting has been so strange that almost any result may be looked for.\'a0 Pinckney McBee is ahead.\'a0 Mr. Carson has managed wonderfully.\'a0 Mr. Ware thinks you next, but the Disunionist thinks Smith & Irvine ahead of you.\'a0 John Russell has been run by them in opposition to Col. Brockman.\'a0 Until the boxes are heard from today, there is no telling what the result will be.\'a0 I would send Willie out but Mr. Elford thinks it a risk for him to go, as his tongue you know is\'85, & he had a little headache night before last.\'a0 I believe I would certainly go, but he says it would be unsafe also for me.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Be sure & come home tomorrow.\'a0 I will ride & meet you if nothing prevents.\'a0 Laurens is sickly & with your accident, you will be sure to get fever if you stay there, so I will expect you certainly tomorrow.\'a0 Reuben will go any time in the stage & bring the horse & Buggy
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I am sorry the horse was foundered; how careless in the Ostler.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I long to see you & help nurse your arm.\'a0 I think I will have to go on your next tour with you.\'a0 I can write for you.\'a0 I will leave Hext, be a good time to wean him.\'a0 Susan will take care of the house & children.\'a0 I hope you are doing well, & will be at home tomorrow evening.\'a0 Your sympathizing Wife, E.F.P.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 P.S. The carri[a]ge will soon be here to take this letter, so I must seal it.\'a0 How kind in Mr. Elford.\'a0 Mr. Hoke says his being beat this time will do him good, make him popular hereafter.\'a0 Tomorrow I hope to see you.\'a0 Last night I dreamt of you, but was awake almost the whole night.\'a0 I must have had a presentiment of some evil.\'a0 I was crying & begging you not to go where you would get fever.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Mr. Elford called here little while ago, to say he was going to Anderson tomorrow & would take a letter, so I will write a few lines.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Yesterday I had a very bad headache, owing to the trouble & fatigue I had had with the children who were here Saturday.\'a0 I am so unaccustomed to have my quiet disturbed, that having even one person stay in the house any time, fatigues me, so that I feel the effects for several days after, so in future I intend to trouble myself very little about company, only \ul your\ulnone  \ul friends\ulnone  to stay \ul one\ulnone  \ul night\ulnone  at a time I am willing to have.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I am glad you have decided at last about Kossuth.\'a0 He is too bad a horse to be at the expense of feeding.\'a0 I sent word to Mr. Elford to advertise him, horse saddle & all you bought.\'a0 The bridle which is broken, I will have mended.\'a0 I will be delighted to have the 145 dollars back in your pocket as soon as you sell Selim, & the first fine pr of horses you come across buy. Mr. Ward came here today to see you to know if you had heard from Mr. Harrison about his Land case. A letter came from the office today from Mr. Gordon, begging you to cash his bond as you had proposed, that he had written to you at Columbia about it, but supposes the letter miscarried.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 If Mr. Elford can take your brush which by mistake I left out, I will send it to you.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Write by Mr. Elford.\'a0 Your letters are always a comfort to me, & break in upon my loneliness. Stop to see Mrs. Dub\'85.\'a0 I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you, & pay you some large fees.\'a0 It is time to have a settlement.\'a0 We are all well.\'a0 I have nothing new to write you, take care of yourself, particularly in the fever country you pass through & believe me, Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 P.S. I do not mean that I intend to give up all company for the children, but when they wish it, it will be one or two at a time to spend the day & when they wish a larger number it must be in the evening.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I love to have my house to myself.\'a0 It is a privilege to be alone.\'a0 A boarding house is the last thing I would keep.

I hope you have given your Papa no trouble.\'a0 You must not interfere with his \ul business\ulnone .\'a0 Let him attend to \ul that\ulnone , even if you are left alone the whole day.\'a0 Tell Aunt Harriet when you see her, that I have not forgotten her Pincushion & needle\'85& as soon as I can get a pretty pattern will make them. Aunt Eliza wrote word that Mrs. Isaac Hayne & Eloisa Martin being in Columbia would make their social circle much smaller than usual, but there were many who would take a kind interest in you & she would carry you to see all of our friends.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 In a City you must remember persons are more particular than in the County, & as your good behaviour will reflect \ul credit\ulnone  on your \ul Parents\ulnone , you must keep that in mind & acquit yourself well.\'a0 I do not wish you to be grave & restrained.\'a0 Be \ul lively\ulnone  & \ul happy\ulnone , but be correct in all your words & actions.\'a0 As soon as you get down, have your patches cut out, so you can have some employment.\'a0 Aunt Mary or Aunt Eliza or Eliza or Sue will cut them for you.\'a0 Practice every day on the Piano.\'a0 Read your Prayer book & say your Prayers, \ul begin\ulnone  your day well, & it will be apt to \ul end\ulnone  well.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I will now close.\'a0 Hext is asleep in the cradle.\'a0 Fanny is busy fixing something in the Entry.\'a0 Willie I expect is in the Library, & I do not know where Frank is.\'a0\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a letter from you, & am very glad to hear.\'a0 When nothing prevents it, you must write \ul every\ulnone  day, but do not let writing to me interfere with any other engagement.\'a0 I write to you every day, because I hope my letters give you the same pleasure yours do me.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I am glad to tell you your Papa feels much better today, & has gone to his office, but he will not be well enough to go to Newberry to attend the R[ail] Road meeting Wednesday.\'a0 I wrote to Aunt Eliza & yourself yesterday, to say I was perfectly willing you should remain longer in town, even if \ul you\ulnone  \ul wished\ulnone  it, as long as Mary Crayton staid, as she so \ul decidedly\ulnone  said, your being with her was a \ul pleasure\ulnone , & you did not \ul incommode\ulnone  her at all, even if her family were larger, it was no inconvenience to her, to have you.\'a0 But if at any time you feel \ul anxious\ulnone  to return \ul before\ulnone  Mary Crayton does, write & \ul tell\ulnone  me so, & your Papa I dare say, by that time will be \ul well\ulnone , & he will go down for you.\'a0 Now that you are to stay longer, continue to be as \ul good\ulnone  a girl as you have been, & your friends will be more & more attached to you.\'a0 Occupy yourself practicing & working & reading & make yourself \ul useful\ulnone  in every way you can to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.\'a0 Perhaps you can learn some new peices of Music to surprise me when you return.\'a0 If it gives no \ul trouble\ulnone , get one of your friends to teach you to knit a purse, & finish the Mit, & when Aunt Ann & Aunt Martha return, go & see them frequently, & Aunt \'85 & Aunt Anna go & see, & Aunt Harriet I hope you will see before you leave.\'a0 I know she would be sorry not to see you.\'a0 You are passing your time so pleasantly, & seeing so much that is new to you. & seemed anxious to remain, that I am sure you will be pleased that your Papa & myself are willing you should.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Soon I am to send 49 dollars to Aunt Mary McCall, 21 for the Cloak & 7.50 for the bonnet, making $28.50 which is spent uselessly, & I would gladly have sent to you,\'a0 The rest of the money is for two dresses & trimmings, as pr velvet Cuffs, a peice of ribbon for the neck, a pr Gloves & a blue veil.\'a0 This is all.\'a0 Next week I will send you more money.\'a0 Write word how much you wish.\'a0 As soon as you get your work box, write about it, & tell me the price.\'a0 I think it will be a very suitable present to make \ul Aunt\ulnone  \ul Eliza\ulnone .\'a0 So after I hear about \ul yours\ulnone , perhaps I may write to you to get \ul her\ulnone  one, but do not say anything about it, until you \ul buy\ulnone  it & surprise her.\'a0 Inquire the prices of \ul neat\ulnone  \ul writing\ulnone  \ul desks\ulnone ; either a \ul writing desk\ulnone  or \ul work\ulnone  box, whichever she \ul most\ulnone  \ul needs\ulnone  will be a good present for your Aunt.\'a0 I am glad you gave the Jar of Ginger & the other presents. Day after tomorrow is Sale day, & your Papa will receive money, & I will be able to send you all you need.\'a0 This week he has been paying some of his debts.\'a0 Three Doctors bills Dr. Crooks 58 dollars, Dr. Earle 24, & Dr. Dean 22,\'a0 Cox & Gower 189 dollars for the carri[a]ge & repairs on Buggy &c, Mr. Westfield 44 dollars, & Mr. Heldman 54.\'a0 For the Hogs Mr. Hoke bought 10 of them, he paid 140 dollars.\'a0 It is pleasant when one goes to town & sees so many things they need & cannot get here, to have plenty of money; your Papa paying his debts, & I also having to pay a large debt, prevents my giving you as much as I would like, but when you make another visit to town, instead of having to send 49 dollars to pay for what is of no \ul use\ulnone  to me, I can give it all to you, & you can gratify your feelings, of \ul generosity\ulnone , & buy presents for all who have been so kind to you.\'a0 I am well supplied with clothes for next summer, & can save all of Minerva\'92s wages for the next visit any of us pay to town. You can buy for Mary Mauldin a little China cup or basket for 28 cts, also for Sally Hoke , a Sugar figure for Fanny Hoke she will be pleased with; more ground nut cake & Candy I will send money for as presents to the children here.\'a0 I will not show them the presents in the box if possibly can help it.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Mr. McKays school begins Monday. & we expect Fanny will commence at once.\'a0 She says she does not wish to go, but I know she will be pleased.\'a0 She will be occupied, which will make her happy as it does everybody.\'a0 Sometimes she prefers going to Miss Hopkins, & then again to Mr. McKay.\'a0 We prefer sending her to the latter, so as to be with \ul you\ulnone .\'a0 In the Male Academy, Mr. Thomas a young man who graduated the other day in Columbia & took the \ul third\ulnone  honor, is to teach.\'a0 We will send Frank to \ul him\ulnone .\'a0 Perhaps Mr. Hillhouse will also be engaged in the Male Academy.\'a0 Willie will go to the Baptist College, which does not commence until February.\'a0 Mamma let Reitta go home, & engaged old Mrs. Greens servant Sarah to go to her today. & Sarah has disappointed her & says she cannot go yet, so I was obliged to let Lindy go.\'a0 The yard is so much pleasanter now, since Becky was here, that Lindy is very sorry to go.\'a0 I expect she feels she is not able to do as well for Mamma as she ought, for she went off wiping her eyes.\'a0 She had her child in her arms.\'a0 Priscilla who is to mind it, following with a basket & escorted by Fanny, & Charlotte & Hext.\'a0 On account of the Measles being at Mamma\'92s, this is the first time Hext has been there since you left.\'a0 I told Lindy to do her best, for we were obliged to hire her out, as we had too many servants, & they must make something for us.\'a0 Though I did not intend to hire her out until her child was older, only to accommodate Mamma & let her go now, & if she did well it would be a good place for her.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Tonight the servants here give a party.\'a0 Becky I believe is the one, & as she is a Methodist, it will be quiet, no dancing or noise.\'a0 There is to be a show here next week of animals & a Circus which the children are expecting with great pleasure.\'a0 I am glad Eliza is having Fanny\'92s cloak made.\'a0 Beg her to send it up by the first opportunity, either Butler Thompson or anyone Mary Crayton knows is coming.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.\'a0 I am pleased at the high opinion they have of you, & hope you will continue to merit it.\'a0 Write me everything that interests you.\'a0 I write so often, Willie thinks it no use for him to write.\'a0 Mrs. Robinson & Butler Thompson go down next week, & today I am going to pack my Cloak to be ready for her to carry, & if she can take them, your bonnet, apron, & flannel petticoat.\'a0 I must now close.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 No mail comes today so I have not heard from you, but I cannot let the day pass without writing to you.\'a0 We again have bad weather.\'a0 Last week was tolerably good, & yesterday we were able to go to church, but this morning after breakfast it commenced raining & has now set in for a bad day.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Willie & Frank & Fanny all set off for school today.\'a0 Fanny went to Mr. McKay, but the day being bad only the Brooks, two of them & Rebecca Croft & Harriet Crooks were there. So Mr. McKay said school would not commence until Wednesday, for tomorrow a snow is expected to be here.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 As the Baptist college does not commence until February we sent Willie to the Male Academy with Frank, but that school does not commence until Monday.\'a0 If we like it, Willie can continue there, but if he does not improve, we will send him to the college when it commences.\'a0Mr. Hillhouse keeps school in Dr. Irvines building back of the Baptist church.\'a0 Mr. Gailliard I believe is not going to keep school.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Today I intended sending or carrying my box with my Cloak to Mrs. Robinson to take to town for me, & I have enclosed in a letter to you, my gold chain, for you to wear with your Medallion, when you take tea out, & a gold pencil case I bought once for myself, but it was too large for a lady, & I have never used it.\'a0 I send it, that you may make it a present to your cousin William Edward from yourself, as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mothers roof.\'a0 If he has \ul no\ulnone  \ul gold\ulnone  \ul pencil\ulnone  \ul case\ulnone . Give it to him. but if he \ul has\ulnone  one, this will be of no use to him, so I will think of something else for you to give.\'a0 I will write you about giving Aunt Eliza a present, & also Eliza & Susan.\'a0 I will send the letter enclosing the pencil case & chain by Butler Thompson, who carries down Mrs. Robinson or by anyone I can hear of going \ul before\ulnone .\'a0 I hope I can send it soon.\'a0 I will tomorrow, if the weather permits go up to Mrs. Thompsons to carry the box & letter, & inquire when Mrs. Robinson goes.\'a0I hope you are \ul satisfied\ulnone  & not disappointed your Papa is not going down as he first intended.\'a0 His being sick, & Aunt Eliza, Eliza, & yourself all writing to ask you should stay, I have written & suppose you have received the letters, saying you might.\'a0 I hope your longer stay will enable you to see those friends, who have been in the country, & perhaps returned by this time.\'a0 What do your friends think of the Daguerreotype?\'a0 Do they think \ul yours\ulnone  a \ul good\ulnone  likeness?\'a0 None of the others did justice.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I would be very glad if you would learn to embroider& embroider clothes for yourself, & Fanny, Hext & your Aunt Susy\'92s children.\'a0 If not \ul too\ulnone  \ul hard\ulnone  you must learn.\'a0 I wish you could learn as you grow older every kind of work, like your cousins Eliza & Susan.\'a0 It makes you so useful, & happy, & it is such a resource & makes the time up pleasantly.\'a0 I hope in time you will knit, Crochet, embroider, & do every kind of work, so if \ul convenient\ulnone , commence now, & learn as much as you can while in town.\'a0 If it does not give your cousins trouble to teach you, you are so \ul quick\ulnone  in everything I think you can learn easily.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 You will be perfect in playing your peices on the Piano, practicing them so much, perhaps you will learn a new peice.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I am afraid the box will not come for a long time.\'a0 A box your Papa packed in Columbia when \ul he was\ulnone  there, has not come yet.\'a0 The bad roads cause delays.\'a0 You will have to hang up a \ul bag\ulnone  for Fanny, if you expect the box of furniture to surprise her.\'a0 A stocking would be too small.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Your Papa is getting a great deal better.\'a0 Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Susan, & thank them again for being so kind to you.\'a0\'a0\'a0 I am glad you were able to visit alone.\'a0 You will learn to be independent.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Annie slept here night before last, but she would go home yesterday, or I would have kept her longer.\'a0 None of your Grandmama\'92s family were able to come in to church yesterday.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have been disappointed today in not hearing from you, but suppose you were prevented writing by some engagement, & as I have said before, I never wish you to write to me when anything occurs to make it inconvenient.\'a0 I received two letters from you yesterday.\'a0 I wrote to Eliza & Aunt Mary McCall, which left me no time to write to you.\'a0 I sent Aunt Mary 49 dollars to pay my bill, which I am very glad she will soon receive.\'a0 I disliked being in debt to her so long.\'a0 If your Papa comes in before I close this letter, I will get some money from him & send it to you.\'a0 I would send to his office, but persons are generally there & he dislikes being interrupted by messages.\'a0 If I do not send the money today, I will tomorrow. I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.\'a0 Miss Drayton has been very kind to you.\'a0 I suppose you know the Fords are cousins of yours.\'a0 You have so many relations, you might stay in town a long time, before you found them all over.\'a0 The patterns of your Cloak & dress are beautiful.\'a0 The dress much prettier than the blue one Aunt Mary sent me. & well worth 64 cts more a yard.\'a0 A Cloak as \ul dark\ulnone  as yours would have just suited me.\'a0 I am very anxious to receive Fanny\'92s.\'a0 She has not been to church yet, for she has nothing to wear [&] if the box does not come soon, I will have to buy her a dress here.\'a0 The Cloak I hope will come by some private opportunity.\'a0 My Cloak Aunt Mary will change for a black Cape, about one yard deep, which she says will be very comfortable.\'a0 I can wear it this winter for dress, & next winter I hope get a handsome cloak.\'a0 As soon as the box arrives I will let you know. \'a0The bad roads will delay it for a long time.\'a0 Our Groceries I dare say will not be here for weeks or months. Fanny went to school today.\'a0 Willie & Frank will go Monday.\'a0 Mr. Rosemond has commenced building the new kitchen.\'a0 It is to be joined to the old one, & have four rooms, two below for a kitchen & ironing room, & two above for chambers.\'a0 The kitchen we have been working in so long, will be a general sitting room for the servants, so our kitchen can be kept clean, & the Cellar will be kept as a Lumber room.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Lindy is still over at Mamma\'92s & Sarah Green is not a good servant, so your Grandmama hears, & I expect she will be obliged to keep Lindy.\'a0 Susy has the Measles.\'a0 I would be very sorry for Lindy\'92s baby to take it, but it must now take its chance; for I am obliged to let Lindy stay there, Mama having ho servant to cook.\'a0 R\'85 is hired to Mrs. Charles Roberts.\'a0 There was a Circus here yesterday, & an animal show.\'a0 The two shows connected together.\'a0 The children went & were delighted.\'a0 More ladies must have been at it, than I have ever known before from what the children say, & I hear Ministers even were there, Mr. Buist & Mr. Mims.\'a0 The say it was an uncommonly good performance.\'a0 I saw nothing of it.\'a0 The band did not [page torn] down the street as they generally do. Your Aunt Annie is as poorly as ever, & as much opposed to your Aunt Susy & the children being there.\'a0 I do not know anyone more dreadfully situated than your Grandmama.\'a0 The walking being so bad, & the horses all the time hauling wood.\'a0 I have been there very little, & your Grandmama scarcely ever can have her horses, as they are all the time hauling wood, & Aunt Annie does not like her to leave her for one moment.\'a0 I have not paid any visits since you left.\'a0 Writing has been my principal occupation, & Eliza being still confined to her room, I am obliged to sew.\'a0 Clara made my blue dress, not as well as Eliza, & the other one I am keeping for Eliza to make.\'a0 The baby is well, & so is Eliza, but she will not be out of her room for two weeks yet.\'a0 Clara is now working for Mamma & Ann & Susan.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Susan Hoke says she has repeatedly written to Augustus Hoke to go & see you, & she thinks he cannot have received the letters, & so does not know you are in town, but it is no consequence\'a0 whether he goes or not, except it is rather ungrateful in him not to go & see Aunt Eliza who was kind enough to invite him to tea; but I dare say he feels awkward, not being accustomed to visit among ladies.\'a0I am glad you are learning independence & visiting alone.\'a0 A little girl may be modest, & yet at the same time be easy & independent, & able to act for herself.\'a0 I am glad also you \ul play \ulnone for your friends on the Piano.\'a0 It is right to begin at once, & be obliging, & not refuse, which generally proceeds from affectation & a too great desire to please.\'a0 They refuse, because they are afraid they will not excite admiration enough, though sometimes it is from awkwardness.\'a0 I am glad to hear that you are obliged & able to entertain your friends.\'a0 I hope you will play \ul well\ulnone  when you return.\'a0 It is no consequence whether you work much on your quilt \ul now\ulnone .\'a0 You will have plenty of time to finish it when you return.\'a0Mrs. Beattie & Mrs. Henry Earle have been here since I commenced writing.\'a0 Mr. Mauldin I hear is much better.\'a0 He is still in Columbia.\'a0 Mrs. Joab Mauldin stays with Mrs. Mauldin.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Sally & L\'85 Cleveand are going to school at the Limestone Springs, & Mrs. Cleveland is going in the county.\'a0 Your Papa has not come home since I commenced writing, & I sent Fanny to his office this moment, & two gentlemen are there, so I cannot send the money today, but will soon.I hope you are behaving so well, as still to merit the good opinion of your friends.\'a0 I sent the box with the Cloak & a letter containing the chain & pencil case by Mr. John Jones last night.\'a0 I had sent the bonnet & petticoat before I got your letter saying you did not need them.\'a0 Fanny says she likes school.\'a0 There are a great many scholars, Vardry & Annie go.\'a0 Give my love to Aunt Eliza & my cousins.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\'a0

\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Yesterday afternoon I set off to walk to your Grandmama\'92s, but before I got halfway, I met Susan herself coming in, so I turned back, & was very glad to, for the ground was very damp, & I had on thin Gaiters.\'a0This afternoon Jenny Carson is to have company.\'a0 Susan told me Annie was to go. & this morning, Miss Malinda, to my great surprise, sent to ask Willie & Frank to go.\'a0 I thought she would not have asked any of my family, but I am glad she did, as I hope she feels kindly to them, so I sent word Willie & Frank should go with pleasure.\'a0 They go at 4 oclock this afternoon.\'a0Mr. Leary was to leave Greenville today.\'a0 Mr. Irwin told your Papa, Mr. Leary said, Willie understood what was taught him, better than any boy he knew of, & his chief regret in\'a0 going away, was leaving Willie & George Wells.\'a0 Willie was to have gone to the Baptist College but it commences in February, so in the meantime he will go to the Academy, & if he improves, I hope your Papa will continue him there.\'a0 Mr. Thomas & Mr. Hillhouse are both to be in the Academy.\'a0 Mr. Thomas teach[es] the large, & Mr. Hillhouse the small boys.\'a0 Frank is very sorry at this arrangement.\'a0 He wishes Mr. Thomas to teach him.\'a0 A Catalogue of the Students of the Furman Institution has been published & \'93B. Franklin Perry,\'94 is among them.\'a0Fanny has gone to school again today.\'a0 Johnny walks with her.\'a0 I think she likes it quite well.\'a0 She has bought a Copy book & a lead pencil & a Primer.\'a0 Annie came in after Fanny left with Permilla & went to school.\'a0 Julia Sharp goes to school, & the Brookes, & Eliza Lynch & a good many.\'a0 Miss Hopkins teaches in Mr. Crofts old house.\'a0 Miss Bessileau lives there now.\'a0 I have not heard how many students she has, or who they are.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Tom Butler has sold his place to Mr. Campbell, & bought that small place of Jimmy Gallows on the Anderson road beyond Abram Willimans.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Mr. John Jones left last night, & not the night before as I had expected.\'a0 He came in the village Tuesday evening too late for the Stage.\'a0 I hope my cloak is now on the road, & will soon be safe in Mr. Reeds store.\'a0 In future I will have to write to your cousin Eliza to shop for us.\'a0 She understands what suits us, better than Aunt Mary.\'a0 She has shopped well for you.\'a0 She & Susan are smart to be able to make bonnets for themselves.\'a0 You must learn to work for yourself in the same way. I mean as you grow older.\'a0 Velvet bonnets are very pretty & lasting.\'a0 If you make yourself \ul useful\ulnone , you will always be happy.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Mr. Smith who was in Browning & Semans Store has returned on account of Cholera.\'a0 He must be a great \ul coward\ulnone .\'a0 He asked Willie if \ul you\ulnone  had returned, said he saw you almost every day in Charleston.\'a0 He came so near death last summer with Typhoid fever, I suppose it alarmed him, & he now wishes to be very careful.\'a0 Cholera not being infectious, is not advancing as other diseases, for if a person lives prudently, there is scarce any danger of taking it.

\fs32 Mrs. Henry Earle said her son William\'a0 told her if she would ask, when \ul you \ulnone were going to return, he would drive her.\'a0 I told her you were enjoying yourself so much you had no wish to return yet, & I might have added unless her son, was a very \ul fine\ulnone  young man, he need\'85no thought on \ul you\ulnone  \ul now\ulnone  or \ul ever\ulnone , for it is\'a0 much better for a lady to remain \ul single\ulnone , than to \ul marry\ulnone , unless the gentleman has \ul every\ulnone  \ul quality\ulnone  to make her happy, & a happy single lady is far more to be \ul envied\ulnone  than an unhappy married one.\'a0 Eliza & Susan are as happy as anyone can be.\'a0\'a0 They are useful members of society. & afford pleasure to so many friends, & have so much resource, that I dare say they do not know an unhappy moment.\'a0 How much better is their situation than Mrs. Hume Simmons, your Aunt Suzy\'92s & many others.

\fs32  Mrs. Westfield\'92s mother Mrs. Stokes is dead, & was buried Tuesday afternoon.\'a0 Col. Dunham\'92s health is very bad, & he is not expected to live long. I will give your love to the Mauldins.\'a0They do not go to school yet.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Your Papa has given me \ul 40 dollars\ulnone , 15 of it you must keep to pay your expenses home, which will leave 25 dollars for you to spend.\'a0 When Eliza sends another list, I will know whether this will be enough or not.\'a0 I do not think I will write for anything more.\'a0 Our Groceries set off at a time the Rail Road was out of order & brought no freight, so they were sent to Hamburg to come up in wagons which has caused their delay, the roads being so bad wagons for the present are not travelling.\'a0 The box set off about that time, & I suppose was sent also to Hamburg.\'a0 Now the R[ail] Road is in order except the \ul bridge\ulnone  & freight comes more quicky, so I am sorry over Groceries & the box did not wait until now.\'a0 The freight also from Hamburg is so high, the groceries will cost a great deal.\'a0 In future we will always get in the Spring.\'a0 Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza & beg her to write & to Eliza & Susan & beg Eliza to write.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received a letter from you this morning, & was very glad to hear, you are still enjoying yourself as much as ever.\'a0 The excursion to the island will be delightful, & I hope you will have as pleasant weather, as we now have.\'a0 Today is delightful, just like Spring.\'a0 You will find it quite a novelty to be on the water.\'a0 I am glad you passed a pleasant evening at Mrs. Cunninghams.\'a0 Before you leave, you must go & see her, & give my love to her. & ask when Pamela & Mrs. Cunningham are going to return from the North.\'a0 I believe they are still there, & tell Emma you have the cup & saucer she sent you.\'a0 It is now in the Drawing room. I sent you yesterday 40 dollars.\'a0 I \ul directed\ulnone  the letter to Eliza, but the letter was \ul written\ulnone  to you.\'a0 I hope you will receive the money safe.\'a0 You ought to get it tomorrow evening, after you return from the island.\'a0 As soon as you receive it, write & tell me, as I will be uneasy until I hear.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 If your Papa has the key to the Carpet bag, I will send it by Butler Thompson.\'a0 He goes Monday I believe.\'a0 Eliza mentioned your having bought a key for the bag, so If your Papa has not the key, I hope the one you have bought will answer. If you would buy some of the things I have written for, & send by John Jones & Butler Thompson, I will be very glad, for I need them, the Gaiter boots, Fanny\'92s cloak, the 12 \'bd cts Calico for my dress, the Mits, the lacets for Gaiters, & as much as they can bring.\'a0 My cloak & Fanny\'92s cloak at any rate I hope they can bring.\'a0 Having sent for so many things, I have not bought anything here, & am in want particularly of the Calico for the dress, but if inconvenient to get & send before you come, I can wait.\'a0 Your trunk will be so full that I expect you will be glad to send beforehand as many things as possible.\'a0 Mr. Elford was to have got 13 stair case rods, but he did not.\'a0 If they could be put in your trunk. I would write for them & send the measure, but I expect you would not have room. I would like you soon to get the work box for Aunt Eliza.\'a0 Get Eliza to choose it for you, & also one for yourself, but they must be \ul useful\ulnone  ones, such as will really be of use to hold thread, needles & everything used in work.\'a0 Make it a present to Aunt Eliza in \ul your\ulnone  name, & tell her to always keep it to remember you by.\'a0 I think it a better present than a writing desk, but you can consult Eliza.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 I hope before this you have received the box with the Cloak, & the letter with the chain & pencil.\'a0 I am sorry I sent the petticoat & bonnet, your visit being lengthened, I thought you would need them, & sent then before you wrote word I must not.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Willie & Frank went to Mrs. McBee\'92s yesterday afternoon & staid until late at night.\'a0 There were a great many children there.\'a0 The boys played in the yard, & the girls in a room.\'a0 Fanny has gone to school.\'a0 Hext is quite well.\'a0 I send you a peice of poetry on the death of Mr. Elford\'92s children.\'a0 I do not know who wrote it.\'a0 Show it to Aunt Eliza.\'a0 Your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy have just been here.\'a0 Your Aunt Suzy begs me to ask your cousin Eliza not to forget to buy her a \ul bag \ulnone she wrote for suitable to use at church & two \ul alpacca\ulnone \'a0 \ul Aprons\ulnone , such as your cousin Susan mentioned were worn.\'a0 They all send their love. & say they would write to you, but they have nothing to write about. I hope you will see Aunt Harriet before you leave, but I am afraid you will not, & perhaps not see Aunt Anna or Aunt Martha either.\'a0 I am glad you have seen Aunt Susan, & that Paul & his wife you may see, as they have returned.\'a0 This season of the year almost all who can go in the country, & many pass the whole winter there. I am glad Eloisa has returned, & that you will become acquainted with her family.\'a0 Sarah also I hope you will see.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Your cousins Cloaks I expect are very pretty, & more useful than the light one Aunt Mary got me.\'a0 The black cape I dare say is comfortable.\'a0 That will be its recommendation, & after this winter I will wear it in common, & as I will not next winter have to get either bonnet or dress, I can afford to get a handsome cloak.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32  Mr. Smith the Jeweller sent me yesterday as a present a white velvet Emory.\'a0 I will give it to you, for your work box.\'a0 I mean to put in it & sharpen your needles.\'a0 Your Grandmama says, Lindy is not able to get through her work, so she is going to hire Maria who she had once before from Mrs. Pearson.\'a0 Lindy\'92s baby she thinks has the Measles.\'a0 I was very sorry to let Lindy go there, feeling certain the baby would take the Measles, & knowing Lindy would not suit, but situated as your Grandmama was, I felt compelled to oblige her, & run the risk of Measles, & now after all , Lindy as I supposed does not suit.\'a0 She will have to remain there until the child gets well, for if she returns Hext & Eliza\'92s baby will take it, & Dr. Crooks said I must not let Hext go near them.\'a0 Little Clarissa was just beginning to grow well & improve, & has been so delicate, the Measles will go hard with it.\'a0 Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & beg her to write to me, & tell me all about you, & give my love to Eliza & Susan, & beg them to write, & my love to Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna.\'a0 It must have been a release to Miss Elizabeth Lee to leave this world.\'a0 Mr. Mauldin is still in Columbia.
\fs29\fsmilli14667  
\fs32 Your Papa is a great deal better & would write to you, but as I write every day, there seems no necessity for him to.\'a0 I generally have some business to write about.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

\fs32 \'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have been busy all day & not able to write, but as no Mail leaves on Saturday, the Cars not running Sunday, it is no consequence my not having written today.\'a0 This letter will go tomorrow.\'a0 I send a letter every day except Saturday when no Mail goes.\'a0 This is the day you were to go to the island.\'a0 I hope you have had as pleasant weather as we have here.\'a0 It is like Spring but so warm, I am afraid it will rain soon.\'a0 You must give me an account of your experience.\'a0 I know you will enjoy it. I hope this evening you will have received my letter containing 40 dollars, 15 dollars of it is to pay your expenses home.\'a0 I will see from the next list Eliza sends me whether the remainder is enough to buy the things I have written for. There is no danger of the children seeing the toys before you return.\'a0 The roads are so bad, the box will not come for a long time.\'a0 It set off before the R[ail] Road was repaired, so had to come by way of Hamburg.\'a0 If it had set off now it would have come on the R[ail] Road to Laurens, & we would have got it sooner.\'a0 If I had known there would be such a delay, I would not have sent for so many things for myself & the children, & instead sent \ul you\ulnone  the money to spend.\'a0 They will come so late, we could have done without some of the things this winter.\'a0 However I will have less to buy next winter.\'a0 I received a letter from you today.\'a0 I am always glad to hear from you.\'a0 You seem to be enjoying yourself as much as ever.\'a0 I would like to see Professor Anderson.\'a0 I wish you would get him to come here. You must thank Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna in my name for the books they have given you.\'a0 The Listener I think I read long ago.\'a0 I will be glad to read it again; the other book I will also like to read. I received today a letter from Aunt Mary McCall.\'a0 She says she has got me the black cape & had to pay 2 dollars, because the man said it was a disadvantage to change the cloaks.\'a0 The light cloak was 21 dollars.\'a0 The 2 dollars added to change it, makes the Cape 23 dollars.\'a0 Your cousin Eliza\'92s, you say was about 15 dollars, 8 dollars less than my Cape, so you can tell me which you think the best bargain, but I am glad to get something \ul useful\ulnone  on any terms.\'a0 Aunt Mary said, the day she wrote, she intended carrying the Cape to Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 I hope you will send it to me by the \ul first \ulnone opportunity, & Fanny\'92s Cloak also, by Mr. Jones or Butler Thompson, the first that returns.\'a0 I walked to your Grandmama\'92s this afternoon.\'a0 Willie went with me, & Reuben came for me in the carri[a]ge.\'a0 Your Aunt Annie begged me to say to your cousin Eliza that \ul she \ulnone wished \ul all \ulnone the Music she had sent, & in addition begged her to get \'93Nelly was a Lady,\'94 set in a peice arranged in the prettiest way, so she writes \ul all\ulnone  the Music charged to her 1 dollars worth she prefers taking it all.\'a0 It is well, for perhaps Mr. Bacon would prefer giving you peices of his own selection, but if you see any peices you would like to get, to learn after you return you can get them. All at your Grandmama\'92s were as well as usual, except Suzy.\'a0 She has had the Measles.\'a0 Alex & Vardry were there.\'a0 Clara is working for Susan & Ann.\'a0\'a0 \'85 inquired particularly after you, & sends her \ul treble\ulnone  love; all send their love.\'a0 I told \'85 you had sent her a handkerchief.\'a0 I told Flora Hoke this morning that one was coming in the box for her.\'a0 You must get a handkerchief for each of Aunt Eliza\'92s women, like those you have sent, & you had better soon get the work box & give to Aunt Eliza.\'a0 Mr. John Hodges is dead.\'a0 He died of typhoid fever.\'a0 Your Papa saw him in Columbia & says he looked as well & healthy as possible.\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is very sick.\'a0 I believe her lungs are affected.\'a0 I have not heard that it is so, but I know they were once, so suppose it is the case now.\'a0 I have not visited her for a long time, but as she is so sick I have some thoughts of riding tomorrow to see her, calling for your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy to go in the afternoon.\'a0 I hope Alston will name his son Robert after his father & the \ul next\ulnone  one after himself. Lindy came home today.\'a0 The child has a cold, but I hope not the Measles.\'a0 I will let her go very often & help your Grandmama.\'a0 She can make ginger cake for her, & bread, & help in other ways.\'a0 Maria I hope will do well.\'a0 She has no child, which is an advantage.\'a0 I wish your Grandmama to have a good servant.\'a0 I did not think Lindy would do, for she is willing but not capable & efficient, & has rheumatism, so sometimes she can hardly walk, & has also to attend to her child. Mr. Randolph has moved into Col. Town[e]s house next door, & Col. Goodlett lives in Mr. Brooks house, where Mr. Randolph has moved from.\'a0 He is to keep a boarding house.\'a0 Col. Goodlett says Mr. Randolph left the house in such a condition, it required a \ul hoe\ulnone  to \ul scrape
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \ulnone  the \ul dirt \ulnone from the floor.\'a0 It is well Aunt Eliza did not board with \ul him \ulnone last summer.\'a0 If she had, she would have been disgusted with Greenville.\'a0 It was fortunate she found rooms at Mrs. \'85.\'a0 Cornelia Ioor has sent me some Pecan nuts, by your Papa.\'a0 They are coming in a box from Columbia, but I do not know when they will reach here.\'a0 I am glad the ginger has proved useful.\'a0 I sent for a Jar for your Grandmama, & one for your Aunt Suzy, & one for myself.\'a0 These are my Christmas presents.\'a0 It is cheaper to buy ginger preserves, than to \ul make \ulnone preserves.\'a0 Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, & thank them for their kindness to you.\'a0 My love to Aunt Mary & Anna & all my friends.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I received letters from your cousin Eliza & yourself yesterday.\'a0 Thank Eliza for hers, & as she says she will soon write again, beg her to, & I will write to her.\'a0 You have really passed your time pleasantly.\'a0 Your friends have been very kind to you.\'a0 I feel indebted to all of them, but more especially to your Aunt Eliza & her family.\'a0 Thanks Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna for the presents you say they have sent to the children, & thank Aunt Mary McCall for her presents.\'a0 She has been very kind.\'a0 I will send her the 2 dollars, she had to pay for changing the Cloak.\'a0 Your Aunt Suzy wishes to know the \ul price \ulnone of the black cape.\'a0 I do not know, as it cost me on account changing 23 dollars, so at Mr. Reed\'92s, inquire the \ul price\ulnone  that I may tell Susan.\'a0 You say I had better send a list of the articles I wish purchased, so I will.\'a0 I have almost forgotten what I have written for, you can add what I have overlooked.\'a0 The work box for your Aunt & yourself you must \ul first\ulnone  get, then what I have put on the list, & after that the Candy, cocoa nut cake & little presents you intended getting.\'a0 The 40 dollars I hope you have received, the 15 taken out for your expenses back leaves 25 dollars.\'a0 Eliza wrote word yesterday I must send 25, so I am glad you have exactly that sum.\'a0 It may not be enough, as I have written for knives, so if it is not let me know.\'a0 Tooth powder I cannot get here.\'a0 Be sure & bring 3 boxes of powdered Charcoal.\'a0 I used to get it 20 cts a box; not \ul paste\ulnone , but merely \ul powdered Charcoal\ulnone .\'a0 One of the boxes is for you.\'a0 If you have not got it yet, get it immediately & \ul use\ulnone , the \ul two \ulnone others bring home.\'a0 Sally Hoke came here this morning, & her teeth looked so black, it reminded me of telling \ul you\ulnone  to attend to yours.\'a0 I suppose you have not needed any Sarsaparilla.\'a0 The Lacets for Gaiters though trifling is important,\'a0 for every morning now I am delayed trying to lace with a \ul pin\ulnone , & then have to give up, & wrap the lacet round the boot, the tins come off, & the tinners here put on such large ones, they will not go trough the holes.\'a0 I send a button for you to get one dozen like 18 \'be cts.\'a0 Ask Aunt Mary McCall where she got it.\'a0 She did not send enough.\'a0 The Calico you sent in the box for your Aunt Annie, If it comes soon, I may take, if \ul you \ulnone are \ul willing \ulnone to make myself a dress to wear at home.\'a0 I need it very much, & your Aunt Annie has just had a worsted Gown made to wear at home. & bought a Calico one, & Clara is to make it for her.\'a0 I have made \ul none \ulnone to wear at home yet.\'a0 The \ul two \ulnone I have got, are what I sent patterns to you of.\'a0 The \ul blue \ulnone one is made & I wear to church, but if you prefer my \ul not \ulnone taking the Calico, you must say so.\'a0 I have written to Eliza to get me Calico for a dress, but it will be long before I get it, through I am very much afraid the box also will not be here soon.\'a0After you have purchased my list, & sent me an account, if you remain long enough, I may write for a few more things, two \ul nice\ulnone  pocket handkerchiefs, about 37 \'bd\'a0 apeice or the peice Susan, but cost 43 \'be, & your Papa wishes Linen for shirts which I may write for.\'a0 Send up as many things as you can by private opportunities, Mr. Jones & Thompson.\'a0 I hope before this my cloak has arrived safely & that I will soon get the other one.\'a0 When the ginger gives out, if you would like it, you can get your Aunt another Jar. I am glad you have fine weather now.\'a0 At least I suppose you have, as we have now delightful weather like Spring.\'a0 Yesterday was cloudy & drizzly, so we did not go to church.\'a0 In the morning your Grandmama sent to ask how Mrs. Sam town[e]s was & she is very ill, & not able to see anyone.\'a0 Her lungs are affected, & she can scarcely speak.\'a0 The roads to her house are almost impassable. So we did not go to see her, but if she gets better we will go.\'a0Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.\'a0 Tell her \ul you\ulnone  write about \ul others\ulnone , & wish to hear from \ul her \ulnone about \ul you.\ulnone  I hope the Cholera will not increase.\'a0 If it becomes alarming, I suppose Mary Crayton will immediately return, & you would come with her.\'a0 Let me know when you think she will return, if she will soon or not, if she will return this month. Willie & Frank commenced school today, both at the Academy.\'a0 Mr. Hillhouse teaches Frank, Mr. Thomas Willie.\'a0 Willie has come back already, & says Mr. Thomas, as yet has only two scholars, George Wells & himself.\'a0 He is to buy more books today, & go back again this afternoon. I will go to see Mrs. Mauldin, & ask when her daughters are going.\'a0\'a0 You say you saw pretty key baskets.\'a0 If you choose you can get one as a present to your Aunt Suzy or Annie or for yourself, or for me.\'a0 It will not come amiss.\'a0 If they are \ul reasonable\ulnone , but if you prefer it, get something else.\'a0 The\'85of baskets Mr. Elford has got me.\'a0 I may spare some of them to your Grandmama as presents.\'a0 I think he said he had got a nest, but I may be mistaken, for I thought he had got knives & rods which he has not. You must excuse my shabby looking letter.\'a0 I am busy & often write so hurriedly I am almost ashamed to send my letters.\'a0 You must take Aunt Eliza & Eliza as your examples for neat writing, not me.\'a0 My gold pen is bent, & writes badly, which is my excuse.\'a0 I will send the carpet bag key by Butler Thompson.\'a0 Mrs. Robinson sent word she was going Wednesday.\'a0 I suppose he will go with her.\'a0 I will write a few lines by him.\'a0 I will soon write to Eliza.\'a0 If you would like it, you can buy a \ul pretty\ulnone  \ul work\ulnone  \ul basket\ulnone  \ul apiece \ulnone for your cousins Eliza & Susan, & not get any to bring home.\'a0 The nest of baskets will do for us. Give my kindest love to your Aunt & cousins & thank them for being so kind to you., & giving you so much pleasure, enough to think of & talk of a long time.\'a0 My love to my other friends.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry Buy some large sheets of letter paper & write longer letters.\'a0 \ul Burn\ulnone  up \ul my \ulnone letter.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received two letters from you, & must answer them immediately, for the Mail now closes at 12 oclock, & the letters must be just in sooner than heretofore.\'a0 I hear very regularly from you, every day except Monday when no Mail comes, & you ought to hear every day from me except Monday, so Monday you get no letter from me. Your friends have all been as kind as possible to you,\'a0 You must thank Aunt Brewton for the present you say she has sent Willie, & tell her I hope her Godson will do credit to her.\'a0 If he is as \ul good\ulnone  as he is \ul smart\ulnone , there will be no fear but what he will.\'a0 I do not say so from \ul vanity\ulnone , but from the opinion \ul all \ulnone his Teachers have expressed, & not to \ul me\ulnone , but to \ul others \ulnone have they expressed it, so I know it is their real opinion.\'a0 Your Papa also has a high opinion of Willie\'92s mind, & he has a good judgement, & no vanity, either for himself or his children. Thank your cousin Eloisa for the cup & saucer.\'a0 It is in a box of paper &c. your Papa had packed in Columbia but it has not come yet.\'a0 The roads are in so dreadful a condition no waggons are transporting goods, either from the Laurens R[ail] Road, or the box would have come on from Hamburg, where our groceries are at present & the box with them that Aunt Eliza had packed.\'a0\'a0 Today your Papa received a letter from Jeffers & Cothran the factors who are to forward the boxes, & they say since Christmas no waggons have come, that the streets present every day the appearance of the Sabbath, & from the accounts they hear of the roads, it will continue so a long time, but by the \ul first \ulnone opportunity they will send on the boxes.\'a0 If I had imagined this delay, I would have done without several things I wrote for, & sent you the money instead, or bought things for summer use.\'a0 F\'85 & my bonnets, we will have to put up for next winter.\'a0 You will be here at the opening of the box I have no doubt, & witness the joy of the children.\'a0 A person in Mobile is writing sketches of distinguished men, & mentions Uncle Robert.\'a0 In a Columbia paper there is an extract in which Aunt Brewton is mentioned.\'a0 It will be published in the Patriot.\'a0 I will cut it out & send to you, & you can give it to Aunt Brewton.\'a0 Perhaps she has seen it, [but] if not, it will gratify her, to see honorable mention made of one whose memory she reveres as she does Uncle Roberts. It was kind in Eloisa to say, she would like to have you stay with her.\'a0 I appreciate her kind intention.\'a0 You must go often to see her, & Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha & Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna Hayne, & any friend Aunt Eliza tells you to go & see. I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick, & Paul\'92s wife in delicate health.\'a0 Give my love to Aunt Emily when you next see her, & Aunt Susan, Aunt Brewton, Aunt Elizabeth & Uncle Arthur, Aunts in Logan st. & Meeting st.\'a0 Your Papa is now quite well.\'a0 All at your Grandmama\'92s are the same as usual.\'a0 Clara works every day for them.\'a0 I help them in that way, as much as I can, & work for myself.\'a0 Margaret at present can spare her.\'a0 Eliza has not worked for me since the birth of her baby, but will again next week.\'a0 Lindy is at home, at present with her child to attend to.\'a0 No one will hire her, but next summer we will get her a place. The new kitchen is building, & when it is done, our servants will be comfortably accommodated, & we will have a nice kitchen for our own use.\'a0 No one but the cook to stay in & an ironing room, for no purpose but ironing.\'a0 The two new chambers, Eliza & Lindy will have.\'a0 If Minerva wishes it, she can come over & sleep in the room Eliza now has.\'a0 Charles will either sleep in the cellar or the old kitchen, & the small house, you shall again have to keep as a play house.\'a0 Mr. Rosemond will repair it.\'a0 I will give Fanny the press in the little dining room as a baby house & put in the play house, all the toys you have bought her, shall stay there.\'a0 If you had kept all the presents ever given you, how many you would have had.\'a0 Begin now & keep them all carefully.\'a0 When you have bought the list I have sent you, I hope to send some more money.\'a0 Have you spent the 5 dollars you took out of your Bank.\'a0 Send as many things by Mr. Jones or Thompson as they can bring.\'a0 I expect you spent a delightful day at the island.\'a0 Your Aunt & cousins have been so kind in trying to gratify you in every way.\'a0 You must tell them I thank them for their kindness to you.\'a0 Tell them not to give themselves any trouble on your account.\'a0 The visiting among your friends, & seeing them, is an enjoyment to you & Greenville is so quiet.\'a0 A walk up King st.\'a0 is such a contrast to a walk here that it affords you delight.\'a0 The shells we will be glad of, & something new in Greenville.\'a0 You must keep them as a curiosity.\'a0 I am sorry you have not seen your cousin Sarah Taylor yet.\'a0 If you do, tell her the Scripture Biography she gave Willie, I find very useful in reading to the children & servants on Sunday, & tell Eloisa the basket she gave me in town, I use even now as a key basket. I saw in the Courier that your Papa had been alluded to by Mr. John Preston.\'a0 In Columbia last winter Professor Thornwell\'92s brother pointed to your Papa & said \'93See that person, two years ago, he was avoided by Politicians as death, & now he has more influence in the Legislature, than any other Member, & more coveted by aspirants.\'94\'a0 Your Papa has always acted independently, & in acting as he thought right, has gone against his own interests, which proves his sincerity.\'a0 Such conduct always in the end begets esteem, & he has in his opinion the best reward, a good conscience & his own self respect. Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.\'a0 Their kindness I will never forget.\'a0 Ask Aunt Eliza to write to me.\'a0 I will write to Eliza tomorrow.\'a0 Go & see Mary Crayton, & let me know when she expects to return.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you a long letter this morning.\'a0 I now write only a few lines.\'a0 I will send them by Butler Thompson & send the key you asked for.\'a0 I will send this letter to Mrs. Robinson & she will give it to Butler Thompson, who I suppose is going with her.\'a0 His father a week or two ago said he was.\'a0 The weather is now clouding over & we will soon have rain again.\'a0 Write word when Mary Crayton intends returning so I may know when to expect you.\'a0 I suppose this month she will return.\'a0 Your cousin Eliza said about the 20
\fs24\fsmilli12222 \super th
\fs29\fsmilli14667 \nosupersub  of this month.\'a0Fanny goes to school, but she prefers staying at home.\'a0 She will like it better when you go with her.\'a0 I sent to ask Mrs. Mauldin when her daughters were going to school & she sent word, they were not going at all.\'a0 I sent Aunt Mary today the 2 dollars she paid for changing the Cloak.\'a0 I hope you have received the 40 dollars I sent you safely.\'a0 I write so hurriedly, you must tear up my letters, tear up this one.\'a0 I write so much & have other things to do, I write in haste.\'a0 Be a good girl.\'a0 I hope Mr. Jones or Thompson will bring the Cloak.\'a0 Mr. & Mrs. Bacon came to see me this morning & inquired about you.\'a0 I told then what Mrs. O\'92Driscoll said, & that you practiced every day.\'a0 Mr. Bacon says he has only 3 scholars now that for a short time in summer he had 23, but he ought to have 30 scholars the whole year round to afford him a support, that if he did not get more scholars he could not live here, but this climate agreed with his health, so he hoped he could get enough to enable him to stay.\'a0 I hope he will find you improved.\'a0 He says he has no objection to your buying any pretty peices for yourself.\'a0 Your Grandmama & Aunts send their affectionate love.\'a0 Your Grandmama says you write wonderfully well.\'a0 She is pleased at Aunt Brewton remembering Willie.\'a0 Give my love to your Aunts & cousins, whose kindness to you has been very great, & I know you feel grateful, & will never forget it, & when in your power return it.\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is better & Mr. Hodges through very low, is not dead.\'a0 The report was not a mistake. You must soon buy the work box for Aunt Eliza as a testimony of your love for her, & a proof you feel gratified for her kindness.\'a0 Your affectionate mother, E.F. Perry P.S.\'a0 Get a Cornelian ring for yourself & one for \ul Fanny\ulnone .\'a0 Her silver comb I will give to \ul Annie\ulnone , which is more valuable than a ring.\'a0 Buy 2 dolls for Fanny & Annie.\'a0 You can dress them when you return & a small doll to L\'85a knife with 2 blades for Willie & Frank, \ul not \ulnone expensive ones.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 \'85like to get for yourself you may.\'a0 The knives for Willie & Frank need not be fine ones, as they will soon lose them.\'a0 Put on paper a list of what I have mentioned in this letter.\'a0 Your Aunt Annie wishes \'93Nelly was a Lady[.\'93]\'a0 The 75 cts for Music that was charged to you, your Grandmama wishes to add to her bit, so that 75 cts you will have to add to your money to buy something with.\'a0 I you need a thick pr of shoes for \ul school\ulnone , you had best get them now.\'a0 I hope to be able to get some more pocket handkerchiefs, as need more.\'a0 If I write for them, I will wish some at 16 cts, for you, & \ul marked \ulnone with \ul your name\ulnone \'a0 & some for 25 cts marked with \ul mine\ulnone .\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & sent word she would be glad to see me.\'a0 At the time Mr. Town[e]s was abusing your papa in his paper, I would not take pleasure in visiting his family, so gave her up, but your Papa has forgiven him, & Mr. Town[e]s looks to him to do more for him than anyone. A great change has taken place & the \ul very\ulnone  \ul persons \ulnone who during political excitement abuse your Papa the \ul most\ulnone , are \ul now\ulnone  writing to \ul him\ulnone . to use his influence with\ul  \ulnone Genl Pierce to give them \ul Offices\ulnone .\'a0 \ul They \ulnone say your Papa writes for them, would have an effect, more than anyone else.\'a0 He does for \ul them\ulnone , & those who have \ul injured\ulnone  him, what he \ul would\ulnone  not do for himself. I will go to see Mrs. Town[e]s when the roads are good.\'a0 Now they are at most impassable.\'a0 I dare say it will not be before you return.\'a0 You can go with me.\'a0 I will call Julia Sharpe to keep the seat at her desk for you.\'a0 I am certain she will.\'a0 Except Miss Hopkins there is no other school for girls.\'a0I hope Clara will be a valuable servant for you by & by; then her wages can even support you.\'a0 Margaret says she can do everything except make Pastry, & that \ul that\ulnone  she would soon learn.\'a0 Our servants are so expensive now, the supporting them &c, that if it were not for the hope of \ul future \ulnone profit, we would be obliged to sell them.\'a0 Eliza\'92s baby is a month old Monday.\'a0 Then Sarah will go back to Margaret, who I hope will take her, through she sent word she did not care for her.\'a0 She is useless here, & get[t]ing into bad habits.\'a0 Eliza\'92s influence & example to her children is so bad, I would be thankful if we could get rid of her.\'a0 Johnny at present seems a good boy. Give my love to all my Aunts.\'a0 If Aunt Harriet is at Mr. W\'85, ask Aunt Eliza to write to her, & beg her to come down for one day & see you.\'a0 It is only a short ride, & I am certain if she knew you were in town, she would come & see you.\'a0 I will send you stamps in this letter.\'a0 When they give out, it would be well to buy some. Aunt Anna\'92s friend was a pious lady, & so afflicted, that her death must have been a blessing, as they have every reason I hope to think she is happy now.\'a0 Mr. Elford has money of your Papa\'92s. but has had no settlement since he returned. So I do not know wat he bought for me.\'a0\'a0 Mr. Wm Watson I believe goes to town soon.\'a0 I had just written this sentence when your Papa came in & brought Mr. Elford\'92s bills.\'a0 He has bought the nest of baskets, the Calico for Comforts, the Fender, Andirons, shovel & tongs, broom & bellows, the nest of baskets is 3.87.\'a0 Mama I expect will take some of them, the Calico 6 \'bc a yd, the other things $18.19 cts. I have just heard Mr. Hodges is dead, that he was resigned, he had no children, & his Wife & himself not very happy.\'a0 Mr. Henry Thompson & your Papa got elected to Commissioner of\'85& he came this morning to ask if he would appoint his son Henry as keeper of the gate, which Mr. Hodges used to keep; that Henry will stay at Mrs. Hodges, keep the gate, & keep school at the same time, & attend to his studies.\'a0 He will make several hundred dollars a year, & is only 17.\'a0 You see when persons are poor & thrown on their own resource, how they manage to support themselves, & at the same time improve their Character & acquire habits of industry, they make their own fortunes, whereas, if their parents had a few hundreds to give them, they think themselves \ul above\ulnone  work. & become \ul idle\ulnone  & dissipated & ruined characters.\'a0 I am glad there is at last something cheering for Mrs. Thompson.\'a0 She has sent repeatedly to ask if there was bundle here for her, but I have heard of none that was coming for her, unless some of her friends intend sending one by you.\'a0 If Charlotte Smith hears of your being in town, I dare say she will send a bundle.\

I have just received a letter from you & will answer it tomorrow.\'a0 Thank Aunt Brewton in my name for yours & Willie\'92s presents.\'a0 It was very kind, & they will be very useful.You have so much to bring for yourself, I dare say you will not have room for Mrs. Herriot\'92s boxes.\'a0 If so, you must return them, & tell her you are sorry you cannot bring them.\'a0 After awhile, persons will be going down from here who can bring them for her.\'a0 Your affectionate, E.F.P.\

Dear Anna\
\'a0\
\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just received a long letter from you & must answer it immediately as the Stage goes now at 12 oclock.\'a0 There is one thing that I wish to get & that is a pattern for the side of an Ottoman.\'a0 Get it the \ul length\ulnone  of the paper I send, & of the \ul shape\ulnone .\'a0 I have cut the paper, & one bunch of worsted like each colour in the pattern.\'a0 I have had broadcloth for you to work ottomans for your Grandmama, & this winter I would like to continue them at least.\'a0 I will teach you how to do the worsted work, & you must work a pincushion\'a0 for each friend who has shown you kindness, since you have been in town, tell them so.\'a0 I have plenty of Broadcloth & Canvass & some Worsted.\'a0 Also, buy one dozen worsted needles of different sizes, some of them very \ul small\ulnone , & you can commence when you return, & work them at your leisure.\'a0 You have made a pleasant visit.\'a0 I know you will need more money.\'a0 If I do not send what you need in time, if your Aunt advances it, I will immediately return it, as soon as I hear from you how much it is, but I much prefer your asking me for it, than getting it from anyone else.\'a0 So write & let me know what you need.\'a0 I am sorry Wm Ed had a pencil case.\'a0 Perhaps Eliza might think of something else for him, & be sure & buy the work box for Aunt Eliza, & a basket or something else for Eliza & Sue, & a handkerchief for each of the servants. I am glad you make yourself useful to your Aunt, & helped her fix the curtains.\'a0 I wish you would see Sarah Taylor, but if you leave before she comes, perhaps in Columbia you may have time to see her.\'a0 I am glad Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha you have seen again.\'a0 Tell them to write to me by you.\'a0 Bring as many letters as you can from our friends.\'a0 Let them know when you will leave, & beg them to write.\'a0 I suppose you have not seen K\'85\'92s relations, Mary, Sarah & Edward though they are not I believe estimable characters,\'a0 Still if you could see them & tell K\'85 you have, it would gratify her.\'a0 I am glad Mr. Jones will return soon, & that he will bring some of the things.\'a0 I sent a letter enclosing the key yesterday to Mrs. Robinson & she had \ul gone\ulnone .\'a0 It is no consequence, for since I have heard Butler Thompson was only going as far as Columbia with them, so I will send the key in this letter. We all will be very glad to see you.\'a0 Mr. McKay & the oldest Miss Hayden teach the large girls; the youngest Miss Hayden teaches the small girls.\'a0 Fanny says they are not cross.\'a0 Mr. Thomas teaches Willie a great many more studies than Mr. Leary did.\'a0 He wishes Frank to learn Latin, but we prefer not.\'a0 He is too young.\'a0 You must take good care of the children at school.\'a0 Only two of the Brooks go to school.\'a0 Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & Mr. Hodges also.\'a0 Soon I must go & see Mrs. Mauldin & some others.\'a0 A Chinese ornament for 25 cts, or a little basket, or any little present, you can bring Mary Mauldin. Aunt Mary McCall today I heard from saying she had received the Check.\'a0 I hope she will receive safely 2 dollars I have since sent her.\'a0 Some pretty Calico get me for aprons for Fanny.\'a0 I would send you a \ul 5 dollar\ulnone  bill at \ul least \ulnone in this letter, if it had not the key & paper in it, for I know you would be glad of it.\'a0 If I write tomorrow I will send it.\'a0 I hear from you regularly each day except Monday, when no Mail comes.\'a0 I am surprised you do not receive one letter each day from me, instead of so many at one time.\'a0 Your Papa says I write too often.\'a0 I suppose that you have heard that Genl Pierce\'92s only child has been killed on the R[ail] Road, how sad.\'a0 I am glad you have some shells, & found it pleasant on the island.\'a0 It looks a good deal like rain again.\'a0 The roads will be worse than ever. Tell your Aunts you will work them a pincushion. & also Eliza & Susan.\'a0 I will help you.\'a0 I did wish you to buy some books, some of Miss Milfords & Mrs. Howitts works, but will have to put off for another time.\'a0 At the end of the year there are so many bills to pay, or I would have sent more money.\'a0 Another visit I will supply you better & not tell you to buy so many things for me.\'a0 I wrote to Eliza yesterday.\'a0 I do not know what our Eliza will name her baby.\'a0 Aunt Eliza has no name to\'85of her.\'a0 She is one of the \ul worst \ulnone servants I know of.\'a0 She has no \ul principle\ulnone , & I am afraid with such a Mother, her \ul children \ulnone will not have any.\'a0 They are corrupted from their infancy, & if it were not for \ul Missy\ulnone , who has been a \ul faithful \ulnone servant to Mamma, I would not feel it my duty to keep such a servant.\'a0 Do not forget Becky\'92s comb.\'a0 She is not near as good a cook as Minerva, but she is a \ul better\ulnone  \ul servant\ulnone , & makes all happier.\'a0 Minerva wishes to leave the Mansion House, says she is worked too hard, but she is always \ul dissatisfied\ulnone . Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins, & my other Aunts.\'a0 I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick.\'a0 Let me know when to expect you.\'a0 Emily Earle & her sister go to the Academy.\'a0 It is the only female school now. Your Papa is quite well now.\'a0 It is no consequence when you see Augustus Hoke, & Mr. Smith must be wanting in steadiness to leave his business for such a trifling reason.\'a0 Hext is well; the other children at school.\'a0 Clara as soon as the new kitchen is finished is going to have a party or Fair.\'a0 I do not like to have such things in the yard, but disliked refusing, & if it is in the kitchen & not in the cellar, it will not distract us.\'a0 I hope to hear tomorrow, as soon as you have taken a list of the things you are to buy, that I have written in this letter, \ul burn \ulnone it. do not show it to anyone.\'a0 It is written so badly.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I send you my chain to wear with your Medallion,\'a0 I do not like little girls to dress \ul too fine\ulnone , but I think when you spend an evening out, the chain put round your neck twice, & the Medallion suspended to it, will look more suitable than the seven pence chain you bought in Columbia.\'a0 I do not think for such occasions it will look too fine.\'a0 The Chain your Papa gave to me before we were married, so I never expect to part with it.\'a0 Some time you can have a Daguerreotype likeness of your Papa & myself & a lock of our hair put in your Medallion. I send a \ul gold\ulnone  \ul pencil\ulnone  \ul case\ulnone  which if your cousin William Edward has \ul none\ulnone , you may give to him, as a present from \ul yourself\ulnone , as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mother\'92s roof.\'a0 I bought it for myself, but it was too \ul large\ulnone  for a \ul lady\ulnone , & I have never made use of it.\'a0 If he \ul has\ulnone  a gold pencil case, this would be of no \ul use\ulnone  to him, & I will think of something else for you to get, but if he has \ul none\ulnone , this he will find useful. The work box or writing desk for Aunt Eliza, & some present of value for your cousin[s] Eliza & Susan I will write you about before long, as soon as I hear from you about the one you are to get.\'a0 I hope to send this letter by Butler Thompson, but if I hear of any other safe opportunity sooner, I will not wait for him.\'a0 If you get homesick, or anything occurs to make it inconvenient for you to be at your Aunts, write me word. & by that time I dare say your Papa will be well, & able to go down for you.\'a0 But your friends are so kind & you seem to be passing your time so pleasantly, I suppose you are not afraid of being homesick.\'a0 I hope this visit to town will improve your \ul manners\ulnone , & your character in every respect, & you will learn more than at school, even if you commenced the \ul first\ulnone  day, as I had expected.\'a0\'a0 I have written a long letter to you today, so will now stop.\'a0 Your affectionate Mother, [E.F.P.] Jany 1

Tomorrow I am to dine at Aunt Elizas.\'a0 I like Aunt Haynes, Uncle Arthur, & Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Brewton, & Aunt Mary McCall the best.\'a0 Of the relations I have seen, I like Eloisa Martin, but Aunt Eliza & her family I like \ul least\ulnone  & Aunt Anna Turnbull & those at her house the \ul next\ulnone  \ul least\ulnone . I have bought nothing yet.\'a0 Charleston is not to be compared in looks to Columbia.\'a0 The Convention sits today.\'a0 It is thought no Bishop will be elected.\'a0 Mr. Martin says he has in his pocket a letter from Dr. Atkinson acknowledging his abolition principles, that Mr. Trapier & the high church ministers here, have given him up.\'a0 It looks cloudy, we need rain, but I will be sorry if it does, as I wish to shop.\'a0 Tomorrow as I am to dine out, I may not have time to write.

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I have just returned from shopping & will write to you.\'a0 The few lines you wrote enclosing Susan\'92s letter, is all I have heard from you since I left Columbia.\'a0 A servant goes to the Post Office every day.\'a0 I hope today after the Cars arrive I may hear.\'a0 I have had to buy things for Susan Hoke, Mamma, Susan & myself, & the shopping is \ul dreadfully\ulnone  fatiguing.\'a0 Yesterday & the day before after shopping, I had to dine out, so at night I was very tired.\'a0 I have almost finished shopping now, so I will not be so fatigued.\'a0 Things are higher than I expected, so I have spent much more than I had any idea of, & more than at the time I am aware of until the bills are made out, but after this, I will be economical.\'a0 I long to see you.\'a0 It is not worth the expense for you to come down to see me, & go back & come down for me, so one trip seems sufficient, but as \ul soon\ulnone  as your business is done, come for me, & write me word when you think you will come.\'a0 I would like to know. I was truly sorry to hear of Eliza\'92s death.\'a0 I could not realize she was going to die, & had a faint hope she would recover.\'a0 She will be such a loss to me, having for 11 years done my work, that I do not know how I can do without her.\'a0 Clara I wish to stay with Margaret until Jany to finish her trade, as this year is the most important.\'a0 She is to learn to cut & fit, but she must sleep at home every night, to attend to the baby, & I hope when I have pressing work to do, Margaret will let me have her.\'a0 I am sorry for Eliza\'92s children & Missy, & will do a good part by them & never part with them.\'a0 Susan\'92s account was quite affecting & I hope Eliza is happy now.\'a0 I dined yesterday at Aunt Eliza\'92s, spent a pleasant time, & in the afternoon walked on the Battery.\'a0 Today I am at the boarding house, & am glad of a rest.\'a0 No Bishop has been elected yet.\'a0 Mr. Leary called today while I was out, & Mrs. H\'85 Simons, & Mrs. Bay & Mrs. Crawford yesterday, & Mrs. Henry Pinckney & family, Mrs. O\'92Driscoll, Mrs. Ramsay.\'a0 Persons have not yet found out I am in town.\'a0 Yesterday Uncle Arthur intended asking me to dine but I was engaged to Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 I saw Aunt Emily at Aunt Eliza\'92s.\'a0 I will keep my letter open until the afternoon when I hope I will hear from you.\'a0 You must write of[ten] or I will get homesick.\'a0\'a0 As I do not know when the letters will come, I will close this.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\'a0\'a0\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 Day after day passes, & I do not hear from you.\'a0 I begin to think you must be sick, for as you are only one days journey from me, I cannot imagine why you do not write. I received a long letter from Susan toda, & one from Frank.\'a0 Lindy\'92s baby had been unwell but was better.\'a0 The rest of the family were well.\'a0 May day she says was the poorest display she ever saw, but they had plenty to eat, & the children enjoyed themselves.\'a0 Aunt Turnbull sent today to say she would send for me at 2 oclock to stay with her, but I wrote word I would let her know Monday, after I heard from you, how long it was probable you would be in Columbia.\'a0 If you expect to come down soon, it would not be worth moving there.\'a0 If you were not coming for me, I would perhaps go there now, but I expect you would \ul yourself \ulnone much prefer being at a boarding house, than staying at Aunt Anna\'92s.\'a0 You prefer being independent, & I am afraid Aunt Anna for the short time I stay there, would expect me if she comes to Greenville to invite her to pass the summer.\'a0 This makes me reluctant to stay with her, but you write me what to do.\'a0 I hope to hear from you this afternoon.\'a0 Mrs. Martin is in this house, & is very polite.\'a0 Mrs. Julius Pringle is here, & is polite, but she is not a pleasant person.\'a0 The weather is not hot; the noise I am getting accustomed to.\'a0 Direct your letters to the care of Mr. Wm E. Martin, or Wm Ed. Hayne.\'a0 I will then be sure to get them.\'a0 I think now there must be some mistake that you have written, & the letters have miscarried.\'a0 Mrs. Pringle\'92s servant this morning, brought me the two from Susan & Frank, & I am surprised none from you. Uncle Arthur last night sent to say, he had called repeatedly to see me, but I was out.\'a0 The servants do not tell me who calls.\'a0After dinner This morning when I returned from King St. I found Uncle Arthur had called again.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull sent to ask me to ride with her this afternoon to Magnolia Cemetery, & I am going with her.\'a0 I have just received a letter from you.\'a0 I am glad you are well.\'a0 I rather think as you think you will come down next week that I will remain where I am.\'a0 If you were not coming, I would go to Aunt Anna\'92s or Eloisa\'92s, but as you are coming, I do not think you would find it pleasant at either of those places, & I expect you would not be willing to stay at a Hotel, & I at a \ul private \ulnone house.\'a0 I do not think at Aunt Anna\'92s you would find it pleasant.\'a0 Perhaps Monday I could go to Aunt Anna\'92s & stay until you write word you are coming, & then I would move back to Mrs. Davis, & be in time to meet you here.\'a0 So hat do you think; write me by return Mail.\'a0 Anna yesterday was unwell.\'a0 The water I expect has disagreed with her, & she was just loose in her bowels, & then \ul bound\ulnone , & in great pain, & Mrs. Pringle advised me to send for a Doctor, & I sent for Dr. Geddings, & he gave her some pills which have done her great good, & by tomorrow he said she will be well.\'a0 He paid her two visits so I will have to pay his bill, & if I were to move from here, I would have to pay the bill here, so I would be very glad if you would send me some more money to prevent my feeling embarrassed.\'a0 From 20 to 50 dollars according to your liberality, the letter in which you enclose it, you can direct to the care of Wm Ed Hayne, if you think it safer.\'a0 I have received two letters from you.\'a0 If these are all you have written, then there is no risk, but I think perhaps you have written some I have not received.\'a0 I was to get money from Alston for Mama, bit I dislike asking, so if I had enough I would prefer lending her mine.\'a0 Send the money by return Mail.\'a0 Mrs. Pringles servant goes for my letters, & brings them safely.\'a0 I will get him to bring me some Stamps, so you will not have to pay postage.\'a0 I will not determine about Aunt Anna\'92s until I hear from you, whether you will like to stay there, or like me to return to Mrs. Davis & meet you here, or you stay at a Hotel when you come, & I at Aunt Anna\'92s.\'a0 She may expect me to ask her to stay with me in Greenville, & this I cannot do.\'a0 Eliza dead, my work will be unusual, & I expect to devote every moment to sewing.\'a0 I see ready made clothes for children, & that is one thing I would like to get for Willie & Frank & why I wish more money, for I will not have time to do all, & do not understand making boys clothes.\'a0 Eliza\'92s loss is \ul irreparable\ulnone .\'a0 I deeply deplore it.\'a0 For 11 years she has worked for me & made my dresses \ul better\ulnone  than a Mantua maker.\'a0 In consequence of her death, I am having a dress made here, which I will have to pay 3.25 for, & that is thought cheap, for 5 is the price.\'a0 I am glad I have heard.\'a0 If you could get business in Charleston, I would like you to move here.\'a0 I like a City.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.Anna is well, but having taken medicine cannot go out this week.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I went to St. Michael\'92s church this morning.\'a0 Aunt Elizabeth called for me.\'a0 I did not see Uncle Arthur.\'a0 He went to Grace church, Mr. Pinckney\'92s church to hear the new Bishop.\'a0 Mr. Arthur preached at St. Phillips.\'a0 It was an old sermon but Aunt Elizabeth liked him.\'a0 The Bishop preaches this afternoon at St. Phillips.\'a0 Perhaps I may go there. Yesterday afternoon Aunt Brewton called to see me.\'a0 She said I must take tea with her Monday.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull then called for me & took me up to the Magnolia Cemetery 3 miles out of the City.\'a0 It is a beautiful spot on Cooper river.\'a0 The river winds along through the grounds.\'a0 A bridge is across it.\'a0 In one spot, there is a Gothic chapel in the midst, & some beautiful monuments, one recently erected to a Mr. Jones a stranger who died here, by his widow cost 6000 dollars. After tea last night, Aunt Mary McCall called to see me, & before she left Mr. Isaac Hayne & his wife called.\'a0 I was surprised.\'a0 I thought after my conduct to him, they would both have passed me without notice.\'a0 They were very affable, & from this time we must \ul bury \ulnone the hatchet, for really I feel sorry for him.\'a0 He has the same abstracted look Mr. Treville has, except more worried, so I have come to the conclusion, that the Attorney general\'92s\'85is never out of their minds, that as the Contest is always such a close one Mr. Treville is looking forward to getting it, but afraid he may not.\'a0 Isaac Hayne is looking forward to losing it, but hoping he may not.\'a0 His manners are not playful & lively as they once were, so I make allowances for his apparent coldness to you, & believe now, it is unintentional.\'a0 He asked about you.\'a0 He looks like his father.\'a0 Aunt Brewton said I must take tea with her Monday.\'a0 Aunt Elizabeth said I must dine with her Tuesday, that she was sorry she had seen so little of me.\'a0 She is the kindest of my Aunts in law.\'a0 She seems to have such a kind heart.\'a0 Uncle Arthur & herself have been repeatedly to see me, but I have been out.\'a0 Aunt Brewton said her daughter in law, Alstons wife had been, & left her card, but I never received it.\'a0 I do not know who has been.\'a0 Mr. Arthur this morning called before church.\'a0 I was very anxious to see him to know if he had received a box a Milliner was to pack & send to him, but the servant never asked him in.\'a0\'a0This is a pleasant house on account of the situation & privacy, but they have but two boys & one woman to attend to the whole house, & one \ul little \ulnone boy, so I miss not having a servant.\'a0 The board for a servant I see on the rules is 4 dollars a week.\'a0 If I had brought Clara, she would have saved me 3.25 already.\'a0 I have to pay for making a dress & would have gone on messages & shopped for me, so another time I will bring her. Write me word what time you think you will be down.\'a0 I wrote a note to Aunt Anna yesterday, & said if you were not coming down soon, perhaps I might go to her house, but if you were coming down, it would not be worthwhile to move, & I would give her an answer Monday.\'a0 She seemed really sincere in asking me, but I know her disposition, & she dislikes so having trouble & expense, that I am certain she would like me better if I do \ul not \ulnone stay with her, so I have no idea of leaving this house.\'a0 She has been kinder than I expected. Mr. Isaac Hayne says Columbia is not as hospitable a place as it used to be.\'a0 I expect as Cities increase in population & wealth, they become more fashionable & less hospitable.\'a0 Aunt Susan Hayne is the only Aunt I have not seen.\'a0 She lives very high up & keeps no equipage.\'a0 Anna is better, but today I thought she had better not go to church.\'a0 I expect this afternoon to go to St. Michaels again with Aunt Elizabeth, & tonight to St. Peters with Aunt Martha McCall to hear the new Bishop.\'a0 Dinner is nearly ready so I will close & hope to hear soon from you.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P. I have not seen a paper since I came here.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 This is Sunday morning and we had intended going to church, but the rain prevented us.\'a0 It also rained last Wednesday, and I expect you do not have as much rain in Charleston as we have here.\'a0 I do not expect the Smallpox could have been bad or you would have went on.\'a0 Reuben said that you were not certain that you would go on if it was ther[e], but I never heard you say anything about it.\'a0 Mayday is past and Aunt Susan read me her letter\'85to you in which she told you about it.\'a0 She did not like the way Mrs. Earle did about the wreaths.\'a0 We had enough to eat upon a table in the yard, and we had enough of dancing also.\'a0 I danced some.\'a0 The dancing continued until late at night and it was twelve oclock when I got home.\'a0 Hudson stayed with me that night, and as we had holiday the next day he stayed\'a0 with me also until after dinner and then went home.\'a0 Aunt Susan likes very much.\'a0 I wrote a letter to Papa last Wednesday for one he wrote me before.\'a0 I wish you would write to me some, or as I expect you will be very busy in shopping and visiting.\'a0 You must tell Anna to write me, and tell her that if she will write to me I will write to her.\'a0 I am now writing upon that Aunt Brewton gave to me and you must tell her that I thank her very much, and give my love to all my relations.\'a0 I am writing in the Library and Aunt Susan has just come in and says that as I am writing she does not think she will as there is no use in both of us writing.\'a0 She says that I must tell you that we are getting on well considering there are so many together.\'a0 She says that Mrs. Caroline Reardon who was Miss Rinehart is coming to live in Greenville , and this is another reason that she is glad she has got out of the McBee family as Mrs. Reardon has such a tongue and temper.\'a0 And she says that Luther [McBee] contualy been sending notes and messages.\'a0 I must now stop writing.\'a0 You must excuse me for all the mistakes in this letter.\'a0 Frank has written to you but he would not let me read his letter.\'a0 Give my love to Anna.\'a0 You must bring me a pretty present.\'a0 Your affectionate son, William H, Perry\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you a few hurried lines last night on my return from Aunt Brewtons.\'a0 The 10 oclock bell was ringing, & the servant was waiting to put the letter in the Office. I received two letters from you yesterday, one enclosing Willie\'92s letter, the other 40 dollars which I thank you for.\'a0 I think the expense of boarding is too great for me to stay here longer than two weeks, so next\'85day I ought to leave, or at least Tuesday, will make it two weeks.\'a0 If your cases will not be called for before then, suppose you come down now, & when you return to Columbia, attend to your business, or cannot you beg the Court, in consideration of your wife\'92s waiting in town for you, to take up your cases at once, & then come for me.\'a0 I will be very glad for you to come, but if it is \ul entirely\ulnone  inconvenient, then I must get Wm Ed Hayne to carry me to the R[ail] Road, pay my passage, & have my trunks marked, & in Columbia you will be ready at the Depot, to receive me. Uncle Arthur will be very glad to see you.\'a0 Alston Hayne also expressed a wish to see you, & all my relations I know would like to see you. so therefore there is not much to interest you here.\'a0 If you can with \ul convenience\ulnone  come I would like it.\'a0 I am to dine at Uncle Arthur\'92s today. He is to send his carri[a]ge for me.\'a0 Last night at Aunt Brewton\'92s I saw Mr. Pinckney Alston who asked after you.\'a0 Mrs. Julius Pringle is still in this house.\'a0 Mrs. Richmond Lowndes is expected today.\'a0 Her husband & family\'85.\'a0 She was a Miss Parker.\'a0 The company is constantly changing.\'a0 It is very private, & I feel quite at ease.\'a0 It is not so pleasant for you as the Charleston\'a0 Hotel.\'a0 You do not see so much company, & it is not known that you are in town, so you had better go there first & register your name. I told Aunt Anna Monday, I would let her know whether I would stay with her.\'a0 If she says nothing further on the subject, of course I wont think of going, & I dare say she will not, for as she has given the invitation, she feels she has done her duty, & I know it would give her trouble.\'a0 If she presses me as she did at \ul first\ulnone , & you are not coming for a long time, I may go, but I will let you know. Aunt Eliza invited me to take tea with her last night & Aunt Emily tonight, but I was engaged elsewhere.\'a0 I wish you would write every day.\'a0 I like to hear \ul better\ulnone , than when I am at home.\'a0 I long to see the children.\'a0 I suppose Hext has almost forgotten me.\'a0 I was pleased to see Willie\'92s letter.\'a0 I am glad Eliza\'92s children do not give way to grief, as it would distress me very much.\'a0 I am sure Missy feels it greatly.\'a0 Her loss is great to me.\'a0 I have not paid one cent for making my dresses for years, & now I have to pay 3.25 for one.\'a0 Washing the least peice here is 6 \'bc a peice.\'a0 It will be a saving another time to bring Clara to sew & wash for me.\'a0 My washing will amount to a good deal.\'a0 If you do not come, you must write me word whether I shall get Groceries, & the Dinner Set.\'a0 I had to buy things to make me look genteel, & those who have shopped with me, think I have at least 500 to spend, & make me go beyond my means.\'a0 Hereafter I will shop alone.\'a0 Aunt Mary McCall said I must buy what would look well at the \ul North\ulnone  , where they dress very fine.\'a0 I have not bought a great deal, but money in a City is soon spent, & yet very little to show for it. Mrs. Wilkes & Mrs. Perroneau called to see me yesterday, & Miss Drayton & her niece.\'a0 The servants are very careless, & even cards left, they do not show me, so I do not know who has called. As I wish you to look your very best when you appear in Charleston among a people who once abused you, you must provide yourself with a dress Sack Coat suitable for the season.\'a0 I wish them to see that you are a \ul striking\ulnone  looking man, & as I am taken for a girl of \ul sixteen\ulnone , wish you to look of a suitable age for me.\'a0 If you can get a nice\'85Sack in Columbia get it there, if not here.\'a0\'a0 I will\'85write by return Mail, whether you will come or not, & when.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I wrote you already today, & will now write to send by tomorrows Mail.\'a0 I went up King st. this morning before breakfast, to shop a little.\'a0 It is the best time as from after breakfast until night, the streets are crowded.\'a0 Today I am to dine at Uncle Arthurs.\'a0 Aunt Anna Turnbull also sent to invite me, but as I was engaged to Uncle Arthur, I had to decline.\'a0 Tomorrow Aunt Mary McCall has invited me to dine at her house just opposite here, at 3 oclock.\'a0 It would take a month at least to see all my relations & to return the visits paid me.\'a0 I have not seen Aunt Susan Hayne yet.\'a0 She lives very high up, & keeps no equipage.\'a0 Anna is now quite well, only bit by muskutoes, which as yet though are not very bad.\'a0 You must write me, whether you can come for me or I must go up without you.\'a0 I have not much to write now, as I have written already to you today, & I wish to write to Susan. Sunday afternoon.\'a0 Aunt Elizabeth carried me to St. Phillips to hear the new Bishop.\'a0 He was a Lawyer from North Carolina, 52 years old, seems in feeble health, not animated, but a very good plain preacher.\'a0 Mr. Arthur reaches Greenville tonight 8 oclock, left here yesterday afternoon, & had a letter from Dr. Croft for you, which he was to have put in the Post Office at Columbia.\'a0 You must write me, whether you prefer my remaining here, or wish me to go to Columbia & meet you there & stay until your business is over, with you or go on to Greenville before you.\'a0 Either way I am willing to do, if it were not so expensive, I would be willing to stay here a longer time.\'a0 It is thought perfectly safe this month & the next.\'a0 I pass my time pleasantly, but I will be glad to see the children particularly Hext; & shopping takes so much money, that it is very unpleasant to go to shop, unless I had a good deal to spend, & I buy the things perhaps I could do without, & have to go without what I need.\'a0 It is dreadfully confusing, & dreadfully fatiguing, & I believe I would rather before I come again, write for what I wish, & when I do come not enter King st., where there is so much to tempt.\'a0 Straw Mating, China, towels &c I have not even looked at.\'a0 I would like very much to buy a new carri[a]ge, to put our new horses to.\'a0 If you come, you must price some.\'a0 I will now conclude & write to Susan, & before long I must dress & go to Uncle Arthurs.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I dined at Uncle Arthurs yesterday in company with Mr. Pinckney Alston & his daughter who we saw at Greenville.\'a0 He is so pleasant; he prevents a dinner party being stiff.\'a0 In the afternoon Aunt Elizabeth took us to ride round the Battery, which is a delightful place, very much extended & improved.\'a0 That & the Magnolia Cemetery are beautiful rides.\'a0 I have to dine at Aunt Mary McCall\'92s today, at 3 oclock.\'a0 She has just sent to repeat the invitation.\'a0 Tonight we are to take tea at Aunt Emily\'92s.\'a0 As I was out yesterday, I expect no one asked for letters at the Post Office for me, so I will send this morning.\'a0 After breakfast I am going to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, & tomorrow I hope she will carry me to return some visits.\'a0 Augustus Hoke came to see us last night, just as I got home from Uncle Arthurs.\'a0 He looks & seems quite well & offered to escort us to the island, but I do not think we will have time to go.\'a0 Several persons called yesterday while I was out.\'a0 The weather today is very pleasant.\'a0 I have not found it hot yet.\'a0 There is generally a breeze.\'a0 Today is quite warm.\'a0 I am afraid Greenville even after the road is finished will not be patronized by the lower country.\'a0 They say it is too hot,\'85that when they leave Charleston, they wish for a greater change so go to Buncombe or the mountains of Georgia.\'a0\'a0 I have written you I believe every Mail, which is more than you have done me.\'a0 I must now prepare to go down to breakfast 12 oclock.\'a0 I have just received a letter from you, & the boy says, there are two more, but he has to pay postage, so I sent him back with 10 cts.\'a0 I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly.\'a0 I dare say more pleasantly than you would in Charleston, for the gentlemen in Columbia are congregated together; here if you stay at this house, you would be with no gentlemen you know, & may leave before your friends know you are here.\'a0 At the Charleston Hotel, you would find it pleasanter, but at this house I find it pleasant.\'a0 This morning I went to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, Aunt Haynes, & Aunt Eliza.\'a0 Aunt Anna is expecting Mrs. Bull Friday, & that day we are to dine with her, & after Mrs. Bull leaves, she is to stay only a day or two, but I know she thinks so of trouble & expense, that I do not think I will go, particularly as I do not wish to be obligated to anyone, & for a few days stay, expect to ask them to stay with me a summer. If you prefer not coming down, you must write me, for I wish you to consult your pleasure, & not come against your inclination.\'a0 I will today speak to Mrs. Davis & ask her terms.\'a0 Aunt Mary said 18 a week, 12 for me & 6 for Anna.\'a0 I hope if it is not more than that, I would rather be at a boarding house on account of the independent feeling that I have.\'a0 I have just received a letter from Susan & Willie.\'a0 They are all well.\'a0 Anna is quite well now & is to dine with me today at Aunt Mary McCall\'92s.\'a0 Tomorrow night we take tea at Aunt Haynes.\'a0 Perhaps tomorrow morning we go to the island. I would like very much to buy some Matting for our drawing room, & the large chamber.\'a0 You can get it 25 cts a yd. 10 dollars for each room.\'a0 I wish you would be so good as to send me 20 dollars, if you are \ul wil[l]ing\ulnone  for me to get it.\'a0 I also would like to get some Shades for our Drawing room, 3 of them.\'a0 I suppose 6 dollars would buy them & I wish some towels & a few large Table cloths.\'a0 If you are willing for me to get these things, send me the money, but if you would rather not, you need not.\'a0 The 40 dollars you sent me will pay two weeks board, so if you are not coming down, I am afraid to spend it, therefore have nothing now to make purchases with.\'a0 The Matting looks so cool & sweet & saves scouring. Mama wished me to get some money from Alston which will be due in a few days, to make some purchases for her.\'a0 I spoke to Aunt Brewton about it, but Alston has not sent me any.\'a0 If I could I would lend it to her, but I have it not.\'a0 My relations have been quite kind to me, & it is a pleasant change to come to the City for a while.\'a0 All I regret is, I have not more money to spend.\'a0 Uncle Arthur told me he was surprised to find you were willing to accept a Judgeship, as he supposed you made a great deal more.\'a0 I told him you had never been a Candidate.\'a0 He says if you had removed to Charleston before this, Mr. King who has a great regard for you would have helped you greatly.\'a0 I wish you would move & bring the paper here.\'a0 I have not seen a paper since I left home.\'a0 I wish you would send the Patriot.\'a0 I hear \ul nothing\ulnone  of it.\'a0 I suppose Mr. Elford has not been to Columbia, as you do [not] mention him.\'a0 I think there is no risk in sending money.\'a0 If you think there is, you can direct your letters to the care of Wm Ed, but when I send my name written on paper, the letters are always brought me.\'a0 Write to me every day, that I may know your movements, & buy a nice setting Sack Coat, either in Columbia or in Charleston if you come.\'a0 I will return whenever you write me. I am very glad you took a pleasant ride with Gov. Manning.\'a0 Persons here are more\'85of their horses than anything else, & keep them for show, not for comfort.\'a0 I have walked more than I do a year in Greenville.\'a0 Dinner company seems not as common as it was.\'a0 Eloisa Martin asked me to stay with her, but has not asked me to dinner, but I suppose she will.\'a0 Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 I took tea last night at Eloisa\'92s.\'a0 Mr. Martin says on Monday he will through the Telegraph learn from you whether you can come down Tuesday to escort me up to Columbia, or whether I must leave here Tuesday, to meet you in Columbia.\'a0 I hope you can come for me.\'a0 It will be only two days longer from home. We will get there Friday night instead of Wednesday night.\'a0 If possible you must come down, but if you say it is \ul entirely \ulnone impossible, I will of course go to you Tuesday, but my visit will end so much pleasanter if you come for me, that I feel convinced if you can, you will come.\'a0 I will keep this letter open until the Cars arrive; perhaps I may hear from you, though I think I heard the Post office was not open on Sunday.\'a0 At any rate I will send & see. Anna & myself are quite well.\'a0 Last night Mr. Lowndes invited us to tea.\'a0\'a0 Monday night Mr. James Heyward.\'a0 My friends have been very kind.\'a0 Mrs. Poinsett went up to Columbia Friday & Mrs. Bull yesterday.\'a0 Mr. Martin says Mr. Bellinger & W. DeSaussure gained the Felder Case, & get a fee of 15000 between them.\'a0 Mama Susan & Ann have given me such a long list of things to buy for them, that I am afraid Mama\'92s money & mine together wont be enough to pay for what I have got, & the China & my board & passage up, & buy all Mamma wants.\'a0 If it is not, I will leave the China unpaid for.\'a0 I will pay for it as far as the money goes.\'a0 I have bought some Table cloths, Towels, Matting one peice, Servants clothes childrens clothes, Cloth for pillow cases, foot\'85&c.\'a0 The China I suppose will be 50 dollars, & my board about 40 & the passage up so I believe, making 100 at once.\'a0 You promised me the interest of the Bank Stocks to provide for children servants &c.\'a0 As I have spent your money in that way. You shall have the interest this time. Tomorrow as soon as I hear through the Telegraph whether you can come or not, I will arrange my plans.\'a0 I will be glad to correspond in so novel a way.\'a0 I am going to church this morning to St. Michaels with Aunt Anna Turnbull.\'a0 Before church Mr. Vandiver is to call, but I hope I am to go up with you instead of him.\'a09 oclock.\'a0 Mr. Vandiver has just been here, & says he thinks on Tuesday you will be engaged in Court in Columbia & cannot come down that day.\'a0 If this is so, let me know.\'a0 Address your communication to Mr. Martin, as I might not be at the Hotel when it is sent.\'a0 Mr. Martin will be sure to receive it & bring it to me.\'a0 If you cannot come Tuesday & prefer my going to Columbia that day, of course I will go, but I hope you will finish your business & then come.\'a0 It will delay you only a few days longer.\'a0 You will have plenty of time to attend to Dr. Crofts business before Equity Court sits.\'a0\'a0\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\

\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0\'a0 If you think your business will not come on for some time yet, & that I will be detained in Columbia several days suppose you let me stay here a few days longer, as I prefer being here to Columbia, & I will be very much hurried\'a0 to get through by Tuesday.\'a0 Cannot you come down Monday\'a0 stay Tuesday & Wednesday & go back Thursday.\'a0 Tell them not to call your cases until you return.\'a0 [I] would like to be here until the middle of next week, so as to be able to finish my business & return my visits, but still I wish you to come for me.\'a0 It is \ul perfectly\ulnone  safe here.\'a0 Everybody laughs at your thinking there is any danger.\'a0 Mr. Leary is very foolish.\'a0 I dare say you can ascertain by looking at the docket when your cases will be called, & make your arrangements accordingly.\'a0\'a0 Today I dine at Aunt Turnbulls, tonight take tea at Miss Draytons, tomorrow at Mrs. Martins.\'a0 I have to return visits & shop, & would be glad if it suited you to come down the middle of next week.\'a0 I wish you to stay a few days.\'a0 I never felt better.\'a0 I wish your cases would be called the first of the week & afterwards you come down.\'a0 If I am to stay either place, it had better be here, but I am not one to stay here longer than the middle of the week.\'a0 By that time I can get through but I wish you to come for me.\'a0 So now you know my wishes.\'a0 If possible you must make your movements correspond if possible.\'a0 Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.\
