My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines whilst Frank is dressing for Breakfast.  The Bell has rung & Frank was asleep.  On being waked up he expressed great mortification that I did not wake him sooner.  We had a terrible drive here on Sunday.  The roads were almost impassable.  We reached here by night by hard driving.

	The Will case was set down for trial today,  I came one day too soon.  But I employ it very well in looking into the case & examining the authorities.  I am very confident of success & we get a fee of $500 if successful before the ordinary & $300 if not.  

	I shall not be at home before the last of the week perhaps Saturday.

	I have nothing new to write you.  My friend Keith has a son born last week.  He has two daughters before.

	If Reed is here to attend to the other side of the Will case & gets only a fee of $5.00.

	Frank has now dressed & we will go to breakfast.  Yours truly & affectionately,
B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely this evening at five oclock & will write you a few lines.  I cannot forego the opportunity of writing you.  If I wont till I arrive in Washington you will not hear from me in a week or ten days.  It gives me much pleasure to write you when absent as it does you to receive & read the letters.  When I leave home I think a great deal more about my wife & children than when at home.  I will not say I think more of them for they are always equally & incalculably dear to me.

	General Thompson & myself had a very pleasant journey on Sunday to Donalds.  We had a great deal of talk about everything.  We reached Donalds about an hour before sunset and there found Frank Burt on his way to Washington.  He is going on to get office and was delighted to meet us and will travel with us.  He expressed himself under great obligations to me for my kindness in his favor.

	I met also at Donalds Wallace Ioor going to Newberry.  He did not know or was not disposed to talk about his visit.  I thought he was seeking employment.  At Cokesbury we took on Col. William Taylor of Camden.  He said the State had gone over to the Perry party�that I deserved great credit &c.  He was a hot secessionist.  He said I ought to be elected over Orr to Congress & he had understood I could beat him.  We took up Col. Keith of Orangeburg just below Cokesbury.  He was a terrible fire eater, but met me most cordially.  Thompson said that he was glad to see that all of the secessionists were so cordial in their relations with me.  Col. Keith said they all respected me a great deal more than they did the Cooperationists.  He gave me two dollars & requested the Patriot to be sent him.  He speaks of going on to Washington with us

	It is uncertain whether we go through Charleston or not.  Thompson is unwilling to risk the water.  

	Janney was very glad to see me.  His little daughter enquired a great deal about Anna.  Janney said where is your little daughter?  Why did you not bring her with you.  Anna seems to be a great favorite with them all.

	I have seen Middlekoff & got a second volume of Harper.  My trip to Columbia has not cost me one cent nor will my lodging here tonight.  

	I shall expect to hear from you on my arrival at Washington.  I wish I could be with you tonight & see all the children & hear you teach them their lessons.  I can imagine you all seated around the fire�Hext nursing, Anna reciting geography, Willie reading Virgil, Frank looking over his lesson & working it & Fanny lying on the sopha.

	God bless you all.  Good night.  I must write to the Patriot.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just arrived here & it is now nine oclock in the night, but before retiring to rest, I will write you a few lines.  Mr. Burt with whom I am rooming has just gone to bed.  General Thompson has gone out somewhere & will probably come back late.

	I wrote you in Columbia & will now continue our journey & its incidents owing to my persuasion.  Thompson agreed to come by Charleston.  He was anxious to take the stages.  Burt told him I was very self willed & would have my own way about everything & he had better yield.   It was well we came the Boat rout[e], for we should have been delayed one day on the other rout[e], besides travelling seventy miles on stages.

	We fell in company with my friend Thompson the boot merchant in Columbia & several other merchants going north.  In Charleston I passed from the cars to the Boat without stopping.  I met Dr�.in the Hamburgh cars & a great many other acquaintances.  Just as I was getting out of the car a woman came up to me & proposed putting herself under my charge going north, which I most uncivily declined on the ground that I was otherwise engaged.  Who she was I know not & did not ascertain, although she went on with us as far as Weldon.

	We passed through Wilmington without stopping.  General Thompson saw none of his friends there.  The evening I wrote you in Columbia he came to my room & wrote one page I noticed, whilst my letter contained Three.  I thought to myself he had been married only two years & I had been married fifteen.  Several amusing incidents have happened which I shall not have time to write.  When we got into the cars & on the Boat it was mentioned by someone that we were General Thompson & Major Perry.  Shortly afterwards a man by the name of Perry went up to Thompson & said he looked so much like his Father that he supposed they were somehow related, as they were both of the same name.  Thompson told him that he was mistaken�his name was not Perry and that my name was Perry.  The young man replied that he thought I was General Thompson & requested him to introduce him to me that he [k]new the family of Col. Jones into which I had married & that he understood I was a great Whig.  General Thompson�him & said if he had taken me for a Whig he would have got into the wrong box most decidedly.  He had made the same mistake that Perry did.    

	Yesterday at Suffolk in Virginia a party got into the cars.  Amongst them there was a young lady to whom General Thompson gave his seat by me & went into the baggage cars.  She enquired who the gentleman was who was so kind & on my telling her it was General Thompson, she observed that she knew him from character & that he had married a Miss Jones.  When the cars arrived at Portsmouth I escorted the young lady to the Boat & found that she was on her way to Washington in company with a friend & his family her relations.  We came on to Baltimore together.  I introduced General Thompson to her & we spent our time very pleasantly on the boat with her.  She proved to be a Miss Ballow & looked very much like Judge Cheves daughter�especially Mrs. McCord�quite intellectual & handsome.  She said I reminded her very much of Governor Graham of North Carolina�both in manners & appearance.  We also met on the boat a daughter of Commodore [James] Bar[r]on who killed [Stephen] Decatur in a duel.  She is married to a Captain Prendergrast of the Navy.  I made her acquaintance.  She lives in Washington & gave me a very pressing invitation to call & see her.  She was in company with Col. Payne of the Mexican Army & who was one of the commissioners that�in the Gardner case.  After I had been introduced to him he told Thompson that he had been more anxious to see me than any man in the United States.  He said pretty much the same to me the next morning & we have become quite gracious.  He has been summoned as a witness in the Gardner case & came on to Washington with us.  Miss Ballard also knew me when told by Thompson that I was the Southern Patriot.  Thompson said to Burt today that I was the most popular man in the Southern States of all the South Carolinians.

	In Baltimore we staid three or four hours.  I paid Redwood his money $517,36cts.  I bought a fine sack coat for $20 & six shirts for $12.00.  Burt & Thompson also fitted themselves up with clothes.  Baylis Crayton passed through Baltimore yesterday.  We reached here after dark& I have seen no one but General McQueen of South Carolina & General Hamilton.  

It is said Gardner will not only be acquitted but vindicated.  Col. Payne has no doubt of his innocence.  

	I hope you & the children are all well & getting on well.  It seems like a month since I left home.  I should like very much to see you all.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow & I will write you again tomorrow night if I have time.  But if the Gardner case is taken up I may not have time.

	I am quite well but will take some pills as I lay down to sleep.  Burt is now snoring at an awful rate & will prove an unpleasant roommate I am afraid.

	I must now stop & write Elford a letter for the Southern Patriot.  My whole passage here has been only &213 or 24 dollars!

	Kiss the children for me and tell Anna I will have her locket attended to & your broach also.

	Yours truly & sincerely.  Nothing special as to the President or his cabinet.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was going to write you last night, but Col. Orr came to see us, and insisted on our going with him to the Presidents Soiree.  There were about two thousand persons in the White House & about it.  I never before saw such a crowd of human beings pressed together.  There was no moving or passing about in the great�Room.  The crowd were about two hours in passing by the President.  When Col. Orr pronounced my name, the President enquired if I was the Editor of the Southern Patriot, & on being informed that I was, he clapsed my hand & expressed the deepest joy in meeting me.  But the crowd behind pressed me on & we had no commotion.  I shall go up to see him today or Monday.  He is a fine looking man. His wife is a very large lady & not very good looking.  I saw General Scott & was introduced to him again.  The ladies were all ugly.  I do not think I ever before saw so many ugly women
assembled at any place.  They were all well dressed of course.

	General Hamilton is here & we had a political chat this morning.  He said we had been most terribly abased in South Carolina, but things were now quiet.  Col. Campbell of Alabama expressed great pleasure in meeting me.  I went in the capital yesterday & wrote a long account of my visit for the Patriot which you will see.

	 Last night just as I was starting to the Presidents I was introduced to Mr. Ingersoll of Connecticut a young member of Congress.  I enquired of him if he was from New Haven & he said he was.  I then mentioned that I had frequently heard Mrs. Perry & her mother Mrs. McCall speak of Mr. & Mrs. Ingersoll of New Haven.  He said they were his parents & expressed great interest in you & your mother-- enquired which one of the daughters I had married, & said he remembered all of you�that your youngest sister was buried in his fathers ground.  He is a very handsome fellow & his name is Collin [Colin M.] Ingersoll.  He enquired if I was the editor of the union Paper in South Carolina--said he was glad to meet me &c.  I saw him again at the Levy with a young lady.  He is single & said to be courting Miss�of Alabama.

	General Hamilton mentioned to me this morning that Dr. Arthur Hayne was expected here & was an applicant for office in Charleston superintendent of�or something of that character.  

	We now have a terrible snow storm & it will be almost impossible to get out today.  I saw Mrs. Schoolcraft or Miss Howard last night at the Presidents, but I avoided speaking to her & Col. Orr did the same.

	The trial of Gardiner has not yet commenced.  The counsel seem confident of his acquittal.  I have not yet seen him.  General Thompson & myself are to go to the office of his lawyers soon.  It may be that the trial may not come on.  Two of Gardiners witnesses are not here yet.

	General Thompson went last night to see the spiritual�& is a believer.  He was put in connection with General Glasscock & tells marvellous communications made.  He ought to have called up the spirit of his departed wife & held a communication with her.  General Hamilton did so with his two dead sons.  I am going to see them today,

	I am enjoying myself very much here but very anxious to hear from you.  I hope to hear this evening.  I am writing for the Patriot so much that I shall not be able to write you every day.  B.F. Perry

	I have not yet heard from you & it is one week since I left home.  This is Sunday morning.  It seems to me one month.  I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  I trust however that you are all well & doing well.

	Yesterday I went to hear & see the spiritual�with General Thompson & Mr. Burt.  I have written a full account of all they did for the Patriot which you will see & which would fill my letter to report.  Everything was�strange.  I was at Burts again yesterday, & Mrs. Burt believes in the rapppings.  Frank Burt told her he was going to enquire all about & Armistead, whether they lived happily &c.  She told him that he and I ought to enquire about our wives at home & see whether they were not carrying on a flirtation in our absence.  I thought the age & appearance of Franks wife rendered such an enquiry unnecessary on his part.  Mrs. Burt seemed very kind, & I must have reminded her of old times before she ever saw Burt.  He said she looked for my gray hairs as soon as she saw me, & wanted to know what had become of them.  Burt is becoming gray.  She said she knew my head of old, & intimated�  She has grown quite fat & will weigh about two hundred.

	Whilst writing the above Col. Orr came to dine with us.  Judge Butler also came to see us, & sat for an hour or two with us.  Col. Orr has just left & it is now near six oclock in the evening, and I must finish my letter.  I intended to write you a long letter.

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Orr & sent a pleasant evening.  Saw Mr. Soule of Louisiana & his wife.

	I have not yet heard from you.  I saw Herndon & Thompson this evening.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I went to the Post office this morning & had the pleasure of receiving two letters from you.  I called at the Post office with Col Orr on our return from the Presidents.  The Col. told me to tell you to keep the thousand dollar check you had received for pin money.  I told him that you had sent me the letter, but kept the check.  I was truly glad to hear from you for I began to be uneasy.  General Thompson has now gone to the Post office to enquire for his letters.  I suppose he thinks his wife loves him as much as mine does me & will write him as soon.

	My visit to the President was a pleasant one indeed.  He met me most cordially & we talked a long time although there were others waiting to have a reception.  He told me all about his administration &c.  He said the Patriot was the only paper in South Carolina he cared to read for a great while.

	On my return from the Presidents we called to see Col. Clements of Alabama.  He expressed himself under many obligations to me for the notice I had taken of him.  I saw Mr. Stephens of Georgia & he enquired if I was the Editor of the Southern Patriot.  Everybody seems to know me about as well here as they do in Greenville.  Col. Orr introduced me to Mr.  [Benjamin D.] Naebors [Nabers] of Mississippi & began to tell who I was & Naebors stopped him & said he knew me perfectly well.  I have not been to the Senate today.  Judge Butler & Governor Aiken called to see us this morning.

	The case of Dr. Gardiner has not yet been taken up, & his witnesses have not yet arrived.  It is uncertain when it will be taken up for trial.  The doctor was at out room this morning with Col. Abbott one of his witnesses.  I am very much pleased with Dr. Gardiner indeed & have no doubt of his innocence.  Col.  Orr says I must argue the case of Dr. Earle & Chase in the Supreme Court if it comes on whilst I am here.  Both Orr & Thompson say this city is now the finest opening for a lawyer in the United States & think I would make a fortune here in a few years.

	As to getting office under the President there is no office within his gift worth having for a poor man with a family, who has a practice worth three thousand dollars at home.  Frank Burt is trying for the office of auditor worth three thousand dollars & expects to live here without his family.  He is in debt & poor fellow.  I am sorry for him.  Unless he gets an office he will have to sell his negroes or lose.

	I am getting very tired of this place, & if Gardiners trial does not come on, I shall not stay a great while longer.

	I hope to hear from you again tomorrow.  I see Livingstons Book neatly bound containing all of our likenesses.  I hope you & the children are all well.  There is a daguerreotypist here�but I have not yet been to see him.

	Mrs. Blake is here & doing well.  Col. Orr spoke of her daughter the grown one being an interesting young lady & said nothing about any scandal of her.  I hope the story told you by Mrs. Hubbard is not correct.  General Thompson & Gen. E� told me last night the Col. Bentons youngest & single daughter had a child recently.  What a horrible circumstance.

	Wilborn Perry & Major Miller & his two daughters passed through here last night on their way to New York.  I did not see them but Col. Orr did.

	Give my love to all the children & believe me yours truly and sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd two letters from you this morning & in one of them you mention the horrible circumstance about Col. [Thomas Edwin] Ware killing his father in law Adam Jones.  It has shocked me so that I am unfit for anything.  It is the most horrible & unexpected event, which could well have happened.  I thought Col Ware one of the coolest & most self possessed men I ever saw.  Col. Hoke sent me Col. Wares letter.  I am sorry I am not at home to comply with his request.  I hope however he will succeed in getting bail, & that he will also succeed in justifying himself before his country.

	Your letters seem to be filled up with offences & horrors.  I am sorry you permit these things to occupy so much of your thoughts.  If you were now situated as poor Mr. Burt is in poverty & a probability of your property being sold you might feel anxiety about yourself & the children.  But we are comfortable with a competency about us & in the enjoyment of health, & I doubt exceedingly if I could make any change that would not be disastrous in some way or other.  Let well enough alone.  I have a pretty certain income of $2,000, a good house to live in, servants enough, & a healthy climate with schools for our children.

	I received a note from President Fillmore last night requesting me to dine with him on Thursday next.  Neither General Thompson nor Mr. Burt are invited.  I shall go & have so written to him.

	Last night I attended the consultation of the council in the Gardiner case in the law office of Bradl[e]y & Carli[s]le�did not get off till twelve oclock in the night.  Then we all. Bradly, Carlile, Dr. Gardiner, General Thompson, Brady Jr & myself, went to an oyster House & took supper.  I did not get to my room till after one oclock.  We went on the whole case.  Thompson told me that Dr. Gardiner was very much taken with my appearance & was now anxious to have me as one of his counsel.  It is doubtful when the case will come on for trial.

	Mr. [Charles Magill] Conrad Secretary of War called to see General Thompson this morning & I had the pleasure of his acquaintance & conversation for some time.  Governor Aiken & Mr. Clingman called to see us this morning.  I have been down to the House this morning & made the acquaintance of a great many members.  They all knew me perfectly well.

	You can give the check to Mr. Elford & let him get the money & pay off Dr. Irwin as soon as he returns.  I have written to P. H� that I cannot take less�  I have not yet seen Mrs. Blake but will attend to your bag before I leave here.

	I have not much to write you today & Thompson & Burt are in my room talking & they confuse me.  Thompson recd a letter from home this morning.  You have written me four & his wife one to him.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter this morning giving me an account of your mothers visit to Col. Goodlett.  I should be very glad if Susan could be contented anywhere, but I am afraid that is impossible.   I feel well assured she will not stay at Col. Goodletts six months.  But do impress on her the necessity of her continuing there and being contented if she goes there.  Her character is in some measure at stake.  If she leaves there again it will [be] said that no one can please her or live with her�that she is a discontented nervous woman with whom no one can get along with.

	I wish to see you all again very much & I wish to be at home again.  To me there is no place like home.  I would not give up the society of my wife and children for all the fame & honors what the world can bestow.

	General Thompson & Burt and Col. Colcock have gone tonight to the spiritual rappers & asked me to go with them.  But I am rather disgusted with the humbuggery.  Yet stranger things are revealed by them.  Thompson believes as firmly as he believes in his existence.  Armistead Burt told me a very remarkable thing which occurred with him & Mrs. Burt & Mrs. Bell the other night.  They made the table dance about over the room & then they enquired if the spirit of any dead person was present.  Immediately there was a loud coffing.  They enquired whose spirit it was.  The spirit replied �John C. Calhouns.�  They asked & were answered a great many questions correctly.  This was all at Burts room & no one present but Mrs. Burt & Mrs. Bell!.

	I have seen Tom Thompson & Tom Thurston here.  Major Miller of Pickens District & Willborn Perry returned here this evening from New York & came to see us.

	I am now all alone and it is about nine oclock.  This is the first evening I have been alone since I left home.  Thompson & Burt will soon return with more�things from the rappers.

	I am fully determined that you & I will pay a visit to the north next summer.  Your notion of waiting till the Court of Equity is over is a good one.  Then we can stay as long as we please.  The other thousand dollars &�due from Alabama shall defray our expenses.  Whether we take Willie & Anna is another matter.  I think you will enjoy traveling some to make you like Greenville & home.  I assure you there is no place like it.  I am here now amidst all the great men & yet I wish I was back at home.  I dine with President Fillmore tomorrow,.  This is the last dinner he will give as President.  The great men & ladies of the U, State will be there.  Col. Orr is to introduce me to President Polks brother tomorrow who will go with me to the dinner party.

	I recd a letter this morning from Elford giving me the particulars of Coll Wares catastrophe.  It has excited great consternation with the whole South Carolina delegation.

	The Gardiner case is not likely to be tried for some weeks yet & if so I shall return home.  Dr. Gardiner called to see me today, but I was out.  Col. Payne a witness in the case went off today & told me the case would not be reached for two weeks.  I sent Thompson to make enquiries about the case, but have not yet heard the result.  

	President [Franklin] Pierce is now in Washington, but very few persons have called to see him.  It is likely he will dine with President Fillmore tomorrow & if so I shall see him most favorably.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	There was no Southern mail this morning & consequently I have heard nothing from you today.  I hope to hear tonight or in the morning.

	I have just dressed myself & am going to the Presidents to dine at six oclock.  It is now half after four oclock.  Tomorrow I will write you about the dinner.  I did not wish to go to the dinner party alone & Col. Orr was good enough to introduce me to General Polk, brother of President Polk, who is going from the National Hotel & is to go with me.  I am to call for him ten minutes before six.  He seems a pleasant gentleman.  Sunday we dine with Governor Corwin, Thompson, Burt & myself.  

	I have nothing to write you.  President Pierce keeps very close and sees very little company.  I hope to see him today at President Fillmore.  The case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up next Monday week, the week of Spartanburgh Court.  I do not know yet what I will do in reference to it.  I shall remain here anyhow till the last of next week.  

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

	I have rece[ive]d no letter from you for two days.  I went to the Post office this morning myself, but could find nothing for me.  I hope it is owing to the Boats not connecting with the Rail Road owing to the winds, which very often happens.  Tomorrow I may get two letters from you.  General Thompson has not rece[ive]d any letters either for two days past.

	Last evening I spent a delightful time at the Presidents & everything was magnificent, which I shall mention in my letter to the Patriot.  Just before we sat down to the table a naval officer came in, in full dress,  & I thought his name was announced Commodore McCall.  Consequently I thought he might be your uncle.  I looked at him & thought I could see a striking family likeness between you & him.  I had heard that you favored your Father.  I watched the old fellow & was pleased with his manners.  I thought they were something like yours.  My mind was made up that he must be your uncle.  I was thinking of letting the old man know who I was but first concluded to ask the Presidents son , a young gentleman who seemed master of ceremonies something more about the commodore.  In reply Mr. Fillmore told me his name was McCauly & that he had just returned from the Pacific on duty.  Away went all my conjectures &c.

	I was very much pleased with the President.  Commodore Stockton was there.  Governor Winthrop, Governor Jones of Tennessee, Mr. Thackeray an English writer of distinction & a good many members of Congress.

	Today I went to see the Washington Monument & the Smithsonian Institute.  Then I went to the Capitol.  Col. Summer came yesterday & he went with me to the Institute & the Capitol.  There Armistead Burt took possession of me & we rambled all over the city.  He carried me to where there were a great many pretty things for sale & into a great many nice stores.  I bought six more shirts for $12.75, six silk pocket handkerchiefs for $5.25cts.  They are now used Burt says instead of Linen.  I am glad of it for they do better. 

	General Thompson went to see General Pierce this morning.  I have not yet been to call on him.  This is the first day he has recd company generally.

	I hope you & the children are all well. I am very anxious to see you all again.  Burt asked me this morning how many children I had.  I noticed a pretty little child.  He said he did not notice such things.  Yours affectionately, B.F.P.

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  It has been three days since I heard from you.  Neither General Thompson or Mr. F. Burt have recd any during the same period which consoles me in some measure.

	As I was coming upstairs last evening I met General McQueen of South Carolina, who married Miss Pickens a lady we saw at the Chick Springs from Alabama.  He had a letter in his hand to his wife & said that he wrote to her every day & that she wrote to him every other day.  I said that you & I wrote every day.  He said he liked me better now than he ever did.  I told the expression to Col. Summer this morning in the presence of General McQueen.  Col. Summer replied he was not surprised at the General writing every day for he had not been married long, but that I had been married fifteen years.  I don�t think General Thompson has recd but two letters from Mrs. Thompson.  He has become in�with the spiritual rappers & goes there every day to talk with the spirit of his daughter, father, uncle and others.  But I believe he has never yet called up the spirit of his wife.  He believes most implicitly in the rappers.  I think it is all humbuggery.  Eliza Jones spirit told him yesterday that John Jones was going to marry Harriet Thurston.  But don�t mention this to anyone.  It distresses the General.  She said she wanted to send a message to her children &c.

	Last night I was by myself for some time & I commenced writing you a long letter& immediately Thompson & Burt came in & prevented me.  F. Burt fell down last night & hurt his face & arm so badly that he will not be able to get out again for some days.

	Today I went to see A[rmistead] Burt & we walked to the Fair, which is the most beautiful collection of pretty things I ever saw.  It has made me more anxious to go to the worlds fair.  We will certainly go.  After dinner I went back to the fair with General Thompson but he soon tired & left me.  I have just returned.  The building is the new wing of the Patent office & was crowded.

	Armistead Burt & myself are to go & see the President Monday next at ten oclock.  You speak of office.  There is not one within the gift of the President that I could accept.  No man with a young family living in Greenville ought to accept of any office whilst he is making three thousand dollars a year.  You may depend on my judgement.  I know that any such office would ruin me.  I know your interest, my interest & the interest of my children& nothing shall make me sacrifice them.  You must yield to me judgement in this matter.  

	I am anxious to see you & the children & don�t think I can stay away much longer.  Home & Home sweet home, there is no place like it, with a good wife & good children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Last night after I had gone to bed, they sent me from the Post office two letters from you & one from Sam Earle.  I was greatly relieved when I received your letters.  I had not heard from you for three days which appeared to me a very long time though I suppose there are many members of Congress who do not hear from their wives once in three weeks.  Your letters were dated Saturday & Monday.  General Thompson received one of the same from Mrs. Thompson dated Friday.

	This is Sunday & I am to fine with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  He has a fine library & collection of paintings & General Thompson says he has invited some friends to meet us there.  I find my little respect paid to the Sabbath here & very little going to church.  Very near to this Hotel is a very large Episcopal church which is under the charge of Mr. Butler whose wife figured so conspicuously  in the Anderdanck trial.  He is a clergyman of decided talent & eloquence.

I do not think your mother would be pleased boarding out & I am afraid Susan will not be.  Though I am in favor of your mother selling her House lot if she can for a fair price.  Real estate and every species of [property] has risen very much lately & is still rising.   Negroes are selling in Virginia for $1,200.00.  Women are worth $1,000.00�boys 10 years old $800.00.  Major Miller & Willborn Perry who came on to purchase negroes here returned without buying, and stated they could purchase much cheaper in South Caroline.  Lands are rising everywhere & it will be a good time to sell.  There will be a terrible crash in the world before many years in consequence of these high prices & speculation.  If I can get a high price for my house & lot, I might be induced to sell with your consent.  Everything here is very extravagant�being further north may be cheaper.

	You speak of wishing to go to Charleston in the spring.  I am very willing if we can provide the ways & means of going there & to the worlds fair both.  But I wish you to go there & see the world.  We will make a northern tour & you will be better pleased with Greenville.  There is nothing that makes me better satisfied with home than to go from home provided they have good sense & a good heart.

	General Thompson came in last night & informed me that he had seen the Cherokee chief & was about to be engaged by them again, & if so he would share his fees with me.  I hope something favorable will result from my visit.  I do not regret my trip however if nothing comes of it except my seeing the world & the great men of the world.

	This week I shall return my visits & see Mrs. Blake & get Anna medallion filled.  How much I wish to see you all�little Hext�Fanny�Frank, Anna & Willie & yourself.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday after writing to you I went & dined with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  General Thompson & Col. Summer were of the party.  We met a good many ladies there, but none remarkable for beauty or talent.  Miss Corwin is a good looking young lady.  She is quite young, and presided at the head of the table with grace & dignity.  Mrs. Corwin had gone home.  Miss Ellicott of Pennsylvania was quite agreeable & rather pretty.  I had the honor of escorting to the table Miss Smith of Ohio, sensible & ugly.  We spent a very pleasant evening & I am delighted with Corwin.    But you will see my letter in the Patriot.

	Today I went to see General Pierce with Armistead Burt & General Thompson.  General Thompson introduced me as the Editor of the�Paper in South Carolina.  He replied I know him perfectly well & am very happy to meet him.  He seems quite cordial and sincere, plain & unpretending.  He said we ought to have placed so quiet a man as he is in the Presidency.  Mr. Burt told him he was going off this evening & the President replied I wish I could go with you.  I observed I had no doubt he was sincere in this wish to get rid of the crowd which was worrying & annoying.  He said never before had his sleep been broken, that he could always heretofore sleep, but now that was not the case.  We staid but a few minutes & as we retired he asked General Thompson to come back tomorrow about some matters.

	I have today had my daguerreotype taken in a broach for you & in the medal[l]ion for Anna.  Your broach is a very pretty one (gold) and fashionable.  My likeness in it is said to be very good.  A very handsome woman, Mrs. Clements of Virginia, said so, as I was puitting it up.  The broach with my likeness cost only five dollars.  The likeness in Anna�s medal[l]ion only one dollar & fifty cents.

	Today has been raining.  I saw Tom Butler in the rotunda of the Capitol.  He said he left home Monday & all were well.  He looked very well.  I saw also doctor Hayne whop is here to get the appointment of Port Physician of Charleston.  He said all of your friends were well in Charleston�that Mrs. Hayne had recd a letter from Greenville just before he left stating you were all well.  I saw Johnson of Columbia & Boatwright &c.

	This morning Col. Orr introduced me to General Bailey of Virginia.  He said he was very glad to meet me if I was the man he took me to be the Editor of the Patriot.  In returning from the Presidents I met Mrs. Bailey & her daughter in a�shop & was introduced by General Thompson.  She is a very pleasant lady & told me that her daughter could make a table run all over the room & could raise a tumbler of water from the table by mere touch.  They do not account for it & cannot, nor had they been to see the spiritual rappers Mrs. Fox & her daughter.

	Mr. A. Burt & his wife were here this evening.  I wish I could go with them but I suppose you wish me to stay till the coronation & give you an account of it.  I am very tired & would not live here for any consideration.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  General Thompson goes to the rappers every day & communes with his deceased wife, child, mother & Father & says he is a new man.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter s-dated Wednesday, in which you say you have not yet heard from me in Washington.  I am greatly surprised at this for I was certain you would hear from me the morning you wrote.  I wrote the very night I arrived here which was the Thursday before you wrote the last letter recd from you.

	I am glad to hear that Judge O�Nealls opinion of Wares case was so favorable.  Tom Butler gave me all the particulars this evening.  He came to our room to see us.

	General Thompson has heard nothing from home for several days.  He complains that your letters come one or two days sooner than his wifes.  He is very much taken as I have already written you with the spiritual rappers.  He visits them daily & calls up the spirits of various persons.    He was telling me this evening a wonderful story about the spirits too long to relate.  

	I will tell you a good story in relation to Col. Summer & myself.  General Thompson & myself were sitting together at the table the other day & Miss Doty daughter of Governor Doty of Wisconsin was sitting opposite.  He said to me Summer is in love with that young lady.  Then he enquired of her if she heard.  She said no.  He got up & told her that his friend Col. Summer of South Carolina was in love with her.  She flashed her eyes across the table at me, thinking that I was the Colonel.  For one or two days she remained under this impression & Summer says she was crying me the whole time.  He said when we [were] sitting together he could catch her eyes, but when he was at the table alone she looked another way.  

	I have been interrupted as usual in my letter.  I thought I was safe for this night.  But in comes Thompson & Summer after Burt had gone to bed & I had to quit writing.  It is now after eleven oclock & I must quit & go to bed.  I had commenced for the purpose of telling you all the chit chat & anecdotes.  

	I will write you again tomorrow.  I have already written two letters today.  I suppose you & the children are all well & asleep.  It is the greatest comfort when from home to hear FROM HOME.

	I have just bought Livingstons Book very handsomely bound for eight dollars.  It is for sale in the book stores & it is something to see my own likeness & life in a book which will be read by thousands of people.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is a very bad day.  The rain is pouring down, and I am not able to go out.  I am now all alone, but how long this will be the case is doubtful.  I have therefore concluded to write you a letter.  I will write till I am disturbed.  But I have nothing to write you.  Nothing has occurred since last night [at] eleven oclock when I finished my last letter to you.

	Having no incidents to mention I will comment on the City of Washington & the thousands of strangers who are now here seeking offices, wives, husbands, & pleasure.  I suppose there are at this time in the city at least five thousand women from all parts of the United States seeking husbands just as openly as the men are seeking offices & I presume nineteen twentieths of both classes will be disappointed.  It is hard to say�which class of seekers are the more active & indefatigable in their respective pursuits.  The ladies seem to wish to excite love in all their actions & mode of dressing.  I will mention one or two instances & leave you to judge for yourself.  Last night at the supper table, which is a huge round table where each one can see everybody else.  Two ladies took their seats opposite to me with their entire bosoms open to their belts and their white gowns covering their breasts just in such a way as to expose the whole bosom.  One of them deliberately put her hand on her breast & compressed it so as to push it a little under her dress.  I must confess I never saw such a fine pair of breasts in my life, full & pleasing, fair & beautiful, swelling & sinking with every breath drawn.

	This morning I saw two others come to the breakfast table very neatly & prettily dressed, but with gowns opening in front & exposing a part of a white underdress below the waist!  These latter ladies are said to be the Miss Stephens from South Carolina., but I think they are from New York�the two last night I was not able to learn anything about.  They have a way too, of placing the elbow on the table with the hand raised, by which means they are enabled to expose to view the whole arm naked with beautiful frills encircling & fingers covered over with jewelry, a very pretty sight.  In the Streets, in the Capitol, at the Fair, there is one complete jam�dresses as various as the states�cloaks like gowns are much worn.  I have not seen a long cloak at all.  

	The gentlemen are very much whiskered & bearded & mustached.  They are from all parts of the world, England & China, California, France, Australia, Maine, Canada Russia &c.  

	The trial of Dr. Gardiner does not commence till Monday & may take two weeks.  I do not think it proper for me to stay & risk the chances.  But I have determined on nothing yet.  As soon as I do I will write you.  I am tired of this crowd & cease to take much interest in the proceedings of Congress.  Mr. Armistead Burt said to me yesterday as he was leaving the Capitol for the last time that he intended to shake the dust off his feet & quit the place, that he had been here ten years & was utterly disgusted with Congress & the city.

	I have written you so many letters, & you were so long in receiving the first one that I am afraid you will not have time to read all of them before I return home.  When they begin to come you will get them by half dozens.

	Mr. Burt has just come up & brought me your letter of Thursday & yet you have heard nothing from me.  That is strange very strange.  B.F.Perry

	I rece[ive]d no letters from you yesterday, but I hope to get one this morning.

	Yesterday in looking into a jewellers shop I saw the most beautiful tea set I ever laid my eyes on.  It was the prettiest pattern & just opened.  Tea pot, coffee pot, sugar dish, cream pot &�bowl�Silver.  I enquired the price & was told forty dollars only so I thought it would be a handsome present to bting you & purchased it.  It is in fact�ware & outwardly silver.  No human being can tell it from silver.  The ware is now�silver entirely.  I am sure you will be pleased with the set.  I think such a purchase a very judicious one for all time to come.

	There was nothing doing yesterday & I have nothing to write about & in fact have no leisure to write, as someone is always in my room.

	I think it probable I shall leave here for home by the way of Baltimore Sunday morning.  This will enable me to get home Wednesday or Thursday.  The trial of Gardiner will not take place for some time
& I cannot stay for it & in fact have not been employed in it regularly.  I have heard nothing more of Thompsons Indian case.  He has kept me here waiting about that.  But after all a tolerable practice at home is far better than any practice abroad.

	The Inauguration will take place tomorrow & I shall see the crowd, but do not expect to see anything else.  President Pierce has gone to Baltimore to meet Mrs. Pierce & will not return before this evening.  

	I am delighted at the idea of returning home & meeting once more my dear wife & children.  I have seen a great deal by coming here & [am] amply compensated for my trip.  In great haste, yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d this morning after writing to you a letter from you dated25th of Feb[ruary] in which you stated that you had just rece[ive]cd two letters from me and were delighted with them.  I was glad to hear that you had at last rece[ive]d some of my letters.  I have written to you every day since I have been in Washington.  I wrote to you the night I arrived here, six full pages & did not go to bed tired as I was till twelve oclock.  I am grattified too that my letters are read by you with interest.  If they only give you the same pleasure to read that they do me to write I have nothing to complain of.  I love you�love to write to you.  You are my sweetheart, my wife, & the mother of my children & when absent from you my love for you & the children is called into action.  It is then just as strong in my heart when at home as it is when abroad.  But it is inactive or when I don�t feel the strength of it till separated from you.  In our intercourse through life you may have found me self willed & seemingly harsh, but this very conduct has been the consequence of my love.  I am more disposed that my children should behave [more]  properly than my servants & hence I reproach them perhaps [more] often than I do my servants.  I do nothing in revenge & therefore do not correct my servants as often as I ought perhaps.

	But I have got to moralizing & will quit it with this expression that I love with an ardent sincerity justice & right in all things.  I am a good [husband] from principle & nature as well as from affection & love.  You too are a good wife from the [same] feeling & principle.

	General Thompson is constant in going to the spiritual; rappers & calling up the spirit of his daughter, wife, father & mother.  Mrs. Thompson in Greenville does not know that he has been in Washington with his first wife.  He told me confidentially the other day that he asked the spirit of his first wife if she was willing for him to marry & she said yes.  He asked if she loved his second wife & she said yes.  If she preferred his marrying her to anyone else & she gave the same reply.  I told General Thompson last night that he was permitting this thing to take too strong a hold of his mind & that it was a fallacy a humbuggery & he ought to throw it off.  That these spirits had told him all sorts of lies & he ought not to believe anything they said.  They told him his cloak, which he lost in Charleston was found & he would get [it], which is untrue.  They told him that Mrs. Jones his wifes mother died in 1825.  But they have told him so many pleasant things that he wishes to believe them.  

	He came to our room the other night & told me that he called up the spirit of his mother & she made a bell ring & move all over the floor�that he requested his mothers spirit to touch him & she did so all down the thigh & leg.  He told her to put one of the bells on his arm & he told her to take it off & the bell got off.  I give you this as a specimen of his wonderful sayings & delusions.  I laughed at him & told him I would have him put in the lunatic asylum as we passed through Columbia.

	I have now written you two letters today & will stop & go to dinner.  I am afraid I write you & Elford so much that you will not read my letters & he will not be able to publish them.

	Give my love to your mother & sisters and tell them all that it would now be my greatest pleasure to meet them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  I hope I may tonight as we have two mails.

	I am somewhat indisposed with A Bad cold & did not go out to the Inauguration.  It is snowing & has been all day & I felt no inclination to risk my health in such weather.  I saw the crowd pass by this Hotel & saw the two Presidents in Gen. Pierces superb carriage & horses.  The General rose as he came opposite the Hotel bowed & waved his hat to the ladies.  There were supposed to be seventy thousand persons at the Inauguration.  The speech is spoken of in high terms.

	I was in hopes that my stay in Washington was at an end & thought of starting home Sunday.  But Dr. Gardiner came to see me this morning and insists on my remaining for his trial next week & offers me a fee of one thousand dollars.  The heads of the Cherokee Indians came this morning & wished to employ General Thompson & myself in the formation of as treaty for them with the President.  Their fee will be enormous if we succeed in effecting the treaty.  I am likewise anxious to see more of President Pierce.  Thompson says if Judge [James Moore] Wayne should die & his health is bad, that Pierce will appoint=t me to the Supreme Bench of the United States.

	Under all these considerations I will stay until after the trial of Dr. Gardiner.  I do not know that I should make one thousand dollars at home.  In the mean time I shall see what can be done with the Cherokee chiefs.  If we succeed in that matter it will be a fortune.

	I have just come up from the dinner table & dined with Col. Colcock, Gen. McQueen, Col. Orr & Mr. Woodward & Gov. Hubbard of Maine.  General McQueen drank to our wives.  I stated that we wrote every day.  Col. Orr said he wrote once in two or three weeks.  Woodward said he did not write at all.  Colcock said he wrote every mail.  We had quite a pleasant party at dinner.  The crowd here is what you would have no conception of.  It will diminish from this term.  The display of the military was grand.

	I am not interrupted by company and really I never have time to write you composedly.  

	Give my love to the children.  Tell them I have bought the coined likeness of General Pierce & General Scott about the size of a quarter of a dollar for them.  They are very pretty.  Give my love to your mother & sisters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

His Excellency President Pierce

	Most respectfully I ask permission to say a word in favor of my friend Francis Burt Esq of Pendleton South Carolina who is an applicant for office from your Excellency.
	
	I am myself a citizen of South Carolina, and a union democrat, who claims to have been one of the first to urge the propriety of the State�s voting for the Baltimore nomination.

	When South Carolina, with seeming unanimity, declared her purpose of resistance to the compromise & a fixed determination to dissolve the Union, I threw myself in the breach, and resisted the action of the state by the establishment of a union Paper in the town of Greenville.  My speech in the legislature of South Carolina in defence of the compromise & the Federal Union, and the establishment of the Southern Patriot was the beginning of an opposition which gradually grew & increased till the state was saved from a bloody revolution.

	For myself I ask no office or reward for the sacrifice of my popularity & influence in South Carolina in defence of the Union & the compromise.  The wildest term applied to me was that of traitor, but I knew my own heart & disregarded it, Although I ask nothing for myself, I do ask for my friend who was then politically opposed to me and whom I know to be honorable & capable & meritorious.  His appointment will confer a favor on me & be highly acceptable to the State of South Carolina in whose service he has spent many years of his life & held a high & responsible office, Treasurer of the State.  

	I am with great respect yours &c, B.F. Perry

	I have been all day today engaged in the Gardiner case, which will be tried or commenced next Monday or Tuesday.  I have been at the law office of Bradly & Carlisle with Dr. Gardiner & Col. Gates.  I am going back there as soon as I write you a line.

	On my return to dinner General Thompson informed me that he had made a contract with the Indians.  We are to have five hundred cash any how & five percent on a half million if we succeed.  This is a pretty good fee.  

	I will write you again tonight.  My room is full again & I must stop.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday morning and I have just had my breakfast and sealed myself to write you a long letter.  But in all probability before I have written a dozen lines there will be persons in my room & interrupt my writing & I never will again have a room so public & appropriated to other persons.

	I wrote you a short letter yesterday for I was engaged all day.  I am disposed to study my case today also.  I think I shall be able to make a good speech.  There are facts & circumstances enough in Gardiners case for a good speech.  I am afraid it will take a long time to try it.  This I regret for I am exceedingly anxious to return home.  I have at this time too a very bad cold which distresses me a great deal.

	I do not know when our Indian business will commence.  This may deter me some time & perhaps render it necessary for me to return to Washington.  I will write you as soon as anything is ascertained in reference to it.

	I hope upon the whole that my visit to Washington will be a fortunate one for me�that it will be the turning over a new leaf in my life.  This Indian business will necessarily throw me a good deal with President Pierce, & make me acquainted with him.  He may in the course of�events take a fancy to me as you say that his character & mine are very much alike.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you Friday night dated Sunday preceding, but I have heard nothing from you since.  I hope to hear this morning when the mail is opened.  General Thompson received no letter from Mrs. Thompson & seemed mortified.  He thought I suppose that his wife ought to write as often as you did.  He requested her to write every other day.

	I am truly glad to hear that Susan is going to remain with your mother.  It is the only proper place for her.  I know full well she will be satisfied nowhere else.  It is more respectable too, and more becoming than for her, separated from her husband, to be boarding out.

	I regard to your mother selling her house for a fair price I approve of it.  She may purchase again or go elsewhere.  If she goes from Greenville let her go back to Charleston & board in some private house.  There she will have friends & relations to visit & see her.  It will cost her much less than keeping house & be more agreeable.  I doubt the policy of her going north.  But she may try it.  How Susan is today I know not & shall never advise again about her.  She has acted foolish from the day of her marriage to the present time.  It was an unfortunate marriage but it was her duty to make the best of it & especially for her childrens sake.  A woman who is so sensitive & selfish as that as to sacrifice her own comfort & convenience for the sake of her children is either bad or foolish�the latter I attribute to Susan.  I think she & your mother the most unwise people for this world & this life that I ever knew and yet I believe they are good & far better than others who before prudently [page torn]

	How I wish to see you & the children!  Nothing neither money nor fame can compensate me for the loss of my family, society & the care of my wife and children.  I am here the associate of Senators, Governors, Judges & high functionaries of government but I had much rather be the associate of you & William & Anna, Frank, Fanny & dear little Hext.

	I must now conclude my dear wife.  Your affectionate husband.  I have no idea when I shall be at home.  But hope the week of Laurens court.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you yesterday after I had written to you.  General Thompson rece[ive]d no letter & was greatly mortified.  He must think that his young wife has neglected him.  He is in constant communication here with the spiritual rappers in beautiful poetry & said she loved to watch over him in sleep & play about his breast.  He sent this poetry which is very pretty to his wife in Greenville.  I think there is a want of propriety in talking to the second wife so much about the first.  It must excite her jealousy. 

	My cold is still bad and today I have to go into court.  I took pills last night.  You must still continue to write to me.  I am afraid from your last letter you may think I am now on the road home.  I wish I was.

	Congress has adjourned & I shall not have the pleasure of seeing Ingersoll again to make the enquiries you desire.  But all will go to him.  However next summer & to the Worlds Fair.  Whether we had better carry William & Anna is doubtful.  We will take them a year or two hence when it will do
Them more service to see the world.

       I have been preparing on my case & shall henceforth have veery little to tell you.  General Thompson says that there is great expectation from my speech & many are anxious to hear it. I have the reputation here of being a very fine looking man which I am sure will please you.
       
       I was met the other day in the street by Mr. Bailor of the Cotton Plant who asked me if I was not Mr. Perry of South Carolina.  He said he had understood I was in the city & he knew me from a description he had received of me.
       
       I must now conclude & go to Breakfast.  The spiritual rappers told General Thompson last night that his child was sick with cold.  I ought to go & consult them about you & the children.  They tell everything that is to happen.  Indeed they have made some wonderful revelations and it is impossible to account for them.
       
       I hope you are all well.  God bless you.  Give my love to the children & to your mother & sister.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
       
P.S. Col. Summer has gone on to New York to court a young lady Miss Doty after two days acquaintance.  He wrote her a note & she wrote him an answer.  She is daughter of Governor Doty of Wisconsin & now a member of Congress.

	I have just returned from court & found your letter of Monday last.  I am so glad to hear from you that I will write you another letter to acknowledge the receipt of it.  No letters come for Genl. Thompson & he is distressed about it.  

	I was admitted to practice in the court here this morning & the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up tomorrow.  I made a few remarks this morning in the case before the court & produced a decided change in the mind of his Honor Judge Crawford as to the right of the U, States to take up which case the district attorney pleases.  I feel that I am prepared to make a good speech in the case if it comes on.

	I am sorry you say you may not write me again.  I hope my letters received will make you do so.  I may be here eight or ten days yet.  

	There is still a great crowd of persons in Washington & office hunters in great abundance.

	General Thompson speaks favorably about our Indian business & thinks we shall be successful and realize fifteen thousand each in the case.  In great haste, your affectionate and devoted husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have rece[ive]d a letter from you today in reply to the one I wrote you of dining with the President.  General Thompson brought it up to the Court House for me from the Hotel, & I was glad, in the conclusion of it you said Mrs. Thompson was well.  He was very anxious & had no letters from home.

	I made a speech this morning in the Gardiner case on a continuance of it, which was well recei[ve]d.  Mr. Bradly & Mr. Carlisle both spoke of my effort in the highest terms to General Thompson.  I saw the effect of my speech on the Judge, Jury & crowd.  They seem to say with their eyes & faces this is admissible, better than we are accustomed to hear.  I carried the point & the case will be taken up tomorrow or Friday at furthest.  The counsel for the United States the district attorney & Mr. May turned pale & their faces looked cadaverous as I was pouring forth some of my burst of feeling & passion.  I am satisfied I have made a good beginning & I hope I shall make a good ending.

	I have nothing more to write you as my time is taken up with this case.  If I succeed well in it, Thompson says I will be employed in the Equity suit.  He has just written to his wife that I had made a speech & acquitted myself admirably as he knew I would, & that she must call & tell you so.

	It is uncertain when the case will be disposed of.  I am now in it & must remain.  But I shall be at home in a week or two I hope.  Write me every day & tell me all the news.  Your letters are my greatest comfort during my absence.  I am glad you read with so much interest my letters in the Patriot.  I have a dreadful cold.  The weather is now wild.

	I will write for the Patriot occasionally but not as often as I have done.  I hope all things are going on well at home.  Go & see Mrs. Thompson & write about her to me so that I may read your letters to the General.

	God bless you & the children.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Last night I rece[ive]d two letters from you�one dated 22d February & the other 2d March.  How one of them could have been so long getting here I cannot imagine.  In the one of 22d Feb. you mention having rece[ive]d Judge Evans� letter.  The Judge told me that he had written me a letter before leaving home, and I thought [it] strange you had not mentioned it.

	  General Thompson has not heard from home for two weeks & he was affected to tears last night when he brought me up your two letters & had none for himself.  He thinks some of his family are sick & made me run over your letters to see if you mentioned anything about them.  He says he knows Mrs. Thompson has written to him.
	I am very much obliged to you for writing so often & our attention to each other when absent will show our friends how much we think of each other.  Col. Colcock met me the other morning & asked if I had not written to you the conversation of General McQueen Woodward Orr & himself about writing to their wives.  I told him yes.  He said he thought so.

	I hope today to receive a Patriot containing my letters.  It must be full of them.

	I will tell you when I return all about the spiritual rappers.  They are very remarkable indeed.  Governor Corwin came to our room last night & told what had been done in his own family.  His son returned from college & laughed at his father for believing anything about it.  Whereupon the governor & his daughter & some young ladies and his son sat around a little table, put their hands on the table and their fingers pointed in the direction he wished the table to turn & it began to move & as his would wish or direct the table would turn about�no one touching it.  Then he asked for a spirit & the table would spell�he repeating the alphabet & the table stopping at the right letter till the whole word was spelled!  This is true.

	I hope the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up today & that it may be finished this week.  I am most impatient to get home.  General Thompson consulted the spiritual rappers yesterday in the presence of Gov. Tallma[d]ge & Col. Colcock as to the trial & my speech.  The spirit told him that the trial would not take place till tomorrow & that I would make a great speech & excel all the other lawyers engaged on the case.  I hope the spirits tell the truth in this instance.  It is probable we will have to return about our Indian business.  

	I must now close my letter.  The books from Livingston will no doubt go safely to Columbia.  I have already got the two volumes for $8.00 very handsomely bound.  I have bought six more shirts, six pairs of drawers & a new hat and six silk pocket handkerchiefs & three pairs of socks.  I wrote to you about your tea set.  It is the prettiest you ever saw.  I have bought a new trunk for us to travel with next summer.  Your loving husband, BV.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Last evening Dr. Gardiner came to me room & said that my speech had produced quite a sensation.  He expressed himself pleased with it and I might say was in ecstacies at it.  He seems encouraged by it & I think we all are in good spirits.  After writing to you yesterday I went out to see about my shirts& the merchant who is a very gentlemanly man said that he was pleased to see that I was employed in the Gardiner case, that he was one of the Jury &�have the pleasurer of hearing me  speak &c.  He had been in the Court House at some stage of the proceedings.  Thompson says that the case is so much talked of & written about that it will give me a national reputation at once.  I hope good will come out of my trip to Washington.

	I am afraid that you will stop writing to me under the impression that I am on my way home.  But this is not likely to be the case for some time to come.  Mr. Burt leaves here this morning.  I wish I could go with him most sincerely.  Col. Orr leaves tomorrow.  Colcock goes today or tomorrow.  Judge Butler & Judge Evans have to remain for some time as Senators.  Tom Butler is here as large as life.  Tom Thompson was to see us last night.  I met Tom Thurston in the streets yesterday evening.  I went to the Appollo Hall last evening.to see Mrs. Blake but she was giving lessons in dancing.  I sent up my card & wrote a note that I would call again.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  General Thompson saw general Pierce last night and is very much pleased with him.  The Indians came to see us last night.  Thompson thinks we can make the treaty at once.  This would be great luck.

	God bless you and the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you last night, on my return from a visit to Judge Butler, dated the 4th Inst., and whilst reading it Mr. Beattie & Mr. Grady came into my room with General Thompson.  I was truly glad to see them & we sat up & chatted till after twelve oclock.  They did not arrive here till nine oclock in the night.  I have sent by Beattie Annas locket with my likeness & your broach with my likeness.  I have also sent by him some medals for the children of Pierce & Scott, who you have no doubt rece[ive]d before this letter reaches you.

	But Beattie & Grady had left home two days after I did & therefore could tell me no news.  I sent the locket & broach for you to have something to see & talk about, though I had rather kept them & exhibited them myself.  I am a good deal like Anna in this respect when she wished her Christmas presents kept till she returned.

	I have bought your silver goblets of the most beautiful pattern in the world for fifty dollars.  They are of the Abbotts�&�beautifully.  They were at the Fair for exhibition.  These with the tea set will be a handsome present for you.  They were so beautiful I could not resist every temptation but that of beauty.  They are used instead of tumblers.  Tumblers are out of fashion & glass goblets will last always & glass tumblers break directly they are cheaper & as a matter of economy it is better to purchase them.

	When Burt left here yesterday I had to let him have fifty dollars to get home.  His brother Armistead Burt told me to furnish him with money & he would refund to me and told me to say so to Frank Burt.  So I am now about able to get home myself after the Gardiner case is over.

	Judge Butler invited me to dine with him tomorrow & see his mess.  

	I must now conclude hoping to hear from you again tonight. I am glad to hear Willie is improving.  I hope he will study hard.  Anna must attend to her studies too & music lessons.  Fanny must be a good girl & study her lessons.  Frank I hope will be quite improved when I see him.  Hext I hope will talk.  God bless you, B.F. Perry

	I now have a room to myself.  It is a great comfort.  I was glad when Burt went off though sorry in some respects.  It is horrible to be tied to anyone or have to room with anyone but my wife.  I never will again under any circumstances permit myself to be so imposed on.  But when we arrived here it was the only chance.  They gave Thompson a room without a fire place & me & Burt a room together with a fire place.  The same evening Burt went off I came up to my room & saw a gentlemans cloak &c on Burts bed & every indication that I was to have another room companion.  This threw me into a violent passion & down I went charging on the Bar keeper.  He said� your friend Col. Summer has returned & wishes to go into a room with you.�  I replied that I was very glad to learn that my friend Col. Summer had returned & that I wished him treated with more respect than to be thrust into my room�that the Colonel was a gentleman & entitled to a separate room.  This I communicated to the Colonel also & he was provided with e room.  I would not again room with anyone if I could do so without paying board.

	I am not all alone & have just come up from my supper which has induced this long preface to my letter.  I am feeling & enjoying the luxury of being alone & thought I could not do better than to write you although I have already written you one letter this morning.

	The Gardiner case was not taken up today.  I suppose it will begin in the morning and in the morning I shall have no time to write you.  I rece[ive]d a note from Mrs. Blake as I went to tea saying she would be happy to see me this evening or tomorrow morning.  But I shall not be able to see her.  I cannot venturer out at night with my cold and in the morning I shall not have time.

	We had an interview with the Cherokee Indians this evening & General Thompson read a note from the Secretary of the Interior saying he could not make the treaty at this time.  It is probable that some time next summer will be fixed on for making the treaty.  If so you and I can come on to Washington & stay till it is over & then go to the Worlds Fair & New Haven.  This would suit exactly.  I shall always be happy to have you for a roommate at Washington.  It will give me great pleasure too to have you always as my travelling companion & guardian spirit.

	If I have time I will go & see the spiritual rappers again before I leave Washington & propound the questions you desire.  Thompson goes twice a day & talks with his wife, daughter, mother, father, friends, negroes &c &c.  Mrs. Cornelia Thompson his present wife has written him [to] not go any more.  She does not like it.  I expect she is a little jealous.  She says it is all nonsense and that God will not permit a spirit to reveal that which he wishes to conceal.

	You think I would idolize my second wife.  I don�t think I could love her more than I do you.  But I hope both you & I have too much good sense & love for our children ever to marry again if either of us were to die.  I think a man is a great fool to marry the second time & a woman a still greater.  Senator Crittenden & his first wife have both been married three times.  I feel a contempt for such folks, and as to the woman I look upon her as wanting in virtue.

	I saw yesterday at the breakfast table an old tottering, gray bearded paralytic man come walking in with a buxome young woman.  They had just got married in New York & were taking a jaunt to spend the�moon.  I should suppose and so thought when I saw them that it would be moon without any�to the bride.

	The office hunters & seekers are still here & some of them have their wives with them.  The Hotel is still full.  But a more anxious set of fellows I never saw.  General Hamilton told me the other day that it was intimated in the Charleston Courier that I was here seeking the consulate at Liverpool & that General Thompson had come on to assist me.  I have written a very severe reply for the Charleston Courier & not one to be published in that paper.  I see from the last Charleston Courier several extracts from my letters & notices of me stating that I am employed in the Gardiner case &c.  The Washington papers & the New York papers all announce me as one of the counsel of Gardiner & that I am from South Carolina &c.  Thompson says that if I acquit myself well in this case Gardiner will employ me in the Equity cases which will pay enormous fees.

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  Tomorrow I shall get any letters you have written on Sunday.  Saturday no mail leaves Greenville which accounts for my not receiving any letters today.  You must continue to write to me till I tell you to stop.  Let me hear all about the children & tell me what they are doing & how they are�.  If you want money you can borrow of Elford.

       I see now I shall not be at home before the last of return week & perhaps not till Anderson court.  As I have got into the case I must stick to it.  It will give me some fame anyhow & perhaps be the means of turning over a new leaf in my book of fortune.
       
       	I met Dr. Hayne in the streets today.  President Fillmore has gone to Charleston where he is to be the guest of Governor Aiken for some days.  He then goes to New Orleans & returns up the Mississippi river.
       
       I hope your mother Susan & children & Anne are all well.  Remember me to them.  Give my love to the children.  It is now about nine oclock & the mails here just arrived from New York.  I will go down & look at the papers & then go to bed & make up for my loss of sleep last night with Beattie & Grady till after midnight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have rec[eive]d no letters from you for the last two days.  It is now nine oclock in the night & I have just returned from Bradleys office & got my supper.  We have commenced the Gardiner case & it opens badly.  All day till four oclock we were closely engaged in the Court House.  Since that time we have been engaged in consultation.  I feel fatigued & depressed but I hope the base may take a better turn tomorrow.  � made a very able opening speech against Gardiner & his counsel Bradley & Carlisle  [have] been not disposed to make one in reply before offering testimony.  I have at last got Bradley to agree to a different order of battle.  He will open in the morning.  I told him my rule was to fight every inch of ground & always keep a bold front.  The case is full of mistry.  No one can tell the result.  General Thompson is quite uneasy.  But my rule is not to despair.

	I hope you have not stopped writing to me under the impression I am returning home.  I shall certainly be here all of next week.  Mr. � the assistant of the district attorney who spoke this morning is the brother of Mrs. McCray.  I met him at the Virginia Springs in 1846.  He seems very kind & friendly on meeting me in court & wished to know if I had been able to get comfortable rooms & seemed disposed to provide for me &c.  I met his brother Dr. � the other day.  He came to see Burt when he was sick.  He told me that his sister had become very large & was married to a gentleman in Baltimore.  

	Col. Orr & Summer left here this morning.  Col. Summer sends his compliments to you & says that although he never had the pleasure of seeing you he entertains a high opinion of you from your children whom he has seen, Frank, Willie & Anna & also from your husband whom he regards a man of taste &c.  The Col. came back from New York rather cooled in his love affair.

	I have nothing new to write you & shall Have nothing for several days to come.  The Indians came down to see me this evening just after I had got out of court but nothing further has been arranged in their business.  One of them is a full blooded Indian and cannot speak English.  The others are half breeds.  They know Mrs. Doctor Butler very well.  William is clever�Tom not very well.  Judge Hicks one of the delegation was raised about Bachelors Retreat in Pickens.  Adair another one of them used to know my family.  

	How little I expected to be gone so long when I started.  The Patriot & my letters are greatly read & sought for in Washington.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	On my return from the Court House today at four oclock I met General Thompson with your letter in his hand at the door of the Hotel waiting for me to open it & tell him the news from Greenville.  He did not receive any letters today, nor did he yesterday.  Your letter was dated last Sunday & you spoke of the deep snow.  It was refreshing to be rewarded with a letter from my wife after a fatiguing day in the court House.  

	The case of Gardiner goes on better today & I think a change has taken place in the minds of the Jury after hearing the statement of our side of the case from Bradl[e]y.  he made the opening speech for Gardiner & Carlisle & myself will argue the case after we have gone through the testimony.  But we are all making speeches on points of testimony throughout the day.  The newspapers are reporting our speeches.  I see a pretty full report this morning in the Republic of the arguments yesterday.  I see it stated in all the newspapers that I am here as counsel for Gardiner.  The Southern Standard this morning had long extracts from my letters & pronounced them the best travelling gossip it had even seen.  

	General Thompson has just come up from the Reading Room & says that the gentlemen there who were in court today state that I outspoke all of the lawyers�long�some of them said there was no comparison between my speaking & that of the others.  I only addressed the court for a few minutes.  I am pleased that my mode of speaking is so much admired.  When I come to make the�argument I hope to do well.

	After writing the above I went down to supper & whilst sitting at the table talking to Major Wigg of South Carolina who has just got a claim passed Congress for fifty or sixty thousand dollars on account of his grandfathers losses in the revolution, and who was the brother in law of Col. Isaac Hayne the martyr,  I was requested by Mr. Colcock to go with him & various others to see Governor [Nathaniel P.] Tallma[d]ge & hear him talk about spiritual rappers & I went with them.  It is now Sunday morning before breakfast.  I did not return till near mid morning from Governor Tallma[d]ges & on my return found a short letter from you dated Monday last.  I was glad to hear from you again a day later than my letter rece[ive]d yesterday morning.  General Thompson  came into my room & I read a portion of your letter to him.  If Mrs. Thompson only knew with how much interest he looks forward to the reception of a letter by me from you she would certainly write him oftener.  

	My visit to Governor Tallma[d]ge & the rappers I will write out for the Patriot. He told the most wonderful & marvellous things done by the spirits to him.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you yesterday after I had written & deposited my letter in the mail in the box in which you state that you had rece[ive]d three letters that morning (Sunday) from me.  I am sorry that my letters reach you so much together.  It must be a task to read them all together.  

	I was glad to hear that all were well & that you were preparing to have beef.  I think you might wean master Hext now & feed him on beef stake.  You stated he was twenty 0ne months old.  I dreamed about the little fellow last night.  How happy I should be to see you all.  No consideration could induce me to absent myself from you & the children as these members of Congress do from their wives & families.

	Yesterday I dined with Judge Butler & his mess. Consisting of Senators Mason & Hunter of Virginia & Atkinson of Missouri & Holmes of Charleston.  I spent a very pleasant day.  Judge Butler & myself took a long walk in the forepart of the day & were starting to walk again after dinner when we met two Englishmen calling to see him.

	The trial of Gardiner goes on today.  How long it will last no one can tell.  You will see a report of the whole case in the daily Republic of Washington.  You cab get the Republic at the Patriot office.  I will not stop until the evening & write you a line after I come out of court.

	It isa now eight oclock at night & I have just returned from the Court House.  We sat in court till half after four oclock in the evening & then Mr. [James M.] Carlisle one of Dr. Gardiners lawyers insisted on Mr. [Joseph H.] Bradl[e]y & myself going home with him & taking dinner.  I am glad I went, for he lives in more magnificence than the President himself.  He married the niece of Madame Calderon, the wife of the Spanish Minister, & his wife�s sister is married to one of the Spanish Legation.  His mother, wife, sister in law & her husband the Spanish secretary, an another Spanish attache.  Bradl[e]y & or some of the Navy were present.  His house is a palace & furnished like one.  I went up into a chamber to wash my hands, & thereby saw the whole house.  His wife and the whole household were so cozy & familliar, that I felt at home amidst all the splendor around me.  I was in a pleasant mood, & had become very intimate with Carlisle & made myself easy with his wife, mother & children�three pretty little boys the oldest not more than five years old.  The Spanish gentlemen were good looking & familliar.  Mrs. Carlisle said she had enquired a good deal every day about the case, Dr. Gardiner & his counsel, & asked how Mr. Perry looked whilst the case was going on.  I suppose Mr. Carlisle carried me home with him to show me.  I spoke in high terms of Madame Calderons Book, saw her portrait.  His youngest son is thirteen months old & talks, but cant walk.  

	We have made no progress in the case today.  No letters from you, so I will bid you good night.  God bless you & the children, B.F. Perry

	I am so much occupied night & day with Dr. Gardiner, his counsel & his case that I have no time to write you.  I am afraid too that his case will result badly.  The testimony yesterday was very strong against him.  We are all alarmed for the first time.  Gardiner seems less alarmed than his counsel General.  Thompson feels very much the weight of the testimony.

	I read a long letter from you yesterday informing me that Cox, Will & Jenkins will had been sustained.  This is good news.  I am glad my letters are in demand.  They are so here.

	I have had a dreadful cold & my hands have all pealed over again.  The cool fires are very bad.  The room is too much heated at night.

	I Am almost crazy to leave Washington & get back to you & the children�my home & my comforts.  It has been near five weeks since I left home.  There is no telling when the case will be ended.

	I am not sorry that I have taken the trip for I have really seen a great deal & become known to a great many & I hope it will be of service to me hereafter.  But I am now through with all that & wish to be at home again.  

	You must request Col. Townes & Mr. Elford to attend to all my matters at Greenville or on the circuit.  I shall be at home before Greenville court if I have to quit here in the midst of my speech.  

	I am sorry to hear that my old friend Col. Dunkin is sinking.  I hope he may live till I return home & see him once more.

	The Senate is still in session.  But I have been nowhere except to the court House.  Mr. May the principal counsel for the Testates has shown me great politeness & attention.  He is an able & most eloquent advocate.  Thompson tells me that there is great public expectation to hear me speak & that I have already produced a very decided impression on the Court & crowd.

	I rece[ive]d lst night a letter of encouragement from Col. B.F. Heard of Charleston�also a letter from Dr. Gibbes of Columbia about my letters in the Patriot.  

	Write to me every day & tell me all the news you have. Give my love to your mother & Susan & Anne & all our dear children.  Tell them I hope to see them improved very much when I return.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d no letter from you yesterday& I have no news to write you except that my cold is better & I am the most anxious to return home that was ever in Washington.

	The case of [George A.] Gardiner progresses slowly & I am tired out with it.  The present aspect of the case is a bad one.  What turn it may take I know [not].  I am afraid however that the Government Has some strong testimony to offer yet.  They have already produced a pile of letters of Dr. Gardiners to prove that he was at a different place at the time he alleges to have been at his mines.  We shall prove the existence of his mines, but there is an�that the government will show this is all storm & pretense.

	I hope to hear from you this morning.  It is a great comfort to hear from you & I feel deeply the disappointment.  I wish you would write me more about the children in all of your letters.  I wish to know all about you & them.  Let me hear how they get on at school�how they behave what they are doing.

	But I hope to be at home before you can answer this letter.  I must now conclude & go to breakfast.  If I had anything to write longer.  Your affect[ionate] husb[an]d, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you this morning whilst at Bradl[e]ys office before going into the court House.  General Thompson brought it to me but rece[ive]d none for himself.  Your letter was dated Saturday & Sunday & you stated that you had not rece[ive]d any letters from me Sunday morning.  I am always sorry to hear that you do not rece[ive] a letter from me, or that you have rece[ive]d two or three at once.  I am afraid you tire in reading them when so many come at once.  

	I am glad to hear that Anna is like her papa & does not desire honors & distinctions.  Anna is a smart little girl & I have always thought she was a remarkable girl for her age�sensible & affectionate.   Willie, too, I think will be like me & let honors sent him instead of hunting them.  He will I hope, however, will be like me in another respect & improve him mind & cultivate his nature, & moral feelings.  Frank is a chop of good looks & good principles & will be a favorite everywhere.  Fanny I think will make a great woman & a very handsome woman.  Hext has his tallents to devellope yet & god bless the little fellow.  How I would like to see him.

	I am not able to give you any good news as to Gardiners case.  We have made more progress today than any day heretofore.  I hope we shall get through next week.  I will make my speech first & leave.  It will take a day for each one of us to speak.  General Thompson is prepared for the worst & has his address already written to publish & in case Gardiner is convicted.  But I will never give up till a verdict is found.  

	If I were to come to Washington to live I would like very much to have Elford as a partner.  I have no doubt at all that we could make a fortune here is a few years in various professional pursuits.  Bradl[e]y and Carlisle are making a small fortune every year.  Carlisle lives like a prince as I wrote you.

	I hope something good will come of my visit to Washington.  I ought to be compensated for my absence from home & from my dear wife & from my children.  

	I am glad you have Susan with you.  �do not hold everybody�at all.  I pity her & commiserate her condition.  But her misfortunes are owing in�to her want of worldly wisdom and patience & suffering and Christian forbearance.  By fretting at everything we soon become so that nothing can please us or satisfy us.  But as you say I must think with you on this subject & will promise to do so like a good husband.  

	I will write for the Patriot.  But I am so much engaged that I can see nothing to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday morning and I shall have time to write a long letter in the course of the day.  I am now waiting for breakfast.  I hope when the mail comes to the Bar at nine or ten oclock I shall receive a letter from you.  I had no letters from you yesterday nor did General Thompson receive any.  It is some consolation when one does not receive a letter from Greenville that the other has.  But I receive two or three to his one generally.

	I intended to write you last night but I dined at Mr. Bradleys & did not return till late & then found the Cherokee agent Judge Hicks waiting to see me.  I am in hopes we shall be able to accomplish the Treaty before we leave Washington.  Judge Hicks had seen the Secretary of the Interior & he expressed a willingness to take it up as soon as he could Col. Thomas an agent of the North Carolina Cherokees came to see me yesterday & expressed the same hope.  This will be a comfortable thing if we can accomplish it.

       The Gardiner trial goes on slowly & the testimony very much against him.  I hope to get through in the course of this coming week.  At least I think we can get through the testimony & I can make my speech.  But everything is uncertain.  Gardiner is the greatest mystery I ever heard of.  He seems unmoved & perfectly innocent & indifferent.  He is a very handsome fellow & has a fine open countenance, a sparkling black eye, black whiskers & beard under the chin�dresses very neatly & is amiable & accomplished & talented�0has been a universal favorite wherever he has been.  Still I am afraid he perpetrated the fraud.  I am likewise afraid he may be convicted.  This I would not say to anyone but yourself.  You & I are the same person you have often told me & therefore in writing to you I am only thinking to myself.
       
       We had a fine dinner yesterday at Bradl[e]ys & this evening he is to take us out to his farm eight miles from the city.  It is an old family mansion to which he moves in the Summer.  Brad[le]y has three daughters & one son�one daughter married & two single all being in the house with him and all grown.  His single daughters are pretty & one of them quite intelligent.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y looks ten years too old for her husband.  He got married at nineteen! And looks quite young now.  General Thompson made some remark to Mrs. Bradl[e]y about her husband which I don�t remember.  But she replied to him by an�to his having been twice married that gentlemen who had so many wives never grew old.  
       
       	Late last night Mr. Carlisle came to our room.  He is a most excellent gentleman & was to have dined with us at Mr. Bradleys but his wife had some company when he went home.  I told you in a previous letter that she was the niece of the Spanish ambassador & one of her sisters to one of the Legation with a Spanish name which I cannot pronounce.  They live in great style.  Thompson says Carlisles mother was a greater woman & that he made his fortune by his�& he is still a young man.  I thought his mother a very fine interesting old lady, & carried her to the table & had a great deal of talk with her.  If she ever was, as Thompson says, it is a magnificent change for the old lady in her old age.
       
       I will now give you some account of Gadsbys Hotel, the table, company &c.  You no doubt would like to see just how I am situated.  The Hotel is a pretty large one but not like the National.  In the dining room there are three large round tables at each one of which some twenty or thirty persons may be seated, all facing as it were each other.  There is nothing on the table but butter & bread.  You take your seat & a servant enquires what you will have for breakfast.  He then goes & cooks or brings you whatevet you direct�coffee, buckwheat cakes, beef stake, mutton chops, omelette, eggs, fish, tea &c.  Sometimes you have to wait twenty or thirty minutes.  During this time you talk or read the newspapers.  They dine at ? after 2 oclock & at 4 oclock.  You eat at either table as you please. The servant brings you what you will have.  A bill of fare is by your plate.  Supper is any time between six and ten at night.  
       
       I must now go to breakfast & will write you another letter if I have time.  
       
       God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
       
P.S.  Your letter of Monday is rece[ive]d.  I thank you for it.   Will write you again this evening�no letters to General Thompson this morning.

	I wrote you yesterday morning & after closing my letter I rece[ive]d yours of Monday in which you mentioned that Col. Ware would come up & see me as soon as I returned home.  I shall certainly be at home in time to prepare for his defence.  I hope to get off this week.  But I must have patience and endeavour to make something out of the Indians or Gardiner before leaving.

	Yesterday evening General Thompson & myself rode out with Mr. Bradl[e]y to his country seat eight miles into Maryland.  I was delighted with the trip & the country and �Cherry��  the name of Bradl[e]ys mansion.  The house is one hundred years old.  His father was assistant Post Master General under General Washington & lasted in office till the administration of General Jackson.

	I have written an account of my visit to Bradl[e]ys farm for the Patriot.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y is as native of New Haven & her name was Tuttle.  But Bradl[e]y tells me there are none of the name or kindred there now.  He said he thinks he has heard his wifes sister who married Sterly speak of Mrs. McCall in New Haven.  She was then perhaps single.

	My letters to the Patriot reflecting & sneering at the secessionists wishing office have excited a good deal of interest in Charleston.  The Mercury has opened his fire on me.  Last night I rece[ive]d a letter from Gilmore Simms complaining that I had done him injustice & that he was not a secessionist.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. B.F. Hunt encouraging me about the Gardiner case.  I also rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Gibbes about my letter to the Smithsonian Institute.

	You say your mother thinks so Badly of her kindred�that I must confess they are not great favorites with me.  Arthur Hayne hardly enquired after you all & I saw nothing more of him after speaking to him in the House of Representatives.  He staid here some time.  Ingersoll did appear to take more interest in enquiring after you all than Arthur Hayne.  This however was very natural.  The only heard from you presumably and the other had not for many years.

	I had you before me last night in my dreams.  I wish the dream could be realized, & I could be with you & the children again.  It is pleasant to go from home occasionally, but it is still more pleasant to return home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I came out of the Court House this evening at half after four oclock tired & hungry & exhausted, & thought I would go to the Post office & see if I could not get a letter from home, from my wife to cheer me & comfort me in my lonelyness & distress, and sure enough two were handed me & one from Judge O�Neall & one from Mr.Carter of Charleston.  But my dear wife how can you scold your husband so poor fellow, when he is away & wants comfort!  Did you not read about what I said about Carlisle having a sweet wife & children to greet him & smile on him & love him when he comes home exhausted & fatigued in�  Keep your scolds till I come home.  I can bear them better there than here�never say one unkind word to me from home.  I had rather receive no letter from you at all.  You must remember what I do is not without consideration & reflection & is for the best.  Moreover I have a right to do as I please with my own money which I have worked hard for & who=ich no one gave me.  I provide for my family pretty well & am not very extravagant.  It is just such nervous sensibility on the part of Susan that has made her life an unhappy one.  He husband is a fool & has nothing to sustain him but the bottle when he [is] crossed or vexed.  �had good sense enough to reason the matter with you.  But never write me any more such letters.  They crush my heart when away, far away from you.   

	Poor Col. [Benajah] Dunham!  His death has made me sad.  I am not well myself.  The Gardiner trial is going badly.  The prospect of getting him is remote�.  General Thompson got a letter from his wife this evening and I�him the one you enclosed.  I also read him what you said about Mrs. Thompson.  He insisted on hearing it.

	Judge O�Neall  & Mr. Carter are bursting with indignation at the  appointment of the secessionists to office.  They wrote me that the people of Charleston are indignant at the appointment of Col�in [Wiliam John] Graysons place.
	The best way to please the President is to keep away from him & make his acquaintance at some other time.  But I shall go and see him before I leave Washington.  Judge O�Neall begs me to go & tell him about the secessionists & that he must appoint Union men.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you this morning in which you stated that Mr. Elford had returned from Laurens Court & had been to see you.  I thank you with Mr. Elford that I have lost nothing by my trip to Washington although I should make nothing by it.  I have seen a good deal of the world of men by my visit, and I shall return to Greenville better satisfied to remove there with you & the children.  It does one great good to go abroad occasionally & it makes him love his home more.  We want a change too occasionally.  Variety is the spice of life.  Sameness is tiresome &c.

	The Gardiner case goes on most slowly & seems to be endless.  We commenced the examination of a witness yesterday & will not finish with him till twelve oclock tomorrow!  I am afraid if you do go & see Mrs. Thompson till you have good news to carry about the Gardiner case, your visit will be postponed a long time.  I am thoroughly convinced of the whole matter being a fraud & my strong  apprehension is that he will be convicted.  This however you may keep to yourself.

	I hope you will go & see Mrs. Thompson as often as you can.  I think how all I can learn from you & the servant [is] that she does not like the spiritual rappers.  It is a pretty good idea that I have visiting the General to leave the spirits in Washington & not carry them home with him.  Remember that one of these spirits he has been talking so much with is that of his first wife.  It would be dreadful indeed to a second to have the spirit of the first in the house with her & talking to her husband!  I thought these spiritual rappings &�would excite Mrs. Thompsons�--a wife is not willing to have a divided allegiance in the heart of her husband.

	I do not suppose I have lost much by my absence from Greenville.  Tell Mr. Elford to sign my name to the draft of a thousand dollars & get the money for it.  Let him write my name like I sign it & send off the draft & pay Dr. T�

	I hope Becky is not very sick, & that her sickness may be such as you suppose.  

	I think when we meet again, we shall have been absent so long from each other that [we] will have to be married over again & I will present you with the tea set & the goblets as a bridal gift.

	If I can find time I will procure a cheap & beautiful ring with my likeness in it for you.  I will have your likeness taken on a locket for myself or on a broach.

	I must now quit & go into consultation with Bradl[e]y and Carlisle.  It is now seven oclock & we went at that hour to examine Col. Abbot & Captain Slocum.

	God bless you & the children & preserve you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I went to the Post office again yesterday evening & rece[ive]d a letter from you & one from Col. Ware.  I am glad you were in a�mood & wrote me a�letter.  I thank you for it.  General Thompson was  not with me but rece[ive]d no letters from his wife.  I read him what you said about your mothers visit to Mrs. Thompson & the fine appearance of his boy.

	I am glad my dear wife that you value my letters so much & read them so often.  I was afraid that I wrote you so much & that I should tire your patience.

	I am glad so much respect was paid my old friend Col. Dunham at his funeral.  He was a public spirited & enterprising man.  I should have been most happy to have seen him once more before his departure
	
	I have nothing to write you.  The Gardiner case occupies my whole time & I see and hear nothing out of court of any interest.

	My Mobile correspondent & friend on the Kennedy case, Mr. Campbell has been appointed to the Supreme bench of the United States for the Alabama & Louisiana district.  I am glad of it for he is a gentleman & an able lawyer.  

	Col. Ware wrote me a letter from Laurens court & was very anxious to see me.  He had not rece[ive]d my letter.  I wrote him a letter immediately & am surprised he did not receive it.  I shall write him again this morning & will certainly be at home by Greenville court if I have to give up Gardiner & his case.

	From present appearance I am afraid I shall not be at home much before Greenville court.  My patience is worn out by the dilitory proceedings in court.  I am heartily disgusted with the case & would leave it now, but for General Thompson.  He says it would prejudice the case, and he would die here if I left him.

	Yesterday evening I went from the Post office to see the�of Mr. Henry an account of them for the Patriot.  I rece[ive]d the Patriot yesterday & read all of my letters with great interest.  I think they must be interesting to the people of Greenville & to the whole state.  They are copied into all the papers everywhere.

	After returning late last night from Mr. Bradl[e]ys office I took two pills with a mixture of calomel & I feel better this morning.  My cold has been a most dreadful one indeed.  I was under the necessity of using two or three handkerchiefs every day.  

	I must now conclude as I have to write to Col. Ware & the Patriot.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning enclosing one to General Thompson from Mrs. Thompson.  It was handed to me just as I was preparing to start to the Court House.  I did not expect any letters from you today nor do I know how a letter written on Saturday night could have reached me so soon.  But I hope heretofore I shall get my letters sooner.

	In regard to my returning home, you need not look for me till Greenville Court.  I shall certainly leave here in time to reach home Sunday before Court.  Whether I shall be able to get off sooner is very doubtful.  The case goes on very slowly.  I begin to think Gardiner may be acquitted.  But they have not got through the testimony on the part of the prosecution.

	Tomorrow is good Friday & court has adjourned until Saturday.  I have written some account of our conversation & remarks in court about good Friday for the Patriot.  I wish I could see the Southern Patriot tonight & perhaps you are now reading my letters to the children.  It is eight oclock.  I have spent the evening with Judge Evans in the reading room & have just come up to my room.  The Judge is very social & clever.  He says he will spend next summer in Greenville.

	I have not seen Judge Butler this week.  In fact I see no one & am almost as much out of company as if I were at home.  Tomorrow I may go to church.

	I doubt whether Mrs. Thompson will write often of her fifteen year marriage than she does now.  I have alluded to our correspondence in my last letter to the Patriot.  We are like lovers still and something we have loves�or rather you give me a lovers scolding.  But it is said that there little affairs increases ones love.  But you ought to know that mine cannot be increased.

	I have no�of your proposing so utterly impossible a thing as for Susan to live with us.  It is out of the question for a thousand reasons.

	Let me tell you something more about the spiritual rappers.  There are some young ladies in this Hotel. The Miss Blounts, who tried last night & made the table run all over the room &�& answer questions.  All persons are not mediums.  When you sit around the table you must have your attention fixed on the matter & your wish for the table to move constantly in your mind.

	    I wish your mother may be able to sell her House & make a trip to the north.  It would perhaps improve Annes health & make them all better satisfied with Greenville.  

	I am glad you made Anne decline the�of Mary.  She is too young for so high an honor.  I am glad likewise Miss Brooks was elected.

	My dear Liz how happy I should be to see you & be with you tonight at our own home, surrounded by all the children.  I will see about the ring tomorrow as I have leisure.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your very short letter this morning dated last Monday morning.  Your letters come much quicker than they did some weeks since.  General Thompson has been lodging complaints against the Post office in Charleston with the Post Master General.  But a short letter from you is better than none.  To know that you & the children & servants are all well is sufficient for a good letter from home.

	I am getting on very slowly on the Gardiner case, but think from present appearances that he will be acquitted.  I am afraid however that the testimony will take so long that I shall not be able to argue the case & get home to Greenville Court.  You may expect me Sunday night before court.  I can leave here Wednesday morning & get home Saturday night next Wednesday week.  This seems a long time to look forward to returning home.  General Thompson says I am acquiring fame & will get a good fee.

	I met this morning Frank Key a lawyer the son of the author of the Star Spangled Banner who told me there was no doubt of our acquitting Gardiner.  This seems to be the general sentiment.  Thompson says the case will give me a national reputation & be of service to me at home.  I despair occasionally & then I am in better spirits.  

       This being good Friday there is no court as I wrote you last night.  I went up to the daguerreotypist to get the ring you requested.  He had none that were pretty but said he would send to get an assortment tomorrow.  I am to call Monday morning.
       
       General Thompson rece[ive]d a letter from Mrs. Thompson this morning & she mentioned seeing you at church Sunday.  She writes more constantly now than she did at first.
       
       I am to analyze the testimony in the Gardiner case today, & make out the heads of my arguments nor have I much to write & will therefore make this a short letter.
       
       I hope you will write more about the children & tell them to behave themselves or you will write they are not good.  I hope the children were pleased with the medals sent them.  I think Mr. Beatty might have come to see you & tell you about seeing me.  I am glad you are pleased with the broach & are wearing it.  The eyes have a sleepy appearance& I was afraid you would notice it.  I wish I could have your likeness taken for myself in a handsome locket.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines before going into court, as I will not have time to write afterwards in time for the mail.  

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Tuesday and General Thompson rece[ive]d one from Mrs. Thompson.  He has complained to her & she now writes oftener.  

	I am sorry to hear Becky is unwell & hope she may not get worse.  I am glad you mention in your last letter all about the children.  Here are the letter I read with most interest.  You must not worry me so much about office, fee, & seeing the President.  Be assured I will do in the�what my best judgement dictates.  The President is annoyed to death at present & I have no doubt hates the sight of a man.  Thousands are calling every day & can only say �howdy� & �good day.�  There is not a moment to talk with him.  You speak & pass on.  In the Gardiner case I will do the best I can.  In regard to office there is none that I would have.  Have nothing for the picture�to my dear wife but�on�do no good & only fret & worry me.  And I have enough to fret & work about in this case & in my absence from home & anxiety to return home.  Your letters should soothe me & comfort me.  Kindness & love is what I want from you & the children not so much of advice and scolding &�  Look on the bright side of our picture.  It is a beautiful one�health &�--a fair standing in the world�and hope in our children�good & pure hearts�and with these we ought to be happy.  

	Yesterday a black & dirty fellow came in the Hotel to sell pork.  General Thompson said to me that fellow is happier than any man he leaves behind him in Washington.  I replied �yes the President not excepted.�  There is constant & unpleasant vexation in office & honors.  If you could only see the miserable looking faces here among the office seekers you would feel thankful that I was not amongst them.

	I still have a bad cold & constant blowing of my nose, which annoys me very much.  I am prepared to make a good speech in this case but in all�will have to close for Greenville court before the case is argued.

	I must now quit & go into court.  There is some sharp sparing in court every day between May & Bradl[e]y & Carlisle.  I tell them we are more cautious in South Carolina.

	God bless you & the children.  Give my love to all of them & to your mothers & sisters. Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines before setting off for Charleston.  I have been so much engaged here that I have not had time to write you.  I have written two letters for the Patriot & will write another this evening., all of which will go in the same mail.  Willie wrote you yesterday whilst I was at the College.  He & Anna went to Mrs. Taylors yesterday & Mrs. Taylor is to send for Anna to dine with her today.  There is no one at Taylors but his wife.

	You will see my letters to the Patriot & I will noy repeat what they contain.  We had a pleasant trip down.  Mrs. Jenkins, Mary & Matilda Croft came down with us & Anna spent most of the time with them.  Col., Perrin & his daughter came also from Abbeville.  Anna was put in a room with Miss Perrin.  She has now returned & Anna is rooming with the�  They all seem glad to see her.  I took tea last night with Professor Brumby & saw his wife & daughters.  The whole Board of Trustees took tea there after adjournment in College.  Mrs. Brumby enquired very kindly after you & especially your mother.  She asked me if Mrs. McCall was much broke in appearance.  I replied that I thought not that she look[s] exceedingly well for a lady of her age.  She asked if she looked as well as Mrs. W � Hayne.  I told her a great deal better & much younger.  She replied Mrs. Hayne was the younger which I knew.

	I went out shopping this morning & bought a waist coat & cloak for Willie five dollars-- a pair of pants & suspenders for myself ten dollars�a pair of boots for Willie & cap $7.50�a hat & pair of boots for myself $14.00.  This is all.  Willie has lost my diamond breast pin.

	I saw Mr. Brown in his studio this morning.  He seemed delighted when I told him General Thompson & others said your likeness was perfect & better than mine.  He told me what he had promised you & I replied that you were still disposed to adhere to his promise.  Mrs. Brown has been unwell with a cold but I saw her this morning.

	Willie & Anna are both behaving remarkably well & much noticed.  I have introduced Willie to most of the Professors in College.  I had a long talk this morning with Dr. Lieber.  I also met Dr. Thornwell & had quite a chat with him.

	Mr. Brown directed me to Youngs jewelry store where there weas a perfect music box.  The price is $75.00 & it plays almost equal to a piano.  I saw another which played twelve tunes for fifty dollars.  But I did not purchase either of them.  At some future day in New York I will purchase one for you.  I have had my cane nicely mended, 75 cts & new crystal in my watch & Willies.  I have exchanged my prayer book & got one with a gold clasp a late fashion of binding.

	I carried Anna out with me this morning shopping.  She is now with the�& Will is reading Dr. Lieber�s book on Civil Liberty in the room where I am writing.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  My sore on the eye has disappeared.  God bless you.  Kiss Hext & tell Frank & Fanny to be good children &c.  B.F. Perry

	We reached here yesterday to dinner & had a very pleasant trip down.    You will see my letter to the Patriot for all that.

	Willie & Anna have gone out visiting your kins people.  I have been shopping.  I bought the frames for our portraits at $18 each.  They will be sent up in seven or eight days.  I gave your Bill to�& to fill & forward the groceries.  They do not want the money before next year (February will do).  I thought after getting all the expensive articles the other items though numerous would not amount to much.

	Yesterday evening we walked over the Battery & around the city, Willie, Anna & myself & Col. Irby.  We met a good many acquaintances.  Dr. [Samuel Henry] Dickson & Judge King have both promised to call & see me�[Richard] Yeadon also.  I saw Col. Hayne & Col. John Cunningham.  Mrs. Cunningham has returned home to remain & will not return to Philadelphia at all.  Miss Pamela will remain in Philadelphia�does not intend returning.  Singular to be thus separated from an only daughter & the sick & bedridden daughter from her mother.

	I have stopped at the Mills House & it is truly a Palace.  I am glad I did not stop at the American.  Sitting at the dinner yesterday Mrs. Beadon said her daughter asked if Willie was the brother of Anna whom they knew to be my daughter.  She replied they are so unlike they could not be brother & sister.  She is the niece of Col. Davie of Chester & a very pleasant lady.  Beadon [Richard Stobo Bedon] is a Senator from one of the Parishes.  We have to spend a great deal of our time at the table eating dinner & breakfast.  But the fare is superb.  I told Mrs. Beadon that we had five children & they were all unlike each other.  I went over Bancrofts store with young�this morning.  I have not yet seen Augustus Hoke.

	My dear Liz, this letter was broken off very abruptly yesterday & I did not have an opportunity of finishing it.  This morning Mrs. Edward Hayne sent for the children to dine with her, but I intend going to the�& they will not get back in time.

	Last night Col. Beadon & his daughters & myself & children went to the Theatre & were all very much pleased.  Anna & Willie�

	Col. Pickens & his daughters are at�  We have a pleasant company.  Willie & Anna yesterday visited Col. Arthur Hayne, Mrs. W�Hayne, Mrs. General Hayne, your aunt Hayne, Mrs. Turner.  Your uncle Arthur said he would call & see me this morning.  They saw Mrs. Emily Hayne in visiting.  They have not yet been to Mrs. McCalls.

	I shall return to Greenville Thursday if possible.  I hope to hear from you today.  I have a great deal to talk about when we meet.  But not time to write it.

	I must now prepare to visit Sullivans Island.  Your uncle Arthur called & staid so long that the hour for taking the boat has passed over.  He invited us to dine with him Monday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter of Friday this morning and thank you kindly for it.  I am in such confusion here & so much to attend to, and so many of my friends to me that I have not time to write as I did in Washington.  I have just written two sheets for the Patriot.  I know you are willing for write for the Patriot although it may interfere with writing to you.

	Yesterday Anna William & myself dined with Judge Henry & his children.  It was a very pleasant party. The children looked well.  Today we dine with Col. Arthur P. Hayne.  Yeadon wishes me to dine with him before I leave.  Wednesday we dine with Mr. Robinson who carried me to his house & put his carriage at my service.  He has been very kind.  Mr. Spratt editor of the Standard has invited me to take tea at his house tomorrow evening.

	This morning when I went downstairs Col. Pickens told me it was announced in the Standard that I had called at that office & was staying at the Mills House if anyone wish[ed] to see me to go there & ask for the finest looking gentleman in the House & I would be seen.  You will see the compliment in this mornings Mondays Standard.  This mornings Courier also notices my arrival & compliments me.  Coil. Pickens & his daughters are here & will remain till next week.

	I have done all Annas shopping.  She has gone to see Mrs. W�.Hayne this morning & your aunt Mary McCall.  Willie has gone to Sullivans Island with Pierce Williamson.  I am to go with Judge Henry to the College at twelve oclock.  Yesterday I saw Mr. Petigru at church & at Judge Henry.

	I have concluded to stay till after Wednesday & perhaps Thursday.  You will see me in Greenville Saturday night.  I went to church yesterday with Col. Arthur Hayne and saw Mrs. Hayne.

	I must now conclude.  I am glad you & the children are enjoying yourselves.  I wish you were with me.  It is more pleasant for us to visit town together.  There you will be in a different circle from your friends.  My friends and your relations are distinctive.  When we are together we see them both.  Next spring we will go down together.  I saw General Martin on Saturday & one of his little sons.  

	God bless you & Hext & Fanny & Frank.  Willie & Anna behave remarkably well like a young gentleman & Lady.  B.F. Perry

	I arrived here yesterday evening very much fatigued, but went to bed at eight oclock & feel quite well this morning.

	We had a pleasant trip down in the way of company and so forth.  The cars were crowded before Abbeville.  A good many came from Anderson�amongst them F. Burt who greeted me most cordially.  

	Janney & his little daughter enquired where Anna was.  Flora Jones came up to me with Col. Irbys daughter & spoke & enquired after Anna.  They are now here but go back to school this morning & will return Saturday.  Janney says he can find a room for Anna.  There are no ladies here now, but will be on Saturday.  She would have been rather lost amidst so many men & no ladies.  Miss Irby & Flora Jones enquired if Anna was going to the commencement Ball.  I told them yes.  They spoke of not going, but I am sure they will.   

	I will be at the rail road depot at four oclock to meet Anna & Willie on Saturday.  Give them something to eat on the road & tell them not to get out of the cars on the road.

	The House is very full but upstairs seems quiet & pleasant.  I have seen a good many of my acquaintances.  There was nothing done yesterday in the legislature or court.

	Judge Frost has resigned& it is said that Chancellor Dargan & General Whitner intend to resign.  The labours of a Judge are now so arduous & keep them so much from home, that a man who can live without the�, is not disposed to be a Judge.

	I am writing to you just after breakfast & just before going to the court of Appeals as you expressed a wish to know the time of day my letters are written.

	Col. Brockman lost his trunk yesterday, but it was found at Caldwells Tavern last night about eleven oclock.  The trunk had money in it.  Duncan & Elford are here & quite well.  Morgan has not come.  I am afraid he is sick.  McBee is not yet here.  I have heard nothing from old Mrs. Butler.

	I hope you and the children are all well.  Send all of my shirts by Willie.  Tell Reuben to haul out the manure & Charles to spade up the garden.  Let Reuben work all the horses occasionally to exercise them.  I have just been interrupted by a candidate for office�Mr. Evans of Marion.  He was a long time giving me a history of parties in his district.  

	I must now conclude my letter & go to court.  It is raining & the weather prospect bad.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have but a few minutes to write you before breakfast, & will conclude my letter after breakfast.

	Last night I went to the meeting of the Board of Trustees & did not return till late.  Just before starting I met Dr. Campbell who brought me a message from Hopkins Williams that he would be down this week & pay me a few in the case of the State against Scurry.  This will be [a] good break if the old man does pay me $500.  I met Redwood last night & paid him $175 which I had for B� Kelly &c of Baltimore.  He told me that Redfield had in Baltimore a most beautiful & splendid Pony for me & was going to write me about sending it on to me.

	I saw Captain Cunningham last night.  He says Miss Cunningham is improving very much since her return from Philadelphia.  Pamela is all over in biles & sores which the doctors think are evidence of returning health.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I met Mrs. Anderson & her little son.  She says her son & Mrs. Beadons son were very sad after Anna left Charleston that she was so lively the boys were greatly smitten with her.

	There is nothing doing in the Legislature.  P. McBee came yesterday & says old Mrs. Butler is as low as she can be to be alive.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear from you.  I am glad to hear Willie is working.

	There never was such a crowd before in Columbia.  Dr. Crook & Dr. Craft are here.

	I shall expect Willie & Anna Saturday.  You will receive this letter Friday night.  Tell them to be careful about keeping their seats in the cars & not to get out.   Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the College & will write you a few lines although it is now ten oclock in the night.

	Willie & Anna arrived here this evening about half after four. I went to the depot at three& found a good many waiting for members of their family.  The cars came filled with women kind principally.  All Abbeville came down.   Mrs. Jones & Betty Robinson were aboard.  Janneys House is like confusion compounded.  I gave up my room to Anna, Betty Robinson & Flora Jones.  They are stowed away very comfortably.  I took shelter with Duncan & Elford..   They gave up one bed to me & Willie.  But since that Willie & Willie Beattie have got a room in the garrett.  Duncan told me that Jones was very much effected by my kindness to his daughter & Betty Robinson who were roomless.  He proposed speaking.  I told Duncan I cou[l]d do nothing about it & had no objections.  His wife refused to look at me when I spoke to Betty Robinson.  Flora seems very kind.    

	Willie & Anna got down safely amidst the crowd.  Miss Perrin sent her brother�to come & take a seat by her.  She is a very interesting young lady.  I left Anna under her charge�I went to College.  Mrs. Trotter enquired very kindly after you & Anna.  The room is full of ladies.  Col. Carn has his wife here.  There are several ladies from Newberry�&c.  Anna has already rece[ive]d a ticket to the Governors Ball.  Col. Wheaton presented me with a ticket as one of the aides de camp.  I think Anna had better go to Balls.  She will see & learn a great deal.  I will let Willie go to the commencement Ball.

	Professor Lewis R. Gibb[e]s of the Charleston College has been elected Professor of Mathematics in the South Carolina [College] in the place of Professor Williams who is paralyzed.  We made the election this evening.  Dr. Gibb[e]s of this place invited me to his party last night but I did not go.  Notwithstanding my Editorials in the Carolinian the Dr. seems friendly & kind.

	I will send Anna to see Mrs. Taylor. Tomorrow we go to church.  The next day is commencement.  Col. Herndon saw Anna this evening & was pleased with her.  He said she was a fine specimen of Greenville
.  
        I will now close my letter.  Duncan is just going to bed.  Elford is writing & will return home Monday morning.  It is now almost eleven oclock.  I will write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Mr. Allston & his sisters go to Greenville tomorrow for the purpose [of] seeing about their lands & building there.  They intend to live there permanently.  They will build a house this winter.  In the meantime his sisters will board at the Mansion House.  They are in bad health.  I have told Mr. Allston he could have my carriage to ride out with his sisters when he desired it.  You had better go & see them.  He thinks perhaps he may purchase a house already built & asked me if I know of any for sale.  I told him of your mothers house.  He may wish to see it.

	I am truly glad he is going to build or purchase in Greenville.

	I have just written a letter to you by Mr. A. Allston who is going to Greenville with his sisters to spend the winter & build on his land near the Village.  But for fear he may not reach Greenville tomorrow I will write you again.

	I thank you for your letter by H.T. Thompson & will certainly do all I can to assist him.  Willie & Anna are enjoying themselves very much.  They went to the commencement today &^ were pleased.  The House is full of ladies. Mrs. Green is now in their room.

	I have just written a letter to the Patriot & have nothing more to say.  I will make Anna write you tomorrow.

	I have no time to write.  Anna does not care to go to the Ball tonight.  I will send them tomorrow to see Mrs. Taylor.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry

	It is now six oclock in the evening & I Have not had a moments leisure since I got up; but as Anna has not written to you as I expected she would do, I will drop you a line.

	It is a hard matter to get Anna & Willie to do anything here & I begin to think there is too much confusion & company for children so small as they are.  I am afraid they will get spoilt.  Willie Beattie & young Buist leave here in the morning & I am glad on Willies account though he will deeply regret it.

	We had a little discussion in the Legislature today on the law prohibiting the circulatory small bills.  I made a few remarks.  Tonight I am invited to a party at Hammerscold�s the German orch�  Col., Jno Preston delivers a speech in the college chapel at about seven oclock.  There is also a meeting of the Editors this evening.

	I will write to the Patriot after I return from the college.  Anna & the young ladies speak of going to the college.  They went down to the State House this morning.  I have written Henry T. Thompsons report for him & will offer it tomorrow.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & will keep my letter open till I start to the college.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & am glad the groceries have arrived.  They will give you enjoyment in opening them & arranging them in the store house.

	You need not fear about Anna & Willie enjoying themselves.  I am glad thew cars are running to Greenville.  	I suppose Mr. Allston has arrived before this time & delivered my letter.

	I will not close my letter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the State House & ate my dinner.

	I see that Willie has been writing & I hope he has written to you.  But I cant find him.  I will however write you a line for fear he has not.

	Anna is downstairs & is going to walk to the Asylum with Miss Waistcot, Flora Jones & others.  She is enjoying herself very much.  The House is full of young ladies, but I hope they will go off in a day or two.  It is utter confusion.

	Today we had a little debate on the Electoral question.  I have not spoken.  There has been a great military parade here today.  Mrs. & Mr. Green are here from Greenville & Mrs. Green is rooming with Anna.  Mrs. Jones has become very civil to me.  But I have very little to say to her.  Flora Jones seems a clever girl & very kindly disposed.  Tom Earle is here & I saw him at a distance.

	I understand that Tom Beattie last summer carried on a systematic begging of money from all his acquaintances in New York.  He got fifty dollars out of Col. Herndon.  Herndon & his wife are here.  Anna has not yet been to Taylors�.  Mr. Petigru came up this evening & also Barnwell Rhett.

	I will not close as company has come into the room.  If I get a letter from you I will write you again.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & thank you for it.  I am glad to hear that all of the groceries have arrived.  You can employ yourself for some time in fixing & arranging them.

	I enclose you an appointment for Henry D. Doyley as cadet.  You will please send it to him.

	Anna has just come to ask me to let her go to Charleston with Mr. & Mrs. Green who have invited her.  But I told her that she could not go.  That if she wished to leave Columbia she might go back to Greenville.  She was anxious to read your letter, but I was afraid she might talk about something in it.

	I will now close my dear wife.  Everybody seems to know that I write every day & frequently speak of it to me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the State House tired & fatigued & have eaten my dinner.  I will write you a line for I find it impossible to get Willie or Anna to write.  After all I believe a husbands has more affection for his wife than a child for a mother.  Captain Brooks & his family have just arrived & the Captain has just come into our room & is talking to me whilst I am writing.  He will go up day after tomorrow.

	Anna is considering about going to the Governors Ball.  She does not wish to go.  But as all the rest are going, I told her she had better go.  I think that she is�that she has not a Ball dress.  Elford has just come down & brings me no letters.  I hope to hear when the mail is opened.  Elford says he saw Fanny & Hext yesterday & you were all well.

	We had considerable discussion today on the Calhoun monument & about that discussion I will write to the Patriot.  My room is now full, & they are all talking as I am writing in one corner.  They are all crowded here like boys & it is like living in a boys den.  I am tired of it.

	John Cunningham is here.  I saw him paying attention to Mrs. Brown today & drinking champaigne with her at the table.  Young Gantt on the other side of her & Brown next.  Poor fellow looked uneasy.  I doubt whether [page torn] any better than�ought to lie.  She seems a�woman, fond of attracting admiration.

	It is now raining & the weather is cold.  Mr. Arthur came into the room just now to see us.  It seems that EVERYBODY FROM Greenville is here.  Barnwell Rhett came up & spoke to me today.  He said he saw from my paper that I had been in Charleston & was greatly pleased with the Ballet troupe.    He asked if you were with me.

	I will now close till I hear from you.  The mail will be opened in a short time.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter.  I am surprised that Allston did not send over your letter.  I gave him a letter to Hoke & to Trevers.  See if they have rece[ive]d their letters.

	I will now conclude.  Hoyt wrote to rent my place for Mr. Dickey.

	The Legislature speak of coming up to Greenville Tuesday evening & going back Wednesday.  The President of the road has invited them.  It may be that a good many members accept the invitation.  I may come myself, & you must prepare to entertain two or three members.  I will write you tomorrow more about this matter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Today the Electoral Bill was discussed in the House & I shall speak next Monday.  Willie did not go to the Ball.  The crowd will go off in some measure tomorrow.   I hope so.  I enjoyed the Ball very much & had a great deal of pleasant chat with the governor & others.  I made only the acquaintance of Mrs. Chesnut amongst the ladies.  Mrs. Brown was there escorted by Mr. Murray.  I think he is a most devoted lover.  Poor Brown must�

	I have just read your letter.  I am glad Mr. Allston called to see you.  The weather is shockingly bad.  Yeadon & Dunkin are now sitting by our fire reading the Southern Patriot.  It is in great demand.  I am glad you have got the pictures hung up.  I am afraid the bad weather will discourage the Miss Allstons.

	I do not suppose that the Legislature will go up to Greenville or any of us get a chance to go.

	This is Sunday & Anna & Willie have gone to the Episcopal church with several others from this Hotel.  I am preparing for my speech tomorrow on the Electoral Bill.

	Yesterday I dined with Governor Manning.  Mrs. Manning enquired about [you] & the children.  She asked why you did not come down with me.  Said she always used to see me with a little Boy in the State House.  Asked me if it was my little daughter at the Ball the other night.  We had a very pleasant party.  But I had to meet the committee.  There was a granddaughter of Mrs. Singleton there, also Mrs. Dickinson a widow & Miss Manning sister of the governor.  Miss De�had just returned from Philadelphia where she had been at school for four or five years.  She is one of the most intelligent & amiable & handsome young ladies I have seen.  Mrs. Manning told me that the Governor had told her a great deal about the mountain girls & beauties, that he had said so much about Miss Sally Thompson that she was anxious to see her.  Mrs. Manning did not seem like Mrs. Chesnut who told her husband whilst he was flirting with a young widow Mrs. Evans that it was a game she could play too although her hand was a little out At present.

	Just before going to church I was told by Mr. Petigru that Miss [Julia A.] Hext a poetess & authoress was in the House & a relation of your fathers & desired to make my acquaintance.  I saw her & made Anna acquainted with her.  I took her book of Poems to read & shall have to purchase a copy or two.  She is poor & from Barnwell.  I will send you a copy of Mrs. Brooks in the morning.  The eldest Miss Brooks is to be married shortly to someone from Darlington.

	Anna is quite a favorite with everybody & is uncommonly most talkative in company.  She attracts attention.  Willie is improving & wearing off his rough points.

	Yesterday Munson of Charleston was elected Judge.  There is a proposition to elect three Judges.  If so I may be put in nomination though I don�t think I should wish a seat on the Bench.

	Mrs. Jones & Miss Robinson go up in the morning.  I and Jones speak but we are not very cordial nor have I had much to say to Mr. Jones.  To Betty Robinson & Flora Jones I have said a good deal.  

	The children have returned from church & I must conclude my letter.  I am sorry I shall not hear from you tonight.  The company are all breaking up.

	Your affectionate husband.  Anna says she would have written to you yesterday but had no pen & paper.  B.F. Perry

We adjourn at night this evening and I now I have to meet the Board of Trustees in fifteen minutes.  Willie has gone to the circus.  Anna wished to go also.  I would not let her.

	You may have heard of some difficulty with [William R.] Taber.  It is all over.  My friends would not let me accept the challenge & it is all over.  General Thompson can tell you all about it.  But I will write you fully tomorrow if I have time.  But it is all over & settled & most happily for me.

	The House has been in session all day & I have to go back half after six.  The Electoral Bill is under discussion.  I made my speech over an hour long.  There was a great crowd, & it is said I made a good speech.  Col. [William Aiken] Owens replied.  [William Ferguson] Hutson has the floor tonight & perhaps General [Samuel] McGowan may reply.
	  
	Anna & Willie are all well & enjoying themselves very much.  I will now tell you the particulars between Taber & myself.  He wrote me a note.  You will see however the whole correspondence in the Carolinian of today.  The course I pursued has met the approbation of almost everybody.  A great many came up to me in the House & congratulated me this morning on the noble stand I took.  Mr. Petigru, General Bonham, and Col. Dawkins came to my room last night to express their warm & cordial approbation.  Col. Isaac Hayne took a warm interest on my side and approves most heartily my course�so do Col. Jno & Col. William C. Preston.  Dr. [Ozey Robert] Broyles said he should put me in nomination for Governor for my noble stand.  Professor Brumby expressed his hearty approbation�Senators [Samuel] McAiley and [Christopher William] Dudley.

	I have sent Willie down to get letters & I hope to hear from you.  Willie says the mail is not yet rece[ive]d at the Box.  I shall have to conclude my letter.

	If anything of interest is in your letter I will add a line.  If the Legislature had accepted our�I should have been at home tonight.  I wish they had.  I long to be at home once more.

	I am writing to you before breakfast.  Mr. Duncan & Willie have dressed & gone down.  Anna still has my room with Miss Waistcot [Westcoat] a very nice young lady hardly grown & the daughter of a member [Jabez J.R. Westcoat] from Edisto Island.  There was no room for Anna & Miss Waistcoat was in a room with her father.  I shall remain in Duncans room till the end of the session.

	Just after sending my letters to the Post office last night, I rece[ive]d yours of Monday.  You must get money from the merchants or Mr. Hoke.  Mr. Grady will pay all of your Bills till I return.  I have paid a debt in Newberry of $78.00 & to Redwood of 180 which has�me of my funds.  You were entirely too quick in sending for our dollars Bills &c.  

	Col. Preston has sent me a bundle of rose cuttings.  There is some mystery about it.  I thought it was intended for one of the other Perrys, & they have remained in my room till they are almost dead.  I sent them out this morning to have them buried & if alive when I go up I will take them.  They are all labelled.  After writing to you I went to the State House & did not get off till 10 oclock in the night.  We discussed & lost the Electoral Bill at that hour.  But it will come up again.

	Anna & Miss Waistcot are going to the Asylum this morning in company with several others.  Willie will go with them.  I have just been down to breakfast.  Anna tells me that Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Isaac Hayne & Miss Hayne were in the gallery yesterday when I spoke on the Electoral Bill.  They bowed to her, but did not get in speaking distance.

	I am still receiving the congratulations of my friends for the bold & just stance I took  in refusing Tabers challenge.  I am glad you are pleased with the Allstons, & I am truly glad they are going to reside in Greenville.

	I must now quit & go down.  John Jones has just been in the room & says he is going up in the morning.

 	After writing you last evening, Mr. Allston called to see me & expressed himself very much pleased with Greenville.  He told me he was at your House with some company the evening before.  He was very much pleased with our portraits & said yours was very superior.  He said he was an amateur painter himself and that he had never seen any portrait more accurate or more beautifully painted.  He preferred the eyes looking from you & said the effect was much better.  He said he had made friends in Greenville & was going to build there.  He was delighted with Mr. Bacon as a teacher & spoke in high terms of his sons playing.  He thought Mr. Arthur very much like governor Manning.

	I rece[ive]d two letters from you last night & in one of them you speak of another letter you had written Tuesday which I did not receive.  I am glad your party went off pleasantly.  Poor Wheaton seems a good fellow, very kind & friendly, but vain & foolish.  He is engaged to Miss Boggs as he told me & showed her likeness in a ring.

	Yesterday we were all day in the Legislature till ten oclock in the night.  After writing to you, I went down & made a speech on the Judiciary Bill.  It was thoroughly discussed & lost.  There was some sharp sparring between Campbell & Owens & Thompson & very amusing.  

	I am now writing to you before breakfast &whilst waiting for Anna & Miss Waistcot to dress & go to breakfast the others are eating.  They are to come to my room when ready.  I may not be able to write you this evening.  We are all hard pressed now for time.  The Legislature will not be able to do much.  

	I am now anxious to see you & the little children dear little Hext especially, & Fanny & Frank.  Miss Hext says she was akin to your father.  She is now staying at Mr. Guignards.

	I have nothing of interest to write you, since writing you last night at twelve oclock.  Luther McBee has just been in my room & says he returns in the morning.  � Mauldin came down this evening  & is going to Pedee for his wife.  Dr. Austin & his daughter came down yesterday & go back tomorrow.  It seems to me I see more of Greenville here than I should at home.

	Anna & Willie are doing well & enjoying themselves very much.  Willie took a deep interest last night in the torch light procession & the crowd.  

	This morning a committee of citizens waited on me & invited me to address the citizens of Columbia in the Town Hall tomorrow night at eight oclock.  I have consented to do so.  I am becoming a wonderfully popular man in Columbia.  In Charleston I learn Taber was also burnt in effigy last night.  A militia company which he commanded there have requested his resignation.  Poor fellow seems to have no rest for the sole of his foot.

	The affair has produced quite a stir in Columbia and all over the state.  General Adams came to me & said he hoped I would not consent to run for governor�that he thought he would beat Wallace but he did not know so well about myself.  He said he was informed his constituents had nominated me for governor.

	We have not had much discussion today in the Legislature.  We meet again at six.  It is now five & I must conclude my letter.  I must think of my address tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line.  It will be the last too that I shall be able to send you before I have the pleasure of greeting you myself in proper person.

	Nothing has occurred today worth writing.  I made a few remarks on the Lunatic Asylum and defeated the proposition to remove it.  

	I see Mr. Taber declines publishing his address in a note which appeared last night in the Charleston Mercury.  He tries to evade the matter.  I am sorry for the poor fellow & if I had known the extent of the mischief that I was doing him I should have spared him.  But his address was on outrageous popular feelings.

	I have written out my address & shall publish it in the next Patriot after my return home.

	It is now after four oclock & I have just been with Anna to purchase an Album for one dollar.  She seemed very anxious to have one. I have never seen anyone crying herself so much as Anna has.  If she were larger I would not have her here as there is too much association with gentlemen for a young lady.  Anna is very smart & lively & makes herself interesting to everyone.  I think she has more mind than any girl of her age I ever saw.  Willie does better & behaves more like a man since his associates William B� & B� have gone.  He now associates with men & listens to the scholars in the Legislature.  

	Tomorrow we adjourn.  I am very anxious to see you & the children.  I hope to hear from you when the mail is opened.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My Dear Sir [George D. Tillman]

	I have recently been informed that you heard & remember Mr. Taber�s Address, last December in the College chapel, & that your opinion of the principles of the Address is in accordance with my criticism.

	I should be glad to hear from you in relation to this matter--your remembrance of the address�The impression it made on your mind in regard to the education of the masses evil�the�effects of common schools & the system of reading and writing.

	I should like also your opinion whether or not the address is precisely the same that was delivered.  Are not some expressions modified�some left out & some added.
  
	  I do not know that I shall ever make any further publication in regard to Mr. Taber.  But your reply should be written with a view to publication.  I wish to show it to my friends & others.  

	I had intended writing to a number of persons but after publication of the address, corrected with a view to �accuracy�, I concluded it was not worthwhile.  Judge O�Neall & Dr. Lieber sustain me entirely in regard to criticism.

	I hope you have seen my reply to Taber & the letters accompanying the reply.  I have just written a second reply to his last publication in the Mercury.

	With great respect I am yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I have a few moments to spare before starting this morning & will write you a line.  I wrote a long letter for the Patriot last night.

	We had quite a pleasant trip down with Mr. Duncan & Beattie.  Col. Fair got in at Newberry.  The up train yesterday had a great many of my acquaintances whom I met for a few moments & amongst them George Butler of Arkansas.  He is on his return from Washington & wishes very much to see me in Greenville he said.

	There are a great many persons going down this morning & amongst them Mr. Taber who is at Janneys. He has been sick & is just returning.  Mr. Robert Cunningham went down yesterday.  [William H.] Thomas the Editor of the Mountaineer is going down & here.  Beattie says the next sale of that paper will be a blowup & it will fall through.  

	I have purchased all my clothes here�coat $10�pants 7.00�waistcoat 5�Boots 8�Hat 5--�$1.

	Mr. Janney is very kind & says he is going to send you a bottle of his preserved peaches which are exactly like the ripe green peach.  He is going to visit the mountains again next summer.  Mrs. Janney enquired after you & Anna.  The smallest of the daughters is here only.  She enquired after Anna.

	The dust yesterday was awful.  Today it is raining & will be better.  

	Pinckney McBee & Irvine went on last night.  Dr. Thomas also came down with us & went on last night.  I saw Henry C� & Doyley at the depot.  Hamlin Beattie came to see his father last evening.  They are all well.

	I have just come up from the dinner table and it is dark.  I have to take supper with Mr. Brown�, & then go to the Ball.  We has a very pleasant evening.  I have written a long letter to the Patriot.  Col. Isaac Hayne, Col. Orr, Dr. Dickson & many others were to dine with us.  They all came.

	I have just recc[ive]d your letters & was glad to hear from you.  In passing down street this morning Mr. Yeadon purchased the prettiest sugar dish I ever saw for a present to you.  Yesterday I was trying to get a large gold pen & Col. Allan of Barnwell presented me with his, which is the finest I ever saw, & has his name engraved on it.  I have noticed it very handsomely in the Patriot.

	I saw�Pinckney last night.  He told me that Mrs. P had written you about the�  Mr. William Elliott his uncle told me that he saw me in the convention & enquired who I was  in so complimentary a manner that he would not repeat it.

	It is not at all probable that I shall take my part in the proceedings of the convention.  It is thought best to let the gentlemen from the other states speak.  The whole affair is a humbug.  We had speeches today from Dawson of Georgia, Pike of�, Maury of the navy & General Cowles.

	I will settle Dr. Geddings Bill.  Dr. Dickson enquired after you.  I will tell Yeadon as to your message about naming the child.  

	After writing the above I went to Brown� to supper & then to the Ball.  The Ball was a magnificent affair but not a great many ladies present.  I staid till supper & then left.  It was not very pleasant to me but I spent my time in talking with the gentlemen & saw Miss Polly Thompson there but did not speak except to bow to her as she passed along.

	I must now stop & go to breakfast.  How is the little Boy.  I wish to see him very much.  I hope you & the children are all well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just finished dressing & it is only six oclock in the morning.  We breakfast at eight.  I therefore have two hours of leisure and will spend a portion of the time writing you a letter.

	Yesterday morning was very busy preparing for an argument in Court.  There is another case which will come up today & for which I also have to prepare.  Last night after receiving your letter, I had to attend the meeting of the Board of Trustees & could not answer it as I desired to do.

	I was glad to hear you were so well & so well pleased with your rooms & house.  I suppose Fanny and Hayne are equally well satisfied .  I received no letters last evening from home.  But Col. Townes came down  and reported that all were well so far as he knew.  He tells me they had quite a may day celebration in Greenville.  

	Fannys cloak & your comb are both safe in my possession

	Last night I was appointed chairman of the general committee to whom all the business of the Board of Trustees was referred &it will be a serious labor to consider & report on all the matters referred to us.  Governor Means, Mr. DeSaussure & [C.P.] Sullivan are members of the committee.  The Board meet again next Monday when I shall have to have my reports ready.  Our committee meet tomorrow evening to consider & dispose of the business.  The next morning I go down to General Adams & stay till Monday morning.  I still have to write out my reports there.

	Next Wednesday the law students are examined & I am on that committee.  It will therefore be out of my power to return to Greenville before Thursday next and about that time my cases in the law court of appeals will be reached.  So all my movements as to Greenville & Charleston are uncertain.  I think it probable however that I shall not be able to return to Greenville till you do.  You can spend all of your money in a couple of weeks & exhaust our credit at � & Wickenberys.

	Look at the carriage & write me what you think of it.

   	Chancellor Johnson saw me at the Post office after receiving your first letter & enquired about you.  I repeated to him your conclusion �good bye notwithstanding the Virginia lady�  which amused him greatly.  I sent your letter, with a few lines written on it to Anna, the evening I rece[ive]d it, without thinking of that expression.

	I hope you are enjoying yourself with your friends and that they admire the admissible pre[page torn]tion in which they find you as young in appearance as when you were married.  I hope too they admire Fannys sweet bright face & lovely complexion & the noble appearance of Master Hayne.  Our children are a fine specimen of the cross between the mountains & the seashore.

	If I were not so busy I could spend my time very pleasantly here.  But I have to work sop much & so constantly that I have no time for conversation�have not been in the drawing room since you left.  Governor Manning has carried me up to his room three evenings after dinner where we spend our time very pleasantly.  Col. Watts, Col. Herndon, Governor Means, Col. W. Thompson, General McGowan &c. have been of the company.

	Last night the Trustees had to act on a case of suspension of two students for passing a challenge to fight.  One of them was Albert Rhetts son, the son of my old friend Sally Taylor.  The other was by the name of [John Charles] McClenaghan.  They were both restored to college.  Mrs. Rhett has taken a house near the college to educate her son & was greatly mortified at the circumstance.

	I have now written you a long letter, too long for you to read with any interest I am afraid.  But I do not know when I shall be able to write you again.

	Be careful about the smallpox on account of the infant who is not vaccinated.  I hope God will protect you & the children---begin to wish[page torn]all very much & to see you all[page torn].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Since writing you this morning I have rece[ive]d a most valuable, useful & beautiful present for Anna from Mr. E� the district attorney of the United States who met her in Columbia last winter.  I asked him & Reed to[page torn] after getting through business there [page torn] Captain H�  I was looking at a very fine gold thimble in a magnificent tortoise shell case & spoke of purchasing it for my little daughter.  Mr. E� immediately said he begged for permission to send it to her as a present & would do so.  He said he went with Anna to the College chappel last winter & had a great deal of amusement with her.  She seems to have made a most favorable impression in all  who saw her here last winter.  I value the thimble & case very much for I know it will please Anna & be of use to her.  It is the finest thing of the kind I ever saw.  The price was $7.50.

	I have just been over to see Col. Pickens and his daughters who are at Hunts Hotel.  They will remain here till next week.  The Col. enquired about you, Anna & Willie & would have been very glad to have seen you.  His daughters seem pleasant & intelligent.

	I have just seen Mr. Irwin of the Mansion House & will send Anna�s thimble by him to her in the morning.  

	I finished my business in the Court of Equity about half after one today.  I think I am pretty sure I have succeeded in all my cases before the Court of Equity.  

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The mail has come in, but not yet opened.  It is half past four oclock in the evening.  Governor Means & Mr. DeSaussure are to come to my room to decide on the college matters referred to us as a committee.

	I must therefore bid you goodbye till Monday next.  There is to be quite a large party going to Governor Mannings residence tomorrow.  I go to General Adams & then Sunday to the governors.  Your affectionate husband now, and at all times, past, present & future, B.F. Perry

My dear daughter [Anna]

	I have rece[ive]d only one letter from you�none from Willie or Frank.  Tell them they must write to me.  I am anxious to hear from you.  I hope however you are all getting on very well.

	I do not know when I shall be able to return to Greenville, perhaps not before your mother returns.  I am very busy in the Court of Appeals & next Saturday I have promised to go down to General Adams, fifteen miles below Columbia & stay till Monday.

	Your mother write me that she just sent you a long letter yesterday.

	You must write me how you get on with your household, and all about the children the servants, the horses &c.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before breakfast.  I have just finished looking over my notes of evidence and argument preparatory for my speech this morning in the case of Keys & �.  Harrison & Reed argued the case yesterday & McGowan & myself will today.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & was glad to hear you were all well & had been to see your aunts.  I was also pleased to know that you were ready to return whenever I desired.  When that will be I am not able to say.  I desire to stay a day or two in Charleston when  I get there.  I shall be detained here till the last of next week.

	Since writing you Governor Manning has invited me to go down with him to his magnificent residence in Sumter & stay till Monday.  I told him I was engaged to General Adams & he proposed that I should divide my time & visit both which I am now inclined to do.  There is a large party of gentlemen going down with him.

	I have not heard from Anna or Willie since the letter I sent you.  But persons from Greenville say all are well.  I am very anxious to see the little children again & know they must be lonely there by themselves.

	We have a great crowd here now.  Jann[e]y turned off eight or ten persons yesterday evening.  I still have the same room.  Governor Manning has the gentlemens parlor for a bed chamber.

	I shall not be able to write you again before Monday.  You will not hear from [me] till Tuesday evening next.  I go in the morning to General Adams with Coil. Herndon.  We shall stay there till Sunday 12 oclock & then to Governor Mannings by four oclock, stay all night & return Monday morning.

	I shall probably go down to Charleston the last of next week and stay till you come up.  I do not think it worthwhile to run back to Greenville just before we are going to return.  It is probable I may get off Thursday, stay in Charleston Friday, Saturday & Sunday, come up to Columbia Monday, stay here two or three days & return home.  But all is uncertain on account of my law cases.

	I will write you positively on my return next Monday.  I am anxious to be with you & the children again.  I wish to be all reunited once more at our home & I hope we shall enjoy home more for our absence.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Since writing you a line on your mothers letter this morning, I have rece[ive]d a most beautiful, valuable & useful present for you from Mr. E� the district attorney of the United States who you saw in Columbia last winter.  I was in Captain Heiseys toy shop looking at a gold thimble, in a magnificent tortoise shell case, & said I Had a notion of purchasing it for you.  Immediately Mr. E� asked permission  to send it to you as a present.  He said he was much pleased with you last winter & hoped you would accept it in remembrance of him.  It is a very superior article, & a most beautiful & useful present for a young lady.  If I have an opportunity I will send it up to you.

	I have just got through with my Equity business in Court & will go down to General Adams in the morning & from there to Governor Mannings & return Monday morning.  I will then write you as to my movements.

	I hope Willie & Frank & Hext are doing well & behaving well.  You ought to behave like a lady at all times & I hope you do, & will show your skill in keeping house.

	I have just seen Col. Pickens & his daughters whom you saw in Charleston.  They & Col. Pickens enquired after you & Willie.

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you state that I may come down Thursday & you will come up with me�send you more money.  This unsettles me again in my arrangements.  I had determined on returning to Greenville & staying there for some time.  I will now be governed entirely by my own convenience in my movements.  When I can get away from here I will go to Charleston & stay two or three days & we will return to Columbia,

	I do not know when my business will be reached.  Mr. Fillmore is expected tomorrow or the next day.  I wish to see him.  Tomorrow I examine the Students.  Today I get my pensioner discharged	 on the ground that the young woman was unworthy of credit in her statements so I have made that much in�of my cases in the court of appeals since my stay in Columbia.

	Easl[e]y & McDaniel both inform me that several of my Equity clients at Greenville are wishing to see me.  It is important that I should return home as soon as possible & stay there.  I am neglecting the business in which our bread & the bread of our children depend.  I am sure you cannot wish that.  And there is no fun in running up & dow  the rail road this hot weather.

	�.

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are to take this letter.  I will write to you again as to my movements & business.   

	McDaniel told me that Hoke said Hext was complaining & not very well.  But Willie & Frank say nothing about it in their letters written Sunday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford say nothing about it.  I suppose it is one of Hokes pieces of news.

	I must now conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate husband�the more affectionate because I restrain you from doing wrong.  If I loved you less I might let you have more your own way.

	We may get home Tuesday or Wednesday.  I am very anxious to see you all again.

	I write in great haste.  President Fillmore is here.  But the best news I have to tell you is a present of $500  from Col. William Williams as an additional fee for my services in the Scurry case.  Such 
a present is worth having�came in time to pay for the carriage.

	I will write you again when I get to Columbia.  Tell Frank I will write the next letter to him.  

	This is Sunday morning & I have just written a long letter to the Patriot.  I must now go to breakfast.

	I hope to be at home tomorrow evening, but it is somewhat uncertain.

	One of my cases which would have taken a day or two being an issue how chancery. Judge Whitner declines trying, as he has been of counsel in the case.  There is one other which I hope to reach today or tomorrow morning.

	Mr. John Maxwell paid me fifty dollars as separate fee for my services in the case of himself & Anderson.  Keith & Perry will be an additional fee.

	I suppose the election is known by this time in Greenville, and I greatly fear that Powell is elected.  Keith has been beaten in this district.

	There was a great gathering last night at Mr. Robinsons in front of the Methodist Church, but I did not go to eat a hot supper.  There are a good many persons at B� from below.

	I saw Mr. Sharpe Monday.  He says Mrs. Sharpe has been very ill for four weeks past but is now better.  He told me to say to Mrs. McCall that she would have written to her but for her indisposition.

	I hope you and the children are all well & doing well & that you did not let the election
give you any uneasiness.  I heard by Goodlett & Easl[e]y all the news of Monday from the election in Greenville.  In haste your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I have been detained here much longer than I expected.  This however is the better for me as my business is much greater than I supposed it would be.  Perhaps I may be at home tomorrow & maybe not till Friday or Saturday.  Mr. Elford & E� are going to leave today & I am now writing to you before breakfast.

	Harriet Perry has sent you some money to pay for a cloak or something of the kind fashionable.  Can you get such an article in Greenville or will you have to send to Charleston for it.  If you have to send to�you had better do so at once as she will need the cloak soon.

	I have seen my brother & Warren.  I have rece[ive]d $245 for the wheat which was sold.�better crop than usual on my own account.  I have also rece[ive]d some little money.

	Steeles pony was not a pretty one & I did not purchase.  I was assured[page torn] would not be pleased[page torn]it.  I had rather have[page torn] one at Anderson, or we may get some other one.

	Judge Glover is here holding court & sems very pleasant & does pretty well.  I have been employed in a good deal of business here.  

	I hope you and the children are well & getting on well.  I am afraid Braeh� did not do well on the carriage & that you are not able to take your accustomed rides.  Your affectionate husband, B, F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am writing to you before breakfast, & will not close my letter till evening.  You have frequently requested to note what time in the day I write you.

	We had a pleasant trip down here & fell in with a great many members & other friends on the way.  Judge Wardlaw partook of my�beef & raisin.  We had no dinner on the road except our lunch.  There were quite a number of ladies in the cars & amongst them a daughter of Elias D. Earles on her way to Sumter.

	Brockman, Duncan, McBee & Mooney are with me in the Congaree House.  I have a fine room, but the others are not so well provided.  The House appears to be well kept & very neat.  Some improvements have been made.  Mr. T� is here as a boarder & as cordial as ever.  He enquired why Anna did not come down.  Said she could room with his daughter.

	There are a great many candidates, a house full of them, and amongst others, tell Willie his fellow student DeLorme is a candidate for doorkeeper.  He came up to me and wished to vote�me in the canvass.  It is probable I shall vote for him.

	I saw Henry Cauble at the depot, & he called round to see me last night.  He looks well & seems very much improved in his manners & appearance & intelligence.  He is well pleased with the school but says only forty have been able to stand the discipline out of ninety who entered.  Dr.  Austins son was dismissed for having too many black marks opposite his name.

	Dr. [C.G.] Metts of Union, a member of the Legislature, took me out last night to consult about my running for Speaker & expressed an earnest wish to elect me.  But I told him my politics would prevent that.  He told me it would make no �ions with him.  Col. Simmons will be elected probably without opposition.  Cunningham is here very active & busy.  Col. [Louis Trezevant] Wigfall & his wife are here.  

	I have not yet made the enquiry about Wilie & Frank but will do so & have no doubt by keeping them in my room where board with be moderate.  They may come down next Saturday if they will promise to be good boys, & keep their seats in the cars without moving about or attempting to pass from one car to the other.

	I have just returned from church & will finish my letter.  I went to the Episcopal church & heard Mr. Sams of Beaufort.  I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin, all of whom I spoke to.  They enquired after you & family.  I think Mrs. Taylor was at church but I did not get to speak to her.  After church Col. Aldrich, Col. Drayton & myself went to call on Governor Manning who is keeping house.  Mrs. Manning will be here on Tuesday.  The Governor enquired after you.  We took a glass of brandy with him & spent fifteen or twenty minutes very pleasantly.

	I came off & forgot to put up in starting from home my dressing gown.  Send it down to me by Mr. Wells who will come down Tuesday.  Bundle it up & direct to me in as small a canvass as possible.

	I hope you and the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  

	If I have time tomorrow I will write you again, but that is doubtful.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have but a moment to write you.  I was engaged last evening on rail road matter.

	I read your letter & can assure you that I am not so foolish ad to mind what an anomos writer may advise.

	I saw Col. O�Hanlon yesterday & he enquired of you & the children very affectionately.  He offered me his house at Perryville to stay at with you & the children.  He says Willie & Frank must come down & stay with him at Say castle.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am now writing to you about seven oclock in the evening.  I was in hopes to hear from you but did not.  I made them send the second time to the Post office but no letter.

	We had a busy day in the Legislature, & you will see by my letter the officers elected.  Poor Dean has been turned out by Col John T. Sloan of Pendleton.  It is horrible to be dependent on the Legislature for office.  I would almost as soon beg my bread.   

	John Cunningham was seated today in the seat I occupied for several years past & I thought he looked ashamed.  In the course of a few minutes Mr. Wagner came to me & asked me if I would not prefer my old seat, said I ought to have it & that persons wishing to see me looked to that seat as mine.  He proposed a change & I went back with all of my colleagues to our old seats.  Henry Richardson & Wagner took the seats reserved for the Greenville delegation by Mr. F�.

	I went this morning & paid Bedell $76 & sent a draft to Easter of Baltimore for $116,50 cts.  Tell Anna Mr. Beadon asked where my little pet was and Mr. Evans & Mr. Siegling enquired after her kindly. She seems to have made a very favorable impression last winter.  Col. Haskell, a member from one of the Parishes & brother to the one who married Judge Cheves daughter says Miss Mardens school is the best in Charleston.  He has educated two or three of his daughters there.  Col. Keith speaks in high terms of the school.  He enquired after your mother.  

	I have very little to write you & must now conclude.  I shall expect to see Willie & Frank Saturday.  They will go back the next Saturday.  I have not yet had an opportunity of speaking about their boarding, but have no doubt I can arrange it.  Anna will come down towards the end of the Session.

	How I should like to be with you all tonight.  I hope you are all well.  Mr. Ioor says the people of Greenville are all well.  

	Dr. Lieber called to see me today & left his card.  Good night, yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from dining with Governor Manning & it is now about nine oclock in the night.  I rece[i]ved your letter last evening & Sunday evening I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  I have not seen Mr. Wells, but understand that he brought my dressing gown.  I have not seen that either.  He is out somewhere. 

	I had a very pleasant time with Governor Manning.  Col. Orr, Col. Wilson, Col. Watts, Mr. Richardson, a German architect & another gentleman whose name I did not learn were all who came there.  I did not see Mrs. Manning who arrived today.  She is likewise in a condition not to show to advantage.

	Duncan informs me that Mrs. Simmons & Mrs. Croft arrived this evening, but I have not seen them.  Tell Willie that DeLorme has been elected doorkeeper & when he comes down he may let him into the�Hall.  DeLorme seems a clever boy & was very grateful for our effort.

	There was nothing of any interest done today in the Legislature.  I introduced a Bill to give the election of Electors to the people & also to give state aid to the Blue Ridge rail road.

	Look in those pigeon holes over where I sit & write in my office & you will see Dr. Gantts deed & the paper I drew for him.    Get them & give them to him.

	I must now conclude as I have really nothing to write about.  I am sorry for poor Luther McBee.  His brother Pinckney recd a letter from Alexander Monday evening but did not represent him as so low as you suppose him to be.

	Mr. Wells has just been to my room & has gone to bring my gown.  I have just seen at a distance Simmons & his bride & two other ladies & I suppose they are all to sleep together.  �.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd a letter from you & one from Willie & thank you for them.  Willies I ought to have recd last night.

	I did not write you last night because it was about eleven oclock when I returned from the Board of Trustees.  Dr. Thornwell has resigned as President of the College.  Who will be his successor is doubtful.

	Today I have been mostly in the Federal court listening to [James Louis] Petigru & Dr. Tre�  argue a case originating in secession & abolition excitement.  I have written an account of it for the Patriot.

	I heard of the death of Luther McBee yesterday evening & I �ft over your letter tonight in reading portions of it to Col. Brockman.  I am sorry for him.  He was foolish, but not a bad hearted man & I never have had but one opinion in regard to him with & to Susan.  She was too sensitive & not disposed to bear & concede his faults as a good wife or husband should be towards their other half.  This intercourse�happiness as well as his.  In married life we never can give unhappiness to each other without participating in it ourself.  It is like the poisoned cholic which returns to [word obscured]�which prevented it.

	I enclose you a pardon for poor Pittman.  Send it at once to him, & when he can give security to keep the peace he can come out & leave the state.  I am afraid the poor fellow is crazy.  

       Wells has just brought me my briefs & says he will pay some attention to Willie & Frank that they need not attempt to go from one car to the other or get out of the cars or stand on the platform.  Let them keep their seats & keep their heads in the cars.  Pickens Butler lost his hat this evening as he came down, & had to come in town bareheaded.

	I recd your letter this evening, & you express so much anxiety to hear from me every evening that I will try to do so.  It is now about ten oclock & I have just returned from a caucus on the Electoral question.  I have therefore time only to write you a few lines.  Nor have I anything of interest to write.  

	The Bill dividing Pendleton passed today & I made a short speech in favor of it.

	Mr. Pinckney Butler went home yesterday & will return Monday.  I think I shall go up with Willie & Frank tomorrow week & stay till Monday.   Next Saturday, tomorrow week, is fasting & prayer & the Legislature will not meet so I can come home & bring Anna down with me, & be better prepared to go to Charleston after the adjournment.  I shall have seen my wife & family. 

	Tell Mr. Elford that I have not yet seen the Patriot.  The Mountaineer came tonight but no Patriot! This is abominable and inexcusable neglect on his part & I can act outraged at it.  They never send the paper together to any of us when it is published.

	Send Elford likewise word to send the other briefs that he is preparing in the case of Bates & Christoipher.  Wells says he lives at his house most of his time; a man may be in love without neglecting his business.

	When you receive this letter Willie & Frank will be in Columbia, & you will be lonely.  I wish I could be with you.  

 	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees and it is now after ten oclock.  Wilie & Frank arrived here this evening safe, whilst I was in the State House.  I barely saw them before I started to the College & now they are just going to bed.  They went to the circus whilst I went to the College & Frank is greatly pleased.

	I hardly had time to read your long letter.  You have certainly got on a way of sermonizing.  I am always the same.  I do not believe that religion consists in being scared, or on the authored observing of religion.  I never expect to get to Heaven by going to church & saying prayers.  To be religious you must be good, in all the relations of life, & do your duty assigned you on this earth.  We must control the evil impulses & passions of our nature, & be kind to all & assist all we can help.  We must learn patience & endurance & long forbearance, & be content with out lot on this Earth because it is Gods will we should be here.

	There is a great crowd in Columbia tonight.  All the professors in the Furman University are here.  Nothing was done in the Legislature today buy make minor elections.  Your kinsman young Peroneau who sent back the Patriot so promptly is a candidate of assessor of Charleston.  DeSaussure came to me to enquire if I was supporting him & to announce him as a candidate.  I replied that I was not.  [Theodore Dehon] Wagner attempted to electioneer with me.  I voted for Dawson [on] the first ballet and the second ballot for Johnson, a brother of Judge William Johnson of the Federal court.  No election is yet made.  Reed & Fair have been reelected solicitors.

	The Speaker Simmons paid me a high compliment tonight.  He said he had no doubt about a question of order till he thought I doubted it.  That made him hesitate.  He knew I would not attempt to deceive or mislead him.  I must now conclude my dear wife by hoping you are in a better mood & not so [two words interlined, illegible].

	It has just occurred to me that the cars do not go tomorrow.

Sunday, 1 oclock

	I have just returned from the College Chapel & heard a fine sermon from President Thornwell.  I have just written an account of it for the Patriot.  Willie & Frank went also.  I saw a great many persons from Greenville there, the professors of the Furman University amongst them.  It was the first service in the new chapel.  There was an immense crowd.  The Building is a magnificent one, a sort of Grecian Temple.  The manse was fine.  I saw Miss Brenan in the Gallery, but did not speak to her.  Somehow or other I do not feel the same interest in her, since her intimacy with Alston.  I spoke to Mrs. Lieber & the doctor.  I saw [Richard T.] Brumby & his daughters, but did not have an opportunity of speaking to them.  Tomorrow everybody will be at the Chapel.

	In regard to my opinion {page torn] poor Luther, I have no doubt his God has dealt mercifully with him, & as I said before he was not a bad hearted man.  It is perhaps better for him, & his family that he is gone.  He could have been of little service to them or consolation to them.  I am sure however Susan feels deeply his loss.  Many a tear fell from my eyes whilst reading your letter.  Tell Susan I deeply sympathize with her & hope she will now devote her life to her children. & unite herself in thought & feeling with the family of her husband.  It is her duty & her interest to do so cheerfully and Freely & uncomplaining.  She must be affectionate & kind to them & neither complain of nor resent their supposed neglect of herself.  The McBees are all affectionate & good people in their way.  They are a plain people, & it is Susan�s duty to be one of them in dress, living & everything else.  They will do a good part by her children.  But if she begins to complain & fret & worry & tease them as she has heretofore done, she will make herself odious to them.  She must be economical & prudent.  If she has grievances she must keep them to herself, & not tell them to her mother, & they will be for [page torn].

	I will now close my letter.  God bless you & the children.  My dinner is ready.  Willie & Frank have dinner before, gone to take a walk with young Butler.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just got through with my business & visitors & seated myself to write you a line.

	His has been college commencement.  I had to stay in the Legislature till five.  Then I went to Chancellor Dargan about T�s business.  On my return I found Duncan, Elford & Sullivan& McBee & Brockman all in my room.  They have just gone.

	Elford gave me your letter.  I shall save my board by going home which will be my passage.  If I can possibly leave I shall do so.  My law business comes up this week.

[Paragraph interlined, illegible]

	I have written a letter for the Patriot, giving an account of the College commencement.  

	Willie & Frank are asleep & Willie is snoring finely.   

	Mr. Petigrus address today was a reply to Tabers false idea last winter about educating the people.  

	Anna can come down with me or stay & come afterwards.   Pinckney Mcbee returned this evening.

	It is now bitterly cold.  I saw Barnwell Rhett today who seemed kind & glad to see me.

	I have not time to write you as I would wish & must now close my letter.

	Today I was employed all day in the court of appeals the case of Croft & Tobler.  Tomorrow I shall likewise be in court & perhaps all the week.  I am afraid I shall not be able to go up to Greenville next Saturday.  I cannot teel the result of Crofts case.

My dear Liz

	I have today had to attend the Judiciary committee, the court, the Legislature, again the committee, & last a caucus, from which I have just returned near twelve oclock in the night.  You must therefore expect nothing but a line.

	Yesterday I argued the Croft case.  Today I have been in the Greenville academy case.  

	I saw Col. O�Hanlon & he will carry Willie & Frank down to say castle tomorrow & they will stay two or three days with him.  They will not return Saturday.

	I dine with Col. John Preston tomorrow & have the invitation being sent yesterday I suppose there will be a large & magnificent party.

	I was glad to receive your letter this evening.  Easl[e]y came down also this evening.

	I saw General martin this morning who said Mrs. Martin had rece[ive]d a long & very interesting  letter from you on the death of poor Luther McBee.

	I saw Col. Hayne also today & spoke to him for the second time since I have been here.

	There was a great parade here this evening & Frank was very much pleased.

	I must now bid you good night by assuring you that you are mistaken in supposing that your love for me is greater than mine for you.  Seldom has a husband loved his wife as I have.  But these things will not do to write about.  When we meet we will talk about them.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from Col. Jno Prestons dinner.  It was a most magnificent affair�fish from the north�a leg of mutton from England�wild turkeys from somewhere�canvas back ducks from the Chesapeake�hams from Westphalia�pheasants & wood cocks�gallons of ice cream, jellies & sweet meats &c.  Everything on the table gold & silver�the best wines & the greatest variety imaginable &c &c--�& cocoanut cakes &c. &c.

	His rooms too are full of paintings & statuary & mirrors�Governor Manning�President Alston�Speaker [James] Simons�Drayton�Mr. Calhoun, Gourdine, Col. Keitt member of Congress, Col. Chesnut, Birdsall of New York & Col. Hampton were the party.

	Willie & Frank went down with Col. O�Hanlon this evening & will return Sunday.  As you are so indifferent about�.

	At present I am engaged in my law cases.  Today I finished the Greenville academy.  Today the Boles case comes up.  I have not been to the Legislature till 3 oclock this week.  

	The town looks like a heap of ruins.  Sad! Sad!

	I saw Mr. Garland & Miss Shor� today.  I saw Mr. & Mrs. Whitaker the other day & Stanly Crittenden.  He looked very happy & self satisfied.  I spoke to them in the State House.  Give my love to the children, & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Shortly after I had written you and gone to bed, I was awoke by the fire bell.  The whole square opposite the Hotel is burnt to the ground.  The sight was a terrific one.  The women were horribly alarmed.  The whole house is in the greatest confusion.  The fire is yet burning.  DR. Gibb[e]s�office $30,000 is utterly destroyed.  The streets are full of furniture.  Willie & Frank have stood in the piazza fir three hours looking on.  The fire broke out ? after one oclock.  It is now after five in the morning.  I have no idea of the loss, but it is very heavy.  The fire broke out in a grocery where last night a man was killed by the son of Chancellor Caldwell.  His body is burnt up.  The murder, the grog shop & the fire will furnish Judge O�Neall with a�theme for a letter or temperance lecture.  In great confusion, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from dinner with Col. Campbell & his Charleston Mess composed of Senator Mordecai, King, Richardson, Johnson, Wagner, Wilson &c.  I was interested to meet Col. Brooks member of Congress & also met young Lowndes who has just graduated.  I spent a very pleasant evening & we had a good dinner.  

	On my return to the Hotel I found your note & was glad to hear you were all well.  I was glad too to hear that Mr. Sto� had paid you a visit, & thought kindly of me.

	I wrote you yesterday that Willie & Frank had gone down to Col. O�Hanlons.  He desired to keep them two or three weeks, but they will return Monday. & perhaps go home Tuesday.  Col. O�Hanlon is as kind & affectionate as ever.  He is bitterly opposed to Adams election.  The election was today ordered for Monday next on my motion.  The opponents of Adams wished to put it off & succeeded till I moved in the matter.  The House immediately acquiesced by a large majority on my motion.  Not three minutes before I made the motion, they decided not to have the election even on Tuesday.

	I have been engaged all day pretty much in the court & have made good progress with my cases.  I hope to get through next Monday.  The case of Bev� & Coleman I shall gain.  I shall also gain the academy case, but I shall loose Bates & Christopher, but I shall also gain Youngs case.  How the other cases will go is doubtful.  But on Monday they deliver opinions.

	The Electoral Bill was postponed today after McCreadys speech for me & Sullivan till Tuesday.

	I am distracted by the division of my labors.  I cannot serve two masters.  My case business is now becoming too extensive for me to continue in the Legislature & do justice to my clients.

	Yesterday I was stopped in the street by General Owens of Fairfield who is moving to Florida.  He wished me to seed the Patriot to him & whilst I was taking down his Post office Dantzler & other hot secessionists friends of the General came by & he told them what he was doing.  Today I was stopped by Erwin of the Pedee who paid me $5.00.  Sp� a lawyer of Edgefield also subscribed.  Erwin said I had saved the state.  Col. Simons the speaker expressed himself of Preston as strongly as I ever did against the brag[g]art spirit of South Carolina.

	My dear Liz I wish to see you & the children very much, & am truly sorry I cannot go up in the morning.  But my law cases will prevent.  In walking home tonight with Col. Brooks he said Washington was a most corrupting & demoralizing place.  That he was not able to carry on his family, and should quit after this term.  That there was no real happiness after all except at home in one�s family circle.

	Enclosed I send you an Editorial for the Patriot  which you will please send up to Elford immediately.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter last night & enclosed some editorials for the Patriot with an article of Judge O�Nealls.

	I have very little to write now in addition to what I wrote then.  I did not go to church today as I heard such a fine sermon yesterday, and also I had to do a great deal of writing in reference to my cases in court.  

       The Case of the Greenville Academies has been referred to the Court of Errors & must be reargued on Tuesday next.  I have understood the chancellors are divided, Wardlaw & Dargan for me & Johnston & Duncan against.  The law Judges are now called in to settle the matter.

	Willie & Frank have not yet returned from Col. O�Hanlons.  I suppose they will tomorrow morning.  If so they may return to Greenville Tuesday or they may stay to the Inauguration of the Governor.  He is to be elected tomorrow at ? past twelve.  I suppose General Adams will be elected.

       Col. Jno S. Preston was confirmed today in the Episcopal church by Bishop Davis.  Col. Wade Hampton Jr. was also confirmed and a large number of others as I was informed.
       
       I am sorry you did not write me a longer letter than the one I rece[ive]d last night.  But were [glad] to hear from you is something, & I should be very glad to receive just as short a letter this evening which is Sunday, a day we have no mail from Greenville

	Col Fair & wife [&] Col. Herndon & wife are here.  Mistress F� has a son about Haynes age which she brought into the room to show me today.  It is very much like her but does not look so well as Hayne.

	I have been from home so long that I almost forget how Hayne looks.  God bless the little fellow.  How I should like to see him tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just had time to read the long�letter you sent me by Mr. Thompson.  It is now ten oclock & I have to write for the Patriot after writing to you.  I have just come back from the committee in the State House.

	Willie & Frank returned today from Col. O�Hanlons & were very much pleased with their visit.  They wish to stay here till the Governors Inauguration Wednesday so you may look for them Thursday.

	The decrees in Crofts case & Boles case were confirmed today.  Tomorrow I have to argue again the Academies in the Court of Errors.

	General Adams was elected Governor today & they are now serenading him�.

	I must now write for the Patriot.  Good night�God bless you & the children & make you happy as you ought to be.  Yours affectionately. B.F. Perry

	It is now nine oclock, & I have just returned from the committee & still have to go & meet [George Alfred] Trenholm & Gourdin on the Blue Ridge rail road Bill.

	I have been all day in court arguing the academy cases & Yanceys cases.  I have no doubt I shall gain both.  Tomorrow I have two or three other cases.  My business in the Legislature is very much neglected.  

	The Electoral Bill was postponed today whilst I was absent.

	I rece[ive]d your letter just before I went to meet the committee.  Willie & Frank will go home Thursday�you may expect to see them.  I wish I could go with them.  About one third of the members went home last Saturday & returned Monday.  Judge Whitner did so. [William Dunlap] Simpson & [W.P.] Henderson returned home to Laurens.  

	But it is impossible for me now to leave till the Legislature adjourns.

	I must now bid you good night as I have now to go & meet Trenholm as already stated.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I was not able to write you last night.  The Legislature did not adjourn till near eleven oclock in the night.  The Blue Ridge Rail Road was under discussion.  I was engaged in Court till half after one when Mr. [Thomas Martin] Wagner came for me to go & open the debate.  I made a short speech in favor of the Bill.  But I was too much fatigued to do justice to the road or to myself.  It is inconceivably perplexing to be running from the Courts to the Legislature.  I am first on our court & then in the other & needed in the Legislature all the time.  In this way I am not able to do my duty in any place.  

	I am now writing to you in the House of Representatives and persons are passing by constantly & stopping to talk.  But I am afraid tonight it will be as it was last night.  The Blue Ridge is still under discussion.  

	On going home last night I met your uncle Col. Hayne again & he walked with me to my Hotel.  He said he had heard my speech.  He seems very kind.

	I read your letter last night & think with you that I had better come home & go with Anna to Charleston.  It will be much more agreeable to my feelings to return home & see my wife & children than to go a different�after the adjournment of the Legislature.  It will be better for Anna likewise than to come down alone or with some stragler.  Mr. Elford is in Charleston & will not return to Greenville till after the Baptist convention on the 20th.  I saw Mr. Pressly this morning who informed me that he left Elford in Town yesterday.

	If I have time I will write you again tonight after receiving your letter.  We adjourn next Thursday.  

	I wrote Mr. Yancy the success of his case.  I have also succeeded in Major Seaborns case & wrote him too yesterday evening.  It gives me pleasure to communicate good news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	 Willie & Frank have just finished packing up & gone to bed.  The Legislature has just adjourned & it is ten oclock.

	I send you two dollars worth of candy which Coil. O�Hanlon gave the money to Willie to purchase & he lost one dollar of it.  There is a great variety of candies.  I also send Fannie a box 1.00 & a ring 1.50 as she is not going from home & Anna is.  I also send Hext a gold watch, made out of India rubber, price 62 ? cts.  Buy a ribbon & let him wear it.

	Tonight I met your uncle Col. Hayne in the streets.  I said to Willie that gentleman looks like Col. Arthur Hayne.  He turned round to follow after us.    He is to be here several days.  He says all are well in Charleston.

	The Legislature will adjourn next Thursday 21st December.  If Anna has no good opportunity of coming down I had just as leave return home, & go back with her to Charleston.  If I were to go home first, I should enjoy my trip to Charleston much more, & would stay longer.

	The Greenville academies was decided tonight allowing the trustees to make the transfer of the Academy lands on the terms we proposed.  But the Court would not permit the two corporations to be united.  But everything is gained that I petitioned for in the first instance.  [George F.] Townes deserves the universal execration of the whole community & ought not to be countenanced by the Baptists for he has greatly bedevilled them.  

	Governor Adams was inaugurated today & gave me a most cordial invitation to go & see his wife & daughters.  He seems a good friend personally & I believe he is sincerely so.  He has always been kind to me & he put me in nomination years ago for President of the Bank.

	I have been engaged in Court all day & shall be tomorrow morning.

	The Blue Ridge Rail Road comes up tomorrow & I have to speak first�Trenholm & Memminger follow.

	I must now stop.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now five oclock & I have just eaten my dinner & have till seven to go back to the State House, where I shall have to stay till eleven oclock in the night.

	I wrote you a letter this morning in the State House, but as I did not write you last night, I will write again.  I am waiting for the post office to be opened, so that I may get your letter & then I will reply to it.  I hope to hear that Willie & Frank reached home safely & found you all well.  I hope also to receive a Patriot & read over again my letters, or rather look at them for I have not time to read them.

	The discussion in the House on the Blue Ridge Rail road is going on.  Col. Memminger will conclude the debate this evening, & I have no doubt the Bill will pass.

	I spent a good deal of today with your uncle.  He came & sat with me sometime in the Legislature�enquired where Willie was & what he did.
	
	I have just been down & got your letter & read it.  I am glad to hear you were all well.

	You may now regard it settled that I will come home before going to Charleston.  Anna therefore need not come down.  It would be unpleasant to go from home after the adjournment of the Legislature when all the other members were hastening home.  

	I must now close my letter & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

This morning I went into court & then to the Legislature & sat till four oclock & thence to dine with Dr. Furman.  Then I went back to the Legislature & have just returned from the House fatigued & tired.  We adjourn on Saturday & I will return Sunday night.  There is to be an extra train to carry us up on Sunday.  

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Dr. Furman & in going there I met Miss Brenan in the street & shook hands with her & had some little chat.  She enquired kindly after you & mother.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few moments to write before going down to the night session, from which I may not return in time to write you.

	I will send you an editorial to read & send up to Elford.  But, now, it just occurs to me that the cars do not run tomorrow.  I shall have all day Sunday to write you.

	This evening I met old Mrs. Ioor & Mrs. Edwards her granddaughter I believe.  I was going to pass by Mrs. Ioor not noticing her till she spoke.  I was glad to see her.  She came down last Monday I think.

	I have just seen Dr. Irvine & Col. Irvin on their way to Florida.  The Dr. has not yet said anything in reference to his sessions case.  I have not seen Mrs. Irvine.

	Mr. Leary is still here & wishes to settle in Columbia.  I saw young Douglass with him.

	We had quite an animated discussion today in the House in which I participated on the Savannah�Rail Road.

	There have been a great many robberies here.  Col. Irby lost one hundred & thirty three dollars last night, stolen out of his pockets whilst asleep.

	Sunday morning.  I find myself in quite a predicament this morning.  In order to be secure against robbers last night, I put my clothes in my trunk & shut it down.  It never occurred to me that the key of the trunk was in my pantaloons pockets.  So I am in my shirt & drawers & nothing to put on but my dressing gown.  The boy waiting on me has been all over the house for keys but none will unlock my trunk.  The mechanics are all away from their shops and here I am not knowing what to do.  The breakfast bell has rung & I have written a long Editorial waiting my lick but all in vain.

	Since writing the above I have had all the keys in the house sent me, but none fit.  It is now eleven oclock & I have now put on an old pair of pantaloons & gone down & got my breakfast.

	The agony is over & a blacksmith has come & broke the lock of my trunk.  I am now dressed & ready for dinner.  Col. R.F.W. Al[l]ston understanding I could not leave my room sent me a book to read.  Col. Drayton told me he would have offered a pair of his pantaloons, but he did not like to have his britches split.  Whilst I was dressing at eleven or twelve Col. Carroll came to pay me a visit & talk about a matter in the Legislature.  I have been disappointed in going to church & will now conclude my letter as I have not any more to write & shall not hear from you tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now near midnight & I have just returned from the Legislature.

	I could have written to you after dinner but I met my old friend S.A. Marenick from Texas & had to spend the hour with him.  He looks as old as his father did when he died.  He came up to me in the room & I had no idea who he was.  He said he had been looking for me.  I have just�from him.  He goes to Pendleton in the morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight.  Becky may go to Charleston with Baylis [Earle].  I shall stay at home three or four days.

	I am glad Brackenridge is dead.  I should have disliked to have seen him again.  I hope the other horses are well.  You must buy corn for them.

	Mr. [Perry Emory] Duncan has heard that his son is sick & will go home Wednesday or perhaps tomorrow.

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line this morning for fear I may not be able to write this evening.

	Last night we had a terrible session.  Neither House adjourned till near midnight.  The Blue Ridge Bill passed the Senate.  The Augusta Bridge is still under discussion & I may speak on it today.

	Mr. [William Dunlap] Simpson of Laurens said last night after hearing Col. Preston on the Rail Road, said he had never heard him before, but that he did not make anything like as good a speech as I made at Asheville last summer�month.   

	I wrote you last night about meeting Marenick.  He shocked me to look at.  He looked about seventy.  His hear as white as cotton.  He lives in San Antonio.  He had heard of Major Bell but had not met him.

	I am exceedingly anxious to get home again & would not for any consideration go on to Charleston without going home.  On reflection I rather think I shall have to remain in Greenville till after saleday.  I must be at home on that day and it will be almost impossible for me to get back.  In going [on] a trip to Charleston I like to take my time in staying there after travelling two hundred & seventy or eighty miles to get there.

       I rece[ive]d a letter last night purporting to be from Reuben.  He says that Mr. Crawford is going to Augusta & that he & Mrs. Crawford are so much attached to his wife they would buy then sell�that the Bible says a man must forsake father, mother & brother & cleave unto his wife�that Georgia seems to be his �trial� & he had as well make up his mind to go.  The letter looks as if a negro may have written it.  It is signed �your boy Reuben.�  But he speaks of Reuben in the letter as if it was written by someone else.
       
       It is now six oclock in the evening & I have just taken dinner.  I will finish my letter before going down to the State House.  Nothing has been done in the Legislature except discuss the Augusta Bridge to empty chairs.  I took no part in such a debate.
       
       I rece[ive]d your letter just this minute, also one from Alfred Huger requesting me to give my support to the repeal of the law relative to Colored seamen.  He says he has always entertained the highest appreciation of my judgement & political principles as well as respect for me personally.  I also rece[ive]d a Book from Judge Butler.
       
       I am glad to hear you mention all the children by name.  I wish I was with them & you.  I am tired & sick of Columbia & would like to go up in the morning with Mr. Duncan who returns to see his sick child.
       
       I also rece[ive]d a letter from W.S. Lawton who says he has a son at Greenville at school�that his son writes him he has heard me make some fine speeches.
       
       Mr. Arthur was here yesterday but I did not see him.  Mr. Leavy has been crazy from drink.
       
       I am glad Lindy is going to be married, & hope she will do better.
       
       The Greenville academies have been decided�that the Trustees have the right to sell the lands & transfer the academies without applying to the Court.  This is the view I always had of the matter but filed the petition at the insistence of Dr. [Andrew B.] Crook to pacify all parties.  [I] have introduced a clause in [word obscured] incorporation bill to blend the trustees of the Academies & Furman University.
       
       I have seen nothing of Miss Brenan.  She did give a concert, but I did not attend nor have I seen Mr. Hasle.  
       
       I must now conclude & go to the State House.  But I shall not stay there longer than nine oclock for I am worn out in sitting up with loss of sleep.  My money is deposited in Bank $700.00 & I have $75 in my pocket.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just read your letter & have but a few moments to write you before going down to the House where I shall be till midnight

	I have had a bad cold & a sore throat which I think I caught Sunday whilst sitting in my dressing gown waiting for my trunk to be opened.  These night sessions have increased my indisposition & I would not�diet but for very pressing matters.

	I shall rejoice to be at home once more & only wish I was now�with you & the children before the fire & could go to bed at nine instead of sitting up till midnight.  

	We had quite a snow here last night for a few moments.

	I saw Mr. Wells just now.  He says Mr. Elford came down with him.	 

	I saw Captain Cunningham here yesterday.  John seems disposed to be civil and kind but was very shy at first.  I think there must be something forbidding and austere in my appearance when I do not like a person.  It is seldom anyone takes liberties with me.

	I rece[ive]d a message from Miss Brenan last night that I must go & see her.  She goes to New York Friday.  I shall not go.  I have not time.

	I saw Governor Adams today & told him to say to Mrs. Adams & his daughter that I regretted extremely not being able to go and see them.  I told him you had been criticizing his Inaugural & said it seemed he opposed everything I had advocated.

	He told me that I was under solemn promise to go & see him next May & every May & that he should prepare for that.

	I saw Col. O�Hanlon today who enquired about you & Willie & Frank.

	I must now conclude in great haste & as you like to see my Editorials I send you the enclosed.

Mrs. [John] Pettit. My dear Madam

	Your very acceptable letter was received by me, whilst attending the sitting of our Legislature in Columbia.  Mrs. Perry was kind enough to enclose it to me.  

	You must excuse the liberty I take in publishing it.  Several of the Senators & representatives to whom I showed the letter said it was it was too good not to be published.

	I have just enclosed to you a Poem by Col. [William John] Grayson of South Carolina, long a member of Congress, & recently a good Union man��The hireling and the Slave.�  I hope you will accept it, as a memento of my regard for you, & your political principles.  It has high merit in South Carolina, & is just published.  It comes from your own �sunny South� & dear old Carolina.

	I sincerely regret the loss of Mr. Pettit in the United States Senate.  My friend Judge Butler spoke in very high terms of him last Summer to me.  It would have given Mrs. Perry & myself great pleasure to have seen you and Mr. Pettit in Greenville.  I have ordered the Southern Patriot to be sent to you.  I scribble for it as Editor, but my Professional vocations as a lawyer are so arduous that I cannot pay the attention to it that I desire.

	   I will write you again shortly.  Mrs. Perry unites with me in regards to you & Mr. Pettit.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry
