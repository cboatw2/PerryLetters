Monday morning, 2 May [1842]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before the court meets.  I am afraid I shall not have time to do so after the adjournment of court.

	We arrived here yesterday evening about three oclock.  Very tired & very dusty.  Judge Earle, Col. Townes, Edward Earle & Mr. Young.  We made free use of your bread stuffs on the road & they were very much praised and also you yourself was praised by all for being as good & kind a wife in providing for her husband so bountifully.  Judge Earle thought the corn pound cake exceedingly good & could hardly believe that it was all cornmeal.  

	I have just been to the court to look at the docket & find a great many cases ahead of mine.  I am afraid of being detained here until the last of next week.

	I saw Judge Evans this morning who enquired after you.  Mr. Pendleton is here & enquired kindly after you.  Not many of the lawyers have yet got in.  Mr. Pendleton has got a good many subscribers to his Paper.  I have given him my Revolutionary Incidents & he seemed very thankful for them.  He asked if he might state by whom they were written.  They will therefore appear as written by me.

	I have boughtbut the other books you wish cannot be had.  I have bought a new novel by [Alexander Dromgoole] Sims of Darlington a member of the Legislature, whom you may have heard me speak of as being a young man of talent & inclined to drink.   It is addressed to Judge Evans.  The style is good.  It is a tale of the Revolution called Bevil Faulcon.

	There was a great to do here the other night about four students who went off to Texas without the knowledge of their parents. They were from Camden.  One was a son of Col. McWillie whom you have heard me speak of.  There was a great crowd assembled to see them start.   The Professors in college came & tried to restrain them.  They went off in the stage & it will be very mortifying to their parents.  

	I went yesterday evening to look at the burnt part of the Town.  This is sad to behold.  I met there Dr. [William] Blanding.  He told me that Mrs. McCray had been brought home and that there was little or no hope of her sons recovery.  He is still in the Asylum.

	My pen is so bad & the ink has grease in it that it pains me to write.  I hope to hear from you Wednesday.  I hope you are getting on well with the house & Servants & that the children are all well.  The dear little creatures how I could kiss & squeeze them this morning.  There is no place like home & there are no persons whose company gives as much pleasure as the members of ones family.  You and the children are to me everything in this world & always with you I could be happy.  

	  My pen is so bad & cannot be mended.  I must conclude.  Give my love to your mother & sisters & believe me yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	I have time only to write you a few lines whilst I am in the same room withWare & Town[e]s & chair.
	We had quite a pleasant journey down here but have had a most angry and stormy time since our arrival here.  The Rail Road Convention broke up in confusion.  The Greenville & Laurens stock holders withdrewtheir connection with the company.  The reason of this was that the road was located in Abbeville & Anderson instead of coming through Laurens.  The Greenville and Laurens subscribers are now released from the payment of their stock.  We have had much debate & some angry discussion none on my part thoughsome on the part of General [Waddy]Thompson & others.  We start in the morning to Columbia.   Col. Coleman, Poinsettand their families are at Harts & go down tomorrow or next day.
	I took tea with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  He lives in great style.  I was at Chancellor [Job] Johnstons who lives handsomely & he invited me to tea, but I could not accept.
	The towns people are outraged with Col. [James Lawrence] Orr for his course on the rail road.  I made two good speeches on the convention & was highly complimented for them.
	Edward has been standing by me & says give his respects to you & tell his mother howdy & all the rest of the servants.  He says that he is very much pleased with his journey, & has behaved himself well.
	Choice is considerably hurt by this runaway scrape.  We have been very gracious.  
       In haste yours truly.  Tell Will I wish very much to have him with me, & I am sorry I did not bring him in the carriage.  Kiss the children. Tell Will to write me.  Your husband affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	I have just finished dressing & taken my seat to write you a few lines before breakfast as I do not expect to have time to write afterwards before the mail is closed.  I hope you wrote me yesterday & will add a Postscript today.  
	We reached Columbia yesterday evening, all safe, after a pleasant journey down, with the exception of an accident which had like to have been a very serious affair.  The second day after leaving Greenville we were disappointed in getting lodging at the house where we expected to stay & had to drive two miles further in the dark of the evening.  I had taken a seat with Judge Earle & his boy was driving my horse & buggy.  In passing through a drove of hogs which had been to water, in the lane & in front of the House where we were going to stay, one of the hogs ran under the heels of his horses & frightened them.  They ran up the hill & we thought their scare was over.   But whilst enquiring about lodgings one of the horses commenced kicking, plunging, wheeling round &c.  The other horses were all behind & became alarmed also & manifested a disposition to join in the frolic.  It was then quite dark.  I sprung out of the Judges buggy & ran to my horses lead & made Edward go to hold the Judges horses, one of which was kicking at a most terrible rate all the time.  Col. Cox unloosed his horses from the carriage just in time.  In order to get my horse out of the way I drove through a gate & I had scarcely got through when the Judges buggy & horse & two or three men who were trying to hold his horse made a dash at the place I had just left.  Had I not been out of the way we should have had a general crash.  After some time a half dozen men succeeded in getting the horses extricated from the carriages.  But the frightened horses was not satisfied but continued to kick, came very near giving Sam Earle a blow which might have made another widower in Mrs. Harrisons family.  Col. Cox received a severe kick on his hand.  Judge Earle came out safe.  The carriage considerably injured, the horse badly crippled.  I thought at one time we should have a general runaway.  The next morning the Judge got a new horse & mended his carriage.  We all came on safely.

	We had some fine dinners on the road out of the provision we carried with us.  Judge Early provided the corn pound cake & ginger bread is so much more pleasant eating on the road side than stopping at a House for dinner.  

	I hope you & the children are all doing well.  I talked to Judge Earle so much about the pleasure we derive from a wife & children that we believe he seriously returned  He regretted his situation very much & said he had nothing but a dreary & gloomyfull of suffering & misery.

	I saw Col. Martin last night.  He says they are all well.  I have not yet seen Mr. Hayne.  There are ten or fifteen candidates for secretary of State.  I have never seen so much electioneering.  I feel happy that I am not a member.  The old members are all expressing to me great regret that I am not a member.

	I have a room with Mr. Burt, but he has not yet arrived.  In it there is [a] fine chest of drawers and locked.  I supposed they were empty & took out my bunch of keys to try to unlock them.  I found a key & unlocked them, when behold, instead of being empty, contained a ladys wardrobe!  All the paraphernalia of a females dress with a great many et ceteras.  I was reminded of the story of I had got into forbidden ground & locked up the drawers & put the keys back in my pocket.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was disappointed in writing to you yesterday as I intended doing.  I was all day waiting in Court for one of my cases to be taken up and it was not till this morning.  I have just finished the argument in that case & have left the court for the purpose of writing to you.  I had the good fortune to try one of my cases last Tuesday.  So I have now two disposed of & six more to argue besides two in the Legislature.  I shall be detained here eight or ten days yet.

	In consequence of my rooming with Mr. [Armistead] Burt I cannot write you as conveniently ass I Could if I were alone.  We have two sets of visitors to entertain in consequence of our being together.

	Your letters were recd this morning & Ispeak of the pleasure they gave me.  I read them both whilst with Sam Earle & had the pleasure of telling him that Mrs. Earle was well &c.  Poor old George looks very natural & is cooking for Dr. Roache.  I do not know what to say about your mother buying him.  She must determine the matter for herself.  You know my plan is not to purchase an old negro.  Your mother can determine for herself & write me.

	I have been tempted to purchase for Susan one of the sweetest little gold pencil cases you  The price was seven dollars but I got it for four & one half so I have paid $4.50 & will present the gold pencil case to her.  It is substantial  & will last longer & look prettier than a silver one.  It was so beautiful I could not resist the temptation of buying it & making it a present.  If you wish I will get you one like it.  It has a ringto a chain & is beautifully carried.

	I have seen a horse & think of buying it for Will.  The price is $14.00 & I cannot get it for less but the difficulty will be in getting it home.  I do not think of going to Augusta now, as I can arrange the business I have there, by sending the money by ben Yancey who is now here & is in Augusta every day when at home.  By the by Ben Yancey says he has the prettiest specimen of female beauty he ever saw.  I doubted that I had not a prettier in little Anna.  Yancey made a very good friend the other day on the Court of Appeals.

	I am the more & more pleased not being in the Legislature & would not takenot then, now, for several hundred dollars.  I have seen so much intriguiry & electioneering this session that I am utterly disgusted with politics.  Col. [William Campbell] Preston has resigned & Mr. Calhoun intends doing so.  The Legislature will have two Senators to elect.  Great exertions are making by the Rhetts to have Barnwell Rhett elected. The friends of Judge Huger will perhaps put him in nomination.  Governor [John Peter] Richardson, Judge [John Belton] ONeal[l], Col. McWillie are all spoken of.  [George] McDuffie will be the successor of Col. Preston.  I saw Col. Preston this morning.  He looks remarkably well &  has returned to the Bar.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler came to see me the other night & enquired after all of you very kindly.  In giving the Judges my briefs I gave him one that you had endorsed last Fall.  He said he would keep it on account of the writing.  Albert Rhett came twice to see Burt & myself & enquired after all of you very kindly.

	Mr. Hayne tells me he has a box for your mother but has not yet sent it to me nor have I sent the box of Susans to him.  Mrs. Taylors brother is much better.  He has Mrs. Keith with him.  Her health is bad.  He has been elected & will return to Town.  He enquired after all of you, how many children &c.  He looks badly.  I went down to the State House this morning to meet the Bible convention but it did not meet.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother &c.  B.F. Perry

I am glad to hear that the children and Servants are all behaving well & am very sorry to hear of Annas bad health again.  [sentence interlined illegible].  I saw Col. Keith who came to my room electioneering.

 My dear Liz

	Your letter was handed me last night & Mr. Earle came up to know what was the news from home & to my surprise had not heard from his better half since he had left Greenville.  I was much pleased to hear you were all doing pretty well.  I begin to feel anxious to see you & the children.  How I should like to take them in my arms & hear their prattle.  I will endeavour to be at home the first of next week.

	I have just returned from the college commencement to write you.  I saw there a great display of beauty & fashion but did not stay long to admire it, not more than three minutes.

	This morning I start with your letter in myto shop.  I found all the articles you desired & have made the purchase.  Tell Will I have bought him a most beautiful pony with a saddle & bridle long tale and main, high headprice $16.00.  Co. [Henry Gaines] Johnsons waggon will be down here next week and will carry the horse up for nothing.  It is really a beautiful hobby horse & Will can ride on it most gloriously.

	Mr. Hayne sent me two bundles for your mother, & I gave him the boxes which I brought downor rather I sent it to Mrs. Taylor.  I have not yet seen Taylor or any of his family.
	
       I hope youthe gold pencil & letter sent you by Col. Town[e]s.  I would write to you oftener than I do but really I have no chance.  Our room is constantly filled with company & I am now writing whilst Burt and Col. [Frederick William] Davie & Reed are talking about all sorts of things, & I have to join the conversation every now & then.

	There is great excitement in regard to the election of United States Senator.  Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger & Barnwell Rhett & Col. Davie are candidates.

	I saw Mr. Pendleton this morning.  He gave the magnolia & a beautiful print of Charleston.  You will however see the Print as it will come with the magnolia.

       I am very much complimented by all who see me on account of my good looks.  I am told that I have improved astonishingly in personal appearance.  They all say that I have flattened & look younger &c.  Laurens district will be added to Greenville & Pendleton as a congressional district & we young that I must be the candidate, but fortune will not permit me.
       
       I have gained one of my cases in court & one in the Legislaturethe road case in court, Spriggs & Bartons case is in the Legislature but they have not yet decided on it.
       
       I have read a letter from Mr. W. Gilmore Simms.  He says that it is well that he was tempered down to a Benedict before he met with Ann or he should have lost hisand says he will be very happy if his (prescription) of cold water can be of service to her.
       
       I must conclude my dear wife as I am writing without thinking.  There is so much talk going on.  Miss the children, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I sent you this morning by Col. Barton & Mr. Spriggs one box, one trunk & one bundle.  They will be delivered to you Saturday some time in the day by Col. Barton.  Be kind & polite to him in the day for he is a good friend of mine & has very kindly offered to carry any thing I desired to send you.

	The trunk will contain a bundle from Mr. Hayne Wells silver cup which he carried down with one Sears Bible and Pictorial illustrations which he sends as a present to my dear wife which you will value both for the gift & giver.  The trunk also contains three vol[ume]s of Harpers family library also Rowlandsoil & two other boxes or vials.  The contents of the Box are unknown to me.  Mr. B. Carrol told me last night that Miss Seabrook had sent it by him & sent for it this morning to send by Col. Barton.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  I am beginning to be very restless & anxious to see you & the children again.  I trust however you are all doing well.

	I argued Mr. McBees case yesterday & was more than two hours reading my argument in the Court of Errors.  After I had concluded Mr. Burt got up to speak on the same side & Chancellor Job Johnston said he did not wish to hear any further argument on my side & went out of court.  Judge Richardson did the same.  This was quite a compliment to my speech.  Mr. Burt addressed the other judges for about an hour & made a capital argument.  You may tell Mr. McBee that I have very little doubt of our success.  Judges& Richardson are with us.  So is Chancellor Job Johns[t]on and Judge Butler (I think) has been brought over by Burts & my argument.  He gave me a favourable intimation this morning.  Judg[e]s Earle & Wardlaw would not try the case.  Judge Harper is absent.  [Benjamin Faneuil] Dunkin & David Johnson will decide the case.  Judge [John Belton] ONeall is against me.

	I have just left the Court House after examining the law students.  My student Reid was admitted & all the others except one.  

	The election of Senator is exciting great interest.  I think Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger will be elected.  Barnwell Rhett and Col. [Francis Wilkinson] Pickens and Col. Davie are also candidates.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler is not, & is provoked at the notice of him in the Mercury.

	I have not yet bought the Bells nor the gold pencil case for you.  You must write me on that subject.

	I was told by Mr. Middleton last night that it was understood that Col. [Edward] Frost & myself were candidates for the next vacancy on the Bench.  I assured him it was a mistake so far as I was concerned. Tell Will his horse will reach home in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be at home sooner myself than that.  This matter of Spriggs & Col. Barton will give me some trouble in the Legislature.  Col. Barton has offered me a fee of $500 if I can get the lease of the State Road for him for five years & $1000 if I can get it for ten years.  I will try.

	In haste yours truly.  Kiss the dear little children for me & give my love to your mother & sisters, B.F. Perry

Sunday morning, [11 December 1842]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am surprised that in none of your letters you have mentioned the death of my Father.  It is possible that you have not heard of it?  Mr. Duncan informed me that Mr. Foster had just returned from Tugaloo & brought the intelligence.  It was a great shock to me, and although he was very old, yet it grieves me much to think I had not seen him before his death.    When I last saw him in the summer little did I think it was to be a final parting between us in this world.  You know that it was our intention to have visited them last Fall.  How sorry I am that we did not do so.  It would have been a great consolation to me now if we had done so and had shown him our two little children, one of whom he never saw.  My father possessed many sterling virtues which I would not have had him to exchange for all the hollow heartedness & proof of wealth & fame.  He possessed a keen heart & a stern unbending integrity of character which would do honor to any one.  There never lived a more honest or a more just man.  I am sure he never did an intentional injury to any one & I believe he did all the good to his fellow men which lay in his power.  I am sure that there is nothing in his long life to exclude him from happiness in another world.

	I am anxious to be at home once more & see you & the dear little children.  I shall finish the last of my business on Monday in the Legislature.  I have already disposed of my business in Court.  And if God spares me I will leave here on Tuesday morning.  You may expect me at home on Thursday evening unless the weather should be as bad as to prevent my travelling.  It is now raining and I am afraid it may not slow up before Tuesday.

	Tomorrow morning I shall hear all about my cases & I will write again.

Letter 8
Sunday night.  I have just read your letter and still you have heard nothing of my Fathers death.  I think uncle Foster might have sent you word.  It is strange.  Mr. Duncan spoke of it as coming from aunt Foster.
       I shall be at home Thursday evening, but this letter will reach you one day sooner.  My cases are not yet all decided.  The case ofis not yet decided.  I saw Judge Earle this morning who told me all of
       I went to see Judge Huger last night.  He looks very well.  Governor [James Henry] Hammond was inaugurated on Saturday.   There was a great crowd at the inauguration.    Mr. Burt has gone home, & I am now alone in my room.  I hope Judge Huger will be elected Senator.  I have purchased four Bells, combs, pullies, wire &c &c for hanging them & they cost $5.87 ?.  I have got the spoon marked for Anna [last line and signature cut off]

Letter 
 Laurens C. House, 11th October 1843

My dear Liz

	It is now late in the night, and I hope that you, Miss Pamela, and the children dear little creatures all of you, are sweetly reposing in the arms of that leaden eyed deity of whose embraces noor lover is ever jealous, no matter how much they may be sought for and enjoyed.  I have just finished looking overforthcoming volume of Reports, which contain several of my able & learned arguments in the Court of Appeals.  This you may be certain, afforded me no little gratification, and I hope you will not feel your noble self slighted when I tell you for the time being you & the children were not out of my thoughts.  But this letter is an evidence of the quickness with which you are recalled.

	The fore front of the evening I spent in conversation with Judge [Andrew P.] Butler.  He possesses his usual flower of spirit, with humour.  I love him much, although you know he shows no greatfor some of his family, in Greenville.  The Judge is a noble hearted fellow, liberal, generous, high minded & honorable.

	We have very few lawyers in attendance on this court.  Burt is at Edgefield, Henry has gone to Union, General Caldwell to Sumter.  General Whitner heard of the extreme illness of his brother in law Dr. Harrison last night & returned post haste to Anderson, leaving me the solicitors duties to perform, which will consist principally in prosecuting some pugilists for an affray & assault & battery.  This may detour me here longer than I intended to stay.  It is probable that I may not be at home till Friday night.

	Tell Miss Pamela that I have not had the pleasure of meeting either her Father or Brother at this court and I am afraid it will be out of my power to visit Rosemont during my stay here, those which nothing would give me greater pleasure. The letter which she entrusted to my care, was deposited in the Post office early Monday morning & I have no doubt it has gone safely.

	I know you are fond of news, like all of mothersdaughters, I therefore give you an item which I have just heard from Judge Butler.  It is rumored that Col. [Francis W.] Pickens is going to be married to Col. John C. Calhouns daughter, about sixteen or seventeen years old! Dr. [Maximilian] Laborde too is about taking to himself another wife, Miss Carroll, his sister in law!  How lucky these old widowers are [&] how easily they fool the young girls!.  And how complimentary to the memory of their departed wives.  They have found the married state one of so much happiness that they cannot exist out of it!

	If you see Mrs. Coleman tell her that the Cols law suit is not yet tried.  I promised to write him by this mail if it had been tried.  Both Young and myself are in good spirits in regard to the case.  It is one of considerable importance to Col. Coleman.

	I hope you & Miss Pamela are keeping house finely with the help of the children and servants to keep you straight.  When did you have your company?  You have had fine evenings for company.  The weather is delightful, & I hope you have had no further visitations from the toothacheand that Miss Pamela has entirely forgotten that there is any such thing as a nervousat all, or such medicine as calomel.  And I hope the children, little Will, Anna & Frank have all forgotten how to cry!!  In all of theseI am sure you will all join me most heartily (page torn) had forgotten or it should have been (page torn).

	I am not so well myself as I was when I left home.  This I say in truth & in compliment to you & the dinner which your kindness provided me with on the road.  I ate too much.  I stopped on the road & had quite a social meal with my horse!  He is indeed a civilized brute and possesses a much more refined taste than most Kentuckians.  He ate several of the rolls, a large portion of the fruit cake, & smacked his mouth as if it was a most delicious morsel, much better than the food every day given him by his worthless groom.  I offered him a piece of ham, but he turned up his nose at the gross & vulgar food & seemed to say that it should not touch his lips after your pound cake.  I ate too much & have been starving myself ever since, which suits the Tavern here, remarkably well.  There ought to be professorships of cooking.

	But I must now go to bed.  I can imagine to myself the great stillness at home tonight, and your situation tomorrow evening when you receive this letter.  Will & An[n]a will have gone to bedperhaps not yet asleeptalking to each other in the darkFrank taking his supperyou and Miss Pamela seated around the lamps engaged in work.  Is this a true picture?  Yours good night , and good bless you, B.F. Perry

Letter 9
24 October 1843
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight as I expect Col. Town[e]s will leave for Greenville in the morning.

	It is altogether uncertain when I shall be at home.  We are now in the midst of a case of perjury, which excites considerable interest, & will take the greater part of tomorrow.  I think our defendant will be acquitted.  His name is Clardy. You heard of the case some three or four weeks since.

	  I have been employed as assistant consul in a case of slander.  Our client is a very pretty young woman, who sues a neighbor woman for imputing to her a wont of chastity.  We expect to recover heavy damages.  The appearance of the young woman will be much in her favour, I hope, with the Judge & Jury.  Almost everyone would be more disposed to punish another quicker for slandering a pretty woman than an ugly one.

	You need not be surprised if I bring home with me another servanta man about 18 or 20  years oldsmart & good lookingblack colour about the colour of Lynda.   He is uncommonly smartraised in N. Carolinasold for debt & the only negro owned by his masterhis name is Jim.  What think you of the name?  But you we may distinguish by calling one Jamesprice $700 in Rail Road stocks.  However the bargain is not yet completed.

	I have been very uneasy about you & the children ever since I left home.    I hope however that the grippe has passed you by.  Everybody here is unwell with itnever heard of an influenza so general in my life.    I wish you would write me by the return mail how you all are.  I will get your letter Thursday morning.  You can write a few lines after receiving this letter before the mail closes.

	Judge Butler showed me a letter he read on Monday from his little daughter.  She is quite well & writes very well for a child of 9 years old.  The letter was only five lines.

	I saw Mrs. Dr. Haynsworth & her son pass through here in the stage this morning on their way to Greenville to Mrs. EliasEarle.  What a melancholy visit they must pay.   Poor Eliassorry for him but ten times more for his wife. 

	Judge Earle has resigned & requested Judge Butler to inform me of it.  He asked Judge Butler who he thought should take the place.  Judge B. told me, he thought I would make a very good Judge.  I replied that I thanked him, but should not be a candidate.  I feel much flattered to be thought so well of by both Judge ONeall & Judge Butler & I have no doubt Judge Earle would have agreed with them.

	I shall endeavour to be at home on Friday night if not sooner.  If Col. Cox should send to take away Exception to winter her, tell the boy I have changed my mind & will keep her at home.  I am afraid some accident may Happen to her if sent off.

	In great haste as I have to prepare tonight for my speech tomorrow.  Kiss the little children for me.  I do hope they have no more of the grippe.  I am pretty well myself.  I hope the servants are all doing wellespecially Lynda.  Tell her I have seen aunt Emily & that she made enquiry after her.

	Good night my dear Liz.  God bless youyou & the children.  [Signature cut off].

My dear Liz

	The mail closes tomorrow morning, & in the morning I shall be busy, so I must write you tonight.  It is better to hear from me a day too soon than not at all.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  If I do not I shall be sadly disappointed.

	I have made a considerable purchase of Books, Law & miscellaneousand Mr. Carter the Book Seller is so much pleased with my custom that he has made you a handsome present.  I do not know what it is.  But it is a large book of pictures.  He has wrapped it up & put it with my other books.  I thought it would not be decent to ask him what it was.  It looks like it might be Lady Bles[s]ingtons book of Beauties. 

	I have been trying to get a hat for Willie, but they are rather small.  I think you must have given me too large a measure.  I see some beautiful Leghorn hats about one inch smaller than your measure.  Write me whether they will do.  It seems to me that they will.  

	I saw Col. Herndons wife the other daymet her & him in the street.  She is good looking, genteel & rather handsomeand possesses an intelligent face.  Her appearance was simple & modest & I was pleased with the glance I had of her and must go & call on her before I leave.

	I saw General [Waddy] Thompson this morning in Court.  He goes on Thursday next.  I have seen nothing of Mrs. Thompson since I wrote you.  Nor have I seen Taylor or wife & family.

	I do not know when I shall return.  It is very doubtful whether any of my cases will be reached at all this court.  I may stay till the last of next week & all for nothing.

	I have drawn the Bill of Equity for Mr. Watson againstMayrant but Chancellor Harper is sick & they are not likely to have any court at Sumter.  It is very doubtful whether Chancellor Harper will ever be able to take the circuit again.  He is now at the Glenn Springs & has not been able to come here.    Judge ONeall is also unwell, but is in court.  Judge Evans looks very wellenquired particularly after you.  Judge Frost looks well.  I told him I thought his Judicial honours agreed with him.  Judge Butler looks a little rough.

	We have now a fine rain falling and it has been pleasant every day since I have been here.  Mr. Young has gone to Charleston & says he may not be able to pay me.  If he does not [page torn] be short of friends.

	I have bought one ream of Law paperalso a very neat little storing or dressing case with all the appurtenances.

	What presents shall I bring you & the children?  A doll for Annahat for Willa rattle for Frankand Mr. Carters Book of pictures for you?  Will that do?

	I want to see you & the children very much.  How often I think of you in the midst of business and I have been very busy since I have been here!  Mr.has sent me some cases to attend to in the Court of Appeals & says that I shall be well paid if successful.  Leitner has sent me some for Town[e]s.  And Young has left some of his for me.  So I am a sort of general agent.  Good night, your truly, B.F. Perry

	I only have time to write you a word or two.  I have been so much engaged that I could not write you last mail & it is the same thing now.

	You last letter gave me great pleasure, but your last one was sad enough in every way.  Poor Judge Earle.  We had a meeting of the Bar this morning at the request of the Judges.  Col. Preston was called to the chair & I offered some Resolutions which you will see in the papers.  I made a biographical speech to the Court of Appeals on Judge Earle.  Judge Johnson replied.  The speeches will all be published.

	I thought you crazy about Texas from your letter.  [remainder of paragraph interlined, illegible].

	It is possible I may start home in the morning.  If so I will be with you my dear wife  & my dear little children on Thursday night.  God knows it will be a source of great happiness & pleasure.

	I have much to write you but no time to do it in as the mail is closing.

	Kiss the children for me & tell them I have a great many presents for them.  Yours truly & lovingly, B.F, Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d several statements today which satisfy me that I have been elected by a handsome majority.  I hope your fears are now put to rest.

	I shall be at home Friday morning.  And I propose to give our wine party Saturday night.  Can you make the necessary preparations?  Send & get two or three large hams & two large turkeys & some fowls & have some bread baked in preparation.  You may also have pound cakes prepared &c.  The supper may be set in the Piazzathe wine in the dining room.  You will have to borrow wine glasses, tumblers & bottles.  If you can make all these arrangements do so.

	I wish every voter in the village invited.  This can be done perhaps after I return.  The invitations may be extended informally through friends.  Saturday will be the day of the agricultural Fair & I can invite persons from the country.  You must propose to entertain at least one hundred persons.

	If you see people you can request Col. Hoke, Major Jones, Mr. Lister, Mr. Wells and any others to invite the village as they may send them wordinvite every voter in the village and others from the country.  Sam Earle, Elias Earle, Waddle, Poinsett, Dr. Butler &c, Brooks, Williams &c.

	We can make quite a display of cake & wine on the tables in the dining room and have the cold meat & bread & coffee out in the piazza.  

	But my dear wife if you think it will give you too much trouble I will have the wine alone & nothing else.
  
	I think the party had better be on Saturday evening.

	I am truly sorry that Col. Town[e]s is not elected.

	In the district Simpson will beat 500 votes. Col. Fair is elected.

	Yours trulygood night & kiss the children, B.F. Perry

 I am much disappointed in not getting off this evening for home.  Indeed I am afraid I shall not be able to leave before Saturday morning if then.  There is an important [case] which detains me.  I hope to try it tomorrow.  It is one in which I have been employed to assist Mr. Young.

	How comes on our wine party?  If you have not commenced it I shall be glad.  If you have made preparation for it you must go on.  How all the people invited.  Get Lester, Hoke, Jones, Townes, Wells & others to extend the invitation.  Let all the country people be invited, who are in the village on Saturday, at the agricultural meeting.

	I will give another party Tuesday night of court week.

	You must get three or four dozen bottles & fill them with wine, Sherry,  Maderia, & Sicily Modecia.  You are a great manager & can do all these things without me.  But still I would like to be at home to help you.  

	Why did you not write to me?  I read a letter from Hoke & Lester giving me a fell return of the election.  My majority was very gratifying.  But exactly as I had calculated.  You must now admit that I have a good judgement in elections.  I hope you will never worry me again on that subject.

	I am very anxious to get home & meet you & the children.  It appears a long time since I left home.  And an important event has happened.	I read a letter for you from Miss Pamela Cunningham & a note to me, with a box containing a cap.  I will send you the letter by mail. 

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.   Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I must write you whenever I can & therefore will have to write the day before the Stage leaves.  I have a few moments of leisure this morning before breakfast & will avail myself of the opportunity of writing to my wife & children.

	Yesterday morning I saw Col. Martin, who said that Mr. Haynes friends requested him to ask me to write & inform you of the particulars of his death.  I told him I had already done so.  I understand Mr. Haynes was in perfect health when the paralysis came on.  He attempted to raise up a window & his right side became palsied & he fell to the floor.  I hope however your mother has received letters from some of the family.

	I made my debut in the Senate yesterday in a short speech on the contested election between [Andrew] Hibben & [James Smith] Rhett which was well received.  Have you seen the puff [of me] in the Charleston Courier?  It was written by Gilmore Simms.  Judge Frost told me yesterday he was really gratified to see me in the Senate & that my election gave great grattification to my friends in the Courier & that they were many.  Almost everyone I have met has said to me that they were pleased to see me back in the Legislature.  Col. Pickens spoke to me as I went up to qualify & said he was glad to meet methat we had both got to be old men at the same timealluding to our coming into the Senate together.

	Judge [Josiah James] Evans enquired very kindly after you and so did Judge Butler & ONeall.  I gave the letter to Mr. Seabrook & also to Mr. Roper, both of whom enquire very kindly after you all & Anne in particular).  I had a long talk last night with Henry L. Pinckney who also enquired after you all.  He is very much like Frances Hayne.  I could but think of Frances all the time I was talking to him.  His nose, lips, expression of the eyes &c.  I hope she has more principle than her uncle.  But I found Pinckney a very pleasant man.  His views & feelings as expressed on every subject were correct & honorable.  He agreed with me very well in politics & I was rather disposed to like him.  I expect he is a good deal like Walker morallynothing bad about him but without firmness & not a close observer of truth.

	I have taken a seat in the Senate with Mr. [Henry Clinton] Young.  He left his seat & came over to where we could both sit together.  I like Mr. Young very much.    He is a noble fellow & keen hearted man.  I love purity & sincerity & will make those only my friends who possess those qualities.  

	The breakfast hall is now ringing & I must close this very hasty scroll.  I have bought the finest trunk you ever sawa large travelling trunk ($22.00).  It will last us our lives & be a trunk for our children.  I have also had to buy a, pair of gloves and shall have to purchase handkerchiefs.   I left one at home.
 
	You have no idea how much I wish to see you & the children & how glad I shall be to receive a letter from you.  God bless you, B.F.P.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight, as I shall not have an opportunity of doing so, tomorrow before the mail closes.  I sat down to write you a letter two hours since, but persons have been calling at my room ever since, and I now will have time only to write you a very hurried epistle.

	You have no doubt heard of the death of Mr.Hayne.  I was told of his paralysis b Col. Bee who came down with us in the stage from Greenville.  Mr. Henry L. Pinckney informed me tonight that he was dead.  He died yesterday evening.  Mr. Pinckney said it was fortunate that he died as his mind was entirely gone.  His is a sad calamity to his family & to your mother.  It will not become necessary for someone else to take charge of your mothers Bonds &c.  Col., Isaac Hayne was in Charleston in time to see his father die.  You no doubt heard all the particulars.

	Mr. Pinckney informed me that Miss Hayne was married but he said nothing further about the match.

	We had a very pleasant ride down here in the stage[Thomas Edwin] Ware, [Tandy] Walker, [Perry Emory] Duncan, Col. Bee, Mr. Young, Moore & Lester.  We ate up all of your cakes &c and your praises were highly sounded as a good wife in providing for us &c.  The stage broke down with us about ten miles from Columbia.  But we mended it with poles & came on.  In jumping out of the stage I hurt Col. [Barnard] Bee in the breasthe was in great pain for a while but is better.  The Col. apologized for not calling to see us &c.  I found him quite a pleasant gentleman.  We talked a great deal & about a great variety of things and amongst other things his relationship to you &c.

	I have got a fine room at Maybins & Ware, Duncan & Walker have another one all together.  The house is greatly improved & I am to keep the room as cozy as I wish it.  

	It is thought that [William] Aiken will be Governor.

  	I have met a great many of my old friends.  They all seem glad that I am in the Senate.  Mr. [Simeon]Pope & Col. Fair have said that the gentlemen will consider me as in some manner their representative no matter in what district they reside.

	I hope to hear from you Wednesday night & hear you are all well.  I hope the children are well & that you have had no more scares [page torn] too easily frightened.  Kiss the children for me.  What about the [page torn] light procession?

	Mr. Samuel Earle has just been in my room.  He thinks the whole affair foolish.  His election I think pretty certain.  

	I must now bid you good night.  God bless you.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	As I suppose you would like to hear from me although I have nothing to write I will not omit sending a letter by the mail which closes this evening.

	I have written to [O.H.] Wells pretty much all that we have done in the Senate which you will see in the Mountaineer.  But we do comparatively nothing in the Senate to what is done in the other House.  Yesterday we had a short discussion on Col. Pickens Resolutions.    He came to me & asked me if I concurred with him & on being told that I did, he requested me to reply to Col. [Franklin] Moses, which I did in a short speech.  After the Senate adjourned he requested me to ride with him in his carriage & seemed very cordial *& kind.  He & the Rhett party have split & have no kind feelings for each other.

	I rece[ive]d your letter by Wednesdays mail and was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I wish to be present & see you all arranged in the dining room whilst you were writing.  Your description called every thing to my mind very forcibly.    There is no place like home after all, especially when we have a wife & children at that homeeven if the wife does worry her husband occasionally & the children fret him & the servants provoke him.

	By the by how do you come on with the servants.  I hope they all behave themselves & give you no trouble.  The children you can manage.  How are the horses, cows & hogs?  I hope Jim will take care of every thing.  

	I think Mr. Aiken will be elected Governor & I shall vote for him.  I gave the letters to Mr. Seabrook & Roper.  Mr. Roper gave me one for your mother.

	Mr. Sam Earle is not so good at electioneering as some of his competitors & if he does not win he will be hard pushed.  The election between Elford & Butler is very uncertain.  They are beginning to be a little excited with each other.  Ware & Duncan are very well pleased with their situation & I suppose Walker is too, for he keeps pretty generally two thirds drunk.  I was ashamed for him the other night on committee.  But all of the [page torn]  is between us.  You must not [page torn] about it.

	I never saw so many candidates before in my life.  There are at least fifty to carry the votes to Washington.  Barclays father came & spoke to me the other day & enquired after his son.   He looks something like his son & has the scotch accent.

	I have gained an important case old Mr. McElroys case in Equity.  You remember he once took you for my daughter.  I have succeeded entirely for the old man & am proud of it.    Charles Sullivan was on the other side.  

	You see I have made up a letter in some sort of a way so God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F.P.

My dear Wife
	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening.  It gave me more pleasure than any I had rece[ive]d from you.  In it you spoke like yourself & seems to have your reason restored.  Butin several of your last letters you seem to be crazy on the subject of going of going to Miss Cunningham as if a pressing invitation from Pamela was a matter of so much consequence when you might know she expected to return your visit next summer.  Nor is a journey down there at that season of the year any very trifling affair.

	Still I think a little recreation would be of service to you & the children.  I have no doubt you would enjoy a short visit there very much.   And I desire you to go, provided the weather is good.  But do not think of travelling in bad weather.  Select your time, & start some day when the weather is settled.  You can go Thursday or Friday if you see proper. Jim can return home & bring down my Buggy.  I shall be at Laurens Court House Sunday 22nd in the morning. It may be that the Legislature will adjourn before that day, or rather so that I may be there sooner.  But this is uncertain.  We will fix on that day.  You can make Jim return by that time.  I do not wish to stay longer than three days at Cunninghams, nor will I.  If you go down there it will be out of the question for you to leave Cunninghams  before I come for you.  They will not let you.

	The election for governor is over.  Aiken is elected after five lotterys.  He gave a treat this evening after his electionbut it was not equal to yours.

       I have been writing to a great many of my constituents, some of whom have been hereMajor Berry, Col. Brockman, Major Goodlett, Blassingham, Whitten, Col. Boston, Dr. Crook, Dr. Irvine, Alleier Barrett & others.  I have sent documents to a good many--so you see I am following your advice.
       
       	I met Governor Richardson the other day who said to me he did not know I was old enough to be in the Senate.  Every one compliments me on my appearanceso I think I must be getting younger. 
       
       Mr. Wells has not sent one of my letters or if he did he has bot published it.  The letter containing the second & third days proceedings of the Legislature in which I mentioned Col. Maybins Hotel &c.
       
       I was disappointed in sending my trunk by last stage as it was full & Moore did not go up in the stage.  I hope you have seen Mr. & Mrs. Mauldin & Mr. & Mrs. [page torn] them whilst here.
       
       I am glad to hear Will becomes better than hew did.  I have not yet purchased the presents.
       
       Whenever I look sat Col. McWillie I am reminded of Frank.  They look very much alike. 
       
       Col. Ware, Duncan & Walker are all well.  I have no further news
        	     
	God bless you & the children.  Good night, B.F. Perry

My dear Wife

	I have just seen Mr. Burt who informs me that he will go up in the Greenville stage tomorrow morning.  This gives me an opportunity of writing you again.  I put a letter in the Post office for you this morning.  Since that time the Legislature have determined to adjourn Wednesday the 18th so I shall be at Laurens C. House Friday morning the 20th.  If you go down to Cunninghams you must make arrangements to send for me on that day to Laurens C. House.

	I do not believe that we shall be able to take Christmas dinner with Mr. Cunningham.  It will be too long for me to stay.  We can spend a day or two there after I arrive & then come on home.  This will do just as well as to spend Christmas with them.  

	You had better start down the day after you receive this letterIf the weather be good.  But if the weather is bad do not go at all.  

	I understand you have scarlet fever in the village.  Mrs. Walker writes to her dearly beloved that their son has had it very badly.  Be careful about the children catching it.    And take good care of them on the road.

	I have been in court today & have gained Mr. Fields casealso on another from Pickens in which two men were convicted of hog stealing.  My other cases not yet decided.  This case of Mr. Fields will be worth $100 more to me by a mistrial.

	I now have to go down to thew State House to attend the committee on Scriviner & Books of which I am chairman so I must close this letter.

	In regard to your visit do as you please.  Go when you please but do not travel in bad weather.

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter written Sunday night.  Major Butler goes up to Greenville in the morning & has promised to carry this letter for me.  I have therefore deferred writing to you till I could answer your letter by tonights mail.

	I am glad to hear you & the children are all well and the servants and animals are all getting on well.  You have before this time received my permission to go to Mr. Cunninghamsso you are well pleased on that subject.  But really I think you are going to make them a visitation with your children, servants & horses.  You had better send Jim with one of the horses back & when he returns for you he can drive my horse and buggy and lead the horse behind the buggy. 
 
	I have no doubt you will be well pleased at the election of Butler over Elford.  They are both deserving the office.

	I will send Susans watch by Butler.  He did not let me know he was going until this evening & I have had no opportunity of sending anything.  The box I brought down I sent to Charleston by Elford who promised to carry it to Mrs. Hayne.  Elford told me that he & Spark are second cousins.

	I saw Col. [Lawrence M.] Keitt this evening & he enquired very kindly after cousin Susan & her daughter.  Mrs. Keitt is with him.  They are on a visit to her niece.  Chancellor Harper enquired very kindly after Anne the other day.

	I can not give you any more particulars than I have as to the death of Mr. Hayne.  Col. Taylor has gone down.  I suppose his family were all present.  His death is indeed a loss to his family & also to your mother.  It would be proper for your mother about her Bonds &c in his hands.  If it is necessary I will go to Charleston for her.  She must write to me.  

	Tomorrow I am to make my speech on giving the election of Electors to the people.  I have already spoken several times & I think I did pretty well.  I feel some anxiety about my speech tomorrow.  There is very little to do in the Senatenot one half that is done in the House nor is there one half of the speaking.

	A resolution was introduced today for the Legislature to adjourn on Monday the 16th.  This will interfere with our spending Christmas at Cunninghams.  But I do not think the resolution will be agreed [on].  I have no idea that they will adjourn before Friday the 20th.

	I will send you the gift for 1845 by Butler containing Simms Greenville Story.  Moore & Lester will return to Greenville next Sunday night and I will send my old trunk up by them with some books in it &c.  They are to be examined tomorrow.

	You need not talk to me about home.  There is no place in the world so sweet as home with your wife & children.  And how I should like to be there tonight.  God bless youkiss the children.  I have a sore throat & cold.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Wife

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter, & have not time to write much in reply.

	All day I have been engaged in the Court of Appeals.  All of my cases are soon disposed of except one which I attend to for Mr. Dean.  The result of them I know not.

	Yesterday was a day of great excitement in both Houses.    The members seemed to be crazy on the subject of the Massachusetts mission.  The House of Representatives passed a Resolution expelling Mr. [Samuel] Hoar, with but one dissenting vote (Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger).  To the Senate your husband was thew only man who opposed them.  I stood alone against the whole Senate.  And I made a most exciting speech.  They were a great many members who thought with me, but had not the boldness to act with me.  The vote has given Col. Memminger & myself quite a distinction, a minority of one.
  
	Mr. & Mrs. Roberts & Mr. & Mrs. Mauldin are here & will leave in the morning.  I will send this letter by them.  I suppose you will be gone to Mr. Cunninghams before I write to you again.  I hope you will take good care of yourself, the children & make Jim take care if the Horses.  When he carries you down he can return to Greenville & wait till the day before Christmasthen go back to Cunninghams & drive down mybuggy.  

	If I can I will get Moore to take my old trunk up to Greenville with him.  But there is such a crowd going up that I am afraid he can not do so.

	Frank Burt has beaten Sam Earle for Treasurer.  Col. Ancrum has been elected Super Intendent of Public Works.  The Governors election comes on tomorrow.  Aikens chance is the best.

	You must write me as soon as you arrive at Mr. Cunninghams.  I shall feel very anxious to hear from you. 

	I have just had a visit from old George.  He is cooking at Clarks Hotel.  Johns son Thomas also paid me a visit yesterday & enquired after his father.  Thomas appears to be a very well disposed boy & looks pretty well.  You can tell John.

	I have written you so often that I have not much to write about.  But will have more to tell you when we meet which will be the Sunday before Christmas at the farthest.

	God bless you & the dear little children.  Kiss them all for me.  How I should like to see them.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday morning informing me of yourto me been veryto meet me, & spend the Christmas with the family, and as you seem so anxious about going, I have no objections.  But I should enjoy myself more to meet you & the children at home.  I never spend my time very pleasantly at Mr. Cunninghams for I am always confined too much to the House.  There is such a sameness y=to the days.  They are all alikeno new placesnew thingsnew faces.

	I have no doubt you would find a change & a journey pleasant and agreeable you may therefore go down there as soon as you please & stay till I arrive.  But I cannot stay more than one or two days.  We will take Christmas dinner with them & start home the next day or the day after.  This is the condition on which we go [page torn] not act there as you did once before & refused to come home when I desired you.    I felt mortified & degraded then, & actually cried in secret until my heart almost broke.    It has ever since made me feel unpleasant when I thought of it.  And I did, at that time, vow it should be the last time I would ever set my foot in the House.    For they were altogether too& urgent about our stay.

	Before you go down you must make Jim haul wood and see that there is plenty of shucks, fodder & corn for the cattle.  He will know how to procure it of uncle Feaster.  Do not start in bad weather.  If you go to Goldsmiths the first day you had better start about one oclock.  The next day you must make an early start for it is a long days drive.  Do not let Jim drive too fast.

	If the weather is suitable I wish the hogs killed before you go.  They are eating too much corn.  Have them killed and the meat all taken care of.  

	[page torn] I had no objection to your lending Yancey my horse & buggy, but you should have written to me about it.  Never keep anything concealed from your husband.  You are so much in the habit of keeping me in ignorance of everything at home when I am absent, that I am loosing confidence in your letters.  When I receive a letter, & have no assurance that you are all wellthat nothing has happened.  The most extraordinary, or the most serious matters may have occurred & yet you do not write about them.  The death of my father two years since, you kept from me.  Such conduct is wrong & it destroys the interest I take in the reception off your letters.

	If you go to Mr. Cunninghams you must send the carriage to Laurens C. House for me.  I shall probably be at Laurens C.H.  Sunday, the 22nd of December.  I will then stay at Cunninghams, Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday.  Christmas falls on Wednesday & we will start home Thursday morning.  Longer I cannot stay.    You had better start down a week or ten days before or as soon as you please.  I hope to hear from you again tonight, & if so, I will write you on [page torn] should anything occur.

	P.S. I have just seen your letter by Butler Thompson and your anxiety about going to Mr. Cunninghams seems to increase & I am afraid you will be off before you receive this letter.   I am very willing you should do as you please about the matter.  If you wish to go you can do so.    But I do not think you should do down so soon as you speak of doing.  It would hardly be worthwhile to send Jim home.  It would look too much like you were going to take up your board with them.  I am willing for you to pay them a visit, but let it be a visit.  If you start down there on Monday the 16thI am sure it will be soon enough.  And you too will get tired of your stay.  I dont think you should manifest such an anxiety to stay so long from your home, your mother & sisters & that to a visit with persons not at all related to us.  As to Pamelas pressing invitations you know they are given to everyone.  And you must remember too that you have to return the compliment & ask Pamela to stay with you next summer.  Unless you do so, it would be mean to go there.

	As to my coming home, & going down to Cunninghams after you that is out of the question.  I will call there for you on my way up from, Columbia.

	I have taken yup so much space in writing about your visit that I have not room enough to write about other matters.  And I have been thinking so much about it that other matters have gone from my memory.

	I have just read to torch light procession in the Mountaineer.  It is quite magnificent.  

	I dined with Dr. Gibbes the other day & was much pleased with the entertainment.  I have spoken of his collection of minerals paintings & curiousities in a letter to the Mountaineer.

	In the Temperance Advocate you will see a very handsome compliment paid my address.  I have bought some few books & amongst them the Gift for 1845 containing Simms story about Greenville.  I had to buy it.

	I am glad to hear you are getting on well with all the servants & children.  But in your last two letters you seem to have forgotten about the children.  

	But it is late in the night & I must close this letter.  Kiss the children for me & believe me your affectional husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now half after ten oclock in the night & I have just finished my pleadings in threecases of slander which are to be tried here this week.

	I write you a line to inform you that I may not be at home till the latter part of the week.  I have been employed today in the management of an important case & we are to argue it tomorrowYoung & myself on one side and Irby & Sullivan on the other.  My fee will be $100.

	I have been employed in four other cases of great importance.  Three of them will probably be tried this court & the fourth next court.  I have also another case here in which I was employed last court & a case of some importance.  It will likewise be tried this week.

	You perceive I am doing well from home.  My practice here is valuable to me.  

	I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  But suppose I hope you are all better.  If the children become worse you must write to me & I will return immediately.  

	Judge Wardlaw is presiding & I find him pleasant & agreeable.  I have not seen or heard from Mr. Cunningham.

	As soon as I can possibly leave here I will but that is very uncertain.

My dear Liz

	I have just seen the Post Master & request to him to let me mail a letter although the hour has expired.  I have therefore but a few moments to write you in.

	You did not write me by the last mail, but Col. Butler &informed me that you were all well.  You might have written by them.  But I suppose you had nothing very particular to write.  They informed me of the very sudden death of Mrs. Chick.

	From present appearances we shall not be able to reach the cases at all from the Western circuit, & if so you may look for me at home Friday night.  I have to stay to Wednesday as I am on the committee to examine Students on that day.  We shall then determine whether it is worth while for us to stay or not any longer.  The Court of Errors will occupy two weeks & the remainder of the month will be covered with the Southern & Middle circuits.  My business in the Court of Errors is through with.

	I have purchased a pair of candlesticks for chamber use price $4.00.  My other purchases you are informed of & you did not desire anything in your last letter.  By the by your letter was one of great interestgave me much pleasure.  A very different letter from some which you were accustomed to write me last winter & spring.  Your troubles now on War & your Box.  I suppose Butler Thompson has relieved before his time & relieved you of the latter troublein regard to the first you need be under no dread.

	I wrote Wells a long letter for the Mountaineer yesterday & went to church which is the reason I did not write youthat I had nothing to write about.

	I saw Dr. Davis last week, who said he wished me to ride out some evening & see him.  I have not seen Taylor or any of his family.

	The lawyers from the county are now coming in.  Col. Fair came down this morning.  Butler &go to Charleston in the morning & will return the last of the week.  

	I would give a great deal to see you & the children.  It would never do for me to be a member of Congress.  I should find it impossible to stay at Washington thew whole winter unless you & the children were with me.

	We have had a fine rain, & I was truly glad to hear you had rain in Greenville.  The rain is now falling & I must conclude my letter & send it to the Post office or it will not reach Greenville before I do myself.  

	Kiss the children for me & tell them I will bring them all something.  

       Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line by General Thompson & to thank you for your long letter.  Willie is quite well.  His grand mother was delighted to see him & so were all his relations especially Fosters wife & family.  He has been very much admired by all who have seen him.  His only fault is that he will stick to me too closely.

	I shall probably be at home tomorrow evening (Saturday).  One of my cases has been postponed & the other we are trying today.

	You did not write me how much you subscribed to the Church.  I hope not much.  There is no necessity for a new church at all, & I regard the whole project untimely.  But more of this when I return.  

	 We have had a fine rain & I hope it extended to Greenville.

	In quite haste yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have sat down to thank you for your very acceptable letter this evening by Dr. Palmer.  It  contains a great deal of news & gave me great satisfaction.  When from home I am always anxious to know how you & the children are doing & nothing gives me more pleasure than such information.

	I had the pleasure as you requested in your letter of being polite to Mrs. Palmer.  I had her invited to sit with the Judge & lawyers.  She sat next to me at the table & we had considerable talk.  The Dr. seemed quite sociable also.  Mrs. Palmer told of yours & your mothers cake &c.  The company is all gone from the Mansion House.  I am in court & did not see the Middletons as they passed down on the stage.

	Judge [Edward] Frost came up in the stage, & lost between Newberry & this place his trunk with all of his clothes & $150.00 in cash.  The trunk dropped off the stage.  He sent back for it, but can hear nothing of it.  Someone has picked it up & appropriated it leaving the Judge without a clean shirt & nothing but a very shabby suit of clothes, on his back.  I lent him my razor & offered him a shirt, but he procured one from the store & has a shirt washed every day.  He says he will make Capt. Ward pay for his loss.  The straps of the leather boot containing his trunk were not buckled.  He is a very pleasant agreeable gentleman & a pretty good Judge.

	I recd a short letter from Miss Pamela this morning with a package of books from her Greenville subscribers and amongst them is Mrs. Poinsett.  You say Mrs. P is not a subscriber.  I have a book for her anyhow.  Pamela writes from Abbeville C.H., is still very feeble, sends her love to you  & the children, and requests you to copy from my C Journal all the corrections she made with a few into the copies sent her, Greenville, wishes.  The Indictment against me canfor whipping young Bowen is going on & will be tried next Court.

	I recd a letter today from Sam Earle on the subject of the Rail Road &c.  The people do not seem to take much interest in the matter here.  They are all absorbed in the Com[mittee] meetings &c.

	None of my cases here have been tried yet & I shall be here all the week.  General [Waddy] Thompson told me as we came down that Butler & Miss Jones were going to be married..  He said it was not what could be called an advantageous match, but it was one he could not object to.

	I have exchanged my gold chain for another one.  It broke, & I found all the links were& worn out.  I have a very beautiful one in exchange, something like yours & I gave $4 for boot.  I hope you have recd & taken care of my plows & straw cutter.  As President of the agricultural society I shall have the honor of introducing the first such soil plan in Greenville District & also the first plan for other description.  I bought them of Robe to use & show at the agricultural meetings.  F Robe has made a present of a valuable book on agricultural chemistry by Johnston.  [sentence interlined, illegible].  

	Tell the servants to gather the peas & clear as much as possible before I get home.  Thank Will for his letter.  General Thompson saw himon Saturday & says he is a born  Democrat.  Tell Anna & Frank howdy & kiss them all.  Miss Crawfords expression is in character & next time let her invitation be delayed still longer.  The news from Col. Hoke is good.  I am grateful to you for your letter.  Good night near ten oclock.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	As I shall not be able to return home before Sunday I will write you a few lines.  Nothing yet has been done in my cases & I am very tired of waiting. My great apprehension is that after staying all the week I shall not be able to reach them.  I have three very important slander cases & the great Will case, all ready for trial.

	I saw Mr. & Mrs. Allston & Mrs. Gadsden last night.  They spoke kindly of you & your kindness to them, praised Will &c.  I see a good many persons passing down the country.  The dancing master F went on this morning.

        Robe has permitted me to take a Box of seeds & wheat of an extraordinary character which he ordered from the north.  I will now plant wheat this Fall which he did not intend doing.  But which you wished me to do.  The grass seeds I am looking in getting. I have a great deal of agricultural talk with the Judge [Frost] &  Robe and amazed with Robe.  He says he likes to talk with him & picks up a great deal of information from him. [sentence interlined, illegible] It is now after eleven oclock.

	It would give me great pleasure if I was at home with you & the children.  My Farm is now another inducement to be at home.  My wife, my children, my office & my Farm are all great attractions for me, [words interlined, illegible] The office the least of all  & yet the most profitable.

	I hope John is well so that I can put Charles to work when I return.

	It is so late in the night I must conclude.  In the morning if I have time I will write a note to Will & Anna & Frank.  Yours truly & affectionately, good night, B.F. Perry

	I was very much pleased to receive your letter.  It shows that you think of and love your Papa although he is absent.  The next time you write you must ask Mama to print the words & let you fill them up.  This will make your letter more interesting.  

	You must learn fast & keep ahead whilst I am from home.  Never let any of the little boys out spell you.  I wish to see you a great man some day.  So you must love your Book & school.  You must also try to be a good Boy and mind what Mama says.  Love Anna & Frank and be kind to the little boys at schoolnever quarrel or fight.

	If you do these things Papa & Mama will love you & everybody will be good to you & you will grow up to be a great good man.

My dear Liz

	I arrived here this evening after a fatiguing passage on the Stage & have nothing of interest to write you.  I am afraid if I have to postpone writing till tomorrow, I shall not have time.  As yet I have seen very few persons.  But as I know you will be glad to receive a line from me saying I am well & have arrived safely, I will write you the evening.

	We had a stage fullElias Earle, Speen, Ware, Dr. Evans & Morris from Anderson.  Col. Ware joins us at Mr. Neelys.  He & Earle had provisions with them.  We all made a sumptuous dinner yesterday & today.  Theat Newberry House has improved very much.  By the bye Judge Frost has heard off his trunk.  Some negroes of a man named Hole found it in the road & secreted it.  They burnt the trunk & books,a portion of the money, dressed themselves in the Judges clothes & gave his silk gown to a negro woman to ware.  A portion only of the money has been recovered & the gold watch & his new suit of clothes.

	Mr. John Maxwell is a candidate for Super Intendent of Public Works, which will interfere most seriously with Elias Earles chance of success.  Their friends are trying to persuade them not to both run.  Mr. Maxwell is a rich man need the office.  But if he runs he will prove a very formidable competition.  

	The feeling in favor of the railroad is strong from Greenvillein this place and the feeling in Charleston.  Other portions of the state is friendly & favorable.  I   think a charter will be obtained this session, but I am afraid the Legislature will not take stock in the Road.

	Duncan & McBee were just ahead of us, & are at the House (Maybins).  I suppose Luther & Susan will be married the day after you receive this letter,  You are now no doubt busy in arranging for the wedding & hardly have time to read my letter so I will stop and write you a longer one next mail.

	Tell Jim to kill the hogs as soon as the weather turns cold.  We had rain Saturday night.  Do not leave the children alone.  I dreamed about it last night.  Tell Willie to learn fast & I will bring him a pretty knifeAnna to be good & she shall have a presentand Frank must talk to be rewarded.

	God bless you my dear wife.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Col. Martin & Col. Taylor enquired where you were.  They had understood you were coming down with me.  Mrs. Martin is not well nor is Mrs. Taylor well.

	I told Judge Butler that Susan was to be married.  He said perhaps his advice had some influence on her.  

	The weather is cold today & clear (Monday).

	I resented the Rail Road Petitions & they were favorably rece[ive]d.

	In haste yours, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I read your letter this evening & was extremely glad to hear you were all well.  If your letters contain nothing else they will nevertheless be read & read with great pleasure.  It would be gratifying to me if I could now take a peep at home & see you & the children.  Tell Will I have been looking at some knives for him & he must write me a postscript to some of your letters.  Col. Ancrum has his little son with him, who is about Wills size & make with hair exactly like Will.  With his back to me I thought of him.  But his face is not so intelligent & manly.

	I carried your watch & pencil to the jeweler this morning & he is to repair them.  I saw some beautiful striped silk dresses today.  Would you like one.  Your shoes I gave to Dr. Davis & he is to exhibit them tomorrow night at the Agricultural meeting.  Mr. Poinsett makes his speech there in the State House.  I saw him yesterday in the Senate for a few moments.  There was a meeting last night of the State Agricultural SocietyJudge ONeall & Butler made speeches.

	In the Legislature not much has yet been done.  We elected Mr. Calhoun today in the place of Judge Huger.  No other election takes place.  Major Earle seems in good spirits.  There are about twenty candidates for Super Intendent.  We have very strong electioneering for Comptroller General.    I have made up my mind to vote for Col. Wigfall.

	The speech I made last Winter on the election of Electors has been put in circulation today amongst the members by someone & I have been complimented by some of the members for it.    Some change will now have to be made on that subject.  I do not know whether my speech has been reprinted or whether the old edition has been put forth by the Chronicle.

	The Rail Road meeting with favour from all quarters.  I have been very busy for two days past in looking up law in McBees case about the gold mine.  Chancellor Johnson wason one point.  I have now furnished him with law sufficient on that point & he will decide in my favour.

	Tomorrow Susan is married & before this reaches you there will be another member added to your mothers family.  When I told Judge Butler of the wedding he enquired if Luther could work.  I told him I rather thought not.  He said that was candid in me.  But if he will be prudent, his father can give him enough to support him through life. [page torn] he must be prudent & Susan alsootherwise in a few years they may sped all he has & be left penniless without the hope of making anything.  

	I have nothing further to write you about Wells.  Duncan has refused to sign the petition 7 I think none the better of him for it.

	I am writing in a great hurry & Col. Ware is waiting to take my letter to the Post office.

	Kiss the children & give my congratulations to McBee & Susan.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from dining at Dr. [Robert Wilson] Gibb[e]s in company with Mr. Poinsett, the Governor, Judge Butler. Chancellor Dunkin, [Chancellor] Johnson, Mr. Barnwell, Seabrook, Col. Pickens, Col. Allston, Col. Preston &c.  The stage leaves in the morning & I must write tonight or you will not have the pleasure of hearing from me.  The other evening I went with Major [James Edward] Henry to the Post office & sent your letter.  He enquired how often we write to each other & seemed astonished.  He writes once in two weeks.  I have just sent to the office for letters now & hope to hear from you before I have finished writing.  I spent a very pleasant & agreeable evening at Dr. Gibbes & drank some most excellent wine.

	Last night Mr. Poinsett made his Agricultural speech before a crowded House of Ladies & gentlemen.  I met Mrs. Poinsett therealso Miss Blanding by whom I was seated during the evening.  She enquired after you with interest & agreeably surprised when I told her Susan was to be married that evening.  She called McBee her old friend Luther.    She seems quite a pleasant young Lady.  Our friend Gilmore Sim[m]s made a most flowery speech complimenting the Ladies & some domestic wine which a Miss Roberts presented to the society.  After he had concluded I observed to the meeting that my fiend from Barnwell had omitted one thing one thing He should have offered his wine to the ladies after he finishedhis speech.  Wherefore he came forward & did so to the amusement of the meeting.    Your shoes were greatly admired by Miss Blanding & other ladies who examined them in my presence.  Dr. Gibbes reported on them & this morning he carried them to have made up. 

	 Today I have been all day in the court of Appeals arguing a case of Mr. Kilgores.  In the House of Representatives they had some speaking on Mr. Calhouns course at the Memphis convention.  The members appeared like Calhouns slaves and refused to assert their opinions.

	The boy has just returned from the Post office & brings no letters from you which is a great disappointment but I suppose you were so busied about the wedding that you had not time to write.  I wish I could have been at it.  Susan is, I hope, happy, as she should be & deserves to be.  I think I heard someone say today that General [Milledge L.] Bonham was married.  Mr. Cox was here today on his return from the north poor fellowlooks rather sad.  He goes up in the stage in the morning.  He left Miss Skinner behind him.

	I hope to see, next week, someone from Greenville which would give me great pleasure.  You said so much in your last letter about my writing about home, that I will say nothing on the subject.   Still I should like to be there & see you & the children & Will I wish he was here with me.  Kiss Anna & Frank.

	The weather is cold.  I hope the meat is doing well.  You must write me everything about the Farm, the children &c.

	I must now bid you good night.  Give my congratulations to Susan & McBee.  Yor husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter by Sundays mail informing me that Susan was married Sunday night.  Mr. Elford came & brought me the wedding cake.  I have distributed a portion of it amongst the Greenville delegation.  The piece for Pinckney McBee has been handed to him.  I informed him we had become a kin to each other since we left home.  I saw Col. Martin this morning in the Senate & informed him that I had a piece of cake for him.  Taylor.  He said he would send for it.  Mrs. Martin is now at Taylors.  She arrived here Saturday evening.  I promised to go & see her.  Martin had his little son with him in church on Sunday.  But I could not see him well. 

	General Thompson and Butler Thompson are at the House.  They came Sunday evening.  Butler talks very freely about his marriage & says he has it so arranged that I shall be at home when it takes place.  General [Milledge Luke] Bonham & his bride are in Columbia.  I saw them today at the college commencement.  They looked very happy.  There was another bride sitting by Mrs. Bonham.  Mrs. Randal, formerly Miss Lipscomb, now married to Mrs. Pearsons cousin of Chester or Fairfield.

	Ben Yancey & his sister are in Columbia but I have not seen them.  I saw John Cunningham today.  He says Pamela is much worse than she used to be though better than she was in the summer.  He speaks of her despondingly.  Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham are well.

	I have very little to write you about the Legislature.  We have done very little yet, so there has been a motion to adjourn on the 12th next Friday week.  If you dont mind I shall get home to your Party.  You wrote me to let you know the price of fruits.  They are moderate in price.  The oranges are not good.  The pineapples are small & 29 cts by retail.  The grapes are very delicious & packed up in little kegs.  If you will direct me I will make a purchase for you, & send them up in the stage.

	In spite of your advice to the contrary I am becoming homesick & would like very much to be with you & the children tonight.  There is no place to me like home.  I very often go from home most cheerfully that I soon wish to return.  The novelty & excitement of new scenes soon cease to interest me.  My wife & children never.  It is true they sometimes interest me a little too much, but I never get tired of them as I do of everything else in this world.  I pitty from the bottom of my heart, him who has no wife & children.  Here is Col. Ashe sick & surrounded by the worlds wealth & luxury but no wife or children.  He seems to be without aim, object or interest.

       I am glad you think yourself so happily married as to wish Susan the same degree of happiness.  It is true we both have everything to make us happy.  It has myfallen to the lot of two persons husband & wife to have lessto their happiness.  We enjoy uninterrupted health.  We have been prosperous, living well, surrounded by & enjoying all the comforts of life, accumulating property notwithstanding our extravagance, blessed with uncommon children, for I see none equal to them.  And our love for & confidence in each other is all that husband & wife could wish or desire.  I hope Susan will be equally happy.  How do they seem since their marriage?  How does Ann like it?  What does your mother think?  Write me all about them.  I have some curiosity to see them together.
       
       In regard to March hope you are mistaken.  Jim has made him work hard at very hard work splitting rails, & he is not accustomed to it & is young & slender.  There is a great deal of comeout
 In March when he fattens & fills up.

	Write me whether my oats are sown. Any fence made, how many rails made.  How the hogs I bought of Watson do.  This information you can get from Jim.

	Col. Martin has just come in, got his cake & brought me a Bundle for Susan B. McColl, a small bundle like silk or calico.

	I must conclude.  I went to the Episcopal church last Sunday.  

	You will see the political news from me in the Mountaineer Friday morning.

	The Governor has given no answer yet about Wells.

       Tell Willy I have seen some very pretty knives.  Tell Anna she must tell me what to purchase for her.  Tell Frank to say what he wants.  I wish I had Will with me.  Col. DeTreville has his little son with him.  We walked back from the college together.  He says he carries his son to let him see & learn things.  He gains practical information of more value than lessons from books.  Write me what you want.  Your truly, B.F. Perry

	I have just finished writing questions for the Students in Equity, who are to be examined tomorrow & I am one of the committee.  It is now eight oclock & I have to put the letter in the Post office tonight.  The preparation of questions has given me a good deal of trouble, & I did not know of my appointment till this morning.  There are four members of the Legislature and one member of Congress applying for admission in Equity.  

	I have just received your letter of Sunday night &the Post letter also.  It had been lost in the Bar Room.  Hereafter I shall take your advice & go to the office myself.  Your letter advising me not to purchase any fruits for you has come too late.  This morning I started to you in Bensons wagon one hundred oranges, six coconuts, 1 dozen plantains, 1 doz Bananas, 1 keg of Grapes 26 pounds, delicious grapes. 50 cents worth of Almons  some ofnuts, some of Brazile nuts, 1 drum of Smyrna figs, 5 lbs of candy, 12 pineapples. All costing $16.85 cts.  They are all in one Box, except the grapes, which are in a keg & have also sent a large Box of Books, law books which I could not well do without.  I have paid for them in past by an order on a client in Charleston.  The balance I pay next Winter.  Jesse R. Gary owed me $100 for a case at Laurens.  The Books cost me $315.00 & cheap at that price.  I bought them of Mr. Carter & Allen.  I know you will be surprised but they are books I have long wanted & could not do well without.  All that I have, & all that I ever expect to make, have been & will be the product of Books.  My Books have been profitable & therefore I must cherish my Library.  I will pay for their balance $215 in some fees which I shall make pretty easily. Take good care of them & dont let the Box get wet before you put it in the house.  

	You will receive the Boxes & key Tuesday next.  Benson, Wade & Lark were all down here hauling Gibbs property down.  Benson owes me & I have got him to take back the 2 Boxes & key.  Elias Earle has also sent up some Fruits and Speers sent up a Box full by some wagons.

	Tell Col. Coleman that the Rail Road Bill has been reported & read once in the Senate.

	I introduced some Resolutions today in the Senate on the subject of General Jackson, which I think are beautifully drawn.  They have been ordered to be printed & I will send you a copy.

	I have not time to write you more at present.  Kiss the children.  Give my respects to your mother & Susan & Ann & McBee.  I hope they are all happy.  Write me all about them.  The weather is cold & bad.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received yours & Willies letter & was very glad to hear from you and especially pleased at Wilies first intelligible letter to me.  Tell Willie I have not time to write this mail, but will by the next.  Indeed all of my letters to you have been written in great haste because I always wait to receive your letter before writing.  And I am so busy here that I hardly have time to do anything.  

	Last night the Governor gave a good Ball, but I had been engaged in court all day, & had to meet a committee at night, & did not go  I felt tired and went to bed about the time the others went to the Ball (10 0clock).  I had to be in court all day today, & knew that I should not feel well if I went to the Governors.

	The courts are now trying my cases & will be at it next Monday & Tuesday.  Today the law students were examined & all admitted (26), Pinckney McBee among them.  The Equity students were admitted yesterday & they all complimented me very much for my courtesy & kindness to them in my examination of them.  Butler Thompson was admitted in Equity & Elford.  

	I have the pleasure of seeing Col. Martins two little sons this morning.  They came with him to the State House.  The oldest is a good looking boy but not equal to our Willie.  In fact I have never seen three children so smart looking as ours.  This I say independent of the influence and.  Martins second Boy would be good looking but for his blemish in the eye.  He has five children.  What a charge for a poor man to have.  I must go & see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.

	I saw your cousin Alston Hayne the other day & he promised to come & see me but has not.  I saw him in the Senate chamber.

	The election of Superintendent of Public Works comes on tomorrow at one oclock.  Mr. [Elias] Earle will soon know his fate.  He seemed pleased at your wish for his success.

	Pinckney McBee & B. Thompson start home tomorrow morning but will go through Edgefield & not reach Greenville before Thursday.  General Thompson will start home the firrst of next week.  Elford has gone to Charleston.  Tom Butler & Rowland have not reached here yet.

	My box of fruits & keg of grapes will reach you in time for your party.  But the weather is so cold you will have an unpleasant time.  Be careful about fire.  Col. F. Wardlaw got his House burnt up last week, by the rolling down of a chunk of wood on the floor.  Have the fire attended to every night & be careful about the children falling into the fire.

	How I should like to gear Franks sweet voice, even his cry.  Tell him to learn fast to talk  Tell Amma I must bring her a frock  Tell Will I will speak to Col. Summer about the dog and bring him a knife.

	The Legislature adjourns next Monday week.  I will be at home on Wednesday 17thwhen it will give me pleasure to see you & the children once more.

	I saw the Governor this morning.  He requests an interview with me & the other members of the delegation tomorrow, on the subject of Wells pardon.  So much has been said about his pardoning every body, that he has become extremely cautious.  I trhink however he will pardon him.  

	The Rail Road is going on finely.  The state will take two fifths of the stock.  

	I have not yet even seen to know[word obscured] Mr. Heyward.  If I can make it convenient I will seek his acquaintance.  But I see very little of the members of the House who do not board at Maybins.  

	The death of Mr. Cleveland was expected.  How many deaths happen in Greenville whilst I am absent.  Col. Dawkins was enquiring about Mr. Cleveland this morning.  I have not yet seen his wife.

	I must now conclude my letter as my paper is pretty well filled up & my topics exhausted, & it is late in the evening & I must put this letter in the office tonight.  

	Col. ware & Duncan & myself all recd letters this evening from our better halves.  Whether Walker did or not I do not know.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

       I have only time to thank you for your letter Sunday evening.  I obedience to your advice I have written a long letter for the Mountaineer & therefore have no time to write you.  You see what you get by your advice.  

	I have been all day today in the court of Appeals until 3 oclock.  Then I went to the Senate & staid there till five.  I have gained Kilgores case in the Court of Appeals & lost one I gained at Laurens.  The other cases have not yet come on.

	I hope you will receive tomorrow the box of fruits sent you, & that it will be in time for your party.  The night you wrote me, you must have read my letter informing you that the fruit was sent.

	You ask about my clothes.  They fit remarkably well.    But I have done so much writing in them that I am afraid of wearing them out.

	Mr. Elias Earle has just called & says he will go up in the morning.  Col. Ancrum was elected today.  But for Maxwells running Earle might have been elected.

	Tell Willy that Col. Sumner is going to write him a letter about the puppy.  He has no puppy yet for him but will have the next time.  I will certainly bring the knife and will as soon as I have leisure write Willy a pretty letter.

	Tell Anna that I will bring her something, but she has had so many dolls, & breaks them so rapidly I do not know soabout bringing a doll.

	Tell Frank that a whip isbrought than a drum & costs a good deal less.  I will bring him a whip.

	I wish to see you all very much & wish that I was going up with Major Earle so that I might be there in time to be at your party.    But, no, I do not care to be at your party.  I rather have the whole of your company to myself when I do return.

	If you do not hear from me by the next mail you need not be surprised.  And you will be so busy entertaining your company that you will not have time to read my letter.  I hope you will have better weather than we now have.  It has rained all day.

	In my letter to Wells you will see an account of a debate we had in the Senate.  I have tried to give quite a spirited sketch.    You will see a complement to the ladies & wives.

	We all had an interview with the governor about Wells case last Saturday.  He has given no answer yet, I think he intends granting a pardon.

	[page torn] I have seen nothing further ofHayne.  I suppose he has returned nor have I been able to visit Taylor & Mrs. Martin & probably will not before I leave.

	I am glad your mother has rece[ive]d her money & hope she will immediately pay Hoke.

	I must conclude this hasty scrabble.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S.  In your next letter I shall look out for aabout the books.

Letter 33
Friday, [12 December 1845]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I hope you have arrived safely atand I shall address this letter to Water Loo.  I feel anxious to hear how you & the children made out in your journey.   But you are a great manager & I have no doubt you got on very well.  You have beautiful weather.  By the by, you are this morning about this time, 8 oclock setting off from Goldsmith.

	I did not write you by the last mail because I know the letter could not reach Greenville before you had started, nor had I time to write,  I have been exceedingly engaged for several days past & shall still be until the Legislature adjourn[n]ing & you may not perhaps hear from me again.

	My bill giving the election of Electors to the People has undergone a long discussion & been rejected in the Senate by a vote of 25 to 19.  I opened the debate, Col. Pickens replied in a very warm & excellent speech on his side.  Col. Thompson spoke next on my side not very ably you may suppose.  Col. [George Washington] Dargan replied on the other side in a very long & most elaborate speech.  This excited me to another effort.  Col. Preston came to me in the Senate chamber & gave me his views & went off & hunted up all the authorities for me.  He brought young Mr. Blanding & introduced him to me who also furnished me with some additional facts.  The debate was adjourned till next day.    In the meantime Col. Preston sent me more books.  I went back fully prepared & made a speech of one hour & a half in length which all friends & opponents, admit did me great credit.  A great many persons have applied to me to have the speech published.  I shall do so as soon as I can write it off.  The Senate chamber was almost empty when I took the floor.  Before I concluded there was a dense crowd all around me.  I felt that I was making a good speech & my replies to Col Dargan & Col. Pickens were very happy & appropriate.

	I will now give you an account of the parties which I attended last night & the night before.  The Governor gave a magnificent democratic party at Col. Maybins Hotel.  There were a thousand persons present.  They drank eighteen hundred bottles of champaign, besides other wines & brandy.  The supper was a handsome one & must have cost a great deal.  The drawing room was covered around the walls, with flags, banners,&c.  There was a painting in one end of the room with the names of all the governors of South Carolina with Aiken at their head showing through showing through a trans

	There were not many ladies.  The Hamptons & Singletons were there however & some others.
Before night I received a message from a lady that she desired to be introduced to me that evening at the governors party.  So I brushed up & went into the ball room about ten oclock, after returning from the State House.  I was escorted through an almost impenetrable crowd to Mrs. Ellet the wife of a Professor in College & a very literary lady who writes for all the magazines, reviews &c.  You have seen some of her articles in the Democratic Review.  She is not only literary but very handsome about thirty.  I believe ladies never get beyond that age.  She took my arm & we commenced a promenade in the long piazza.  The other ladies & gentlemen followed.  We had quite a literary talk.  I found her very agreeable.    She made me promise to collect some information connected with Col. Clevelands life & character.

	Whilst promenading with Mrs. Ellet I met Gen. Canty with a lady hanging to his arm about forty, with a pleasant smiling face having still the vestiges of former beauty.  I thought I had seen her, but could not recall, either name, time or place.  In the course of the evening, I asked Gen. Canty who she was.  He said to me she is an acquaintance of yours.  Says she remembers you very well & perhaps you might remember her as Mrs. Cripps.  I took the Generals arm & was immediately introduced to her.  I saw her fifteen or sixteen years since at William Mauldins wedding in Georgetown.  She told me that she had frequently seen me since.    She once heard me make a speech in the Legislature on the duelling billthat she saw me at Greenville &c.  Poor woman you know her sad fatemarried a drunkard & separated.  

	Last night I rerce[ive]d an invitation from Col. & the Misses Hamptons.  Col. Harleston & myself went together four miles & a half.  We started after 8 oclockgot lost & arrived there just at ten oclock.  Quite a fashionable house!  When we came within lights on each side of the road negroes standing to add fuel, the road was perfectly lighted.  On the gate posts a quarter of mile from the house there were--lamps burning.  The lawn leading up to the house & all the circuitous walks in front of the house were lighted with lamps. I suppose at least one thousand.  It looked like the starry firmament brilliant indeed.

	Col. Hamptons residence is a magnificent one & looks like an English noblemans palace.  I cannot undertake to describe it to you in a letter.  The company had all assembled.  We were ushered into a wide entry & on each hand there appeared to be rooms as far as the eye could see filled with all the elite of Columbia the Legislature & a large portion of the state.  There were wealth & fashion & beauty.    Col. Hampton met us & carried us through the smiling crowd to his daughter & gave us an introduction.  They were dancing & waltzing & flirting & talking all around.  I knew most of the gentlemen present, but few of the ladies.    I saw a lady dancing with Middleton who looked pretty but somewhat faded & I said to Mrs. Bull who was standing by my side what lady is that dancing with Middleton?  That is Mrs. Bull was his reply.  I saw Miss Pride (still Miss Pride).  She went to Europe this past summer with Col. Davieyour cousin Allston Hayne was there & quite a dancer.

	The supper was the most beautiful affair I ever sawmagnificent yet graceful.  The tables were arranged in circles all round the room.  In the center a splendid collum of evergreens &c.  But I will not describe.  Leave this for a conversation.  I left as the company were breaking up at one oclockgot home at two, & woke up this morning at sixfeel quite wellhave to b0e in the court House at ten, to argue a case from Spartanburghand in the Senate at eleven.

	Since I have been writing it has clouded over & we have appearance of rain.  I feel for you & the dear little children & think of your lonely condition on the road.  I hope however it will not rain today.  This day week I shall meet you & I assure you that I shall greet this place with great pleasure.

	After my return home I shall have to go to Charleston, perhaps in January, to argue a case in the court of Appeals, Mrs. Mayrants case.  The court has not time to dispose of it here.  Col. Hunt & the Attorney General are employed against me.   We have made an arrangement to take it up whenever I go down.  The only objection is the season of the year.  But that is nothing if we go down in the stage.    Think of it.  We can carry all the children with us.

	I must now go into court.  You must give my respects to Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham, and Miss Pamela.  Tell her that I have given her womansto Dr. Arnold.  My friend Simms is about starting a magazine again.  If he does it will afford miss Pamela & myself an opportunity of making use of the womans

	Kiss all the children for me & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I am afraid from the progress yet made in Court, that I shall be detained here till Sunday.  I have four cases here of great importance & no prospect of reaching any of them before Thursday or Friday.  And I cannot think of leaving before the last is disposed of.

	I saw Mr. Cunningham here today.  He was indicted in court for an assault & battery.  But the case was compromised, and he got off with a fine of one dollar.  He informed me that Miss Pamela had been extremely ill last week that he had despaired of her living, but that she was now better.  She was last week worse than she ever had been & Dr. Arnold was sent for.

	I will send you the Laurensville Herald which contains my communications & the remarks of the Editor.   He has treated my explanation very fairly & published my speech.  I am entirely satisfied with the result.

	Judge Wardlaw is holding court here & seems sad no doubt mourning for the loss of his wife.  He mentioned a shocking piece of news in regard to General McDuffies negroestwo of them were brought in the other day dead.  had been whipped & tarred to death by his driver & overseer.  He says that McDuffie has had some fifteen or twenty slaves in chains for some time past.  They work in chains & at night are locked up.  Such cruelty is more is worthcan cover.  I am pleased at Judge Wardlaws notions about the government of slaves.  The correspond with my own.

	General Thompson is here but is not going on to Washington until after the courts are over.  He says he is very much distressed about Butlers eye & thinks he may loose the sight of it.   

	Mr. Cunningham told me there was no prospect of Ben Yanceys getting married.  I expect he has been kicked.   He said he wished him very much to marry Miss Perwho is now staying with Pamela.

	I hope you are doing well in your garden & will have everything in nice order when I return.  You had better plant such seeds as the season suits.  Send & get a paper of carrots & parsnips & plant.

	Tell Jim &I want to see a great deal done at the Farm on my return.  Let the ground all be broken up & ready for planting corn next week.  Tell them that next week I wish everything ready carry out the manure. 
       
	Kiss the children for me & say to them that I forgot to kiss them when I was startingand that I have thought of the omission often.  It would give me great pleasure to be with you all tonight, & hear them fret & crying in the morning.  I do not know how much I love you all [page torn] I am absent from you.

	It is now late in the night & I must go to bed.  If I have time I will write you by Fridays mail.

	The prospects of the Rail Road are dull, but it is said that a good deal of stock will be taken in Laurens during the summerand also in Newberry.  I hear $100,000 has been taken in Charleston, but I am afraid it is too good news to be true.

	My dear wifegood night.  Mr. Wells will leave here in the morning for Greenville & perhaps may carry this letter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S.  We are all shocked to hear that President Tyler & his wife had separated.

My dear Liz

	I received no letter from you by Sundays mail.  I shall anxiously expect one by the next mail.

	It is more than likely that I may return home next Friday evening.  There is no hope of reaching my cases under two or three weeks.  Young, Whitner, Sullivan, Irby & Orr are now here and we will probably make an arrangement tomorrow to continue all of our cases & go home.  Whitner has his wife with him & Mrs. Mays is to be here tonight.  Harrison is here with his wife.  General Thompson came here yesterday & says Cornelia Crittenden will also be here tonight.  She stopped a day in Orangeburgh & all the Abbeville lawyers came in today & yesterday.  

	There weas quite a pleasant party at Col. Prestons Saturday evening.  I met Mrs. Ellet again.  She invited me to her soiree Wednesday evening, but the Board of Trustees met that evening.  [Thomas Jefferson] Withers, Manning & myself have been busy about the college every day.  

       The students for admission to the Bar are examined next Wednesday & I Am on the committee again.    Have just prepared my questions.  Fortunately I brought my old ones down with me.  There are some fifteen making application.
       
       I purchased the works of Hugh [Swinton] Legare & was not a little surprised [to] learn from Col. Wigfall that I was mentioned in them that my name had reached Brussels also!   I have been reading the Work with some interest.  He is very severe on the nullifyers.
       
       I was at church on Sunday & heard Mr. [James Henley] Thornwell preach a fine sermon.  I saw Chancellor Harper at Col. Prestons.  His health is desperate & [he] cannot live long.  He enquired about Anna & your mother.
       
       I have bought your knives & a carving knife & forka Ball for Will that will bounce as high as the Houseno hat as yetprice same as in Greenville $1.50 and Panama $3.00.
       
       I hope you are not much alarmed by the war.    There is great interest felt here to know more about it.  We shall hear in a few days.
       
       I saw Pringle here on Saturday.  Poinsett will be here tonight.  
       
       Col. Irby brings me news that you have had a great deal of rain in Greenville.  I am afraid my crop is all ruined & the land all washed away.
       
       In my last letter I said nothing about being anxious to get back home.  You once told me not to write anything more about that.  I will not at present, but only leave you to imagine [page torn] much pleasure it would give me to see you & the children.  The remembrance abroad is always a delightful one.  I forget that the children ever cry, or behave badly.
       
       I saw at Col. Prestons a beautiful marble bust of Mrs. Preston by [Hiram] Powers.  It is worth looking at & made me ashamed of my plaster of Paris busts.  He has a great many fine paintings.  His library was on shelves in the dining room but not so large as mine.  Nor was his house so neat as our rooms are.
       
       My darling Liz good night.  If I do not return home by the next stage I will write you.  Kiss the children for me & believe me yours truly, &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Although I have just started on my tour. Only one night from home, and yet I am disposed to avail myself of an opportunity of writing to you.  In fact you and the children have scarcely been out of my mind for ten minutes since I left home.  I regret that I have not all of you with me.  The conduct of Will the night I started in running down the stair case to kiss & hug me once more before I departed deeply affected me.  He has an affectionate heart & his faithfulness no doubt proceeds from disagreement of his stomach lately.  He will one day make a man of some figure in the world I hope.    Anna is so kind & affectionate, so much like my old mother & being a daughter is my favourite.  Little Frank is a noble fellow, & how I wish I had him sitting on my knees this evening by your bedside.  But I have left you all in the care of your mother & I am sure, feel certain that you will be well taken care of.  It is said that a mothers love is the strongest feeling of human nature & I know your mother possesses it in its greatest strength.  But I think a husbands love for his wife, & the mother of his children as strong [as] any human feeling need be.

	I had a pleasant trip down here.  The stage all alone to myself& my journey had been preceeded with most refreshing & delightful showers, whichthe dust & cooled the atmosphere.  In the lower part of Laurens I heard of much sickness & some deaths from fever, whereupon I took out Dr. Crooks vial of pills & swallowed them without water or anything else to facilitate their downward course.    I never felt better than I do.  I weighed at Col. McNeeleys 192 pounds.  He said he wanted to see how much I would gain in my travelssays I will weigh at least 200 when I return.

	I hope you have had rains since I left home.  Tell Jim he must continue to harrow the corn until it is all silking.  Crops look fine on the road and a great deal of the corn made & out of danger from drought &c.

	At Newberry I sent for Col. Fair.  He was at Edgefield court.  But he heard that he & Patrick Caldwell & Mr. Nance were all going on to the north next Tuesday.  I am approved the mens is too good to be true.  How I would like to have Col. Fair as a travelling companion.  He is a noble hearted fellow & I love him much.

	You must return my thanks to Mrs. Poinsett, Mrs. Butler & your mother for the letters they gave me, although I may not be able to deliver one fourth of them.  My journey is more to look at the country than to become acquainted with people.

	Should you see any of Tom Butlers family you may tell them to think there is but little doubt of his election as Major.  I have heard from all the campaigns but Chester & he is thirty votes ahead of Major Gladden the next highest candidate.

	I have seen no one scarcely since I reached Columbia.  ate dinner washed dressed & sat down to write you this letternothing to write about eitherso I canpromising our children and speaking for husbands love old themes, but nevertheless interesting ones.  You, however, have had too many proofs of my love in actions in conduct to have it strengthened by words.  Your sweetness & womanly softness, have too often made my stern[n]ess & inflexibility if purpose yield to your own wishes, to doubt your influence over me.  I was not born to obey & yet you have always made me yield to your feelings & wishes.

	But enoughremember [me] to your mother, Susan & Anne.  Susan I suppose begins to feel a young mothers love.  I hope she may be as happy in life as her disinterested affection through life merits.  And I pray that Anne too may be restored to health & happiness.  Her father has, indeed, been a sad one.

6 July 1846
Washington, D.C.

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this city yesterday morning & have not yet recovered from the excessive fatigue of the journey.  I will however endeavour a brief of my travels so far.  

	The morning after I wrote you in Columbia I set out on the Rail Road for Charleston in company with Professor Henry of the South Carolina College.  I had quite a tete a tete with him as far as Branchville.  He then turned up for Aiken.  The downward car had Judge Dunkin on board but I did not find it out till we had landed in Charleston.  He enquired after you very particularly.  I saw no one in Charleston.  The boat closed at 4 oclock.  We had a crowd on board.  In the night a most terrible storm over took us & I assure you I never spent a more wretched night.  We were in great danger from the wind & lightening.  I slept none.  It was excessively hot & we had to close all the windows to keep the rain water out.  The heat broke out all over my body & in many places the skin is as red as blood.  Sunday morning we landed in Wilmington & took the cars for Weldon where we arrived at night 160 milestravelled all nightcame to Petersburgh about sunriseate breakfast at Richmond & arrived here at 5 oclock.  I took lodgings at the National Hotel, a very splendid building.  Almost the first man I saw was General Thompson.  He was glad to see me & hear from home. I next saw Frederick Rutledgethen a Mr. Michael from near Beaufort.  He was going round to Burts to take tea.  At the tea Burt & Yancey came to see me & we sat & talked to near ten oclock.  In the meantime I met my old acquaintance General Rush of Texas.  General Thompson called up Commodore Morris & introduced me to him & I informed him Mr. Poinsett had given me a letter to him.  He enquired very kindly about Mr. Poinsett & invited Gen. Thompson & myself to call & see him.

	In the morning I went down to the Capitol.  This is a magnificent building & greatly surpassed my expectations, for grandeur & beauty.  The grounds too are magnificent.  I was introduced into the House by Mr. Yancey.  [Richard F.] Simpson came over to see meso did Rhett & [Isaac] Holmes, [James] Black, [Joseph] Woodward & [Armistead] Burt.  I was greatly astonished at the appearance of the members.  They are indeed a most inferior set of looking menseem to have very little talent & one half of them look like they had no pretentions to be called gentlemen.  I was more shocked at their rudeness & vulgarity than I was at their bad looks.  They are a rowdy set & nothing could induce me to be a member of that House.  I went with General Thompson into the Senate.  He introduced me to [John J.] Crittenden of Kentucky, [Dixon] Lewis of Alabama, [Alexander] Barrow of Louisiana & [William S.] Archer of Virginia.  The latter invited me to take tea with him tomorrow evening.  I spoke to Mr. Calhoun but did not see McDuffie.  Col. Benton is decidedly the most striking & imposing man I have seen.    I am to go to his house to deliver my letter.    The Vice President is also strikingly aristocratic in appearance.    A good many of the Senators are inferior looking.

	I have engaged some clothes.  [page torn] they will not be ready for some days ad will detain me hereotherwise I should go north immediately.

	I hope to hear from you before I leave this city.  I shall endeavour to write a letter for the Mountaineer, but really the breaking out of the heat annoys me so at night, that I am almost crazy.  I commenced writing this letter last night but had to stop on that account.

	I feel as if I was a long way from home & am anxious to see you & the children.  It seems to me that I have been from home a month at least.  

	You must excuse thisscroll.  I will write you again before I leave Washington.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The weather is so dreadfully hot that I can hardly muster courage enough to write you.  It has been one week since I left home really it seems to me like an age.  I have travelled so far, & seen so much that it seems to me impossible that I have done all this in one week.  I hope you & the children are  all well & that I shall receive a letter shortly saying so.  I left you unwell & when I think of it I am almost ashamed of my conduct.  But you were willing & persuaded me to come.

	I have just written a letter to Col. Townes giving a full account of what I have seen & noticed.  To that letter I refer you & you must consider it part & parcel of this.  

	I had the pleasure of going to the Presidents yesterday evening & was charmed with Mrs. Polk.  There was an immense crowd in the grounds around the Building.  The President is not soin his manner as his wife.  I soon was introduced to another fine lady Mrs. Crittenden of Kentucky.  Yesterday evening I spent at Archers in company with the Russian minister, Barrow, Senator from Louisiana, Crittenden of Kentucky, General Thompson, Pendleton of Virginia.  I called to see Commander Morris, General Towson, Major Cooper & Col. Benton.  Commander Morris returned my visit this morning.    Holmes, Woodrow, Simpson & Black all called to see me this morning & left their cards.  Mr. Crittenden also did me the honor to call & leave his card.  I dined with Simpson today.  General Towson seemed very glad to hear from Mrs. Butler & requested me to call & see Mrs. Towson.  Major Cooper seemed delighted to hear from Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett.  Col. Benton was not at home.  I saw Mrs. Benton & her three daughters, one of them married to Co. Fremont of the army.  When I gave Mrs. Fremont the letter from Poinsett, she said she was entitled to one half the letters her father received from him.  They seemed quite a pleasant & agreeable familynot pretty, but not uglyhealthy & rosy cheeked.  General Thompson went with me and he has been very kind to me.  I feel under many obligations to him for his politeness.  It has been of great service to me.

	I was delighted with Barrow of Louisiana.  He is a noble looking man & I think a noble hearted fellow with handsome talents.  I have yet seen very few pretty women.  They do not strike me at all.  Mr. Calhoun came up to me today & seemed very kind.  I have not seen McDuffie.  Yanceys mother is here & has fallen out with Cunninghams family & Ben.  She must be crazy.  So Burt thinks.  Mrs. Calhoun & Mrs. Burt left here this morning for the Virginia Springs.

	Commodore Shubrick is in command of the navy yard at this place.  I went to visit the yard & did not carry your mothers letter with me nor did I see him.    I will send it to him.

	Barnwell Rhett.

	I have just got my clo[page torn] coat, pantaloons, & 3 vests at $45.50.  They fit very well & if I had my shirts, I should look quite genteel.

	I shall not leave for the north before next Saturday.

	You must write me in Boston, all how you are coming on, & the children, & the farm &chow Willie  What they say &c.  What sort of a present they wish &c.  Barrow told me the other night he wished to have 25 sonsthat he would rather have a distinguished son than be distinguished himself.   I told him I expected Mrs. Barrow would object to the number which made him smile.  He is a noble gentleman.  Good night.  Your husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before breakfast.  I am not in such a rack of pain as I was when I wrote you last.  But the weather is the hot[t]est I have ever felt.  Last night I went to the Presidents alone.  Burt was to have gone with me.  I first rode to Mr. Calhouns where I spent a few minutes very pleasantly with him.  I had sometensions in going to the White House alone for fear I would not be recognized.  There was a great crowd assembled.  I pushed my way through to the President & then to Mrs. Polk who said in her kind manner how do you do Mr. Perry. I entered into conversation with her.  She expressed great astonishment that I never had been to Washington before--said she could hardly believe it.  We spoke of South Carolina, the mountains, Tennessee, the French Broad down which she had once travelled, the Hudson &c.

	I met Col. Benton at the Presidents & had a long talk with him about Oregon & his speech.  I complimented it very highly & he seemed pleased.  I understand he is very greedy of praise & flattery & does not hesitate to talk of himself.  The President was nearby & heard my compliments which he did not seem to relish as it was rather a censure on him as he differed so widely from Col. Benton.  I noticed he turned off & sat down.  I was introduced to Col. Benton in the Senate chamber yesterday by Mr. [William Lowndes] Yancey.  He told mew that Benton would speak of his daughters who were educated by himself, in very high terms.  He said Sir my daughters are well educated.  They are capable of conversing with ease, with the crowned heads of Europe!  Mrs. Freemont it is said possesses all of her fathers talents & I should suppose so from what I saw of her.  

	Mr. Yancey has resigned his seat in Congress, is going to move to Montgomery & practice law in copartnership with Elmore of that place.  He says Isaac Hayne was doing well & his wife made him herethat he will go into copartnership with Perroneau & Mazyck is going to withdraw.  There was no other cause for his leaving Alabama.

	I dined with Simpson the other day.  He lives by himselfonly one other member of Congress with him.  He has been very kind to me.  And General Thompson I feel under a thousand obligations to.  I have become acquainted with Governor[Arthur Pendleton] Bagby of Alabama.  I was also introduced to Yulee & [James Diament] Westcot[t] last night at the Presidents.  She is very pretty.

	Yesterday I heard a debate in the Senate between Calhoun, Webster, [John Adams] Dix of New York, [John] Davis of Massachusetts, [William Segar] Archer of Virginia.  I also heard Benton speak on Another subject.  I liked Calhouns style of speaking more than that of any other.  I felt proud of him.  He sent me his report the other day on the Memphis Convention and yesterday he came to me in the Senate chamber and asked me if I had read it and I had barely looked over it.  He asked me what I thought of it & begged me to write something in the Mountaineer about the subject in order to call the attention of our friends to it.  This placed me in a most delicate situation for I differ with him in some respects.  I told him I would think of it.

	If I do not stop my letter will not be at the post office by eight oclock when the mail closes.  I hope to hear from you on MondayTuesday.  I will go north.  Mr. Yancey speaks of going with me.  Kiss the children a dozen times for memy dear Lizyour husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your letter yesterday morning and was delighted to hear from home.  I went to the Post office to put in the letter I wrote you, & came very near coming off without enquiring for letters, not supposing you had had time to write me.  I assure you it affords me great pleasure to receive a letter [from] my home & my Dear Liz in a strange place.    And it seems to me that we shall have been separated so long that our meeting will be like a second marriage.  I am glad to hear that Will is head, that Frank misses me so much.  I hope they will all be good children & grow better by my return, & I will bring them so pretty presents.

	Yesterday I went to see Commodore Shubrick.  He now lives in Washington & has command of the navy yard.    He made a great many enquiries about your brother & family & seemed very kind.  Sent for his daughter to come down & see me & introduced me as the husband of her cousin Elizabeth McCall.  Said he would call & see me &c.  His standing in the navy is very high & he goes to sea in a few months.

	From Commodore Shubricks I went to the Capitol & was there introduced again to John Q. Adams who I find represents the district in which My Father was born.  He invited me to call & see him  Monday morning  & he would give me some information in regard to my name.  I had considerable conversation with him.  He looks very much like my Father, & I was so forcibly reminded of the likeness on first seeing him that I could not refrain from shedding tears.  I never will say aught against him again.  For I hold it impossible for any one with his features to be a bad man.

	I went into the Senate & there met for the first time Mr. [George] McDuffie who seemed very kind & invited me to take tea with him.  I was introduced to Richie, the venerable editor of the Union.   He enquired if I was major Perry of Greenville, S.C. and on being told yesHe replied you are a much stouter man than I expected to see.  I had always formed an opinion that you were a small man.  I had a long & very agreeable conversation with him.

	In the evening Burt & myself took a ride & went to the walls of the Capitol where some hundred of ladies & gentlemen assemble every evening to hear the Bank of music, promenade &c.  where I met Miss Howard.  I tried to avoid her but she literally ran after me, begged me to call & see her.  I found her with a member of Congress from Kentucky.  She must be crazy.  I met Mrs. Woodward & walked over the grounds with her & her husband and a Missfrom New York.  I met & was introduced to Winthrop of Massachusetts who is a gentleman.  About dusk we returned to Mr. Calhouns & took tea with Mr. McDuffie & Mr. Calhoun.  After tea Middleton came in who married a Vonness.  I had met him in the Library in the morning & had a good deal of conversation with him after an introduction by Burt.

	After sitting a while Burt & myself came to the Hotel where we found Col. Fair & Mr. Nance who had just arrived.    I am delighted to have Col. Fair for my travelling companion.  He will detain me a day or two longer in Washington.

	At the Box I found a letter from Col. Totteninviting me to dine with him on Monday at 5 oclock.  He had just rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Poinsett.  I find Mr. Poinsetts friends very much attached to him here.  And I could not have brought letters from a better source.

	You can form no conception of the heat of the weather.  It is actually purgatory.  Such distress & complaint I never had before.  My room is surrounded by Ladies & such doleful lamentations do I hear.

	You need be under no apprehensions about my money.  I believe my trunk the safest place.  Captain Rivers is here with his daughter going north & Mrs. Bryce of Columbia.  

	Adieu my dear Lizmy love to the children & your mother & family, your husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 41

Washington

My dear Liz

	I wrote you this morning because I may not have an opportunity of writing again for several days.  The great Tariff debate in the Senate commences today & from what I hear will continue several days.  I may detain me in Washington as it will [be] of great interest.  The great men of the Senate will all take a part.

	Yesterday was Sunday & it was so hot that I did not go to church.  I wrote you a letter in the morning.  After breakfast I pulled off my clothes and lay on my bed near a window pretty much till dinner thinking of you & the children.  That I loved you all as much as it was possible for a husband & a father to love his wife & family.  But I never realized the full strength of my love till separated from you in a strange city & no hope of seeing you for weeks to come.  I thought to myself all day yesterday how little I Appreciated whilst at home the value & the pleasure of yours & the childrens company & how much I would value it on my return.

	In the evening I went with General Thompson by appointment to ss Webster.  We found him sitting in his front portico with his coat & waistcoat off.  He looked as plain as any old farmer or country magistrate.  He said to me I have heard of you before.  I told him that I once had the pleasure of receiving a letter from him.  He ordered some claret, whiskey & water.  I & General Thompson drank of the claret & water.  He drank whiskey & water.  He spoke of the Tariff, Mr. Calhoun, Internal Improvement, Oregon, the Mexican War, the character of the American people, Agriculture, England, Stock, Talleyrand, France &c.  I enjoyed the conversation very much and was delighted with his simplicity & greatness.  When I went to start he asked me how long I would remain in the city.  He asked me if he could do anything for me in Boston by way of letter &c.  Said he would send me to a gentleman near where my father was born who would give me more information than I had any conception of in regard to my name & myself.

	From Websters we went to Judge Masons attorney general of the U. States and spent an hour or two very pleasantly with the judge, his wife & children.  Judge Mason is regarded as the purest best man in Washington.  His wife is very ugly but pleasant & agreeable.

	A good many South Carolinians are now here and Judge Butler is to be here today.  I tell you in great confidence which you must not mention that Governor Butler & Col. Mason of the Army are to fight a duel as soon as he arrives in Washington.  This brings Judge Butler here.  I have my information from General Thompson.  But do not let it get out as it would distress his family & friends.  It is an old quarrel & cannot [page torn] made of.   

	Major Stark of Hamburgh is here & also Mr. Bryce of Columbia.  They are all going north.  So I shall have company enough.

	Today I must return some calls & visit old John Q. Adams by appointment.

	The weather is alarmingly hot and it is truly distressing.

	Breakfast is ready & I must conclude this letter.  You may not hear from me again before I leave the city.  I shall go to Baltimore & stay a day, thence to Philadelphia, New York, West Point&c.  Give my love to your mother, Susan, Mr. McBee, & Anne.  Kiss the children & accept the openness of my love.  B.F. Perry

Letter 42

Washington

My dear Liz

	I received your second letter last night.  I sent two or three times before I could get it.  Once or twice the Bar keeper told me there were n letters.  I knew you had written me and I leave here today.  I was unwilling to start without hearing from you.  General Thompson rece[ive]d letters from Mrs. Thompson & Butler who sent word that all of my family were well.  But I persevered until the letter came & I was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I shall now leave the city without regrethoping to hear from you in New York & Boston.

	I have not much to write in addition to my last.  I dined at Col. Tottens Monday and was delighted with him & his family.  He is a very intelligent & warm hearted gentleman.  His wife is a most agreeable lady but not handsome.  His daughter is a sweet young lady.  They all came up & shook hands with me & treated me as one of the family.  He has two sons not grown.  I believe he has one or two sons, a daughter married whom I did not see.  They all seem greatly attached to Mr. Poinsett.

	Yesterday evening I went to the Presidents in company with Burt, Simpson, Judge Butler, Fair.  I told Mrs. Polk that I had written Mrs. Perry some admirable sketches of the White House & its inmates and I assured her that the feeling of South Carolina was quite loyal that evening.  Judge Butler who was standing with me said I should use the word allegiance.  Mrs. Polk replied the other was the feeling when applied to a lady.  We talked to her some time until a crowd came up & pushed us off.  She is a most charming woman & seems so happy at being Mrs. President.  I do not think I ever saw a happier woman in my life.  She has a little spice of vanity in her character & her heart is filled to overflowing with the idea of being the wife of the President, & she seems to look upon him of being worthy of all the honor & admiration.  I could but think how she would differ in opinion with those who called Mr. Polk a third rate man during the presidential canvas.  In their opinion he is first of the greatest.  I will have a great deal to tell you about persons in Washington, but cannot write all.

	I have written a letter to the Mountaineer & in it mention my visit to Adams & the debate in the Senate.  You will see this letter and I will not repeat what is in it.

	Judge Butler stays here a short time & returns to So Carolina.  Governor [Pierce Mason] Butler has not yet arrived.  Dr. May who was over at Greenville with Powell McCray called to see me yesterday.  I also went by myself to see Crittenden of Kentucky & Archer Senator from Virginia.  I found them both very kind & pleasant.  Yesterday I dined with Mr. Burt at Calhoun & McDuffies in company with those gentlemen, Judge Butler, Simpson, Fair & Tucker of Virginia.  We had quite a pleasant party.

	Col. Fair & myself will start today for Baltimore.  You will not hear from me for some days.  I have not written yet to anyone but you & Col. Townes.  I must write to some others when I get time.

	My dear wife you must take good care of yourself & children.  Give my love to your mother & family & write me all the news, write to Boston.  My present notion is to go to New York, Saratoga, Niagara, down the river to Montreal & back to Boston.  Mr. Adams directed me to take this rout[e] & gave me all the particulars.  In great haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Philadelphia

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Col. Townes describing everything I have seen since I left Washington & to that letter I refer you.

	I am now travelling with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  Yancey did not come on with us as we hoped.  We will go on rapidly together till we reach Boston.  There Col. Fair will leave me & return home & I will stop along to deliver my letters & see more of the country.  He will go with me to Niagara & Quebec.  I find it very pleasant to have a friend, & will more so when I get into Canada. 

        I hope to hear from you in New York.  If you wrote within three or four days after you wrote me last in Washington I shall receive it.  But my stay will be as short one in New York until my return.
       
       In looking over Sullys Gallery of Paintings I was struck with the painting of Adam & Eve.  It is the most lovely picture I ever saw & if I had money would purchase it at $150.   You will see some account of it in my letter to the Mountaineer.  I am delighted with Philadelphia but have seen no one.  Your mothers letters I shall have to leave in the Post office.  I left Mrs. Heywards at Willmington as I passed through it.  I feel awkward in calling to see strange ladies & I suppose they would have some such feelings themselvesnow shall I be able to call & see Capt. McCall as I pass through New Jersey.
       
       I was looking at some bracelets for you this morning.  They are fashionableone only.  But I will take your advice & make my purchases as I return.  I saw a bedstead worth $2500, a wardrobe $1500 and the whole set for one chamber worth $8,000!  I saw some beautiful & new fashioned sofasFrenchprice $190some neat plain ones at $35.
       
       I have met in Philadelphia Dr. Thompson, son of Wallace Thompson of Union who is attending the medical lectures.  He has been very kind in showing us the city.  I find hacks here cost me a great deal.  They charge one dollar per hour for driving.  In Washington my carriage hire amounted to all most as much as my board Bill.
       
       So far my dear Liz I have been delighted with my trip.  I knew so little & had seen so little of the world before compared with other gentlemen.  I have learnt much & acquired much valuable information which I hope will be of service to me in other life.
       
       You must take good care of yourself and children.  Do not whip them.  I believe it is best to let them be unrestrained than to be punishing.  All children are bad & unruly.  Do not let Will study too hard.  I was glad to hear he was head again & hope he will remain there.  I will bring them all a pretty present.  How I do wish to see them& yet we are separated a thousand miles by Rail Road &c.  This is a long distance when I think of it.  Tell Anna she must be a good girl & I like to hear that she cries when my letters are read & hope to see Frank much grown when I return & hope also to see my dear Liz recovered & in good health with blooming cheeks again.  It has been almost a month since your confinement & I hope you are pretty well.  But you must not get well too quick.
       
       I hope the servants are doing well.  If they do not it is best to let them alone & not have any difficulty with them.  In Washington they had white servants entirely.  Here they have black ones.  I get along with the black ones best.
       
       I will write you from New York if I have time.    I hope there to see someone from Greenville.  General Thompson told me to write him when I returned & he might go back with me.  
       
       Give my love to your mother & family & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

New York

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Albany in company with Col. Fair & Mr. Nance.  We will go thence to Niagara Falls, & through Lake Ontario, down the St. Lawrence to Montreal & Quebec, which we expect to perform in six or seven days.  We shall then return through Lake Champlain & Lake George to the Hudson & Saratoga Springs.  There Col. Fair will leave us & return home.  I shall call to see Mr. Van Buren & stop at West Point.  Then go to New Haven, New Port & Boston & return by the way of the Niagara Springs, to Greenville about the middle of August.  Mr. Nance will return with me.  He is a very worthy & clever gentleman & I am much pleased with him as a travelling companion.

	I have been in New York only two days & would leave with regret for the beautiful Hudson had I rece[ive]d a letter from you whilst here, as I hoped & expected to do.  I feel sure you have written, & the letter has been misplaced in some way, which provokes me.  You do not know how dear a letter from home is to one in a strange city.  My heart sank within me when the Bar Keeper informed that there was nothing for me in the Post office.  I made him send again & again.  The same answer was returned.  I console myself with the hope that you & our dear little children are all well.  I do not think that I shall ever wish to leave home again to travel.  I am not sorry however that I am making this tour.  It wasto me never to have been to the north.  But I shall be satisfied when I return to my home & to my wife & children.

	I wrote you from Philadelphia which letter I suppose you have rece[ive]d.  We had a pleasant trip to New York passing through a beautiful country, the heart of New Jersey in a high state of, adorned with many pretty little villages & townsPrinceton, Newark, Burlington, Jersey City, Elizabeth Town, Amboy &c.  We stopped at the Astor House & find it a most magnificent Hotel well kept.  I rather think the best table I was ever at.  But the company is inferiormerchants & merchants clerks & travelling yonkes & manufacturers--very much like the company I found at the Charleston Hotel.  At table we have soup which is one coursethen fishthen all sorts of meats & vegetables, oyster pies &c.  Then all sorts of pastry, strawberry pies, puddings &c &c.  Then the clothes are removed & we have pine apples & all sorts of fruits, & lastly ice cream.  If I can get one I will send you a Bill of Fare.  The servants are all white & very attentive.  I now see so few negroes that when I meet one it seems to me I have found an acquaintance, & feel glad to see him.  I feel as if he was my countryman & fellow creature, & not the white man.  Today we wished a carriage to drive to the Croton water works & I selected a black driver instead of the many white ones standing by.  I think cuffee was made for a servant & he does pretty well in his post.  In every room of this Hotel there is a bible placed on the table.

	I called to see Hastie today.  He was out.  I left Nichols letter & my card.     The weather is quite cold but today has been very pleasant.  I have rode throughsaw the museum & there met two mammouths [word obscured]seemed ten years old weighing five hundred pounds.  They look like fat hogs.  As I return & shall endeavour  to see more of this great democratic &city.  The streets are crowded from morning till twelve oclock at night so much so that it is difficult to walk them.  I went to Trinity church Sunday evening, but the& aisles were all full.  I stood up amidst the crowd till the organ stopped.It is the largest & richest church in America I expect.

	You must write me to Boston as soon as you receive this letter.  I shall be constantly travelling now for a week & you may not hear from me in that time.    Accept my love for you & the children and remember me to your mother & family.  I must now back up.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Albany

My dear Liz

	I cannot resist the temptation which a few leisure moments afford me of writing to you.  I have nothing to write and yet it gives me pleasure to say so, and I know you will take pleasure in reading such a communication from me in a far distant land.  I wish I could only receive a similar communication from you tonight.  But that pleasure will be denied me until my return to New York & next to Boston.

	I wrote you on leaving New York.  I will now bring my journey up to this time.  Tuesday morning we got on board the steamboat for Albany.    From the time we started until we reached this city the scenery on the Hudson was a continual picture.  To me it was an enchanted view the whole way.  I did not know before that a landscape could be so beautiful.  It is worth travelling a thousand miles to see the beautiful river the high & precipitous banks, rugged cliffs, splendid mansions, lovely Farms, fertile & highly cultivated & improved, the flocks of cattle &c all admiration & wonder.  The Boat was crowded with men, women & childrenseveral hundred.  I took my seat in the extreme part of the forward deck & continued to gaze on the bewildering scenery.  Col. Fair & Mr. Nance joined me and Mr. Hobby assistant Post Master General united himself to us.  He was familiar with every spot & could point out every house & cliff & village.  He was born on the banks of the Hudson.  I found him a most intelligent & agreeable gentlemanvery much like Mr. Calhoun in appearance & talks like him.   I never saw a prettier place than Newburgh a town on the Hudson.  The Catskill mountains looked to me very much like the Saluda mountains.

	We reached the city at five oclock.  The British Legation, Mr. Cronston, was on board, a very plain looking gentleman.  Albany is a beautiful Town, built on the side of a hill & on top of the Hill.  every rain washes the paved streets clean.  The convention of New York is now in session at this place.  We went last evening to visit the capitol & were very politely shown over the House by one of the members, Mr. Townsend.  In the morning I found that Mr. Conbreliry & Mr. Kemble were members of the convention & boarding at the House we stopped at.  I sent them Mr. Poinsetts letters & they were very civil to me.  Mr. Kemble is one of the most accomplished gentlemen I have met with, an old Bachelor & as I was told in Washington the Siamese friend of Mr. Poinsett.  I have had a great deal of conversation with him.  Governor Wright is not at home today.    My letter to him I will keep till I return.    Mr. Conbreliry is a very plain sensible gentleman, but not remarkable for anything except his good sense.

	We start in the morning for Niagara Falls.  It is now raining very hard & I am afraid it may rain tomorrow.  The next letter I write you will be posted in her Majestys dominions & in it you may expect a description of Niagara & the lakes.

	Tell Will I will bring him a nice suit of clothes from Canada.  Tell Anna & Frank I will bring them something pretty.  And I must get a present for you from Queen Victorias

	My dear wife good night &c.  All of my letters are written in great haste as I have not time to travel, look, write & sleep all at the same time.  It seems to me.  I have been in one continual hurry from the time I started.  Travelling is not pleasant, except that you see so much.  Remember me to your mother, Susan, McBee & Anne.  Good night, your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here last night.  Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter which you will read & send over to Col. Townes.  It will give you some idea of where I have been & I have not time to rewrite it for you.  I shall leave here this evening for Troy, AlbanySpringfield, New Haven, Boston &c.  I shall not get your letters until my return to New York.  It seems to me that I have been almost to the end of the World & am happy that my face is now homeward.  You may well imagine my impatience to return to my wife & children.  I am heartily tired of travelling & will never care to go from home again.  

	In Montreal I purchased three beautiful dresses for youone of silkone of a new sort of goods not yet reached the U. States & the other of a most lovely patternsilk & wollen.  I have purchased Anna two beautiful dresses & perhaps enough for three or four.  I have purchased Will & Frank a suit each.  I have also purchased for you a great many Indian curiosities which are beautiful toys, pin cushions &c.  And also a rarity from the Grey Nuns.  I have bought for myself some fine clothesall very cheap.    Your dresses are new & lovely.

	How glad I would be to hear from you, but I flatter myself that you are perfectly well & the children are all well.  It is (sic) has been more than a month since your confinement & I hope the bloom is restored to your cheeks.  This is the very first opportunity I have had to write you since my letter from Albany.  

	Last night I met here some very pleasant ladies from South Carolina who seemed glad to see me because I was from their own statea Miss Nelson from Statesburgh who knows the Bradys & says one of them is to be married to Richard Harrison in a very short time.  She is a young girl about 18, and I have walked with her all over the grounds to the springs &c.  Miss Yates is here & has taken possession of Col. Fair.  There is a Miss Taylor here from South Carolina, granddaughter of Governor Taylor & a pleasant girl.  Mr. Seabrook & his bride Miss B are here who seem pleasant & glad to see us.  There are at this House about 500 personssome thousands at the other Houses.  The world seems very congregated here.

	In some of my former letters I spoke of the heat breaking out over my body.  The skin is now all peeling off and my hands look bad but are now pretty well peeled over.  I shall have a new & fresh skin on my return.  Yesterday I was bilious.  There was one effort of nature to relieve  I feel much better today.

	I shall part company with Col. Fair & Nance at Troy & I regret it, but they will not wait on me.  I must see Governor Wright & Mr. Van Buren before I return.  When I shall reach home I do not really know.  I wish to spend a day or two in Boston and a day at New Haven.  I may stoop a day in Washington & a day at the Virginia Springs.  

	God bless you my dear wife & children.  Kiss the children for me and give my love to your mother & family and remember me to all my friends in Greenville.  I shall have a great deal to tell you on my returnenough to keep us talking for a long time.  Your husband, B.F. Perry.

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter to read & hand to Col. Townes.  I have nothing to add to it.  I wrote it because I had a few leisure moments.  

	I was very much gratified with my visit to Mr. Van Buren & spent the evening most pleasantly.    When you see Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett say to them that Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Gilpin & Lady & Mr. John Van Buren & Mrs. Van Buren all desired to be remembered to them & spoke of them in the most affectionate termssaid they were in hopes to have seen them here this summer. 

	By waiting to see Mr. Van Buren I have lost two days & I assure [you] I hesitated whether to do so or not.  I thought however that you would desire it, & that you would be willing to postpone the pleasure of seeing your husband that length of time for him to make the acquaintance of the ex President.  I was pleased with Governor Wright, but had only a few moments to stay before the cars left.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone.  They are to meet me at New Haven tomorrow night.  They will be returning from Boston & I shall be going on.  My impatience to return home is now so great that I shall not enjoy what I see as I otherwise might.  

	 I will write you from New Haven if I have time.

	I must now close my letter & start to the Rail Road.  God bless you & the dear little children & God only knows how much I wish to see you all again.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Letter 47
4 August 1846
New Haven

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this lovely Town yesterday evening in time to take a walk around the College Buildings, the State House & churches.  This morning I procured a large open Barouche, & I drove all through the streets & around the suburbs.  Oh my dear wife how happy I should have been to have had you seated by my side pointing out the streets & Houses as you saw & recognized them.  The house in which you mother livedthe church which you attendedthe school where you went with books & slate every morning like a sweet little girl of ten or twelvesometimes trudging through the snow & meeting the cold winds.  I need not say to you that New Haven is dear to me from these associations, & if it were an ugly place, still I should love it, as the town in which my dear wife was educated & spent some of her most pleasant days.  But it is the prettiest town I have yet seen.  I was told by a young Englishman, with whom I travelled in Canada, that New Haven was the prettiest town in America.  I now heartily agree with him.  But it is twice as large as when your mother resided here.  And yet every house is built in the finest style & with great taste.

	After I had rode over the Town, I drove to Col. Moslys to deliver your mothers letter.  He was not at home, & would not return for several days.  So I shall not have the pleasure of seeing your old friend.  I left the letter and my card & drove to Governor Edwards.  He was at home & as soon as he broke open your mothers letter came into the room.  I found him very pleasant and agreeable.  He made a great many enquiries about your mother & her family.  After a short call she desired him to introduce me to Professor Silliman & President Day & show me your sisters grave.  He stopped at Mrs. Ingersolls to enquire the spot.  We went into the cemetery & readily found the place beside the grave of a Daughter of Mrs. Shubricks, & shaded by a small tree planted some years since.  I need not say to you that I shed many tears over the grave of [my] wifes sister as I looked over it.  My weakness was seen & noticed by Mr. Edwards.

	We found Professor Silliman at home & I was much pleased with him, his conversation & his appearance.  He is really a fine looking gentleman & much younger than I expected to see him.  He begged to be remembered to your mother & to yousaid he remembered all of you with great interest & thanked me for calling to see him & regretted my stay was so short.  We found President Day engaged with the Board of Trustees.  He came to the door of the college & expressed great pleasure at seeing the son in law of Mrs. McCallenquired most affectionately after you & your mother & invited me to take tea with him this evening at half past six.  He said Mrs. Day would be glad to see me & enquire about Mrs. McCall.  Mr. Edwards asked me to walk round this evening & see his daughter, the only member of his family living with him.  But I am afraid I shall not be able to do so.  We rode by the brick House in which your mother lived near the college.  I looked at it with great interest & pictured to myself three little girls, blooming with health, beauty & loveliness & playing & running over the House, & that one of them was now my wifethe mother of three sweet, lovely children!  What a change a few years make in the condition of a little girl!

	I cannot get from here to New London except by riding twelve hours in the stage.  I will return to Springfield & from there to Boston.  I will pass through New London or New Port on my return to New York.  Say to Mrs. Butler I came here on purpose to go by Mrs. Rodgers to Boston but am disappointed.  I hope however to have the pleasure of seeing some of her relations on my return.

	I hope to hear from you in Boston & also on my return to New York.  I must close [and] shall not write you again for several days.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family & remember me to all my friends.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Letter 48
6 August 1846
Boston

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday to dinner and received two letters from you.  I cannot tell you how happy these letters made [me].  It had been so long since I had heard from you, , & I had travelled so many thousand miles, that it really seemed to me that I was lost & forgotten.  I was opposed to & that some of you might not be well.  If I had consulted my feelings I should have started home from New Haven without visiting Boston.  But I am now better satisfied, & will remain here a day or two.  Your first letter was advertised & I did not receive it till I applied for advertised letters.

	  I immediately on receiving your first letter I made a memoranda of the articles you wish me to purchase & which I will get as long as my money holds out.  I purchased last evening a beautiful shawl such as you described white with lilac stripes for $3.50.  The price was $4.00.  It is a beautiful thing & far prettier than anything of the kind sold in Greenville.  Your dresses in Canada were about $9.00 a piece.  The dresses for you & the children were $35.00.  My cloth clothes dress coat & pantaloons & travelling sack were $52.00.  My clothes in Washington & shirts in New York $60--Carriage hire has been a large item.  I paid one day in New Haven$3.25cts for the hire of a carriage to ride over the city & to visit with Governor Edwards.  They charge $1.00 an hour!  I mention these things to show you the state of my finances & if I should to buy you a musical box & something else, you must know it is not because I would willingly deny the least request you can make.  It has been my great pleasure since our married life commenced to love you & make you happy in everything and the only pain I have ever experienced has been on account of myknowing that I was not able to live as I desired & you deserved to live.  But I think our condition has greatly improved since our marriagethat we are much better off than we were then.

	I have now $140 in my pocket which I hope will be enough to carry me home & get all you desire.  If I could return directly by the way of Charleston it would save time & money but on account of sickness I had better return through Virginia.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone home.  They did not pass through New Haven & I saw nothing more of them.  I found on my arrival at the Tremont House a letter from Col. Fair explaining why he did not meet me as he promised.  Just as I was getting into the cars at New Haven I met Mr. Latta of South Carolina going to Boston & will make the same stay that I do & return to New York with me.  He is an old gentleman of great wealth & has a son & two daughters at school in New Haven.  He was on board the vessel with your father & mother when he died, desires to be remembered to your mother about whom he made many enquiries.  I find him a pleasant old gentleman being from South Carolina we have attached ourselves to each other.

	The weather is extremely hot & last night I was so much fatigued that I had a dreadful headache.  I was afraid I was going to have a bilious attack & hunted for Dr. Crooks pills, but they are lost.  This morning I feel much better.  But the weather is so hot there is no moving about.

	Tell Mrs. Butler I will certainly see her sister.  But I shall not be able to visit New Port.  I will return through New London to New York, there stay a day & go home as fast as I can.  I should like to call & see your uncle McCall, but am afraid I shall not be able to do so.

	Tell Susan that the coral beads must be a present from me & not you.  I claim the honour of making the young stranger the present.

        Tell Will, Anna & Frank that their commands shall all be obliged & they must be good children, mindful what you say & not [be] cross [with] each other.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter for Col. Townes.  I shall leave in the morning for New London & do not know when I shall have time to write you again.

	I have purchased for you a most magnificent Bracelet $11.50 & two gold pins $3.00.  I have had made for you the prettiest thing in the shape of a French cap your eyes ever beheld $5.00.  How I shall carry it without washing is the difficulty.  I have purchased a beautiful set of coral for Susans first born $4.50.  I have purchased a suit for Will & Frank of cloth at $17.00.  They are very handsomely made.  My funds are getting low & I must now stop.  I will make your mother a present of Mas[s]il[l]ons sermons which I now have & dont care for.  My trunk is full & I can get nothing in it.  You see I have grattified your every wish.  I felt it doubly my duty to Susan as I had been off enjoying my travels & spending money whilst you were at home.  I wish you had been with me & yet I know you would not have found it pleasant.  

	I must now pack up and be ready to start soon in the morning.

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am happy to be this far on my return home to you & the children and am very much tempted to go on by Charleston.  Judge Butler & many others are going that way.  But I do not consider it entirely safe and if I returned through Columbia I should have to stay there at the Court of Appeals.

	The morning I left Boston I recd your last letter & on my return to New York I found two more only.  The two first you wrote me are last in some way.  I was delighted to receive all your letters & read them on in the cars as I came on.

	When you see Mrs. Butler tell her I was most pleased with Mrs. Rodgers and her family.  If Miss Rodgers wardrobe had been completed she would have come on with me.  Her mother says she is insane on the subject of her visit to South Carolina.  She will remain twelve months with Mrs. Butler & will come on in September.  She is about the size & age of Behethlen Butler & seems quite a pleasant girl.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Rodgers, who must have been a very handsome woman when young.  He sons seem clever.  One is in the navy & the other in the army & gone to Mexico in September.  There was a little chap about thirteen or fourteen who was standing with a string of crabs in his hand looking at me.  His brother called him & said to him you have let that gentleman [page torn, word illegible] you with your crabs & he is a relation of ours.  Well said the little fellow I saw him when he got out of the Boat & I saw then he was one of our kin.

	I have just had a visit from James mother & brother.  She is quite a good looking woman about the colour of James and seems sweet & sensible.  James must take his bad qualities from his father, who ran away to a free state as his mother tells me.  She gave me a letter, a brush & 25 cts to give James.  The Brother of James looks lazy too & is the son of a white man as he is nearly white.

	I did not see General Thompson on my return to Washington.  He will leave there in four or five days with Governor Butler by the way of the Virginia Springs.

	Miss Rodgers informed me that Miss Thompson & Mr. Jones were engaged & Miss Crayton & Mr. Rowland,  I told her this was news to me.

	Governor Butler looks to be in very bad health, a mere wreck of himself.  His difficulty with Mason is unsettled and I did not learn the particulars.  

	I must now conclude as I must pack up & get breakfast in time for the cars.  I hope to be at home in the course of ten days, or perhaps sooner & do not know the stage rout[e] &c. & cannot speak with certainty.  

	Kiss the children for me & remember me to mother & family & all friends.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Butler Thompson who starts this morning.  He told me that his mother said he must come back BY Thursday.  I suppose from that you will be invited to the wedding.  If so I hope you will go.  I trust that Frank is better and that neither of the other children has taken the scarlet fever.  If you can write me by Thursdays mail though I do not know whether I shall hardly be detained here so long.

	We have very little business in court & as soon as I can get through I [page torn] to Pendleton & perhaps [page torn; final line on the sheet] my mothers at place.  You must write me to Pickens by someone who is going.

	I have been talking to Cureton a negro trader about purchasing my negroes.  He intimated that he would give me my prices at Greenville Court $500 for Mario--$550 for Janus--$600 for Mor.  But MorI do not care to sellnor do I like to sell Mario to a trader to be carried off.

	Your mother sent for me to stop as I passed on Sunday.  She has a notion of building a little house for Anne.  I told her it would cost $500 and then she would find it uselessthat Anne would not stay in it & accept  She asked me what she should do, & I told her to do as she had been doing all along.

	Mr. Spears will return to Greenville in the morning and I cannot forego the opportunity of writing you a few lines.

	I hope to hear from you & how the children are by the stage tomorrow.  I have been detained here longer than I expected and the probability is that I shall not get off till the end of the week.  I have a case of great importance which is at the foot of the docket.  I have been trying to compromise it, but have not yet succeeded.

	I had a settlement with my client Mattisontook his note for $200.  He is very good but I should like the money instead of it.  I shall get another note for $50 so theis not entirely valueless.  

	I have not yet sent your prescription & box to Mr. Sharpe but will do so if I do not carry it myself.  I have not seen Mr. Sharpe since I have been here.  

	General [Joseph Newton] Whitner told me today that Mrs. Whitner had sent to invite me there yesterday evening but the messenger could not find me and that she was scolding him for not bringing me.  They are kind & hospitable.

	I hope you & your household are doing well.  I am very anxious about the children but hope for the best.  You must write me a letter by Mr. Spears to Pickens.  Send it to Mrs. Rowlands early Sunday morning.  And let me have all the news.  How you & the children are.  How your mother & family arethe servants &c.  You can also give me an account of the wedding.  I understand the whole world is invited.  

	I am very much afraid I shall not be able to go by my Fathers old place.  I am certain that I shall not get there Friday night. But perhaps I can see them at Pickens & it will do as well.

	We shall have a great deal of business at Pickens & I may not be at home till the last of the week or Sunday.

	The rail road is quite popular here & in Abbeville.  It is said Abbeville will subscribe $500,000.  I begin to think the road must go that way.

	Kiss the children & tell Frank I will let him ride Skylark when I come home.  Tell Will he must keep heart & tell Anna she must be a good girl & begin to learn her letters.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

	I do not know when I shall returnperhaps not before the last of the week.  I was disappointed in going to Josiahs as it rained all day Saturday, & I was detained at old Pendleton.  I have not yet seen Josiah or Foster.  They will be here today.

	In the evening of Saturday Mr. Sharpe called to see me & thanked me for the pincushion & invited me to his house.  But I did not go.  The weather was bad & the invitation rather a cold one & I thought should have been given in the morning instead of the eveninghaving been there all day.  Sharpe was dressed up & looked quite spruce & seemed quite pertimportant in his own estimationhad a good deal to say about his farm &c.

	I came to the place Sunday morning & escaped the rain but have a bad cold.  I find very little business here.  General Thompson says if he practices law he will go to Charleston.

Columbia

My dear Liz

	Your letter was rece[ive]d last night & although a short one I was exceedingly glad to hear from you.  I am gratified to hear that you are pleasantly situated at you Aunts, but you did not mention any thing about the children.  Always tell me how they are & what they are doing.

	I would have written to you last evening but had no an opportunity of doing so before the mail closed.  I wrote a very good letter for the Mountaineer as you requested and gave an account of our Rail Road meeting in Charleston &c &c.

	We met with a considerable accident on Sunday coming to Columbia.  There were three cars filled with members of the Legislature.  I happened to be in the first one.  The car behind ran off & broke the axle tree, pulled off the middle one & twisted the one in front considerably.  Finally the hind most car broke loose & was left behind.  The Engine was stopped, & the second car after great difficulty was extricated from the train.  Fortunately no one was hurt.  All the members had to get into one car & stand up till they reached Columbia, a distance of thirty miles.  The other two cars were badly broken & left behind.  It was too late in the night when we arrived in Columbia.  The cause of the accident was the weakness of the hinder most car.

	I found all of our Greenville members in Columbia & at Gladdens.  They brought no news from Greenville.  Col. Townes brought my drawers & said he had seen Edward & Charles.  Col. T.P. Butler is here but returns home to muster his company.  He says he will go to Mexico if his company accepts the terms, which I am inclined to think they will not.  Major E.D. Earle is here in good spirits & so is Reed.  The candidates for the different offices are without numberthirty-two for messenger, ten or fifteen for Secretary of State & as many for the Superin[tendent of] Public Works.  

	I saw Mr. Gilmore Simms & had a long talk with him about his criticism of Pamelas book.  He has written an answer to John Cunningham which he presumes will pacify.  He said he had no idea that the article was written by a lady.

	Mr. Boyce came to me on Monday& saw that some of the Senators had been trying to get Col. Patterson not [to] run for President of the Senate again & if he had consented they intended to elect me.  But that Patterson seemed so anxious about it they did not like to say more to him on the subject.  How would you like to have heard of my election as President of the Senate without, in fact, my knowledge of what was going on?  I have been asked repeatedly since my arrival here if I had no aspiration to the Chancery Bench.

	The prospect of our rail road is brightening.  Col. Memminger called to see me yesterday evening & we were engaged some time in consultation on the subject.  He takes a deep interest in it.  We have another meeting this evening.  

	B[enjamin] C[udworth] Yancey has his bride with him at Hunts.  I am going over this evening to see her.  Ben looks well but I saw a tear in his eye when I spoke of his marriagefact is it was in remembrance of his first wife.  It seems disrespectful to the reported companion to take on other scenes like beingor forsaking the memory of her.  Kiss the children for me & give my respects to your  aunts & kin.

My dear Liz

	Your second letter was rece[ive]d last night & gave me great pleasure to hear from you.  But I was surprised you had not heard from me.  My letter was certainly in the Post office when you wrote.  You must not wait for me to write you in answer.  This you know I would do most cheerfully if I had time.  But really between the Legislature, the courts, & calls of company I have not a moment to spare.   I have been wishing to go to the theatre & to see The Painting again, but have not time.  The night you declined the Miss Elliotts invitation I had to walk a half mile down to the College in the night & back after ten oclock.  The wind was terribly cold.  The Board of trustees meet again Monday night.

	You seem to think you will be short of money.  You know, my dear Liz, I will get you more if you desire it.  Make yourself easy on that score & if you see anything you desire, purchase it, & write me & I will send you the money.  It gives me great pleasure always to gratify the wishes of my wife in every particular.  I know how pleasant it to purchase little things which we fancy.

	There is one thing which I wish you to do for me and you must do this.  As you pass through Columbia you must let Clark Mills take your bust.  It will look handsome & be much better than a portrait.  I have had mine taken.  He came to me roomtook a brush & put on my face a sort of paste which dried in a few minutes& fell off as complete mould for a likeness.  The is not disagreeable.  He says I will see the finest likeness I ever saw.  I saw Mrs. David J. McCords.  It is very fine & looks well.  The price is $25 & $35.  You may have copies for $5.00 or $7.50.  The busts of Judge Johnson  & Elmore are admirablealso of Petigru. Preston, Judge Cheves & Hampton.

	I have paid Mr. Carter $200 for my book bill.  also paid over the money recd of Butler Thompson.  Whilst I was sitting for my bust Dr. Teague came in & paid me $50 in part towards a counsel  fee.  I thought the visit very opportune.

	General Thompson & the Greenville delegates think I can be elected Chancellor but I do not.  Col. Ashe said he would vote for me in preference to any of the candidates.  Col Fair has suggested me for President of the Bank in place of [Franklin Harper] Elmore who will be elected U. States Senator.  But I have suggested Judge ONeall.  If he is elected, I do not know but that I may be a candidate for the Bench.  I am really gratified at the estimation in which I seem to be held by the Legislature.  Dr. [Thomas Jefferson] Goodw[y]n told me the other day that he was very anxious to see me President of the Senate.    He is Senator from St. Mathew.

	You must write me often & all about the children, yourself & aunts.  Col. Martin asked me this morning how often you wrote me.  He said his wife wrote every other day & he did the same.  You must write me when you expect to come up, or what your arrangements are as soon as you determine.

	I have not yet been too pay Mrs. Yancey a visit.  We have a rail road meeting in Columbia tomorrow evening.  We are all to make speeches.  Col. Summer will publish my speech in the Carolinian next week.

	I have engaged with the editor of the Southern Review to write an article on Life and embody the revolutionary history of the upper country.

	I must now go to the committee room.  Tell Will he must be a good boy.  His papa was never so bad (though I was a bad boy at his age).  Tell Anna she must be the young lady.  And Frank a little man.  Kiss them.  My love to your aunts.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed last night on returning from the Rail Road meeting & not finding a letter from you.  My first letter to you remains unanswered & I hope however that you & the children are all well & that I shall certainly hear from you this evening.

	I am so busy that I have no leisure on Sunday eve.  The whole of today I have spent in drawing a rail road charter for Greenville.  Last night I made a speech an hour long on the rail road to a town meeting in the place.  General Thompson is to speak Monday night.  Then I have to meet the Board of Trustees, & check a Professor of Roman literature.

	Yesterday I attended a lecture of Dr. Ellets before the Trustees on green cotton.  He loaded a pistol with this cotton, & I shot it three or four times.  The cotton is better than powder & will supersede it in all probability.

	Tomorrow my resolution giving the election of electors to the people [will] come up for discussion.  We shall begin this week to have meetings of interest before our Honourable Body.  I wish you were here to witness them.  You must let me know as soon as you determine what you are going to do, whether remain in Charleston or come to Columbia.  General Thompson says Mrs. Thompson is to be here this week.  Jones & Eliza have gone home from Edgefield.  

	Clark Mills is making progress with my Bust.  At present it is an ugly affair.  I desire very much to have yours taken.  I am sure it will make a handsome one.  And whenever an opportunity offers I wish to  have your portrait taken.

	How I should like now to see you & the childrenin on you & see how you areI hope the children are behaving better.  But really no children [always] behave well & should never be taken from home.  The next time we visit Charleston we will leave them behind.  I must now go to dinner & will keep my letter open till night.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Saturday morning and thank you for it.  I was afraid you were unwell or something was the matter with the children.  z\I have written you twice & hope you have re[ceive]d the second letter.

	I shall be glad to see you whenever you feel disposed to come up and if possible will supply you with all the money you wish.  I know how pleasant it is to spend when abroad & how much we are tempted by pretty things.  I only regret I had not a fortune to place at your command.    But we have done pretty well.  If you stand in need of funds write me

	
I have just re[ceive]d a Greenville Mountaineer with my letter in it & one from Col. Townes.

	Mr. Elmore will not be a candidate for the Senate.  Judge Butler will be a candidate.  Col. Davie, Barnwell Rhett, Pickens, Judge ONeall, Governor Hammond &c.

	I rec[eive]d your letter tonight & herewith enclose you $25.00 which I hope you will receive safely and that it may be as much as you will need.  I do not think you will save much by remaining in Charleston as there are so many pretty things to tempt you.  The next week is the gay & fashionable week in Columbia.  The commencement in the college is on Mondaythe Ball that evening.  The inauguration of the governor elect will take place Wednesday.  He will no doubt give a party.  I went round to Dr. Roachs this evening to see General Thompson.  He & Mrs. Thompson will stay therealso Mrs. Walker & Jane.  Mrs. Roach told me that she could furnish me with a fine room the first of next week.  You can stay there or at Clarks Hotel.  He has room plenty and I desire you to stay in Columbia a few days & see the Town.

       I went to the Fair tonight & saw an immense concourse of ladies & gentlemen.  Coil. Hampton & his family were there selling all sorts of pretty things & eatibles.  There were some twenty or thirty different establishments belonging to different persons.  I bought a pen of Miss Yates for 50cts.  At another table Mr. Griffin bought a couple & paid $1.00!  The difference in price, & in persons too.  The fair was a most magnificent collection.  Col. Martin had bought some little matter to send in a letter.
       
       Governor Aiken & Lady paid us a visit this morning in the Senate Chamber.  He introduced me to her & I took a seat by her & conversed with her for some time.  Their little daughter was with them.  How immensely rich she will be.   I saw Mrs. Yancey at the Fair.  She is not pretty, nor very young, nor very pleasant looking, but immensely rich whicha multitude of faults.  However she seemed very
       
       I hope you see the Charleston Courier which contains an account of our legislative proceedings.  I made a speech on the Electoral question Tuesday about an hour long.  Col. [George Washington] Dargan replies to me & I shall reply to him.
       
       You must write me as soon as you determine to come.  If you could come up on Sunday next you might be at the college commencement.  If on Tuesday you can be at the inauguration on Wednesday.  But you consult with your own convenience.  Take special care of the children on the rail road.  Perhaps one of your cousins may come up with you.Arthur or Col. Hayne.  It would be well to have some friend to come with you.  If you desire it, you may stay until after the adjournment of the Legislature & I will come down for you & then I am sure you & the children will be safe under my charge.  But be careful & do as you like best.  It gives me great pleasure to gratify your every wish when I can do so.  My happiness in life is to make others happy.  I live for them.  Good night, kiss the children.  If Will comes up I should like to keep him until I go home.  Remember me to your Aunts.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

General Thompson & Col. Herndon had a fight yesterday in Gladdens Hotel.  But through Chancellor Johnson & myself they have made friends.  Col. Herndon said at the supper table that the General was broke.  Erwin Jones went & told Thompson.  He met Herndon told he lied & struck him in the mouth & thereupon a scuffler ensued.  Duncan ran for me but it was overneither hurt. They shook hands today & made friends very cordial[l]y.

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed in not receiving an answer to my letter enclosing you $25.00.  I hope it is not lost.  I received a letter from you night before last.  I have been so much engaged that I have not had time to write you as often as I wish to do.

	We have had more elections & electioneering than I ever knew before.  After five ballotings Judge Butler has been elected U.S. Senator.  Governor Hammond was ahead of him two ballotings.  Col. Davie was also a candidate.  There was great excitement.  The old rumors against Hammond were brought to bear on him.  I saw a letter from him.  He admitted that he had committed a great indiscretion, denied that there was anything criminal designed by him.  But said that he should not attempt to defend or extenuate his conduct unless the version given by Col. Hampton was grossly incorrect.  I heard that Col. Hampton placed in the hands of Col. [John Algernon Sidney] Ashe a letter of Hammonds confessing & begging.  I know nothing more about the affair.

	The election of Governor will be made Tuesday.  Chancellor Johnson has already resigned.  Two Judges are now to be elected.  My friends have placed my name amongst the chancellor for Chancellor.    But I do not know that I will continue to run.  They think however that my chance is a good one for being elected.  I have no such hope.  General Caldwell, Mr. DeSaussure, F. Wardlaw, Col. Patterson, & Haynesworth are all candidates.  For the Law Judge General Whitner & Col. Dawkins are running.  But for Whitner I would run for a seat on that Bench.  A good many persons have spoken to me about running & have persuaded me that my chance was as good as anyones.  But the others have had so long the start of me.

	You had better not come here until the elections are over.  They will probably take place next week.  But you must expect to hear of my [being] beaten.  And as all my friends say, it will do me no harm to run if I am beaten.  I believe to a[ttempt] it is your advice.  

I was at the fair last night & saw Jane Walker.  Mrs. Walker is here & her son.  I wrote you in my last that Mrs. Thompson & Eliza & Jones were here.

	I hope you have seen the Charleston Courier & read the accounts of my speeches.  I am sure you will read them with great pleasure.  

	I saw Mrs. Aiken in the Senate Chamber today.  She has been there every day for the last three or four days.  I find her a very pleasant lady.  Mrs. Yancey was in the Senate Chamber today but I did not have an opportunity of speaking to her.   I met her last night at the Fair again.  She is actually turning gray or it seemed so to menothing remarkable about her.  

	I was invited to dine with Mr. DeSaussure today & also with Col. Martin.  But I declined both invitations.

       How are the children?  You must write me several days before hand when you are coming so that I may prepare to receive you.  But you had better not be here during the election if I run for Chancellor.  I will write you again Monday.    In haste yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Col. Martin informing me that Mrs. Rhett has this afternoon lost a little daughter with scarlet fever & that it is prevailing in several families in Columbia.  If the fever still continues you must either remain in Charleston or pass immediately through Columbia.  I will write you again tomorrow evening.  And you must write to me what you determine on.

	The election of Chancellor takes place tomorrow at 1 oclock.  The probability is that no election will be made for the first or second balloting.  I shall be voted for by some, but have no hopes of being elected.  Caldwell & DeSaussure are electioneering hard for it.  I think it unbecoming a gentleman to electioneer for such an office & will not even mention it to a member.  It is not generally known that my name is used as a candidate.  Several gentlemen have told me that they were glad my name was used although they could not vote for me the first ballotthey would the second.  My friends tell me that all the members seem pleased at my nomination & the greater portion would support me but for their pledge to others previously.  In the scramble there is no telling what may happen.  The fact of my permitting my name to be used will do me no harm if I gain nothing by it.  I look upon it as an honor to be taken up under the circumstances & voted for by even a few friends.  But I will write you the result tomorrow night.  The election for Law Judge will not come on for several days.

	I was at the commencement this morning, & a splendid one it wasmore company & better performance than I ever witnessed before.  Mrs. Jones was there, also Mrs. Walker & Jane.  

	In regard to servants clothes & everything else do as you think best.  I have confidence in your judgement & prudence my dear wife.  My only anxiety now is about the children.  I have so many reports to write tonight that I must conclude.  Your husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It wasconsolation, after being beaten so badly as I was today, to receive your scolding letter.  You have but little philosophy in your composition & ought to thank your stars that you were not born of a different [page torn].  Your letter was so unlike the soothing of a gentle & affectionate wife, that I burnt it immediately for it might hereafter be seen.  So there is an end of it.  Forget that you wrote it, & I will forget the contents.

	Noe for the election.  I would not go to the State house at all this morning.  I never mentioned to anyone that some of my friends were going to vote for others, but all expressed themselves friendly towards myself.  Caldwell recd 36, Wardlaw 30,  DeSaussure 29, Patterson 25,  Haynesworth 19, myself 12, 6, Young 2 &c.  There is no election made.  I presume Caldwell will be elected.

	I care nothing about it.  In fact I had rather stay at the Bar.  But General Thompson & others persuaded me that it would be no injury to me as a candidate.  But I was not a candidate.  My friends only voted for me a few of them.

	I will expect you Saturday evening.  I hope there is no danger of scarlet fever.  No cars arrive now before night, & leave Charleston at 9 oclock in the morning.  I shall be most happy to meet you & the children my dear wife.  After all the only real pleasure in life, is in ones own family.  
	I saw Mr. Legare this evening, who spoke of you.  Mr. Bull introduced him to me.  I saw Dr. Hayne also this evening.  General Thompson & Mrs. Walker will leave before you arrive.  I will endeavour to get a room at this hotel for you.

	My bust is said to be a fine likeness.  The man who cut my likeness on paper several years since is here now.  He is cutting the whole Legislature.  You & all the children may have your likeness cut.

	There was a great to do here today.  The volunteers arrived here from Chester & paraded through the district.  They will be in Charleston tomorrow.

	I am now engaged in court constantly.  I am glad to hear you are pleased with Charleston & your friends there.

	You must write me again before you come uplet me hear from you Friday night.

	I must now conclude.  Kiss the children for me.  I am very anxious to see the little creatures.  I hope Anna & all of them have improved by their visit to the city.  Tell Will I expect to see him a man in behaviour.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & shall be prepared to meet you at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening. I do not suppose there will be any danger of the children catching scarlet fever.  It will give me great pleasure to meet you all again.  It seems a long time since I saw you.  And I have been in a hurry ever since, not time to do any thing. 	

	I made a speech of one hour length today in the Senate on the Rail Road, which drew a great crowd & was well received.  Tomorrow I speak on the Electoral question which is made the special order at one oclock.  Today I have been in court a good deal.  I wish you were here, to be present when I speak.

	The election of Law Judge will take place tomorrow.  Col. Dawkins, Whitner, & Withers are candidates.  Who will be elected I know not.  General Caldwell was elected Chancellor.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees.  We have elected two ProfessorsPelham & Williamson [Mathew Williams].

	I must prepare for my speech in the morning & therefore must conclude,

	Col. Townes is unwellheard from Greenville.  They are all well there.  Col. Hoke wrote me that my negroes were doing pretty well.  Jim & Minerva had a fuss & he came very near sending both of them to jail.  I rec[eived  a letter from McBee about the rail road.

	I shall expect to see you with great anxiety on Saturday evening.  You must not disap[p]oint metake care of the children.

	Give my love to your Aunts & thank your Aunt Mrs. Turnbull in my name for her hospitality & kindness to you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I hope by this hour you are comfortably seated in our Home with the children all around you eating their suppers & the servants coming in to see you.  Today we have had rain & I have thought you all the same.  But you were fortunate to escape so well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip, & that the children gave you no annoyance.  

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Martin who invoked the President of the Senate Col. DeTreville, Moses, Boozer &c.  I like Martin very much.  He said the first thing he thought of when he saw the sun rising Sunday morning, was that you would have a pleasant day.  I do not like Col. Isaac Hayne much.  He seems cold & sly.  Manifests no disposition to become acquainted with me & I have shown none towards him.  He seems not disposed to approach me or to have much to say when I approach him.  I think our dislike is mutual, & likely to continue.

	Dr. Goodwyn told me that Mrs. Goodwyn was coming to our room to tell you goodbye but prudence had you to bed.  She had taken tea out that evening.  Col. Davie spoke of my pretty mountain children whom he had seen running about in the Piaz[z]a.  

	The likeness of the whole family is finished & makes a pretty group as Col. Ashe says.  I have got a gilt frame for it.  You look quite natural.  Your dress & hair are taken very accurately and I thank youralso.  Mine is not so well as the other.  Anna & Frank show rather better than Will.  All look well enough.  Will is standing near me & Anna near you.  Frank between.

	I have to go down in the Senate tonight at seven oclock & will finish my letter after I return.  Col. Town[e]s, Sam Earle & Dr. Earle all go up in the morning.  I will send this letter by Col. Townes,

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just returned from the State House through a terrible rain & deep mud.  This is one of the worst nights I ever saw.  How glad I am that you are not travelling.  

	We have had a great deal of discussion tonight in the Senate & I feel much exhausted.  I claim the credit of having saved many thousand dollars for the State this night.

	I have just heard of a most melancholy death. Mrs. Seabrook, once Miss B the wife of a member of the Legislature, married last Summer, & I met them at Saratoga Springs, gay & joyous.  He was a very young man & his wife not more than 17 years old.  She died suddenly from mis.  Her husband went to the rail road tonight & heard of her death.  He fainted & appeared for some time a maniac.  Another member Mr. Barnes of Lancaster lost his wife last week in the same way.

	I must now bid you good night.  I hope to meet you Sunday evening.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours truly, B.F, perry

I have but a few moments to write you by Mr. Butler.  Last night it was twelve oclock when I got my supper on my return from the State House.  For the last three nights we have not [adjourned] until near eleven oclock.

	I recd your letter last evening& was glad to hear you were all well, & that your party was to take place after my return.  But in postponing it, you may disappoint Mr. McBees family from North Carolina which you ought not to do.

	Edward Rhett took dinner with me the other day & enquired kindly about you & your mother.  He told me some anecdotes about you & Mrs. Potter in New Haven.   He seemed astonished when I told him Susan had been married whilst I was in Columbia.  He said he thought she had returned not to marry.

	I will endeavour to bring the little presents you name but I shall not have time to get them.  Indeed I have no time to do anythingnot even to go & see Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin.

	For several days past we have some hard discussion in the Senate in which I have taken a part.  The election of the circuits has taken place again.  Mr. Ward of George Town said to me he wished me to be a Judgesomeday & did notme to have to come to George Town so early as the court now sits.  I was elected a Trustee of the college yesterday.

	I was one of a special committee on the Beaufort College.  Mr. Robert Barnwell sent for me in court to talk about the college & the business before the committee.  I was much pleased with him.  He afterwards appeared before the committee & made a speech and an admirable one it was.

	The governor says he will not make up his decision in Wells case for four or five weeks.

	It is now near eleven oclock and I have just returned from the Senate.  You must expect only a few lines.  From ten to three I was engaged in court.  From three I have been engaged in the Senate till ten with the exception of time to get dinner.

	I was disappointed last stage by Mr. Earle.  He says he is going in the morning & will carry this letter. Thomas Butler is here also & William Rowland but they will not go till the next stage.

	Your very welcome letter was recd this evening enclosing [not present] Simms note.  I do not wish you to postpone your party on my account.   I had rather you should have it before my return.  But if you see proper to postpone it untill after I reach home it will make no difference with me.  Your letter did not scold me as much as I expected about the purchase of books.  I hope before this time you have sent your fruit.  The grapes are nice and delicious.

	I shall no doubt surprise you when I inform you that I am a candidate.  The joint committee to nominate Trustees of the South Carolina College has put my name down amongst them.  The Legislature has to vote on it tomorrow.  This was done without my knowledge.  It is considered a high honor.  Dr. Gibbs, Col. Goodwin, General Caldwell & Col. McCord have all been electioneering for it the whole session & are disappointed.  They have not been nominated.  Whilst I have been who never thought of it & was greatly surprised when I heard of the nomination.  The Board of Trustees consists of the most distinguished men in the State.

	I have no time to write you about our legislation.  I should be glad to hear Frank talk a little tonight.  OI hope Will has sent his letter.  Tell Anna if I had time I would write her one.

	Mr. Walker has been sick for three days past, but is better.   He came very near going out as Bob Spurgeon did by hard drinking.    Bob says nothing about it.  I have heard nothing positive from the Governor.

	Mr. Earle has been in my room & just left & it is now near twelve oclock in the night & I must bid you good night my dear wife, B.F. Perry

	Mr. Thompson was here this morning & I write you a line merely to inform you that I shall be at home tomorrow.

	I had only three small cases here & two of them have been disposed of.  The other will not be tried, but requires my presence today.  Col. [James H.] Irby is here, came last night & I wish to close our trade with his note.  He informs me that Maria is satisfied, & from what he tells me of the management of his negroes I have no doubt he is a good master.  He is anxious to gethome again.

	We have quite a number of Lawyers here in attendance on court.  Col. Dawkins, Irby, Waites, Thompson, Young &c.  They are all complaining of hard times in their profession.  Henry tells me that both he & Dean who are in copartnership will not make $1000 this year between them.  He seemed greatly surprised when I told him that I had already received $900 this year.

  	I am very much pleased with Judge Withers.  In my opinion he is the ablest man on the Bench.  He is quite pleasant & agreeable on the bench.  There were some doubts about his temper.

	Kiss the children for me & tell Willey he must continue.  There is to be a great Fair here tonight & if any little thing suits I will buy it for a present for the children or you.  Thompson is leaving.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	I am not well this evening.  Last night I had an attack diarrhea prostrated me for a time.  Today I have been all day labouring in a capital case for which I shall receive no fee.  The poor fellow is unable to pay a lawyer for defending him.  He was convicted last court of the murder of Vance & got a new trial.  In the absence of Col. Leitner I have been assigned counsel for him by the court.

	I hope I shall feel better in the morning.  If I do not, I shall not be able to continue in the management of the case which will take all day again.

	I have seen Dr. Teague but have not had a settlement with him yet.  I mustin the morning.  I expect he will not feel very willing to pay me as much as I think I ought to have.

	Elford Thompson, Speers & Wells came down this morning in the stage, but brought me no news from Greenville except that my dog & Moonys son were all the talk theregreat threats are made against.  I hope Jim will not let him be killed before I return.

       I have not seen any of Captain Cunninghams family or heard from them.

	The weather is so bad this morning that I shall not return home today unless there is a change.  The rain has been pouring down in torrents for the last two days.

	I have got through with my business & am anxious to be at home on many accounts, but I have too much love for my wife & children to expose myself {on] such a day as this is.  Besides I have some regard for my own comfort & health.

	I was quite unwell when I wrote you last, but am pretty much recovered now.  A ride in the rain all day might make me sick again.

	I saw Richard Harrison who informed me you were all well, which I was glad to hear but you ought to have written to me.  I did not know him when he first spoke to me.  He came up behind me at the Bar & shook hands, and I was not going to say anything moresupposing it was some young man about the village.  When he told me he had seen you, I then noticed him & recognized him and was very glad to see him.  He is a clever young man.  As he was leaving the Bar I told him to give my respects to his Bride.  He said there was no other lady in Sumter., that I ought to send some compliments to, for she was greatlywith me and had a great deal to say about our meeting at Saratoga Springs.  It was Miss Nelson, a relation of the Bradleys.  

	The poor fellow I defended the other day has been convicted of murder.  I did not make a speech for him, for I know it [was] not worthwhile.  Mr. Speers & Garlington spoke in his defence.  I examined the witnesses.  They are now trying his accomplice & will convict him of murder also.  The next case is a woman for killing her child! and she will be convicted too.  

	I truly regret that I shall not be able to see you & the children tonight.  Kiss them for me & tell Frank to pray for Pa to comehome.  Tell Will to keep head and Anna to learn her book so as to say her lesson to me.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines this evening as Col. Thompson says he will return in the morning.

	I shall probably get off Thursday though it is uncertain how long a certain case will occupy the court.  I am trying to compromise it, but do not expect to succeed.

	We have very little business here & a prospect of less next court.  I have recd two hundred dollars on Mattisons note.  Suddith says he will pay me $50 at Greenville court on Fowlers note and $100 from Major Henry in Mr. Thomas Case will enable us to square off & have some balance.  But the Sawyers prospect bis now a gloomy one.

	I find it rumored here that I will be a candidate for Congress, but the more I think of it the less inclined am I.  How can I give up the pleasures & vexations of you & the children for six months?  How can you & the children do without my counsel & advice?

	General Whitner has given me an invitation to go see his wife, children, & coons.  I told him the wife & children were inducement enough without putting in the coons.

	I have sent Col. [John] Bausketts money to General McDuffie by Mr. Perrin.

	We had a pleasant dinner on the roadside on Sunday.  Butler made a fire & we ate in great comfort.

	I have neither seen nor heard anything of Mr. Sharpe.

	I have just written Col. Townes a long letter on the prospects of the Rail Road.  The people of Columbia are now very much in favor of it.  Col. Preston made them a speech which has completely revolutionized them.  

	I have nothing to write you of interest.  We had a pleasant journey down, Col. Coleman, Mr. McBee, General Thompson & Major Earle.  We feasted high on the road every day at twelve oclock.

	I have not yet had time to purchase Vardrys chair.  I am much pressed with businesshave been appointed to examine law studentshave to argue a case in the Court of Errors tomorrowhave to attend the Rail Road meeting &c &c.  You must therefore value this hasty epistle, written amidst so much hurry.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell Will I shall expect to find him head of his class.  I will endeavour to bring all the children some little present.  I wish you to write me every mail.  It is a great relief to my mind to hear from you. 

	I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Webster in Columbia on Thursday.  They are making great preparations to entertain him.  I expect I shall have to attend their Ball.

	It is probable that Mr. Kilgore will be elected President of the Rail Road Company.

	I have seen nothing of Col. Taylor or any of your kin.

	Col. Dawkins & his new wife have gone to Charleston to see Mr. Webster.

	Col. Herndon has given up his dye for his hair & he is now as gray headed as any man you ever saw.

	We have very few lawyers here at this time.

	The rail road convention adjourned last evening, & I now have time to write you, which I had not before.  

	I recd your letter last night & thank you kindly for it, but.you know too well my deep feelings of love & affection for you & the childrenanxious to hear from you every mail.

	Your letter was handed to me as I was starting last night at nine oclock to see Mr. Webster at Col. Prestons.  I stopped a read it here & then again this morning.    The Party at Prestons was a magnificent one.  Mrs. Preston took my arm & carried me to Mrs. Webster & gave me an introduction.  Mrs. Webster is a very tall masculine & intellectual looking woman about forty five, dresses very fine & has no children.  I had no opportunity of talking to her, as she was engaged in conversation with some one when I was introduced.  Mrs. Preston enquired about you & why you did not come with me to Columbia.  She said she regretted that she did not hear you were here last winter that she would have called to see you &c &c.

	Mr. Webster looked very much pleased at his reception.  I told him I was happy to see him in South Carolina & he thanked me very politely.   He made a short speech to the college Boys from Col. Prestons Portico.  They had illuminated the college & formed a torch light procession.  The Judges were all present.  The supper was a magnificent display of strawberries & ice creams, wines of every description.  I never before saw such a quantity of Strawberries.

	Dr. Lieber gives a party tonight & I have recd a written invitation.  The governor gives a dinner tomorrow at 5 oclock & has sent me an invitation done up in most beautiful style.  They have a Ball tomorrow night to which I am not invited, but can invite myself by paying five dollars.

	Judge ONeall has been elected President of the Rail Road companyMcBee, Coleman & Kilgore directors for Greenville.  We had quite an interesting meeting.  On my motion Col. Preston made a most magnificent speech to the convention at night.  Mr. Poinsett, Col. Elmore & many other distinguished men were at the convention.

	I forgot to mention that I saw Mrs. Poinsett last night at Col. Prestons.  She enquired most kindly after you & the children.  I told her I had just rece[ive]d a letter from you in which you stated you had been out to her residence after Strawberries, but found none.  She said she was very sorry to hear the vines were not bearing.  They go to Greenville on Monday.  I have just recd a valuable present from Col. Summer of some hundred fifty volumes of Congressional booksExecutive documents &c &c.  They are all bound & very large works, & will fill a large book case from top to bottom.  It will be a large addition to my Library.  He bought them with the printing office & has no use for them.

	I saw Judge Butlers little daughter at Col. Prestons.  She told me that she was looking for her Father to come after herthat she was well pleased with Columbia but liked Greenville much better.  She seems very grave & sedate, as much as her grandfather Hayne.

	Mr. Webster has just been into the court of Appeals where I saw him sitting on the bench with the Judges & a great crowd in the court house to see him.

I will this morning conclude my long letter as I shall not have time to do so this evening after my return from the governors dinner.

	I expected to have gone last night to Dr. Liebers party, but I felt so much fatig[u]ed & exhausted that I could not muster courage enough to walk through the mud & sit up till twelve oclock again.  And these parties are dull placesgreat crowds of strangers thrown together & nothing to talk about.

	Mr. Webster dined with the Miss Hamptons yesterday & went to look at Hamptons negroes & see their mode of living &c.

	I have purchased for you Amy Herbert & Holmes Gardners but could not get the other books on your list.  The other purchases I will make in due time.

	I do not know when I shall be able to leave here, perhaps not before Tuesday or Wednesday next.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell them to be good & Papa will bring them something.  I am glad to hear Will has turned down four more boys.  I hope he will soon be head.

	I must now go to my breakfast.  I will write you again before I leave Columbia & give you an account of the dinner.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I recd your short letter by Fridays mail, & I truly regret that Susan & Luther are not doing better.  He is a great fool & I have no doubt a very disagreeable husband.  But Susan should reflect that she was not a stranger to him when they married, & she promised before her God to love, honor & obey him.

	General Thompson did speak to McBee as we came down about doing something for Luther.  He said he was afraid to mention Pinckney on account of his interest.  McBee told him Luther was not capable of doing anything, that he & Tench Corson had already spent for him $30,000.  This I should suppose hardly true.

	We had a pleasant dinner at Governor Johnsons & all made speeches, drank a good deal of wine, & went to the Ball.  Judges, Governor, Webster & all.  There was a very large assembly at the Ball, but very little beauty.  I did not see one pretty face in the room.  One of two things has certainly happened to me.  The Ladies are less pretty than they used to be or I have lost my perception of female beauty.

	Col. Dawkins & wife were at the Ball.  I had considerable conversation with her & she was the only lady I did speak to.  She seems pleasant & agreeable  She said all wives were ambitious for their husbands to be great men.  

	Yesterday I was invited to dine at Dr. Gibbes with Mr. Webster & the Judges & Professors in college.  The dinner was the most interesting party I have yet been at.  Webster covered a great deal & his conversations were remarkably interesting.

	I went to church this morning & sat with Dr. Gibbes & Chancellor Harper.  Mr. Webster & lady were there.  The new Episcopal church is a magnificent building & beautiful inside. The handsomest church in South Carolina.  Mrs. Alexander Taylor was just in front of me.  I went up to her after service & she seemed really glad to see me, took my arm & I conducted her to her carriage.  She enquired after the children & yourself, said her children had the [w]hooping cough.  She invited me to call & see them.

	I recd your letter this evening dated Friday evening & was truly glad to hear from you.  In it you mention the expected marriage OF Miss Walker.  I heard a [piece of scandal which I will mention.  Dr. Ellet & his wife have separated on account of that littlefellow Theodore Gourdine!!  And it is said he seems rather proud of the

	I have nothing to write you since I wrote you last, except that I have made some purchasesa little chair for Susan which I have sent by the stagetwo large rocking chairs for you & myself price $7.00 with cane bottoms.  They will be sent up by wagon.  I have purchased a ball for William, a glass doll for Anna, a knife & a trumpet for Frank and I will give William my old knife as I have bought a new one for myself.

	I will write you a few lines by Mr. & Mrs. Thompson who go to Greenville in the morning though I have nothing worth telling you.  But you requested me to write when I was about starting & I will do so.  

	I hope you & the children are all well & doing well in my absence.  How long I shall be detained here is very doubtful, perhaps till Friday.  Two of my cases have been continued, & the other is at the foot of the Dockett.  You must postpone your contemplated event till I return home.  Next week is the proper time.  I will then be at home.  But I should not regret my return to find you well & an additional member of the family in this happy world.

	I have been fortunate in seeing today one hundred dollars of Major Henry as a part of my costs in the case of Croft vs. Thomas.  This was rather better luck than I expected when I left home, for I remember saying to you I should not receive a dollar.  

	Chancellor Caldwell is presiding & it is his second circuit since his election to the Bench.  I am much pleased with him as a Judge.  He is very kind & civil & sufficiently learned to make a good chancellor.  Col. Herndon & Mr. Young are the only lawyers here from the adjoining districts except General Thompson & myself.

	Mrs. Thompson says her health is very much improved from her short visit to the Glenn Springs.  Miss McClanahan, daughter of Sam McClanahan of Greenville, took the first honor at the Lexington school the other day, a good medal worth ten or twenty dollars for the first composition.  This will fill Sam with joy.  There were thirty competitors.
	
I see Mr. Tench Carson here.  He looks quite gray.

	I saw the Dantzellers on Sunday expecting to get dinner.  You know I  refused to carry everything with me to eat.  I saw a good many persons in the House & enquired if Dantzeller was at home.  They informed me that he was a corpse in the house & had died that morning!  I rode on without dinner to this place.

	I have enclosed an editorial notice of the Spartanburgh Paper on the Southern Quarterly which I am sure you will read with pleasure as it contains a compliment to your husband.

	I met the family of Mr. William Elliot here on Sunday evening at supper but though they were some of the ordinary borders till they had gone the next day.  They are certainly very ordinary looking.  I sat opposite to them & thought they were theof some shop keepers.

	Old Mr. Parker enquired about your mother today & said your uncle John McColl married a very near relation of his, a Miss Lesesne (Lesayne). This is all news to me.

	Look for me about Friday.  Good night & kiss the children.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines this evening as you requested me to do though I have nothing to write you about.  It would be much more satisfactory to [me] if I could hear from you.  I hope however that nothing will happen till I reach home.  You must postpone as you promised and I will endeavour to be at home on Saturday.

	I shall leave here tomorrow evening & go as far as old Pendleton.  The next day I will stop & see Mr. [John C.] Calhoun & spend an hour or two with him.  I will also call to see Mrs. Sharp if I possibly can do so.

	It is pretty generally rumored here that I am to be a candidate for Congress & I believe is generally approved of.  Mr. Keith told me that it was the general wish of the people of Pickens district.  Mr. Sloan says he will not be a candidate as I have been informed.  Mr. Webb tells me that Col. [James L.] Orr had an idea of offering but that he would not oppose me.  The impression is that I will have no opposition if I become a candidate.  

	Mr. Perrin is the only lawyer here from the other districts except myself.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not well.  Mr. & Mrs. Roper arrived here this evening from Greenville.  I saw Mr. Isaac Henry who told me something strange had happened in Greenville since I left home.  I did not see Col. [Benajah] Dunham as he hoped though whilst I was in Court I heard Mr. Roper saying this evening at the supper table that he was delighted with Greenville, that place was beautiful & the people very dear &c.  It seems he had been staying at this House sometime before he went to Greenville.  His wife is quite a contrast in size to himself.

	This has been a delightful day.  I hope Charles will go on with his plowing.  Sunday was a drizzling day & my mare behaved badly.  Broke the trace as I expected when I started, fretted a great [deal] with the fl.   I mended the trace & came on very well.

	You must write me a line by Col. Townes or General Thompson who will both come over to Pickens on Wednesday.  Write what letters have come for me.    How you & the children are doing [well] & the servants.

	I must now conclude this letter & bid you good night.  Kiss the children for me & tell them to behave well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines tonight as Colonel Townes will return in the morning.

	We had quite a spirited meeting here today, & I made a pretty good speech which has taken well.  My prospects are as good as I could expect & I rather think that I will beat Colonel Orr at almost every Box in the district.  From Pumpkin Town Esquire Sutherlin writes me I will get two thirds of the Box.  & others tell me that I will get three to one at Fair Play.  W. Lee says I will not loose a vote on Corneross.  At Bachelors Retreat I will beat  The news from other places is very similar.

I saw Lee & gave him the bundles for Mrs. Dunlap.  He gave me one for Anne.  I saw Foster & his son Clark.  Josiah was not here.  His health is bad.  The rest of my relations are all well.  Josiah has a fine crop.

	In consequence of the absence of General Tompson I have been employed in several of Keiths cases.  I do not now expect to get off from here before Friday morning.  William seems very well satisfied & is now sitting up reading Headeys Lives beside me & it is near nine oclock.

	Colonel Townes left home this morning at four oclock he tells me & returns in the morninga pretty flying visit.

	I have nothing more in the way of news to write you.

	Kiss the children for me.  Will had a present of chesnuts today from a countryman & will carry them home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have but one moment to write you by Mr. Elford as I have just understood that he is going this morning.

	Willie is behaving like a little man & is the admiration of all who see him.  He sits in court, goes to the tavern, plays with those around him & reads Hendleys Washington & amuses himself very well.  He says I must tell you & Anna, Frank, & Fanny that he wishes to see you.

	There is very little business in court & we shall probably get off Thursday morning.  I have been employed in several cases since I came here.

	In regard to politics I am doing well & have flattering news from all quarters.  We have a public meeting today on the Wilmot Proviso.

	Tell Jim to sow & plough in the rye.

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening & received your letter after tea, for which I thank you more sincerely.  It always gives me the greatest interest to hear from you & the children although you may have nothing more to write than that you are all well.

	Major Earle informed me last night that his wife & children passed through Columbia yesterday evening & that he only got to see them in the streets.  I told him that if I had been in his place, they should have staid all night or I would have gone with them.  He had not seen them for four weeks!
He should be ashamed to mention the fact and I rather thought Major Jones who was present was ashamed of his conduct.  But you need not speak of it.

	You must not pay any attention to the reports & news your friend Moore tells you about election.  I know how to understand these matters & you do not.  They are too idle & foolish to do me harm.  I think the Rail Road will have a good effect on the election in Laurens & perhaps loose me some votes in Anderson.  

	I met Dr. Goodwin last evening in the presence of Reed & Alexander who expressed his great regret at loosing me in the Senate, & joy at my having a wide field to display my usefulness in.

	Yesterday I travelled in company with Col. & Mrs. Coleman & we stopped on the road at dinner together.    Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett did not start so early.  The company was all pretty much behind.  

	Major Jones & Col. Townes fell in company at Newberry & had the pleasure of riding in the stage to Columbia.  Townes told me he saw you riding out & supposed you were all well.

	I am glad to hear that Mr. Bradshaw speaks so highly of Anna.  I think she is remarkably smart & will no doubt learn fast.  Keep her at school.  We have great cause to be thankful for all of our children.  They are all uncommon childrenvery handsome remarkably smart, very good & well behaved & seem kind & affectionate.  I think you have a great deal to be thankful for in this life & I hope we will both appreciate it & enjoy itnot disturb ourselves by looking on the small dark speeches which may be seen in ouror which we may imagine we see.

	You say I must write about Edward.  He does well, & I hope he will be of service to me and will learn a great deal.

	I have not much to write you this morning.  If anything of consequence should transpire during the day I will write you again tonight.  I write now because it is before breakfast & I am at leisure.

	I have seen very few persons yet.  All the Greenville delegation board at this house except Col. Townes.  He stays at Hunts just opposite & came over last evening to see us.  Major Henry says he caught cold at my house & has not been well since.  He seems inform.  I saw John Cunningham at Newberry.  He says Pamela has had chills & fever since her return from Charleston & is very much reduced in health & spirits again.  She is at Ben Yanceys.

	Tell the children they must behave themselves & I will bring them a present.  Willie must write me.  Let me know how all the servants are doing.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Willie

	I have just received your pretty letter, & am delighted with it.    Col. Townes could hardly believe it possible that you had written it.  I hope you will write me another one soon.  It will give me great pleasure to hear from you & see your letters and the writing of them will improve you very much.

	I look to you my dear little son to sustain & improve on what little of reputation I may have for talent & usefulness.  Your opportunities will perhaps be better than your Papas & therefore you must endeavour to be a smarter & greater man than I am.  I think you have a great deal of talent, & if you will only study & be good you will one day make a great man.  But first of all learn to be a good boy.  Never tell an untruth or do a dishonorable thingnever quarrel or fightalways be kind to your little play fellowslove your little sisters & brothers, be good to the servants & everybody & then everybody will love you.

	The next time I come to Columbia I will bring you with me & perhaps I may carry you to Washington withy me should I be elected to congress.

	Since I commenced writing you this letter I have had to stop & go to the College to attend a meeting of the Board of Trustees.  I have just returned through the rain &, & it is now near eleven oclock in the night.

	I hope to see you in College in the course of seven or eight years.

	Tell you mother I wish to see you all very much & that I have recd her letter tonight & thank her for it.  

	Tell Anna & Frank they must be good children.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I hope to hear from you tonight but I cannot write you after receiving your letter,

	The Board of Trustees meet this evening at ? past six oclock & I must attend them.  Yesterday I was engaged all day in the Court of Appeals & Errors.  The day before we did little or nothing in the Senate & today not much.

	I have seen Col. Taylor & General Martin.  They enquired kindly after you & said their families were all well.  I told Taylor that I had some packages for his wife, but it has been raining so much that I have not sent them up.  I saw Judge Butler this morning.  He looks very well.

	You may tell your mother I have engaged a chair at $3.50 if I can send it up.  I have bought me a Buena Vista coat, price $9.00, socks made out of--vest $3.50 & pantaloons $6.50 & boots $9.00.  These are my purchases & nothing else.

	I saw Mr. Symmes just now, who enquires after you & your mother.  He gave me a long talk about Congress.  Says Orr is a particular friend of his & he told him he ought not to have offended me.

	There was some talk of running me for Chancellor until Colonel Memminger took the field.  Hew is a candidate & General Whitner is not.

	Edward does very well & is some help to me.  He seems very much pleased.

	I really begin to wish to see you & the children again, & have been thinking how & what I will do when I go to Washington.

	Nothing new on the Rail Road subject.  What will be the result I know not.

	Kiss the children & take care of them & yourself.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Letter 80

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I know you will be glad to receive a letter from me although it may contain nothing of interest.  I can well imagine myself in your situation every mail night, waiting to receive a letter & I know that I should be disappointed in not receiving one.

	I hope to hear from you again tonight & perhaps Willie may be enduced to write me again this week.

	I sent your package to Mrs. Taylor yesterday by Edward.  He saw no one but Colonel Taylor.  I have not seen the Colonel since.  Yesterday I saw Col. Isaac Hayne.  He says they are all well in Charleston & enquired after you & your mother & family.  I do not think he looks altogether as well as he did last winter.

	Gilmore Simms called the other night at my room after I had gone to bed & paid me a long visit.  He was deeply interested in the election of his friend Col. Aldrich, who was a candidate for commissioner in Equity for Barnwell & who was yesterday elected.  Tell Anne that he expressed a deep interest in her health & welfaresaid she had made a lasting impression on his mind, & from the way he talked one might suppose his heart too.

	General Martin tried to dissuade me from going to Congress the other day by telling me that I  would be elected President of the Senate whenever [Angus] Patterson retired, & that this was a more honorable position than a seat in Congress.

	I have purchased Kohls Russia, Austria, England, Ireland & Scotland in three volumes for six dollars.  You may remember extracts from the work & know how interesting they were.  I have got them to read to you this winter.  I have also purchased ancient & modern sculpture, a very fine & large English work, full of the most beautiful plates for three dollars fifty cents.  This work in England I have no doubt [would] cost ten or fifteen dollars.

	I have just recd a letter from Keith of Pickens giving me good news about the election.  Col. Grisham & Miles Norton are here, & they speak favorably of Pickens.

	The election for Chancellor will take place next week & there are several candidates Memminger, Whitner, Dargan, Haynesworth, DeSaussure, Wardlaw &c.  I suppose Col. Memminger will be elected & I am sorry that Whitner permits himself to be run.  He had better keep back for the law bench.

	We have nothing new on the Rail Road subjectnor have we done anything in the Legislature.  General Thompson is here & expresses a great interest in my election.  He had some sharp sparring with [James Lawrence] Orr at Newberry.  Orr charged Greenville with a want of courtesy in debate.  I replied & he stopped me & said it was no I that he alluded to, but some other member.  Thompson told him to name the member, but he declined doing so.  

	Tell me what present I shall bring you & the children.

	My breakfast is now nearly ready & I must conclude.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  I had received no letter from you the mail before this.  I hope you & Willie have rece[ive]d the letters I wrote you some days since.  Tell Willie he must answer my letter.  Col. Summer enquires after him & I told him Willie said he must send his dog.

	I forgot to mention in my first letter that something passed between Choice & myself about swapping your mothers carriage for his.  He has a very large one coming on from New York, & intends keeping the present one for himself.  I told him it was not a suitable carriage for a gentleman, & that Mrs. McCall had one that was & did not suit her, that his would suit her & that probably they might make a swap.  He promised me to look at it.  His carriage would suit your mother very well & is remarkably cheap.  It cost only $325.00 harness & all, delivered in Hamburgh.  I think it a very fine carriage for a family & would suit your mother.  When I return I will endeavour to make the exchange if your mother desires it.

	I have been writing letters all day today to my friends in Pickens.  Keith sent me a long list of names to write to.  I think it is the best & easiest mode of electioneering.  

	Last night I went to the Theatre with Major Henry, Col. Ware & Mr. Duncan.  The performance was only tolerable & the theatre is an old & uncomfortable building.  There were not more than one hundred persons in it.  

	Tonight a boy brought me a letter & said that a man below was waiting for an answer.  I broke it open & it commenced Dear Father.  I looked at the signature and saw C.C.P.  I then turned to the superscription & saw it as directed to Col. Benjamin Perry.  I felt very sorry at the mistake.  It is very likely some of your letters may be sent to my namesakes room, & he will commence reading about Col. Orr & the rail road & Laurens & Anderson and suppose his wife has gone crazy.

	I have really nothing of interest to write you.  I did not go to church today.  Edward did go twice.  He put on his Sunday coat & looked quite neat.  He does very well but is rather small to be of much service at so crowded a table.  

 	Major Jones came to me the other day to borrow fifty dollars, & said he was out of money.  I told him I had none to lend nor have Iyou must not speak of this however [page torn].  

	I am very anxious to see you all.  Fanny cannot be sweater than she was when I saw her last.  How I should like to be with you all this evening.  I told Col. Ware that I thought [if elected] I should stay in Congress about six monthsthat I could not bear the thought of being from my family.

	Mr. Simpson came here tonight on his way to Washington.  He says Mrs. Simpson will go on in May next.  

	Tell Pamela [Cunningham] if you are writing to her that I shall value very highly her present.  Mr. Calhoun & Burt are expected here tomorrow.  If anything occurs tomorrow I will write you again.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter yesterday & have not heard from you since.  But I am in the humor of writing again, & what is more I have time to write you this evening, & may not have tomorrow.  

	The business of the Senate is growing full of interest.  Yesterday I made my first speech & succeeded in defeating a claim of my friend John Bradly of Sumter for a negro killed whilst working on the road.  I thought the claim unjust.  Therefore went against it although it was the claim of a friend.

	Last night the Board of Trustees met again, & we had quite an interesting meeting & considerable speaking.  I took a part for the first time on the Board.

	Today we had quite an interesting discussion on the Electoral Bill.  The rear of the Senate chamber was filled with Ladies, & in front of me on the other side were several members of Congress on their way to Washington.  Black opened the debate & I followed.  It was not a set speech, but I did very well.  Miss Yates, as she came by me, whispered that she was delighted to have an opportunity of hearing me speak.  I had not spoken to her.

	I drew up a long Report on the Mexican War which I first read in the Committee on Federal Relations and they addressed it in full.  I then read it to the Senate in the presence of Judge Butler & other members of Congress, some from Georgia.  I afterwards went to speak to the Judge. & he asked me for a copy of it.  General Harralson of Georgia & Shannon of the Military Commission in Congress, said he was delighted with my report, that he approved every sentiment & was gratified to find such sentiments to be popular in South Carolina.

	There is a very strong war feeling in the State & in the Legislature especially.  Colonel [Franklin J.] Moses moved to have five hundred extra copies of my speech printed for distribution amongst the people.  Colonel [G.W.] Dargan moved that it be made the order of the day for Friday next.  I drew it up hastily & had no idea that it would produce the sensation it did in the Senate.

	They are going to move against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson in the House with a view of making him resign.  I feel sorry for the poor old man.  It is very likely he will resign this week.  Allen of Barnwell is the member who is going to move on the subject.

	    I find that I commenced my letter on a half sheet of paper & shall have to continue it on another half sheet.  Since writing Col. [Thomas E.] Ware came in & has delayed me.  Our member of Congress Richard F. Simpson is here, & spoke to me today to form a copartnership in law at Anderson C.H. with a Son of Dr. Broyles who has just been admitted to the Bar, & who is a clever & talented young man.  I told him I would do so with great pleasure.    He is a nephew of his wife.  

	I saw Mr. {Joel Roberts] Poinsett today & he will remain here for some time.  Several of the members of the Legislature have made enquiries after you & the children,  They seemed to have been struck with my family & observed that they could but admire us as we were walking about with the children.    Dr. Waldo made this remark this evening.

	I have made arrangements with Dr. [Edward] Sill of the Columbia Telegraph to send off two or three hundred copies of my Report.

	I must now conclude.  I will write you again tomorrow if anything of interest occurs.  Edward is a great help to me.  Tell Wille to write me.  Edwin P. Jones is making application for admission in Equity.  I was put on the committee to examine the students in law but could not serve.  Jones came to me today to write his Petition & give him a certificate of moral character which I did with great pleasure.

	Kiss the children for me & believe me truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I have just been to the Post office & recei[ve]d your letter & also one from your mother.  I was very much pleased to hear from you all & learn that you were all well & doing well.

	It gives me great pleasure to receive a letter from you & you write so well too that it makes me feel proud of you.  I suppose however your mother helps you a little in dictating the letter.  But it is written remarkably well & if you go on improving fast you will soon write a better hand than I do.  I showed your letter to General Thompson & Mr. Duncan but did not let them read it.

	I wish my dear son that you were with me.  In travelling you are great company for me & I like to have you with me in my room & hear you ask questions.  I love you so much & am so proud of you that I should like always to have you with me.

	Colonel Summer enquires about you very often & says he is sorry he has no dog to send you.  The free dog he brought with him from the north he has given to Colonel Leitner of Spartanburgh.

	 I will bring you the presents you desire when I return.  Tell your mother I will bring hers also, & say to her that I was very glad to receive her letter.  I put one in the Post office for her this evening.  You ought to have recd your letter one mail sooner.  I sent Edward with it about daylight to the Post office, but I suppose the mail had been made up.

	Tell your mother that nothing has occur[r]ed today or I would have written to her again.  It is rumored that Judge Richardson is to be impeached.  They have given him till Saturday to resign, & if he does not resign by that time articles of impeachment will be proferred against him.  I am truly sorry for the old man.

	Next Monday is commencement in College when all the boys make speeches before the Legislature, Judges, Trustees, Ladies & people generally.  It would give me great pleasure to have you in College & sit & listen to your speech.  This pleasure I hope one day to enjoy.  You must make haste & prepare yourself & when you are in College you must study hard & take the first honor.  I believe Judge Frosts son takes the first honor this Winter.

	But my dear son the first object of my heart is that you should be a good boy & grow up an honorable and correct mannever do anything wrong or behave badly.  I must now close this letter & send it to the Post office by Edward.  Kiss Anna, Frank & Fanny for me.  Edward says I must tell you all howdy & say he likes Columbia very much.

	Kiss your mother for me & tell her I will write by the next mail if I have time.  I have made arrangements to  send off about 300 copies of my Report on the Mexican War.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I must write you tonight for I am sure I will not have time to do so in the morning or tomorrow evening.

	We have a great deal to do tomorrow.  I shall be engaged in court in the morning attending to a case for Mr. Choice.  The Electoral Bill is discussed in the Senate at one oclock.  The Trustees meet at night & there is an exhibition in the college.

	I went this morning to get my razor mended & found General Martin looking at some beautiful broaches for Ladies, & he proposed that each of us should purchase one & send to our wives.  We did so.  The price is only $1.50 cts & they are really beautiful & a new fashion made out of wire beautifully wrought, large, & intended for common usebut fine enough for any occasion.  

	I have been engaged in court today & heard John Cunningham make a speech.  He speaks well.

	In passing up street I saw one of the finest looking men my eyes ever beheld.  He had a foreign aspect & genius stamped in his face.  I could not keep my eyes off him.  Dr. Gibbes stopped me, & said let me introduce you to Mr. Gliddon of whom you have doubtless heard.  I said to him that I had had the pleasure of reading a most interesting book written by him.  He bowed gracefully & thanked me for the compliment.  He was excessively polite & strikingly handsome, about my age, & heightperhaps not quite so tall.  He is going to lecture on Egypt.

	There was an effort to give Chancellor Harpers heirs [a] years salary today, but it failed by two votes.

	The magnetic telegraph is now in operation between this & Charleston.  	Col. Perry enquired how his sister was & in ten moments the news came back that she was better.  Various messages have been sent to Charleston.  If you wish any word sent to any of your friends I can do so & get an answer for a few cents.  They have messengers at the office to send all over town.

	We have very wet weather & walking is most disagreeable.

	I have made a report on the Mexican War & sent copies of it all over the congressional district.  I made arrangements with Dr. Sill to send them from the Printing office.  

	Tell the children that I was going into Heises today to buy some toys for them & saw some ladies & passed on.  I will get the candy & knife & marbles & doll & rattle &c &c.

	In regard to my books you know that I have a weakness in that way.  But I have derived so much happiness from them that I cant resist the temptation.  My wife, my children & my books are my sole sources of happiness.  With them I can be happy independent of the world & regardless whether elected or beaten for Congress.

	Poor Judge Richardson is to be impeached Saturday.

	Kiss the children for me.  I recd a long letter from Spears on the R Road.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	
I received your letter by Fridays mail, & hope to get one from you this evening.  You commenced your last letter by saying you had nothing to write & yet I think it was the most interesting one I had recd from you this Session.  You spoke of your children & yourself, your household. Servants, &c.  I am exceedingly anxious to be one of your household again.  Indeed, my dear wife, I do not think I can bear a winter in Washington from you & the children.  I begin to have great misgivings about the course I have pointed out for myself.

	I have made a few purchases for you & the children in  ..ioner with your request & instructions.  For you I have bought the beads, also a strand for Susan.  Tell Willie I have bought him a pretty little knife with two blades.  For Anna I have bought a glass doll, and a sheep with a little girl on it, which is very pretty.  For Frank, a knife with a green handle & also a set of marbles.  I have also bought a large quantity of candy of all kinds & shapes, four pounds.  I will purchase a basket for Anne, if I can find oneif not something else.  I wrote you in my last letter about the broach.  For Fanny I have purchased a rattle, whistle & ivory ring all in one, which may be separated into three pieces.

	Yesterday we had the Electoral Bill under discussion & will conclude the debate on Tuesday.  Col. [Franklin J.] Moses made a very able speech in favor of my Bill.  He, all the week kept postponing his speech & at last I found out the cause.  His wife was expected & came Friday night & was in the Senate chamber yesterday waiting to hear him.  She is a tall fine looking woman & is said to be quite intelligent & accomplished.  You may remember how ugly the Colonel is.  Mr. Carrol & Miss Charlotte Smith were in the Senate chamber yesterday & I spoke to them.

	Last night I went to hear Mr. [George] Gliddon in company with General Thompson & others.  I had the pleasure of falling in company there with Col. Preston & Dr. Henry.  There were a good many persons present at the lecture & some ladies.  I was much pleased with the lecture & would tell you a great deal about it if I had time.  I saw a variety of Egyptian curiosities, four or five thousand years old, a mummys coffin, arm, hand, head, scull &c. &c., clothes, shoes, sandals, writing, &c. &c. The likeness of Cleopatra & her son Caesoria.  In looking at Cleopatra I was reminded of Annes face & skin, expression &c. 

	Yesterday I dined with the Governor.  There was a large party, Poinsett, the Judge, Chancellors, Governor [Edward Bishop] Dudley of North Carolina, Governor [John P.] Richardson, Dr. Mr. Petrus who married Miss Harper.  He is a very large & old man, was a widower, & the cousin of Mrs. Harper, had been a member of Congress, did not offer to be anything very great.  Governor Dudley is very large & rather good looking.  General Thompson & General Whitner & Major Henry were also at the dinner.

	  I have been interrupted two or three times since I commenced writing by persons coming into my room.  Colonel Hodges is here from Greenville & he has been to see me.  General Thompson started for home today, by the way of Edgefield.  Tomorrow is commencement in College.  Someone sent me through the Post office a Ball ticket for Commencement Ball.  The ticket has the name of Lipscombe on it & perhaps he sent it.  I suppose he is a student in college, & perhaps a manager.  We had quite [a] contest in the election of two Trustees of the College on Friday night.  Mr. Poinsett was run but got beat by [Robert Wilson] Gibbes & [Francis Hugh] Wardlaw.

	The name you could not make out was Gilmore Simms, the novelist &c. [pagetorn] had just put him in nomination for Lt. Governor last year.  They became rather intimate.  I write you in such haste that I am not surprised you cannot read my letters.

	The Resolutions against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson were introduced yesterday & will be considered on Tuesday next.  The old Judge seems to have brushed up since his impeachment.  He looks five years younger.

	I will now conclude my letter, & go to the Post office to get one from you.  I have been writing out a speech today on the Electoral Bill.  Tell Willie he must write me again.  Tell Anna I am glad to hear she is reading so well.  Tell Frank I think of him dream of me every night.  I expect Fanny will be so much grown I shall hardly know her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Col. Dargan will beat Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger for Chancellor.  We have had three ballotings & no election but Dargan is 21 votes ahead.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not running.

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College commencement & will write you a second letter for this mail.  I do this because I have a leisure & may not have time to write you by the next mail.  The business of the Session is now pressing on us & Judge Richardsons impeachment comes up tomorrow.  The Senate have agreed to adjourn on Tuesday 14th but I have no idea the House will agree to it, or that we shall adjourn that soon.   

	Col. Dargan has just been elected Chancellor by a large vote over Wardlaw & DeSaussure.  Col. Memminger withdrew.

	My Report on the Mexican War has just passed the Senate with only one dissenting vote.  It has been sent to the House & will come up there tomorrow.

	Governor Richardson came to me today, to talk about the Judge & his impeachment.  He says he will defend himself & then resign.  I am truly sorry for the old man.  The Governor asked me my opinion & I gave it promptly that he ought to resign.

	I recd your letter last evening & thank you for your punctuality & kindness in keeping me advised of the news of your household.  It is indeed a great pleasure to hear from you & the children very much.  When absent I love you all more than I do when at home or rather at home I do not realize or feel the extent of my love.  It remains dormant in some measure & is called forth by absence.  I should indeed like to take a peep into my Home this evening & see you & the children.

	I enquired of Col. Isaac Hayne the other day if he had heard from his wife lately & he said she had not written to him  since he had been here.  He then said by way of excuse for her that she did not expect [him] to stay long when he came.  This reflected on him, if he had not written to her since his arrival in Columbia.

	The college commencement was very fine today.  I never saw such a crowd in the Chapel before.  There was an immense crowd of ladies from all parts of the State.  On Saturday they sent a message by means of the magnetic telegraph to Clarks Hotel from Charleston, that a company had just got in the cars for Columbia which would want sixteen rooms.  When they arrived the chambers were all provided for them.  

	Mr. [Richard] Yeadon paid me a visit last night, & will remain here till next week.  I saw Mr. Barnwell the minister in the Senate chamber on Saturday, & I got him a seat by my side & we had a great deal of talk.  He was very pleasant & facetious whilst the debate was going on as to the Electoral Bill.

	Col. Preston made a very fine speech today in College.  All the students did well.  Tell Willie I one day hope to hear him make a speech in college & take the first honor of his class.  Judge Frosts son took the first honor today.  He does not seem to be very smart & has a little squirt in his eyes.  A young man from Camden whose name was Villepigue made the best speech on the character of Benedict Arnold.  Whitemarsh B. Seabrook had a son who took an honor & made a good speech.  The latter sat next to me on the platform as one of the trustees & I enquired of him if the young man was a relation, whilst he was speaking.  He replied that he was his son.  He is good looking & better looking than Archey.

My dear Liz

	I wrote you two letters by last mail & did not then suppose I should have time to write you so soon again.  I have a few moments leisure before breakfast.  I hope to hear from you tonight but shall not have time to write you afterwards.

	Yesterday the Electoral Bill was discussed in the Senate & we had an immense crowd of ladies & gentlemen to hear the debate.  I never saw the Senate chamber so much crowded before.  The ladies actually took the seats of Senators & looked as self possessed as if they had actually been members of our great body.  I was going to speak & therefore could not give up my seat as I was taking notes to reply to Col. DeTreville.  Some fair damsel came in & took a seat beside me which she continued to occupy until I had finished my speech.  I spoke about three quarters of an hour and I believe acquitted myself very well.  Today the discussion is resumed & I shall speak again at one oclock.

Letter 88
Monday night I went to Dr. Gibbes to meet Gliddon & others.  We sat around the table & ate fruits, nuts, cake, drank wine, talked & spent the evening very pleasantly.  He is quite an interesting man in conversation, but did not have much to say about Egypt.  I suppose he keeps his information on the subject for his lectures.

	At ten oclock I went to the Ball, having been presented with a ticket.  General Adams & myself made arrangements to go together.  The room was a very large one & quite crowded with young ladies from all parts of the state.  They were very tastefully & finely dressed.  The Miss Hamptons in rose colors.  I saw Miss Cornelia Crittenden there & spoke to her.  She is assisting in a school here.  Judge Wardlaws daughter was there.  I saw a young lady there, whom I had seen & known very well fifteen or twenty years since.  I told Black that I knew her as Miss Pride and I wished to know what her name was now.  He told me she was still Miss Pride.  Judge Withers told me she had been in Europe & was quite an accomplished woman.  I did not renew my acquaintance.

	After staying an hour or two at the Ball I came off before supper.  I was much amused in looking on at the different faces, & the dancing & waltzing, which is quite affectionate in the position.

	Major [Nathaniel Ridley] Eaves a senator from Chester returned Monday night from Mexico & took his seat yesterday in the Senate.  There was a great to do & he made a speech.  He tells me that Goodlett & Elias Earle are both quite well in the city of Mexico & that he shook hands with them when he started.  

	General [James] Shields & [John A.] Quitman are to be here tonight.

	When I commenced writing I intended discussing about the children & our household, but have not time now.    Dr. Prior has just called with a letter from Mr. Howard on his way to purchase at Greenville.  He seems a fine gentleman.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

	I now have scarcely time to eat my meals as a man should.  Yesterday morning I rose before daylight, shaved by a candle, dressed & commenced writing my reports as Chairman of the Committee on Finance & Banks which I continued till fifteen minutes before nine, when I went to breakfast.  At nine oclock I met the committee on Finance & Banks & sat till ten oclock, when the Senate met.  I sat in the Senate from ten till five oclock, when we went to dinner.  At six oclock I was back in the Senate chamber sitting on committee.  This continued till nine in the night when we adjourned to supper.  I read the newspapers & went to bed.  And I am now writing to you at seven oclock.

	I saw Mr. Elford last night.  He called at my room about ten oclock, handed me a letter from Mr. Choice & said he had a bag from you to me which he would send me this morning.  Mr. Speers arrived here Wednesday night, & I am always glad to see anyone from Greenville.  But they brought very little news.  I thought that you were out of the way of news, but that if I could see anyone from Greenville they could tell me a great deal.  This was a mistake.

	I am truly glad to hear from your last letter that Hooker is going on with the fence.  Tell him to have it finished before I return.  It would give me great pleasure on my return to see the old fence removed, which has been an eye sore to you so long.

	Tell William I recd his letter & will write him as soon as I can.  You will see a report of my speech on the Electoral Bill in the Daily Telegraph which I still send you zi suppose.

	Chancellor Dunkin gave me $25.00 for Mrs. Doyley again.  You will expend for her the balance I left with you if you have not already spent it for yourself.

	I have recd another letter from Heath giving the most flattering account of my prospects in Pickens.  Everyone who hears Orr speak is astonished that he should have the impudence to oppose me.  I have made some good speeches on the Electoral Bill & have acquired some reputation for speaking.

	There is a Bill reported to elect an additional Judge.  I have opposed it in committee & shall continue to do so in the Senate.

	The trial of Judge Richardson comes on tomorrow.  What will be the result I cannot tell.  The House has agreed to adjourn Friday week 17 inst.  The Senate have not concurred yet.

	The Senate gave Judge Harpers family $2000 yesterday which I voted against.  His family are said to be penyless.

	Write me all about the children.  How I should like to see the dear little creatures.  Fanny, I shall hardly know.  Tell Anna that she must learn fast & be a good girl.  Tell Frank to dream of me & be a good boy.  Tell Willie I am glad he is head.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received & read with great pleasure you letter of Friday last, in which you say you will make me a kind sweet wife.  This you have always done, and I require no change for the better but am content with what I already have.  I believe that it has been our lot to pads through life so far with as little matrimonial differences as ordinarily fall to the lot of those whom God has joined together.  I, at least, think myself greatly blessed in my wife & children.  And it would be hard for me to love either more than I do.  When I am with you all, it seems to me now, that I do not know the extent of the feelings of my heart, & it is only when absent that I am made aware of it.

	But I have been thinking very seriously about the absence which must necessarily occur if I go to Congress, & it has affected my resolution very seriously.  Perhaps I can make some arrangements to carry you all with me.

	Yesterday the trial of Judge Richardson came on.  He appeared at the Bar of the House & made a speech of two hours in length & showed pretty clearly that he had his mental faculties about him.  The House acquitted him by a vote of seventy four to thirty two.  The Greenville members voted for his acquittal.  I had no vote till It should come into the Senate.  But the whole matter is now dismissed.

	Governor Richardson came to me some days since to know my opinion & I spoke very freely, that the old man should resign.  The governor told me that the Judge intended doing so after the trial was over.  But I doubt whether he does.

	The Rail Road Bills have all failed, & the state will not aid in the construction.

	This evening I took a ride on horseback.  My mare is so fat & so much improved that you would hardly know her.  Tell Jim I now see what good keeping & care will do for a horse.  He does not seem to be a good hostler.  

	The purse sent by Elford is a most beautiful one, and I have just written a letter to Pamela thanking her for it.  It is too pretty to use & I am afraid would be very easily injured.  I gave her an account of you & all the children and I told her you wrote me a letter every mailthat Willie was the smartest boy of his age that I had ever seenthat her godson [Frank] was the universal favourite of everyoneThat Anna & Fanny were sweet childrenthat my children were so pretty & smart that I was willing to have twenty &c.

	Major Henry told me that his daughter had fallen in love with you, & that she talked of nothing else for a week after her return home.  

	If I have time I will write Willie a letter tomorrow evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	There is now so much commotion & such a press of business in the Legislature that I have not time to write you as I would desire.

	We shall adjourn on Friday night & I will leave here Saturday morning, which will enable me to reach home Monday night or Tuesday.  If the roads are bad I shall not be able to drive it in three days, as my horse will have been standing idle so long & become so fat it would hurt her.

	Tell Willie I have not had time to write him as I desired to do.  I am sorry he is not with me.  Mr. Sullivan brought his little boy down with him & sent him back the next day in the carriage.  Mrs. Sullivan has now come down in the carriage with another one of his little ones.  She is staying at this House.

	Tomorrow General Shields is to arrive here & there will be a great show.  I have been appointed one of the committee on the part of the Senate to receive him to the State House where the governor will address him & the multitude be present to receive him.

	If I should have time I will write you or Willie after he reaches this place.  I hope to hear from you twice before I leave Columbia, Wednesday & Friday.

	I have bought a set of chess men, a board for $2.25 which are very neat & pretty.  I have also bought a cup for travelling, which looks as well as silver & is a very pretty pattern for $2.00.

	I must now go down to the Legislature, & will finish my letter tomorrow.

	I have just taken my seat to finish my hasty letter.  The arrival of General Shields has thrown the whole town in an uproar.  As one of the committee I went down to the Rail Road depot to receive him.  The procession was immense.  He is a small but noble looking fellow, with a foreign air & look.  The crowd some five thousand persons called for him in the streets.  He went out & addressed them from the second story of the Hotel & made a thrilling speech.  Just before we were going to sit down to dinner, DeSaussure came to me & said the governors table was too small & that part of us must go & dine with him.  I went & spent a pleasant eveningnever saw Mrs. DeSaussure before.  She is fine looking & very masculine.  I saw Mrs. Bull, she has faded very much.  Col. Hunt, Davie, General, Col. Orr, Boykin, General Wallace all dined with DeSaussuere.

	I have not yet read your letter but will in a few minutes I hope.  It is now 8 oclock & I must hasten back to the Senate.

       General Shields has turned all Columbia crazy.  They had a grand illumination, torch light procession &c.  Yesterday the General accompanied by the governor & committee of arrangements, of which I was one, visited the House of Representatives which was crowded as I never saw it before with men & Ladies.  He made a speech sat awhile & then went into the Senate which was a squeezejammed full of ladies & strangers.  There he made another speech, shook hands with the ladies &c.  He is a single gentleman & I thought some of the ladies liked him the better for it.  He is about forty, good looking, fine countenance, & noble bearing.  He says he is only thirty-eight.  Yesterday I dined with him at the Governorsa very large party & pleasant.

	I will write you a few lines by Col. Townes, who returns to Greenville in the morning.  I shall probably be at home Thursday evening.

 	In the way of my election I am doing as well as I could almost wish at the home of my opponent.  I am much stronger in Anderson than I had any idea of being.  From all parts of the district I have favourable news which I will tell you when I return.  In Pickens too I have the most flattering accounts.  Indeed I should not be surprised if I beat Orr in Pendleton election district.  Colonels Sloan & Taylor members of the Legislature, living near old Pendleton go for me & the Maxwells & Earles also.

	I took tea last night at Elias Earles, the brother in law of Mrs. Mays & spent a pleasant evening.    Today I made a speech on the Wilmot Proviso which took well & has been much complimented.

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I rece[iv]ed your letters this morning and was truly glad to learn that you and the children were all well & had safely arrived at the Cunninghams.  My election is going on as well as I could wish in this district.  At the muster which I attended on Saturday there was very little division.  The same may be said of the whole Ennoree side of the district.  I stopped on Sunday & heard a sermon from Mr. Lewis, eight miles from the village & the most flattering intelligence from the neighborhood.  Dr. Dillard told me to say there was no division in his neighborhood.  Major Cunningham said my prospects had been growing better all winter.  Frederick Nance said he had taken pains to ascertain from persons here today, what my prospects were & that I could not wish them better.  My speech last Court on the Wilmot Proviso & my address this winter have secured my election in this district.

	The Barksdale affair has blown over almost entirely.  I had a long conversation with him this morning & he seemed entirely satisfied.  I saw his brother with whom you staid & thanked him for his kindness.  He said he should have known the children from their resemblance to me & complimented you & them very much.  He is a most worthy & respectable gentleman, & one whom I have always esteemed.

	The evening after you started from home I spent in reading Kendall & found the House lonely in the extreme.  I never could reconcile it to myself to live the life of a widower.  Monday I saw a great many persons at Greenville & recd $60.00 from one of my clients, which came in good time.  Last Friday night I came to Jones & was most kindly recd.  The next day I went to the master & made a speech.  That night I staid at General Wrights & was much pleased with his family.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to see you at Mr. Cunninghams.  My business will not permit me to leave here before Sunday morning.  It would give me great pleasure to see them all but you must make my excuse.  To go there & return here would take two days.  We will meet Sunday night at home.  You had better stop again with Mr. Barksdale.  The other one does not live on the road.

	I need not say how happy I should be to see you & the children & really when I think of being absent from you & them in Washington, I wish your apprehensions realized about Coil. Orrs beating me.  I have no doubt it would be the greatest kindness he could do me.

	I invited the Col. To take tea with me this evening & we spent a pleasant evening together.  He has just left me.

	I will write you again if I have time.  Do not say or think anything about the Election.  Leave this to me to manage.  Take care of the children & yourself.  Give my love to all the household & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Mr. Elford who leaves in the morning.  I shall probably leave here myself tomorrow evening & go to Pendleton, thence to the Tugaloo side of Pickens.

	I find my prospects here better than I expected.  Some of my friends think that I will beat Col. Orr in the village of Anderson.  Esquire Cox told me that with the business men he knew I would and named the following persons who would vote for meBenson, Earle, Brown, McCully, Griffin, Reed. Whitner, Dr. Webb &c.  In fact the prominent men throughout the district will mostly support me.  Young told me this evening, that every gentleman in the district of Laurens would vote for me.  That they were not sating much & that Orrs friends were drinking fellows who made a fuss & deceived him.  

	About old Pendleton I have a good many friends.  Col. Taylor, Maxwell, Seaborn, Burt, Sloan & others.  Burt has taken charge of the Pendleton Messenger.  He wrote me a kind letter inviting me to spend a day with him on my way to Pickens. 

	I have seen Keith & Robbins from Pickens.  The Wolf creek where I was to get no votes, Keith said he was last week in company with twelve persons & nine of them were Perrymen.  He said Col. Hagood told him there was no comparison between me & Orr & that he should vote [for] me although he did not like me.  You know I have had several very important cases against him.

	There is a place in this district called the Dark Corner.  Billy Sherrord is king of that neighborhood & they are all whigs.  He informed me last night that he should vote for me.  Reed told me down on Broadmouth in a company of one hundred there were ninety for me.

	Coil. Orr has reported that he will get two thirds of Laurens district & seems very confident of success.  This is very well to encourage his friends at home.

	I found my copartner here rather desponding.  I was employed in a case of perjury for next court.  There is very little business in court.

	Tell Jim to go on planting the corn as fast as he can.  Let him scatter the manure & plant the ground already laid off.  Let Mary go out & help.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  As I came in this place I overtook Esquire Long from Slab Town in this district.  He told me I would [receive] a very strong note in that neighborhood.  He said he had taken beef to your mother.  [I] enquired how Anne was.  Said McBees wife was the heartiest looking lady he ever sawthat he was one day praising her appearance at your mothers, & Mrs. Perry enquired if she was not just as good looking.  I think the old man has made a mistake & took you for Susan, & that it was Susan who made the enquiry.  I had a great notion to tell the old man of his mistake.  

	Tell Willie to learn fast & be head when I return.  Tell Anna she must also study hard.  Frank must learn his letters at home.  Good night, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I reached here this morning and was much gratified to receive your letter.  I hope Mary may soon be able to relieve you of your charge.

	I will now give a briefof my journey thus far.  Friday the day I left home, I met Major Wright & his bride & three young ladies from Pendleton going to General Wrights.  We stopped & had some conversation.  At Major Bollings I met Mr. [S.A.] Goodman, the editor of the Laurensville Herald.  I took dinner there, rode with Goodman some distance on the road to Laurens C.H.  Went to Esquire James Cunninghams & staid all night.  Found General Thos Jones there.  Cunningham told the people were disappointed in Col. Orrs appearance, that he would have done better not to have shown himself.

Letter 99
Saturday morning I went to the muster & found a large crowd.  In the evening the rain commenced falling & we had no speaking.  The people seemed a good deal divided between Orr & myself.  That is his stronghold in Laurens.  In the evening I drove down to Captain Andersons & found him absent.  I then stopped a few minutes in Bowens & went on to Captain Cunninghams.  There I met Mr. Buist & Col. Evans of Spartanburgh.  Miss Pamela was unwell & I did not see her.  Mrs. John Cunningham was there.  They all desired to be remembered to you.  The grounds & gardens look beautiful.  Dr. Hillhouse & his wife had been there the evening before.  Mrs. Cunningham said she was very much pleased with my cousins.

	Sunday morning I went to church with the family.  It was a Presbytery meeting & a large concourse of persons present.  I found a great many friends there.  Col. Orr was at the muster & also at the church.  I went to my friend Nances.  He lives in great style & has a magnificent house.  He is active for me & so are all his neighbors.  His wife is a good looking ladylike woman.

	Monday morning I went down to my client Dr. Teagues & took dinner.  Saw a great many persons & they all seemed for me.  Mrs. Teague is a warm friend & I have seldom seen an old lady of more dignity or finer manners.  I was quite surprised.  We had a good dinner.  Told me I need be under no apprehensions about that neighborhood.  In the evening I went over to Jesse Youngs where Major Coleman & others were dining.  I returned to Col. Williams who is a most influential friend & staid all night.

	Tuesday morning I went to Col. Watts who married General Jones daughter but did not see him.   He is against me & influential.  But his uncle Col. Williams told me he would control him if possible.  About ten oclock I fell on the track of Col. Orr.  He had gone but a short time, whilst I had traveled over fifty miles & seen hundreds of persons.  I can beat him electioneering.

	This evening we were both invited to a Ball given to Major Wright.  I have just returned from it.  I was introduced to a good many ladies & made myself very agreeable to them.

	   In regard to my prospects I have seen everything to flatter me, & yet my friends tell me that the race will be a close one in Laurens.  I think I know better than they do.  They judge from the Saluda side of the district whilst on the other side my support will be almost unanimous.  

	I am greatly indebted to Col. Williams.  He is a man of great influence, princely fortune & high character.  He espouses my course with boldness & zeal.  I do not think I have a warmer friend in the Congressional District.  What makes it more remarkable he was a bitter nullifier & the mortal enemy of Capt. Cunningham.  He is the grandson of Capt. Williams who was killed at Kings Mountain & between whom & the Cunninghams there existed a mortal feud.

	I do not know wqhat course I will take in the morning.  Good night.  God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived in Columbia this evening at four oclock & found your letter.  I called at the Post office as I drove down street & enquired but my letters had been sent to Col. Maybins.  I was very glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home, because many things have occur[r]ed & I have seen several hundred persons.

	The weather is excessively hot & I am almost in a state of meltiness as Miss Fanny Kemble says in her book of travels in the U. States.  I shall therefore be very brief in my narrative.

Letter 101
Thursday night I spent at Mr. Conners & was much pleased with him & his wife.  They are very pleasant & genteel persons indeed.  Conner was hesitating about the election.  Col. Orr had been there the night before.  I have no doubt he is for me & he has great influence.  I stopped at several houses above there & found them all for me.

	Friday morning I went to muster early & called at every house on the roadgot on Orrs track again.  There were not a great many persons at the muster on Friday.  That evening I went to Dr. Hunters.  He was not at home when I arrived.  I found that he is a single man & lives with his mother & sisters.  The place is a beautiful one & displays more taste than any I have seen except Rosemont.  Miss Hunter met me at the door, & I introduced myself to her.  She is a very pleasant, intelligent & handsome young lady.  After conversing a few minutes, she said you have not been at dinner, and in opposition to my intreaties observed that she would go & have dinner prepared.  The Dr returned & I spent a very pleasant evening.  Invited Miss Hunter to visit Greenville.

	Saturday Col. Orr & myself made speeches & the feeling of the crowd was decidedly for me.  Whilst speaking one fellow stepped out & said to me we are all going to vote for you here.  Someone else observed to Col. Williams that a nigger could tell the difference in our speeches.  Esquire Brown came to me & said he was going to vote against me but there was too great a difference between us & he should vote for me.  The expression was general that I had gained a victory & that the scale was turning rapidly against Col. Orr.  So Said Col. Mosely, Col. Williams, Major Anderson & so felt everyone.

	Saturday night I was going to Col. Kerns, but stopped at Pitts & he made me stay with him.    He said there are twenty votes you will gain by staying with me.  I replied then put up the horse.  He keeps a store & is a man of great influence & wealthhas a magnificent house, but lives as plain as any one.  He sent off for his taylor,, blacksmith, carpenter, hirelings & neighbors.  I drew my bottle of old brandy & it was drunk up directly.  I have never seen a kinder man than Pitts & I left him as warm a friend as Col. Williams.  He had been rather opposed to me.

	Sunday morning I went to Col. Kerrs & saw him.  He feels the responsibility of the change he is about making, & when I spoke of Miss Earle, the tears filled his eyes.  He is a most excellent gentleman.  He said whilst courting he had given me as one of his references.  He has a handsome house & richly furnished.

	I stopped at every house on the road till I got to the Newberry line.  My run will be general & almost unanimous in the lower end of that side of Laurens.  In the upper end of the same Ennoree side, Esquire Griffith told me a relation of his told Col. Orr he would not get ten votes!  Orr replied he liked for persons to speak the truth to him no matter how discouraging it may be.  

	I saw Major Simpson this evening.  He came to meet Mrs. Simpson & two children & carry them to Washington.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here on their return from Charleston.  I was introduced to Mrs. Brown the engineers wife this evening.

	I shall leave here this week & go back to the Battalion muster on Saturday & return again next Sunday in time to attend to my cases in the court of Appeals.  So you see I am disposed to be quite industrious.  I do not know when I shall write you again.

	I drove today forty one miles between 7 oclock & 1 & ? after 3 oclock P.M.  This istravelling.  In conclusion let me say that my prospects are brightening & I could not have desired greater encouragement than I have recd.

	I have not been out of the Hotel since I came.  Have seen a great many persons however.

	Take care of yourself & the children & servants & household generally.  I am truly yours, B.F. Perry

	I have just read your letter of last Monday & was glad to hear from you & the children.  Mr. Keith of Pickens & Mr. Henderson of Laurens both went with me to the Post office & enquired for letters but rece[ive]d none.  We seem to be more regular in our correspondence than any other husband & wife from the upper country.

	Today Col. Fair was taken sick & had to get me to argue his cases in the court of Appeals.  In this I had good luck, & gained two out of threeone more to argue.  But I shall return to Laurens tomorrow to attend the Battalion muster & come back on Sunday evening or Monday morning. 

	I have no news to write you.  My cases in the court of appeals will not come up before tomorrow week.  I may not be at home before Sunday weekperhaps not then.

	I have been looking at some beautiful dresses for you & Anna & will purchase some of them.  I saw some of the most magnificent window paintings or curtains & arranged to purchase a couple of them for $10rods & tassels &coil paintings.  I saw some at Cunninghams, though by no means so pretty.

	Mr., Crawford gave me a package this evening to carry [to] Col. Kern, containing a gold watch & many valuable trinkets for the bride.  I think Miss Earle is going to do well, & you may say so, & that the Col. Is an intimate friend of mine.  He is about forty fivegood lookingvery rich.  It is thought that my friend William Mills is to marry the other Miss Earle.  He is about the same agerich & clevergood looking.  I think Mrs. Earles daughters have done well.

	My election is very much talked of here.  Everyone is enquiring about it & all wishing me success and saying we now want talent in Congress.  I have no apprehensions about my election.  It was just so when I ran for the Senate.  My friends were alarmed but I was not.  The rumor everywhere was that I would be beaten.  It is always so.  My enemies first speak out & make a noisemy friends say nothing.  But in due time they speak out also.  Everyone says I am gaining rapidly but that is not [page torn] the case as is supposed.  It is only my friends speaking out.  

	I have been writing letters since I have been here & will continue to do so.  I must now conclude for that purpose.  I have carried your shoes to have made up.

	Tell the children I will bring them all a present & they must be good.  I am glad you have heard from Miss Rodgers.  They have sent for a bracelet like hers & I will get it next week on my return to Columbia.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as I promised, though I have nothing of interest to tell you.

	The morning I left home, I got lost, was caught in the hardest rain I ever saw fall, driving over the worst road I ever travelled in a buggy.  I met Mr. Jacobs who told me Col. Orr could not get more than one hundred thirty votes in Greenville.  He said he did [not] know a man who would vote against me.   He laughed at the idea of my loosing three hundred votes in Greenville district.  He is a man of good sense & great candour but does not know as much about the election as I do.

	In Anderson I stopped at old Mr. Douthits a Methodist clergyman.  He seemed glad to see me & said he knew me, my character & politics about as well as I did myself, & he had known me as long as I had known myself.  His son told me I would divide equally the votes in that neighborhood.  But I sha do better than that.  In fact all along the road on Saturday I found very little opposition.  I went to my old client Joseph Rodgers & saw three of his brothers.  They insisted on my staying all night but everything looked uncomfortable & I determined to go to Dr. Andersons.  He is a whig & an old union man, lives in considerable style, has a fine wife, & two very pleasant daughters.  They were all glad to see me, & I spent a very pleasant evening.  The Dr. told me there was no division in his neighborhood, & there is an election ground at his house called orrsville.  He said he did not know that I would loose a vote.  He lives within ten miles of Anderson C. House.  I saw a good many voters at his house.  Mrs. Anderson told me Dr. Butler was taken sick at their house & remained there some time when electioneering & that Mrs. Butler came over to see him.  She said Mrs. Butler was a remarkable woman.  She told me a great deal about Col. Bees visit at the same time.

	 Sunday morning I came to Irbys.  He told me I was gaining.  I stopped for dinner at Frank Hammonds & fared sumptuously though I believe he is an Orr man. He is the stepson of my friend Jenkins Hammond.

	I met here Sunday evening Miles Norton & Elliott Keith and as usual Norton was crooking & Keith looking only at the bright side of the picture.  Keith told me that the Burnl[e]y appropriation was doing me a great deal of service.

	I saw today Mattison from Craytonville.  He says I will get thirty votes there out of eighty, the box at which Orr was born.  Sherrod told me that the Rev. Mr. Chalmers a seceder had come out for me.  In fact the news everythere seems to be that I am gaining ground.  Col. Orr has come out for Taylor under the hope of carrying the Whigs.  But he will not succeed & find all of the Democrats are opposed to [page torn] some of them go for [Lewis] Cass.  My position is one of neutrality, or opposition to both & with mew are most of the Democrats, Burt, Maxwell, Benson &c.

	I shall go up tomorrow to Pendleton & thence to Pickens.  You must write me by Coil. Townes & send my papers & letters. Tell Jim to hurry with the plowing.  I hope you & [the] children & household are getting on well.  I am in fine spirits about the election & have heard from Laurens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I intended writinglast night but was engaged in Sullivans office examining witnesses in Dr. Andersons case till near eleven oclock.  I have time this morning only to write you a few lines before the mail closes.

	My prospects are growing better every day is the information of my friends.  Major Anderson & Col. Williams tell me that I will only loose ten votes in the village of Laurens.  Captain Cunningham says there are only two persons against me at Waterloo.  Mr. Mills informs me that there is scarcely any division on the Ennoree side of the district from Scuffletown up to the Greenville line.  The information is decidedly more favorable from the Sullivan

	The communication on the Burnl[e]y appropriation has excited Sullivans opposition for me a good deal.  But he was doing all he could before secretly & now he is more open in his opposition.  And in that respect it will be better for me.  He has written a reply to the Herald which you will see.  In fairness he should have published my letter but it contained expressions which did not suit him, so he gave a garbled statement of its contents.

	I shall be here till Sunday.  The Teague case has been postponed but Dr. Andersons case will occupy three days in trying it.

	Mr. Cunningham says that Mrs. C & Pamela are going to Charleston as soon as he returns home.  Mrs. John C. is to return & take charge his household.

	Mr. Mills is about commencing a fine large house in the village of Laurens.  This looks as if he has been successful in his excursions to Greenville.  He is a strong friend of mine & I should be glad to aid him in his election in Greenville if there is any difficulty about it.

	All the democrats in Laurens  [Zachary] Taylor & the Whigs are not for him.  Col. Orr will find himself mistaken.  The Col. Is not here.  Why I know not.

	In great haste.  Yours truly & sincerely, I hope you had a pleasant time with your kindred & that everything went on as well with your household.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I shall have to remain here till Tuesday.  We commenced the case of Anderson & Neely yesterday morning & did not get half through.  It will be a very long case & I may not reach home before Wednesday.

	I am however killing two birds with one stone.  Tomorrow is sale day & there will be a great crowd here.  I shall of course charge a fee proposition to the time occupied in the case.

	General Thompson told me yesterday that he never thought before I would be electedthat he believed now that I would beat Col. Orr five hundred votes in Laurens district.  I replied that had been my calculation all the time.  He made great efforts to get me to hoist the Taylor flagsent Mr. Garlington & Capt. Cunningham to me very much alarmed but I soon satisfied them to the propriety of my concerns & they admitted that their alarms were entirely groundless.

	There is a large Presbyterian meeting here today.  Mr. Buist is down here.  I was invited to tea at Wrights yesterday morning but could not go and to Mr. Garlingtons the evening before but declined.  I was also invited to a ball the evening I arrived here, but I was so much fatigued I could not muster enough of courage to shave & put on a clean shirt.

	I am very sorry I cannot go home today.  Sullivan and myself are both engaged on the same side of Andersons case & quite friendly.  

	I write you in great haste & merely to account for not returning this evening.  Governor Johnson had 22 little negroes burnt to death in one house the other night.  Be careful of fire.  God bless you.  Kiss the children for me.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Lauren C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening instead of exposing myself to the night air instead of going to a temperance lecture where everybody else has gone.

	I have just had a long talk with my friend Billy Mills & he is really a warm friend.  He assures me that my prospects are growing better daily.  The same assurance has been given me today by Mr. Garlington, Col. Williams, Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Simmons, Col. Irby &c.

	Col. Orrs communication will operate against him as I am informed by almost everyone & amongst them Dr. Simpson & Deaton & Godman.  They were all pleased to hear that I intended replying to him mildly.

	I have been in the Court House pretty much all day & Col. Orr has not shown himself in the Court House at all.  He is here however & his face looks as red as a bottle of rum.

	I saw Col. Kern today & he reports favorably for me in consequence his going for Taylor.  Not one friend has left me in consequence of my opposition to Taylor.

	Col. Kern looks well & seems very happy.  Mills admitted to me that he was to be marriedsaid he would be at Greenville again before the grand occasion.

	I finished my article in reply to Orr last night, & handed it to the Editor this morning.

	I hope to hear from you in the morning.  I will write you again before the mail leaves.  It has just occurred to me that the mail comes down instead of going up in the morning.

	The court will probably last all the week.  One of my cases has been continued.  General Thompson is here.   I met William Butler returning from Charleston Tuesday night.  I recd your letter & the one from Folgerheard nothing of the old letter.  I was glad to hear from home & that Fanny was better.  Folger is at enmity with the Hol & wishes to prejudice me.  

	I have just got through with my speech in the case of Maddox & WilliamsonYoung & Sullivan speech tomorrow.

	My friend Norece told me this morning that General Griffin & Major Calhoun had better quit Orr on account of his communication.

	I met Orr this morning & we shook hands & passed the ordinary civilities.

	I have not been well since I have been heretook pills last night, & they have made me feel a little unpleasant.

	General Thompson has gone on to Washington City.

	Orrs Taylorism is losing him votes very rapidly in Laurens.

  	I do not know when I shall be at home.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

I saw Major Reed & he says he will be in Greenville in August.  BFP

29 July 1848
Greenville

My dear Sir

	I thank you for your letter received last night & in reply to it can only say that you have very happily expressed my position in regard to the Presidency.

	Neither of the candidates is acceptable to me, but if forced to choose between them I could not hesitate to take the nominee of my own party with his endorsement of the Democratic creed. In preference to the nominee of my political opponent, who has not expressed himself in favour of one solitary principle beneficial to the South.

	I was anxious that the State should not take sides at present in the canvass.  Her neutrality will give her influence & position in the settlement of this territorial question.  Moreover both candidates being objectionable is a strong reason why we should not be in haste to enlist under the banner of either.

	But the American people are impatient, & must take sides in all elections.  The people of South Carolina are so in the present contest.  Neutrality will not be endured much longer.  In regard to the Congressional Election it has nothing to do with the election of President.  And I do not see why it should be made a test question between Col. Orr & myself.

	I am disposed to maintain my neutrality as long as possible.  But when forced to give it up I shall not go into the ranks of a Southern man who is afraid to avow himself in favour of Southern rights & the equality of the States, who has expressed himself in his signal letter in favour of the Wilmot Proviso by opposing the ordinance of 1787 & declaring against the extension of Slavery.  General Taylor has also abandoned the veto power which is the great protection of the South, in the administration of the government by a Southern man.  

	The party supporting General Taylor are our hereditary enemies on the Tariff, Bank, Internal Improvement & latitudinarian continuation of the Constitution.  It is impossible for South Carolina to Take position in their ranks & fight against her old principles.

	I am glad to hear that my reply to Col. Orr has met the approbation of my friends.  I hear this is the case from all quarters.

	You will please give my respects to Mr. Maxwell and I hope on your return home you will call & see me in Greenville.  Truly yours, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the muster & am very much fatigued but will write you a few lines for the mail in the morning.

Letter 109
Saturday night I staid with my friend Joseph Rogers fourteen miles from Anderson C.H.  He informed me I would scarcely lose a vote in that neighborhood.  Sunday I went to the camp meeting, took dinner with Dr. Anderson.  He is still my friend & says his neighbors all go for me although they are [Zachary] Taylor men.  I saw my friend Dr. Reese & he says I will best at his Box below old Pendleton.  I heard from other places & all favorable.

	Sunday night I staid at Bensons.  He is for me warmly.  Vandiver thought my address had injured me with the Whigs.  Reed thought the same.  But I know it has gained ten for me lost.  I went to the drill muster on Monday.  Heard favorable news from the Saluda side of the District.
 
	Monday night I was at John C.  Norriss& perhaps made him my friend.  Spent the evening pleasantly.

	Tuesday Col. Orr was not able to attend the Review.  No speeches were made.  It was a Whig country & perhaps better.    Col. McFall is still my strong friend.  Says I will divide at Majors, Store, & Caspers boxes before Anderson.

	Tuesday night I spent at Dr. Browns who married a Broyles.  He said he wanted to vote for both Orr & myself.  The people [are] very equally divided in that neighborhood.

	Wednesday I came here through Orrs stronghold, the Tumbling Shoals where they are more equally divided, but all will go over when they ascertain that Orr stands for Taylor.  I stopped at one house where the man was for Orr & the woman for me.  She told me that she had said to her husband, if he did not vote me, she would make him drunk on the day of the election & prevent his going out.  I took dinner with them & the husband promised to vote for me.  His name was James.

	I paid my printers bill at Anderson & had 37 ? cents left for crossing the Bridge over into Laurens.  I paid 25 cts & had 12 ? left.  I had sad feelings.  Here I was in a strange place, a candidate for Congress & no money.  Whilst brooding over my necessities who should I meet in the public Road but my old client Maddox.  He pulled out his pocketbook & paid me a fee of Fifty dollars in cash.  Hurrah for good luck thinks I to myself.

	The news from every portion of this District is one entire change to my side.  In some neighborhoods where the vote did stand 35 to 42, it is now 6 for Orr & 70 for me.  This is pretty much the case throughout the Ennoree Regiment.  I never met so many friends before at a muster, not even in Greenville.  They all come up to speak to me & shake hands & were really glad to see me.  They were all intelligent men & gentlemen.

	The people enquired if Col. Orr was still a Taylor man.  He had not then erred & I thought was sick at home.  The news had reached them that he was for [Lewis] Cass or neutral.  I told them I understood him differently.  In the course of the day he came & even made several speeches.  He made a strong Taylor speech whichhis fall in the Ennoree regiment.  If he will only make the same speech next Saturday my majority in Laurens will be seven or eight hundred.  He spoke well too, better than I ever heard him before.

	I will be at home Sunday evening.  Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter by General Thompson, & it contains better news than he brings.

	In this district the votes are not counted.  I have beaten Col. Orr about two hundred votes in this district.  

	There never was greater effort made by a man & his friends than Col. Orr & his have made at this Box.  He opened the grocery & had the Liquor free.

	My estimated majority is two hundred but this is uncertain.  It may be more or less.  The Whigs have all turned against me except a few gentlemen.  This reduced my votes from a majority of 500 to 200.

	I regard the Election as very uncertain.  From old Pendleton I heard Monday at 12 oclock we were even.  At Dr. Andersons he beat me {by] a few votes.  At the Trapp Thompson says I only beat [by] 10 votes.  Several other Boxes he mentions unfavorably in Anderson.  But this is all uncertain.  You perhaps know by this time.

	I did not receive your statement.

	I write you in great haste.  I do not expect to be at home till Saturday or Sunday.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have written Col. Townes by this mail.

Letter 111
Wednesday morning, [18 October 1848]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines to inform you that I shall be detained here all the week.  I have been employed in several very important cases, both in law & equity, since I came here and in them will receive handsome fees.

	I was employed on Monday in a very exciting case by Mr. Richardson of Sumter, whose boy drove the carriage against Mr. Barksdale.  Barksdale immediately commenced an assault on the negro boy and Richardsona dish on Barksdale.  They both indicted each other & the boy was indicted.  Richardson is a gentleman of large fortune & was returning home with his mother in law Mrs. Spann the sister of Mrs. Colonel Calhoun & their families.    They were detained here two days.  Many of my friends came to me & told me not to defend Richardson & his servant that it would injure my election.  I replied that I should think meanly of myself if I shrunk from Professional duty on that account, that I was always disposed to do my duty, be the consequences what they may.

	I did not know Richardson, but he had seen me in Columbia & knew me, asked my professional assistance as a stranger &c.  I became acquainted with his wife, who is a very handsome & pleasant lady, & in her manners very much like her cousin Miss Calhoun.  Mrs. Spann reminded me a good deal of her brother Warren Davis.

	We had a large public meeting here yesterday at which I made a good speech.  Col. Orr also spoke & General Whitner, Sullivan, Young, Irby & Summer.

	My election is going on well as I could expect, though I have been too busy to electioneer any.

	I was at the Episcopal Fair last night & bought some little thingsa needle case for you & a pair of mit[t]s for Anna & some candy for Frank & Will & an emery for you.  I saw Mr. Arthur.  The church is a very pretty one.  

	I recd your letter by Elford.  Mrs. Rowland must make Hodges pay the note.

	I have not seen or heard from Captain Cunningham and send no money except $30 paid me by Richardson for defending his servant.  His own trial put off till next Fall.

	The great equity case I mentioned to you & have been employed inalso in one other case involving eight negroes to assist Col. Irby.

	In great hastekiss for me the children & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 112
Monday night, [23 October 1848]
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this morning and thank you for your kindness and affection.  I was glad to hear you say as I was starting that you were as happy as you are well.  I am sure I can say so with truth and propriety.

	As I came here on Sunday Mr. Satterfield told me you had done one good thingrefusing to purchase Allen Merrits chickens and he told me a long story which Merrit told him.  I have a suit now in Anderson court against Merritt.  Indeed I had a great deal of weight to carry in the electionall against whom I had cases voted against me.  All the drinking whiskey men opposed me.  The Taylor men were united against me.  The old ignorant nullifyers remembered their ancient hatred of me and last, though not least I was a gentleman.

	Reed told me today that Col. Orr said his election had cost eight hundred dollars.  On the day of election the spirits used would amount to $250.00 cts!

	Burt says he was instrumental in depoting me by inviting me over to Pendleton.  If I had staid at home & not made any speeches I would have been elected.  Col. McFall told me I beat myself, by espousing  the cause of General Cass.  He is a Whig & a Taylor man & a strong friend of mine.  Major Gilmore told me great changes had taken place at the Rock Mills just before the election.    He was still for me.  He said captain Garrison remarked any man who voted for Col. Orr admitted I was the best qualified.  He said Cass would be elected and I ought to be his secretary of War & would fill the office with great ability.  

	On the road I met several persons who said I must try it again.  Really in walking about the court yard today, I was surprised to find so many friends.  It seemed to me, that one half of the persons (intelligent men of character) were for me.  How different my vote in Anderson is from Orrs in Greenville.  Everyone of my votes in his district is a man of character & intelligence.  Almost everyone of his voters in my district is either worthless, no character, or mean men.

	I have heard Jones is a great deal better & therefore I shall return to Greenville.  perhaps Wednesday evening.  We have very little business in court.  I had two cases & was employed to assist Mr. Harrison in another today.

	You said nothing about Willie & the other children.  I hope they are all doing well.    As I came on here whilst stopped to eat dinner Powell rode by, & I invited him to dine with me, which he did.  He praised Anne very much.  Saw [her] at the examination.  He says his son is to be married in December to Miss Mullins daughter of Captain Mullins of Charleston & very richthat he is a very promising fellow &c.

	I have now told you all the news.  Mrs. Dubac, no doubt, had a greatto you.

	I am with great affection, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recei[ve]d your letter & weas truly glad to hear from you & the children & learn that you were all wellFanny poor little thing is better.  I hope to see her walking to meet me on my return.

	In regard to Reuben I do not know what to say.  James Harrison is altogether mistaken in his report of our conversation.  I said we could not tradethat I could not give more than $500.  This was all that passed.  I made an offer at all.  It would not be convenient for me to pay the money at present.  But James Harrison said that would make no difference.  He may be mistaken in this as he was in our conversation.  But if they will take my note bearing interest, payable within twelve months, I will purchase Reuben if you desire me to do so.  I leave you to make the trade with Mrs. Harrison.  She can make a Bill of Sale & warrant the soundness & I can give my note on my return home.  It may be that I will pay the money in a short time.  The trade of course cannot be completed until my return.

	I have been going on bravely with my cases in the Law court & have nearly got through.  When my Equity cases will be taken up is doubtful.  I have unquestionably got a new trial in Col. Dunkins case & also in a case of Monsels in Pickens.  I am preparing myself in Dr. Andersons case.

	In regard to elections I have done a little for Col. Hayne.  I believe all the Greenville delegation will vote for him.  I told Col. Ware if he did not you would never vote for him again.  He is for him.  General Martin invited me to dine with him tomorrow & I am to do so.  I introduced Col. Hayne to Major Smith & Col. Williams & told them he was your cousin & a candidate for attorney general.  

	I have not yet been to the State Houseall my time in court.  And I have really nothing to write you about.  I must go in a few minutes to the College to meet the Board of trustee.  I have not yet had time to look at carriages or anything else.

	I have bought Mrs. Ellets Book & it contains one of my articles & makes honorable mention of me.  I see my article [on] Dicey Langston has been published in the New York papers & in the Palmetto Banner.

	I do not wish the other hogs killed until my return home.  They are young hogs & do not fatten well.  I wish Jim & Charles to keep clearing up the pieces of ground pointed out to them & splitting rails.  The garden is to be spadedleaves& thrown in the stable lot &c.

	I must now conclude by saying to you if you desire Reuben make the purchase.  I do not know when I will be at home.  Perhaps I may return in the stage or I may write to you to send down the carriage.  

	Tell the children to be good & learn fastno danger of hurting themselves by studying.  I shall bring them something.  In haste, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Letter 114
Monday night 1848 [ca. November]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter which is the longest I have ever had the pleasure of receiving from you.  You have indeed scolded me good [several lines interlined, illegible]

	I am sorry to see you manifest so much want of decision in the purchase of Reuben.  There is a great deal of uneasiness avoided in this life by doing a thing at once & having done with it.  Never brood over it & think it may not turn out well.  There is to me a pleasure in casting off my mind what is over & cannot be remedied.

	I have no doubt Reuben has his faults & may be in some respects worse than Jim & in others better.  As to getting a servant who will do as he ought to, I never calculate on it.  I am not faultless myself & shall not worry myself in trying to do it.  I am not faultless myself, & I cannot expect to find more perfection in a poor, ignorant, degraded cast of creatures..

	Today I have been very busy in electing a President & preparing the papers.  Yesterday I was all day in the Court of Appeals hearing opinions.  The day before I was all day in the College.  Last evening Major Henry & myself went to see his daughter at Mr. Hooks school.  Mrs. H made a great many enquiries about you & the children & Dr. Crittendens family.  She really seemed glad to see me.

Letter 115
Monday night after writing you a letter I went with General Adams, Col. Dawkins & Mr. Middleton to the Ball, having been invited as trustees.  There was as usual a large number of ladies & gentlemen.  They waltzed & danced.  We took champagne and looked on for an hour, & then went to Col. Alstons room where we sat till one oclock eating & talking &c.  I saw Miss McDuffie at the Ball & Col. Taylors daughters, Miss Brooks &c.  I enquired of Col. Taylor who that was with a rose in her head & he replied, she is my daughter & it will give me great pleasure to introduce you to her.  I laughed at the mistake & apologized.  

	When I shall get through with the court is very uncertain.  Today the students were examined.  My name was on the committee, but I could not serve.  Tomorrow the Court of Errors will sit.  The case of Dr. Anderson is not yet tried.  I have to send a letter from him.  The printing of the Brief cost $32.00.

	I voted for Thompson Earle to carry the votes to Washington but Black was elected & has gone.

	General Thompson is still here.  Col. Townes is quite well.   Earle is not sick, but drooping.  Col. Elias Earle told me today he was a candidate for Comptroller General,  He is an abominable fool.  Mr. Speers & Major Jones are here yet & will return tomorrow. 

        I have made no purchases since I wrote you except a pair of small candlesticks $3.00.  The forks are as good as silver & no one can tell the difference.  They will last a great while.  The German silver is too common & too well known to be genteel.  The silver spoons were needed, so were the knives & forks.  I may look for a dinner set, but will purchase nothing unless very cheap.
       
       Col. Dawkins told me that Union district felt almost as much interest in my election as in General Wallaces.  Mr. Church, a representative from that district told me he said that he would muchI should be elected than to be elected himself.
       
	Tell Willie I have looked at a glass slate for him & I have seen a great many pretty things for Anna & Frank.

	How happy I should be now to peep in & see you & the children.  I do not think I will ever offer again for Congress.  It is all right.  I will not try & make something to educate the children with.

	I have now written you a long letter in return for yours & am sorry I cannot pay you with a kiss.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	 
	We are still in the midst of Dr. Andersons case.  I concluded my argument today.  General ThompsonYoung followed.  Sullivan finishes [to]morrow.  This will end my business [h]ere, & I shall certainly be at home [F]riday night.  How happy too I [s]hall be to meet once more you {&] the children.  And how glad I am to be able to leave before the Legislature adjourns.  

	The election for Governor takes place tomorrow & Col. [John L.] Manning will no doubt be elected.  Col. Irby iswith him for Lieutenant Governor.  I have understood today that a great many of the members of the Legislature will vote for me for President of the Bank in opposition to Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore.  The election will not come on for a two or three days.  The Bank question is now being discussed in both houses.  Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger made a very able speech against the Bank.  Major Henry replied to him, but it was a feeble effort.

	I read your short letter on Sunday evening, but did not see Mr. Smith.  I hope to hear from you again before I leave.  I looked for carbon sales, but can find none of the paper size.  I will look again tomorrow.  Not yet in the book store the In regard to subscribing [to] the Ladies Book &c., there is no ag here for the work.  When I re[turn] home I will write on for.

	I have added fomore beautiful toys for my collection.  They are quite a pretty collection, &amuse you & the children Ver[y] much.

	I went to church on Sund[ay]  to the Episcopal & heard Mr. Shand.  [Shand] is a poor preacher.  The church [is] a beautiful one.

	In regard to my cases in Court, I thought I had written you the result.  I have succeeded in Col. Duncanscase, also in the case of Walker & Bradford & in the case of Moon in part.  In Pickens I think I have gained the case of Mvs. State & have lost the case of Gordon & Gordon.  In Laurens I have gained the case of Maddon; lost that of Mr. Filson, also Hunter & Garrett.  Dr. Anderson not yet decided.

	The weather is as warm as Summer.  I have bought no books.  In great haste my dear wife, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Post Office with your letter & thank you for the punctuality in writing.  I assure you it gives me great pleasure to hear from my little family and I begin to count the days when I may return to them.

	I might go up in the morning with perfect propriety.  But I am sure if I did, Dr. Anderson would never forgive me.  His case came up today & I spoke three hours & did not quite finish my argument.      General Thompson & Mr. Young follow me & Sullivan concludes on my side.  I might now leave my authorities with him & go home, having done for Dr. Anderson all I can.  But he would not think so & the people would say I had not done my duty.  The court will not sit again till Monday.  They will be all day delivering opinions.    Consequently I will not get off before next Thursday morning.  Perhaps, however, better luck may befall me & I may start Tuesday morning.

	Col. Townes & Col. Ware went with me to the Post office & I believe both recd letters from home.    Choice & Walker came down this evening.  I have seen the latter but not the former.  They are on their way to Charleston.

	You say Susan is going to housekeeping & I must make a substantial present.  I do not feel any such obligation.  Her husband is or will be worth five times as much as yours.  His children will be rich when ours are poor.  I have already given several handsome presents to Susan, a diamond ring, gold pencil case, gold thimble &c. &c. and have never received the first memento from her.  Her conduct too towards me lately has been foolish & vindictive for my bold & generous & kind efforts to keep her from taking a step disgraceful to a wife.  My feelings towards Susan are not kind & I do not know that they will ever be again.  

	I have made my dear Liz for you several purchases & for which you will no doubt scold me again.  But wait till you see the presents.  A handsome flowing blue set in china for dinner & tea, late & fashionable pattern just imported.  I went up to look at the Box after being packed, & to my astonishment saw a big hogshead, which it took to contain them as large as three or four flour barrels.  They cost $32.00.  I also bought the most magnificent set of waiters you ever saw for $2.00.  They are beautiful pictures, landscapes, birds, flowers &c.  Two beautiful spittoons & a butter box of beautiful ware, to keep butter in.

	When you have got through with the scold for thepurchase & begin to breathe freely again I must tell you of another purchase.  The most beautiful, ornamental & useful collection of toys &c. for you & the children amounting to $12.00.  Three knives, one of them a curiosity for its tinny size, inkstand ivory, letter press, glass ship, goose &c., a waxen cupid in a glass case semetrically made, Christmas cards &c., ivory match box, parlor ball, silk real, 2 medallions, pearl waxen, 4 cakes of wax, 4 exquisite needle cases. toy carriage, mory chair with a glass in the back, 3 pictures framed, one looking glass &c. &c.  What say you to all this.  I am afraid you will think I am crazy, & the next news you hear of me will be that I am in the Lunatic asylum.  But I like to grattify the children & hear their wonder on my return home.  I am sure too you will be pleased at my curiosity shop.  Moreover the Legislature have passed a resolution to pay me about thirty dollars for voting General [Lewis] Cass.  I must get a big fee from Dr. Anderson, Col. Dunham, Eaton &c. 

	Yesterday there was a great todo, in the Legislature, in receiving a visit from Mr. Calhoun.  I did not get to speak to him & did not care to.  My feelings are soured towards him.  The other morning he met Col. Orr & introduced him to Mr. Campbell.  Campbellenquired who Orr was.  When I told him he said I was joking & seemed I hadat his vulgar blackguard looks.  He had evidently been in a debacle the night before & that he will go the same way that Sims has is evident.  

	It is a mistake to suppose that General Thompson has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.  I had a very long talk with him the other night.  I must now conclude my dear wife & write a few lines to Willie.  Isaac Hayne returned from Charleston yesterday all Well.  Mr. Martin has something to send up by me.  Col. [Adley Hogan] Gladden is elected Bursar.  Col. [John L.] Manning will probably be elected Governor.  Col. [Francis W.] Pickens is here but stands no chance.  Miss Martha Calhoun came down in the last stage & was turned over between Newberry & Columbia in the night, but not hurt.  I saw Edward Earle this morning looking unusually smart & genteel.  I told him of the arrival & he seemed not to have heard of it, but it was all pretense.  Tom Pickens came down with her & told me of the accident.  

       General Tompson seemed pleased that you thought Mrs. Tom Jones pretty.  I am glad you have displayed so much freedom in your arrangement with Mrs. Harrison.  When we meet we shall have a great deal to talk over & arrange & I wish it was Sunday night, but here I shall have to stay.  Dear little Fanny how I should like to see her smacking her lips with a bone in her hand.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

 My dear Liz

	I have just returned from a large dinner party at Dr. [Robert Wilson] Gibbes & have time only to write you a few lines.

	I begin to wish to see you & the children very much & I have frequently thought whilst here that it was well enough I was not elected to congress.  I am sure I should be homesick before the Session closed.

	Your letter was recd Sunday evening.  Col. Ware, Ed Earle & myself walked to the Post office.  I pulled off the motto & gave it to Ware.  You feel quite too much interest in my public preferment.  I am pleased at your high estimate of my character & usefulness.  But they are overrated  

	Col. Hayne is elected Attorney General.  Col. Bonham Solicitor in place of Col. Edwards.  Col. Dawkins came very near being beaten by a lawyer not known out of his District.  Iabout the grade of Jefferson Choice.  Dr. Griffin beat Col. Gladden for Treasurer very badly.  Thos P. Butler is elected Commissioner for Greenville.  It is thought Col. Manning will be elected Governor.

	Today I attended the College commencement.  The speech of Col. Preston was a noble one.  A young man by the name of [William] Faber, a nephew of the Rhetts, made one of the best speeches I ever heard from a graduate.  He is an extraordinary fellow.  Wm Elliott says the Barnwell blood has shown itself in him.  General Thompson gave him an invitation to come & live with him & read law with him & myself.

	Nothing further done in the Court of Appeals.  Nor do I know when I shall be able to get off.  Tomorrow the Judges deliver opinions.  Next day we vote for President.  It is probable I may get off Saturday morning in the Stage.

	I have priced the Buggies & they are as dear as they are in Greenville.    I have seen no carriage to fancy.  The carriages now are all coloured, not black.

	I sat beside Chancellor Dunkin at dinner today & had some very interesting conversation.  He said my address was of great service to his sons election in Charleston. Col. Alston spoke in high terms of it.  Chancellor Dunkin did not believe it possible that Mr. Calhoun voted for Orr.  

	Tell Willie I must write him by the next mail.  I hope you will be pleased with Reuben if you have bought him.  In great haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

P.S. [Richard T.] Brumby has been elected Professor of Chemistry.  Tell Willie I want him to study hard & prepare himself for college.  It would give me great pleasure to see him make a speech & take the first honor.

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to say to you that I have been very busy defending Keiths election today before the board of managers & have been successful.  I was employed as a lawyer & will charge a good fee.  It is said I have gained many votes by my defence.  It has united all of Keiths friends on me.  Many of [Frederick Newton] Garvins also go for me.  

	I start in the morning to Cheohee with Col. Norton who is tome the rounds.  I go on horseback & will not reach Pendleton before Sunday or Monday evening.  I have to make a speech here on next Monday, which is sale day & I shall spend the time in the District.  You can go to Pendleton & remain there till I go there or you can go on home.  I will perhaps get there Saturday evening, but if so I shall come up to Pickens on Monday.  

	I hear favorable accounts from old Pendleton.  Col. Orr has the fever at Caesars head & has sent to Greenville for a doctor.  So you may know he is not doing mischief.

	There was a great crowd there today & a favorable account from all quarters.  

	Kiss the children for me.  I hope you may spend your time pleasantly, Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening, as I understand Mr. Elford will return in the morning.  And I shall pursue the same course you did in your first letter to me rece[iv]ed this evening, that is give you a journal of my activities & doings since writing you last week.

	I came to Pendleton Wednesday evening & stopped with Hubbard.  Several gentlemen called to see me, & amongst others William Hayne, who invited me to Mr. Sharpes.  Sharpe was not at home.  I went round the next morning & saw Francis & the children.  The two first or eldest are fine looking children.  The third is not so good looking.

	William Hayne called to consult me as a lawyer in regard to his situation.  I was two hours in conversation with him.  My impression is he is going to marry Miss Sharpe.  I judge so from his conversation & from what I heard.

	Francis sent your mother some beautiful presents & some for Susan & Anne & perhaps you.  They are in my trunk & I have not examined them particularly.

	Mrs. Hubbard & daughter enquired a great deal about you.  In the morning I went to Burts & saw Mrs. Burtspent an hour very pleasantly with him, & he rode back to the village with me.  I crossed the river at John Maxwells & stopped a few minutes.  He was there all alone with his overseer.  He drank some of my brandy & invited me to eat the meanest sort of a dinner or wait till he could have a better cooked.  I declined both.

	Thence I went to Browns store & there heard the most flattering news about my prospects.  Thence to Fair Play.  Reeder told me I would not loose more than fifteen votes at that Box.  Thence to Josiahs where I spent a sad time.  He is a mere skeleton & unable to leave home.  I went in sorrow & deep grief to the graves of my father & mother & so much affected was I that I shed tears all the morning.  Thence to Bachelors Retreat where I saw Verner & family and others & heard the most flattering news of my prospects.  I stopped at a great many houses on the road.  Came to Mrs. Duboses, who was extremely glad to see me.  I delivered your letter & went on to see her Brothers & thence to Fosters, where I staid all night.    My vote in that region is almost unanimous.  Fosters family were all well.  One of Josiahs children had the measles.

Letter 121
Saturday morning I went to muster at West Union & saw a great many people, where it was said Orr would beat me.  But that is a great mistake.  Some of my friends seemed astonished at my great excellence in electioneering.  Today I have seen a great many persons & find everything going well in Pickens.  I shall be at a long way in that neighborhood where Orr thinks he will get all the votes from the fact that they all voted for General Garvin.  Burt told me that he passed through that neighborhood the other day & found there to his great surprise all for me.  It is an old union neighborhood.

	Mrs. Col. Calhoun & Miss Martha have been electioneering for me strongly.  Mrs. Calhoun told one of her tenants that he might continue another year provided he would vote for me.  Miss Martha says publicly that it will be a disgrace to the district if Orr does beat me.

	I have been employed in several cases in court.  I may not return till the last of the week.  I send both of your letters & thank you for your advice.

	Tell Will that Trace is well & the tenor of the country.  South says he will take good care of him.  It is late & I have been interrupted by a good many. yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Col. Townes.

	I will probably be at home Thursday evening.  The murder case which I defend will be tried Wednesday.  I shall have no other business to detain me.

	In regard to the election I have nothing new to write.  My friends are greatly mortified at the result and my opponents are rejoicing.  Mr. Gantt told them they ought to be sorry for their country & not for him.  Elliott Keith says the people did not turn out.  A great many who would have voted for me staid at home, but my opponents were all out.  I have understood that Mr. Calhoun voted for Orr with an open ticket.  It is understood here that he threw the whole weight of his influence against me.    Col. Grisham says that was the cause of my defeat more than liquor.  The Rev. Mr. Kennedy said it was a great shame to see the people led by the noose by one man.  He said I was the most talented man in the congressional district so Boggs told me.  Kennedy was a strong nullifyer too.

	I must conclude & go, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

       I rece[ive]d your letter by Col. Townes & the others sent me.  He was not able to bring the newspapers.  I thank you kindly for your letter as it gives me considerable pleasure to hear from my wife & children when from home.
       
       I came to Pendleton Tuesday morning about eleven oclock.  There I met a crowd of gentlemen waiting for the mail.  They recd me most cordially & all of them came to the tavern to see me.  I sat & conversed with them about two hours & I think we were mutually pleased with each other.  Dr. Symons, Maxwell, Seaborn, , Sloan, Taylor, Lewis, Col. McCord, Maverick Starke &c &c.  Col. McCord gave me a most pressing invitation to go down & see him & offered to meet me at Pendleton on my return with his carriage & carry me down to his House.  Burt says I must come over & stay there three or four days & bring you with me for an excuse, & that I can do good business in the way of electioneering.  He counted about thirty votes for me in the village of Pendleton out of seventy.  He told me afterwards that two or three had said they were for me whom he did not count.
       
	I rode out to see Mrs. Mays but she had gone down to Anderson.  I took tea with Mr. Sharp, his wife & sister.  Mrs. Sharp looks very bad, & I am afraid she is rapidly passing to her grave.  They will be in Greenville next week on their way to North Carolina to see some of Mr. Sharps relations & restore her health.  They desired me to inform your mother.  I invited them to stay a day or two with [us] & come to our house.  
       
       I came up to Pickens Wednesday & came through a verybut they were all absent.  In Pickens Village my vote has increased from a bare majority to two thirds since last winter.  Everything is going on well.  The Burnl[e]y & Johnson debt has done me good service.  Col. Orr is the only democrat who goes for Taylor.  They are all pleased with my course on the Presidential election.  John Sloan who has been bitterly opposed to me, told Burt if Orr went for Taylor he should vote for me.  The Col. Has committed a great mistake in committing himself so soon.
       
       We have been all day trying a case in court, & it will take all of tomorrow & perhaps not finish it.  I shall probably not be at home before Sunday.  The weather is dreadfully hot.  
       
       I intend paying a visit with you to Pendleton this summer.  We can spend a few days there most pleasantly.  I saw Col. Bee who enquired after you all. 
       
       Joseph Powell is here, & told Miles Norton that he intended to vote for methat Col Orr would not get 300 votes in Greenvillethat I had always mistaken his character &c.
       
       Kiss the children for me.  Yours in great haste & true affection, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter this evening, & Willies on the same sheet.  Tell Willie he has improved very much in writing & I showed his letter to Col. Dawkins & Mr. Yancey who were sitting near me when I opened it.  Col. Dawkins asked me how many children I counted now & remarked I was not going on as rapidly as I commenced.

	I have just returned from the college through rain & mud.  We have made no election of Professor of Chemistry or Burser yet.  It is probable that Mr. Brumby will be elected & Col. Gladden will probably remain as Burser.  

	I think Col. Haynes prospects are pretty good for the attorney generalship.  I dined with Martin yesterday & saw his wife & children.  Porter, Perrin , Davant & Johnson were at the table.  Mrs. Martin seems to have very little to say.  I am to send your box to her to carry to Charleston.

	I went to the State House today for the first time.   Just as I entered the Senate chamber, I heard Col., Felder say in his speech I regret that the Senator from Greenville who then adorned this Body is not now a member of it.  He came to me after finishing his speech & said he did not know I was present & that I must have blushed.

	I saw Mr. William Elliott here yesterday.  He delivered an agricultural address.  I spent some time in pleasant conversation with himenquired after his son & wife & told him you were intimate with her.

	I have made considerable purchases in the way of silver forks & tea spoonstwo dozen (large & small) forks beautiful indeed & not to be told from entire silver for $18.00one dozen of large tea spoons for $18.00with your initials engraved on each spoon.

	I am not yet through the court of Equity.  My law cases are all disposed ofthe result not known however.

	It is said the governor can hardly surviveis very illthought this evening to be dying.

	You are so much pleased with Reuben.  I suppose you & Mrs. Horn are well are mull[ing] such a trade.  I do not know when I shall returnnot yet had time to look at buggies & carriages.  I think I shall go up in the stage.  The roads will be very bad.  I am sorry Jim had not reached home when you wrote me.  I was anxious to hear he had arrived safely.

	There is great electioneering herenever saw the likehad been in the Senate but a few minutes before Governor Richardson came to me to electioneer with me for Col. Manning.  I told him they were all my friends & I would not interfere.

	I met General Brisbane & Col. Edwards in the lobby of the State House.  Col. Orr was standing by me.  The General began to express his astonishment at my defeat.  Col. Edwards gave the hint that my opponent was present.  The General saidthat fellow--he looks like a taper and seemed horrified.  I have never before met with so many flattering & cordial expressions.  I think my defeat has given me great reputation.  Col. Alston said he read my address on the Presidency with great interest & approved it highly.

	I left my gold pen at home & I miss it very much I assure you.  Kiss the children for megood nightGod bless you, B.F. Perry

You see I desire to learn the duties of a husband.  You already know the duties of a wife.  My clothes cost $35.00.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne.  He looks this & sad.  He & Col. DeTreville are the only candidates for atty general.  The result is very doubtful.  I saw General Martin today.  He said Mrs. Martin was with him keeping house in Columbia.  Mrs. Taylor is purportedly confined today & is very ill.  Col. Taylor is absent in Alabama.  They are all well in Charleston.  Your box for Mrs. Hayne Col. Martin has promised to have sent to Charleston.

	I was in the court of Appeals all daydid not go to the State Housewas studying Dr. Andersons case.  My business will not come up before Wednesday.  I may get through this week but will have to remain here all next week.

	My friends have greeted me in most flattering terms & express the utmost astonishment at my defeat.  They all lament in most sincere terms my absence from the Legislature.  General Thompson says that Elmore will resign & if so, I can be elected President of the Bank very easily.  I am sure there is a very kind feeling towards me in the Legislature.

	We had a pleasant trip down here but of this Jim can give you some account.  Col. Ware has not yet arrived.  Judge Richardson declines being a candidate for governor.  General Thompson was disappointed in Georgia.  Austen left no will.  He now goes on to Washington.

	I shall not be able to return today, as I wrote you by Mr. Elford.

	The murder case in which I was engaged was tried Tuesday evening, & resulted in a verdict of manslaughter.  There were some Georgia lawyers here & amongst them a son of Judge Underwood who told me that he had waited to hear my speech & he had not been disappointedthat it was the only speech that he had heard during our court although General Thompson & General Whitner had spoken.  Mr. Underwood was also a Whig.

	Mr. Allen another lawyer from Georgia told me in the presence of Judge Frost that Judge Dougherty of Georgia although a Taylor man, regretted deeply my defeat when he heard of the result of the election.  I became acquainted with Judge Dougherty some years since at Greenville.  He is a man of great talent & high character & a noble fellow as he said of me.

	General Thompson has been talking a good deal about my offering for the Presidency of the Bank.  He requested Coil. Townes to speak of it in Columbia.  Elliott Keith has proposed me as a candidate for the Senate of the U. Statessays that some of the members of the Legislature here had promised to support me.  But this is all idle and I tell it to you for the want of something better to write.  My friends are all disposed for me to run again at the next election.

	 I recd Fifty seven dollars in cash yesterday my costs in the case of Reed vs Keith.  I filed a bill in Equity last night which will be worth fifty dollars.  General Thompson says that the chancellor has decreed in our favour in the case of Evans & Boston.  If so we shall get a handsome fee.  

	I saw Mr. Lee yesterday, also Foster & three of his sons.  They are all well.  Josiah is very low & speaks of coming to [Greenville] with aunt Foster.  In haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter and was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I had been invited by Col. Wigfall to drink wine with himself & Col. Manning & left the table when the mail was opened to get your letter.  The insisted on my not going but I said I expected to hear from you.

	I have but a short time, as I have to go down to the college immediately after tea to hear the Senior Class speak.  I was there last night till eleven oclock & as a trustee occupied quite a
conspicuous seat amidst the Professors & Judges, surrounded by a crowded gallery of Ladies & gentlemen.  The students performed well, and the college is in a most prosperous state.

	I arrived here Wednesday evening just in time to take my seat at the Board of Trustees and we were kept sitting until after eleven oclock.  We met again next Wednesday nightno election of Burser yet.  There are about twenty candidates.  I had hardly got out of the stage when Dr. Davis called to electioneer with me.  I told him I had to vote for Anderson but if he withdrew I would support him.

	I have been today performing a duty imposed on Mr. Withers, Col. Manning & myself as a committee of the Board of Trustees to Report on the communications recd from the President & Professors.  Tomorrow night I am invited by Col Preston to go round to his house & eat strawberries.  He wishes the Trustees to meet the senior class at his house.

	I have not yet, & am afraid I will not reach any of my cases in the court of Appeals, for a week or ten days.  In fact there is some danger of having to stay here till the last of the month.  But for my duty as Trustee I should return home & come back again.

	None of the lawyers from my circuit will be here before Monday.  We will then determine what to dowhether to wait or postpone our cases.  

	I came down all alone on the stage to Newberry.   There I was joined by Mr. Pope & two young menone of them comes down to be admitted to the Bar.  Tom Jones & Players son Daniel came up last night to apply.  Jones looked so plain I hardly knew him.  He has cut off all his beard, & laid aside his fine clothes, & looks like a different being.  He says I must give him a certificate of moral character as he is better acquainted with me than any other lawyer here.  [James L.] Petigrus son does not seem promising.

	I sawButler & delivered his letters & bundles.  The package to H. Thurston I sent [page torn] Summer, who enquired for his little friend as soon as he spoke to me.    He seems to have been very much taken with Willie.  I have not seen or heard from Taylor.  General Bonham enquired after you all.  He seems very happy & talks about his anxiety to get back home again.

	I will write you again on Monday next.  Tell Jim as soon as he has finished replanting to plant the new ground, & sow the herds grass in the wet places, where it is too wet for corn.

	I will execute all your commissions contained in your letter.  Tell Will I will bring him the ball &c.  If Will goes to school again, make him come home at twelve oclock.  Take care of yourself & the children, my dear wife, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and thank you for it.  I was anxious to hear from you, & walked up to the Post office before the hour for opening & delivering letters.  The post master saw me through a crack & opened the office.  Whilst I was standing reading your letter in the piazza of the office Judge Evans came up & enquired how I could get letters out.  I replied the post master knew me & supposed I was anxious to hear from my wife.  The Judge said do you not thank God that you were not elected  [to Congress--you ought to.

	Since writing to you I have bought a beautiful wig for $10.00 & it has improved my looks very much.  I immediately made Col. Herndon buy one to cover his grey head.  He now looks about thirty five.  I told him when Mrs. Herndon comes down this week I intend to have them married over again.  She would hardly recognize him.  

	I have made considerable purchases since I wrote you besides the wig.  Col. Dunhams agent offered to pay me if I would take out the draft in his store.  I thought it best to do so & purchased the following articlesone dozen tumblers $5.00dozen wine glasses $6.00all the finest cut glasses or stonea set of beautiful decanters, cut glass, 4 in number $16.00two wash basins & pitchers 3.00two vegetable dishes $3.00one entry lamp (gas light) $6.50a most splendid affairone chamber lamp (gas) $2.50cream pot 75ctsmolasses pitcherdo very handsome $2.50one small beautiful basin & pitcher for Annas room &c &c.

	I have also purchased two bedsteads for $8.00 & $6.00three mattresses $6.75 a pieceone mahogany folding table $14.00one crib mattress $2.50.

	I do not expect to go to Charleston or purchase groceries till I return home.  Next spring we will go to town as you suggest & lay in our supplies.  Tell Anna I will buy her ear rings.  I will get the shawl for Anne &c &c.  But have not yet had time.

	I saw Captain Cunningham this morning.  He called to see me & is a member of the convention.

	There was a meeting of the delegates yesterday evening & it was agreed that we would not do anything more than organize a central committee to correspond with the Southern people.  Tomorrow the convention meets & there is a great crowd in Columbia as we usually see at the meeting of the legislature.

	I was employed in a case from Newberry to be argued before Judge Frost at chambers Wednesday & shall get a good fee.  The case is a dispute about a child between the grandmother & the aunt of the child.

	It is more than likely that our cases in the court of Appeals will not be reached & that I may return home the last of this week.  

	Col. Irby & Mr. Young came down this evening.  They brought news that Edward Earle was probably not alive.  Col. Irby tells me that he will pay the interest & desires to do so.

	I am sorry to hear of the death of Durbecs child & that Elias Earle was in the bar room so soon after the death of his wife.  His son came up to me the other day & made himself known.  He is going to school here.

	I have no doubt that Dr. Tiddiman is sick of his purchase.  You are mistaken in saying that I have a horror of long letters.  Yours are never too long except when you scold me, or give me too much advice.

	I hope the children are well and that Reuben is getting on well with the farm.  I am glad you have had a fine rain.

	I must now conclude.  You have no doubt heard of the dreadful in New York.  The last account is that 500 men were killed in the last one & that the mob had overcome the military and that they had sent to Philadelphia for aid.  
	
       I hope the children are through with the mumps & poor little Fanny rid of her complaint.  Yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

Friday evening, May 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from dining with Mr. Petigru & shall not have time to write you as long a letter as I intended to do before I shall be under the necessity of going to attend the college exhibition.

	Since my arrival here I have been busy, the greater part of the time in court listening to Mr. Petigru, Col. Hunt, Col. Memminger & Judge henry arguing some very important cases.  When I shall reach mine is very uncertain.  

	In coming down I did not get to see Col. Irby, but was told that he will be here Sunday night.  The draft Col. Dunham gave me has not been paid.  His agent says he owes him nothing so I shall probably not have funds to purchase many things or go to Charleston.

	At Laurens there was a passenger in the stage who had been overseeing all his life for wealthy planters in the lower country who amused me greatly as I came to town.  Amongst many others
he had overseed for Mr. Wigfall father in law of Dr. Simmons.  He says the Dr. has moved nine times since his marriagethat his wife is one of the finest ladies he ever knewthat he has spent a large portion of his fortune, but will have a handsome competency on the death of Mrs. Wigfall.

	At Newberry I passed Mrs. Walker without seeing her.  That night Mr. Higgins came to the Hotel and asked me to take charge of two young ladies, nieces of Col. Fairs, who were going to Columbia.  I found them very pleasant & agreeable.  One of them was from Florida.  They were going to Dr.  Fairs in Columbia.  We had a great deal of amusement with the overseer who told us about his family difficulties &c.  He & his wife lived very badly together.  The young ladies pronounced him a hen picked husband & his wife a

	On my arrival in Columbia I found a whole troop of Arabs in Maybins tavern.  They are as black as mulattoes & two of them have fine looking English wives & children.  They are dressed in the Arabian costume & present a fanciful appearance.

	That night I attended the Board of Trustees & General Adams & myself were sent to the college to represent them at the exhibition of the students.  The college was crowded with ladies, & Adams said we were selected because we were the finest looking members of the Board.  Col. Summer said the ladies in the gallery made the same remark when we came in.

	I met Mr. Brumby on the stage in college but we did not recognise each other.  When I found out who he was I spoke to him.  He said I had entirely changed every feature &c.  He invited me to take tea with him & get an acquaintance with Mrs. Brumby who was an intimate friend of your mother.  I suppose he meant Mrs. Hayne.

	I have never seen so many lawyers in Columbia.  There are 70 here & more coming.  Petigru came to me in court today & said I must go & dine with him at Clarks Hotel.  We spent a pleasant evening & walked over the town off Columbia after dinner.  He told me that he wished to see me a Judgethat I was a great fool for coming out for Cass last summerthat he reached Pendleton two days after my declaration & if it had been two days before he would have stopped me.

	I have bought myself a coat, two pairs of pantaloons, two waistcoats for $23.00.  One of the waistcoats is French linen & I know you will oppose my taste.  

	I am anxious to hear from you & the children.  I saw the uncle of Mrs. Earle who was greatly shocked at her death.  Major Henry & daughter are here.  Miss Henry seems a great favourite with her teacher & Dr. Lieber.  She learns very fast.

	Kiss the children for me.  I will write you by the next mail.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before going to bed & I hope you will write me by Col. Townes Wednesday morning.

	I suppose our groceries & bedding have arrived from Hamburgh & that you are perhaps tonight engaged in unpacking.  I wish I was with you to help you & enjoy the pleasure of a first look at the different articles not forgetting the little matters purchased for you by your Aunt.

	I hope too that Col. Dunhams wagons with the paint have arrived & that Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell will commence the House.

	I had a very hot day on Sunday & severe headache Baylis Crayton & Wagstaff travelled in company with me.  We dined at the spring & there met a man & woman eating their dinneralso the man called me by name & Crayton seemed to know him well.  I offered him my bottle & then proposed making some toddy for his wife as I supposed.  I gave her [page torn] rush & was very polite.  When they started, Crayton told me the woman was Mrs. Patterson of noted fame about Greenville.  You maty imagine my surprise.

	There is very little business in court.  I have found it pleasant meeting Chancellor Dargan.  We served four years together in the Senate.

	It was reported the other day in Anderson that Mrs. Sharp was dead.  But Dr. Sloane told me he saw her riding out on Saturday.  She is so ill that she cannot lie down to sleep, but has to sleep sitting up in her chair.

	I had a dreadful headache today, & shall take pills tonight.  I did intend going by Pendleton, but shall not be able to do so.  

	I saw Mr. Keith here & told him he must collect some money for me at court.

	There is a fine crop growing on Josiahs farm.  I go there in the morning.

	I saw Mrs. Mays carriage in the village this morning with a trunk behind.

	General Whitner is walking on crutches.  He was badly crippled in the ankle by a fall from his horse.

	I shall be at home on Friday.  Tell Reuben to keep ploughing & let Mary help hoe the corn.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Spartanburgh  

My dear Liz

	I will avail myself of the opportunity of writing to you by Mr. Choice whop returns to Greenville this morning.

	It is likely I may return myself tomorrow.  The case of Dr. Bivins & Col. Leitner has been postponed & another case in which I am concerned will be disposed of today.  Unless I am employed in some new business I shall have nothing to detain me longer.  I hope to see today some persons who were to settle fees with me at this court.  One on them I saw yesterday and recd from him sixty two dollars.

	I found poor Delia in a hopeless situation.  She sent word immediately on my arrival that she wished to see me.  She was dreadfully emaciated & unable to get out of bed.  I could not help shedding tears when she enquired affectionately after you & the children.  How long she may linger I am unable to say.  It is some consolation to know that she is with her mother & will not be neglected on her death bed.

	It is a sad sight to see one sinking gradually into an unknown eternity & reflect that they have to give up life and this world and all ties which bind us to life.

	Chancellor Dunkin is presiding & he enquired after you & your mother very kindly.  I stopped at Mrs. Dantzellers for dinner on Sunday.  She asked about you & whether you had altered or changed much.  She said I had not at all since the first time she saw me, twenty two years sincethat I looked as well now as I did then.  I told her you were as young & as good looking as you were when you were married at seventeen.  I also told her & Judge Dunkin the mistake {page torn] client who took you [page torn] daughter.

	Mrs. Dantzeller enquired whether all of my children were as good looking as Willie.  I think I shall have to carry Frank with me on the circuit.

	I hope Fanny is better & that you are all well.  I have just heard of the death of General McDuffie.  It is well for him as he had outlived his mind and strength.  Mrs. Singleton is also dead.  

	I must conclude, yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  It was my intention to have returned home from this place & then to have gone to Bachelors Retreat before Pickens Court.  But yesterday Mr. Burt had me retained in a case in court with a fee of fifty dollars, & directly afterwards Mr. Harrison came to employ me on the other side with himself & General Whitner.

	I shall not now be able to return home till after Pickens court.

	We had quite a strong time in the convention at Abbeville, as well as going & returning.  But the Rail Road has been secured to Greenville and the people of Anderson are very much outraged at it.

	You must tell Reuben to attend to the hogs in the field & feed them as they have eaten up all the peas by this time.  As soon as he has gotten the corn out of the other field, & dug the potatoes & ground nuts, he must turn the hogs in that.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  You must write to me at Pickens by some of the Lawyers.  I am so anxious to return home that I felt indifferent about getting a fee to detain me here.

	Tell the children to learn their lessons & get no more ther from Dr. Laurens.  Yours truly, B.F Perry

	You must write me on Sunday by Mr. Elford, Townes or Choice and let me hear all your newshow you are doing &c.  How Reuben comes on with the corn &c.

	I was at a musical concert last night at Mrs. Daniels Academy & heard all of her scholars perform.  Saw & spoke to Mrs. Daniels, Miss Payne & Mrs. Mays & Miss Marion.  They all enquired after you.

	Mr. Elford is now about starting & I have just left the C. House to write you a line only.  

	It will probably be the last of the week before I return.  I have had a good share of business & have recd some money.

	Our client Young is to be tried tomorrow for counterfeiting.

	Nothing has been done in any of my cases yet.
       
	Mr. Farley has gone to Memphis, & has entrusted all of his business to me.
       
       In the case of Dr. Teagues, argued last summer in the court of Equity, the decree of Chancellor Dargan has been rece[ive]d & is in my favor.
       
       Dr. Teague was so much pleased at the result that he paid me two hundred dollars this morning.  He will pay me the balance in Columbia about one hundred more.  He had already paid me $140 or 150 dollars.  
       
	Mrs. Philson owes me $100 & promised to pay me a part this court but I have not yet 
seen her.  Her daughter Mary Dillon has a very important case in court & poor woman is about being confined & not able to be at court.  This is her second slip.  You remember she paid us a visit two years since.  

	It is very doubtfull whether Dr. Andersons case will be reached this court.  There is a woman to be tried here for murdering the mistress of her husband.  An unusual number of witnesses is bound over in the case.

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this morning & thank you kindly for it though I wish you had said more about the children.  In writing to me always let the first topics be yourself, and children, the servants & HorsesThen our friends & neighbors &c.

	I have recd since writing to you a letter & package from Mrs. Cunningham enclosing a bay to you.  I will enclose her letter, which I broke open thinking it was directed to myself.  The Bay is a beautiful one & I wish I could send it to you immediately.

	It is possible that I may be at home Saturday evening.  I have tried only one of my cases, which I gained, Nashe vs Rodgers for land.  We are now trying another one of mine, Hudgens vs Kennedy.  The case of Dr. Anderson & Neeley has been postponed for want of time.  The case of Dillard vs Philsen I am afraid cannot be reached and if I find that out tomorrow I will leave here Saturday morning.  

	The woman has been convicted of manslaughter for killing the mistress of her husband.  It was a shocking case.  The parties were all poor & unprincipled.  It took place in Mr. Cunninghams neighborhood.

	I am sorry forSimmons & it is a pity that such a man should not have more sense.  It seems hard that that some men should be placed in this world, wholly unfitted for it.

	I hope H. Judge Moore will do better in Charleston than he did in Greenville.  I am afraid that Miss Trott will find that she wants something more than Moore to keep her pleasantly tattling through life & the world.

	I am sorry too for Mrs. Power.  She never will be happy from her husband & perhaps never happy with him.  Poor woman deserves a better fate but no doubt her own imprudence has in some way influenced her destiny.

	I was greatly shocked yesterday in seeing a friend of mine. Griffin Williams, the brother of Col. Williams looking very bad & ascertaining that he had separated from his wife.  The cause no one knows.  He is a gentleman & an amiable man.  His wife was a young, & a fine lady.  They have children & a large fortune and are young people.
	My friend Nance was here as a witness in court.  He is a good fellow & I like him much.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening although I have but letter to communicate.  Willie is seated by me reading the Evenings of old story tellers.

	We had a very dusty drive down here.  At Laurens we fell in company with Col Irby, Col Ware, & Major Smith.  On the road we fared sumptuously.

	I have met a great many of my acquaintances here from different parts of the state, who have all given me a most hearty welcome back to the Legislature.  Mr. Mitchell said he was glad to see me as Col. Memminger had had the House under his control long enough.  He wanted me to divide his influence.  Col. Fair told me that Col. John Preston asked him about my running for Governor. He replied that the upper country intended to run me for U. States Senator if there were two or three candidates from the lower country.

	General Whitner has gone to Florida & requested me to ask leave of observer for him, which I did today.

	I saw Col. Martin who enquired after you & said he had a box for some of you.  I told him I could send it up by Col. Townes wagon the latter part of this week.  I met Col. Isaac Hayne this morning in the Court House.  He seemed very careless about speaking & did not even enquire about any of you.  I showed equal indifference in regard to him & thought to myself how different his manner was last fall when he was electioneering.  I believe it is true, that we mutually dislike each other.

	I have bought myself a frock coat $20.00, pantaloons $9.00, do $7.00, hat $4.00. boots $8.00, gloves $1.25, cravat 2.50, cap for Willie $1.50, two books for Willie $1.50.

	I have not had time to look for a shawl yet.

	Col. Tandy Walker is here & a candidate for comptroller general but I should suppose with very little hope of success.

	There is a crowd of candidates for door keeper & no election yet made.  

	I saw today a beautifulof pictures to be sold tonight.

	Col. Irby insisted that I should take ten shares $200 in the Laurens Rail Road that he wouldname & would get me fees to pay the installments. I told him I would promise to take in stock all the fees he would get for me at Laurens whilst the road was building.

	Willie is greatly admired by all who see him.  He takes care of himselfwent up in the gallery today & sat there all the time the House was in session.  He must write you by the next mail.

	You had better have the top of the house cleaned off.  If the weather is bad & Reuben cannot plough let him & Charles split rails for the cross fence which is not high enough.  

        Tell the children I want to see them all very much & will bring them all some candy.  Willie is a great comfort to me & company for me.  
       
       I am my dear wife yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was detained so long at the meeting of the Board of Trustees the other night that it was out of my power to write you by the last mail.

	I recd your letter by Mr. Elford & also the package which I have handed over to the shoe maker.

	Dr. Erwin told me yesterday that he left your letter in his old coat at home.  I was very much provoked at it & told him I has a great notion to whip him for his negligence, not having recd a letter from you by the last mail.  I was anxious to hear from you.  It is always best to send letters by mail.  

	Willie commenced writing you a letter the other day & will finish it to go by this mail.  The whole letter is his own production and was written whilst I was out of the room.  I only told him to write you all that he had seen & heard.

	I have bought him a very pretty suit of clothes, black cloth frock coat.  He looks like a little man with his cravat on.

I saw Col. Isaac Hayne the other day& he seemed more cordial & said he would send Isaac to see Willie, but has not yet done so.  General Martin said Taylors son must come & take charge of him, but he has not.  Dr. Erwin brought his little son with him & he & Willie were together yesterday.

	I have bought Willie three very pretty books & he is now reading one of them & laughing heartily at the stories.  He behaves like a little manwent to the show last night by himself whilst I went to meet a committee.  He sits in the gallery till two oclock, then goes to the tavern & eats his dinner amongst the crowd.  The members do not dine till 3 oclock.

	I have written a long letter for the Mountaineer, which I will enclose to you [not present] to read Sunday night & send up to Wells, soon, Monday morning.

	I have not yet made any purchase of a shawl, as I wish to see how the ladies are dressed on Monday at the College commencement, whether they wear shawls or mantillas or something else.

	I have exchanged my gold pencil for a gold pen & pencil, the prettiest thing you ever did see & gave eight dollars to boot.  I have forty dollars left.  I think of purchasing an overcoat which is now worn entirely instead of cloaks.

	Tell Anna, Frank & Fanny that I will bring them something nice or prettycertainly the cocoa cakes for Fanny. I want to see you all very much.

	I recd a letter from Mr. Stuart the other day.  Who the Trustees will select I am unable to say.  He thanks me for my politeness to him in Greenville & regrets that his wifes health will not permit his coming to Greenville.

	I am glad to hear Charles & Reuben are ploughing.  Hope the servants will all do well.  Kiss the children.  Yours affectionately. B.F. Perry

2 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a letter this morning before I go to church for fear I may be prevented afterwards, as I was the other evening in attending the Board of Trustees.

	I have read a letter from your aunt Eliza requesting me to let Willie pay them a visit when next Jas. Conner returns.  But Willie says he will not go without I do.  He is a manly little fellow & I think a most remarkable boy.  Since he came here he has read three books of considerable size, I had to purchase another for him last night.  Dressed up in his suit of cloth, silk waist coat & frock coat he looks like a little man.  He goes to the State House, sits in the gallery alone, observed everything that is done in the House & comments on the proceedings at night as if he were a member.

	Yesterday we took a ride on the Greenville Rail Road.  The Judges were all with us & they all renewed their acquaintance with Willie.  The road is finished seven r eight miles.  The car purchased for the road is the most beautiful one I ever saw.

	Last night Mr. Yeadon & Judge Porter of Alabama called to see me.  The Judge said he would have known me any where by my Bust in Mr. Yeadons drawing room. Yeadon has got Clark Mills to make one from the mould in his possession, which Mills has preserved.  I was very much pleased with Judge Porter.

	I am going to the Episcopal church this morning.  Tomorrow is commencement in college & a great day.  Willie will see a great deal.  Yesterday he heard the cannon firing for the first time & at first did not know what it was.  

       Col. Isaac Hayne & his son called to see Willie & myself the other day & we were not in the room.  His son Isaac & William Taylor came in the evening and spent a few minutes with Will & invited him to see them.  He has not yet been.

	I recd your letter by the Fridays mail & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself in my absence.  I hope you will continue to dance.  I am anxious to return home again.  But having Will with me is a comfort & he behaves so well it is doubly pleasing & grattifying.

	It has now commenced raining very hard & I do not suppose we shall be able to go to church.  How I should like to be at home & spend the day with you & anna, Frank & Fannydear little creatures.  There is no place like home.  There are no persons like wife & children.  

	Elford, , Green & Dr. Erwin are all here. But I have neither seen or heard of Jones.  The idea of his offering for solicitor is absurd.  Walker is here & ran twice for Comptroller General & got three votes both times.  Jones would not get as many for solicitor.  How people can deceive themselves.  Walker really thought he could be elected, & out of 164 votes recd 3!  Elias Earle was not a candidate.

	I do not know that I mentioned that Mr. & Mrs. Burt passed through Columbia on their way to Washington.  I saw them sitting in the gallery & Mrs. Burt was spruced up very fine.  Before I got an opportunity of speaking to her she left.  Burt & myself spent some time together & went to call on the governor together.  He has become as fat as a bear.  I saw Barnwell Rhett yesterday, who gave me a most cordial greeting.  He too is fattened up very much.  I was introduced to Heyward the other day who married Miss Smith or Rhett.  He enquired after you & your mother & Susan & Anne.  He was under the impression that Anne was married & Susan single.  Mrs. Isaac Hayne is here, but I have not seen her.

	Tell Fanny I will bring my pocket full of cocoa cakes for her.  Anna & Frank shall be remembered.  You shall be in the way of a shawl but I have not yet seen anything of the kind.  The four ladies I have seen wore mantillas & not shawls. 

	I have bought myself an over sack like my Canada sack only larger for $12.00.  It is worn over my coat & looks very genteel & is all the fashion.  Cloaks are thrown aside as old fashion. 

	I hope to receive a letter from you tonight.  The last mail Col. Fair & myself went to the Post office together & he said he was very anxious [to] get a letter from his wife, but did not.  I however recd one from you, & thought to myself you were more thoughtful of your husband.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am greatly vexed that you had not received my letters when you wrote me on Friday.  I have written you three times & sent you a long letter to read which I wrote for the Mountaineer.  Willie has also written you a letter & would have made it longer by was interrupted by a visit from his cousins.

	I was glad to receive your letter Sunday evening.  I hope you have recd all my letters before this reaches you.  Yesterday I went to church with Willie although it rained.  Today I have been in the college all day attending the commencementWillie with me.  The chapel was full of Ladies & the young men spoke well.  I had some conversation with Col. Preston.  His health is better though he is very feeble.   
	 
	I wrote your Aunt Mrs. Eliza Hayne yesterday in reply to the letter sent me inviting Willie to visit them.

	I have been appointed on the committee to examine some students day after tomorrow.  The committee consists of Memminger. DeTreville, DeSaussure, Bonham & myself.  In the Board of Trustees I was appointed one of the visitors to attend the college next Fall & witness the examination of the students receiving the pay of a member of the Legislature.  Tonight there was a caucus to send delegates to attend a convention of the Southern States at Nashville next June.  I was to have been one of the delegates, but the appointment was postponed till next week.  In walking to the college today with General he suggested to me the propriety of my being the anti Bank candidate for Governor, which I declined.

	I have mentioned those little matters to you knowing the interest you take in everything which looks like a compliment to your husband.

	Willie is as great a book worm as myself.  He is now sitting at the table reading & it is near ten oclock in the night.  Mr. Keith has just informed me that he will leave here Wednesday morning for Greenville & I will keep this letter open till tomorrow evening & send it by him.

	I have nothing more to add since writing the above.  Willie says he will write to you in the morning.  He is the greatest book worm I ever saw of his age.

	I was looking at some shawls this morning, but was not altogether pleased with them.  They were $7.00 & $12.00.  I will take a good look before I purchase.  Shawls are said to be now fashionable.

	We shall adjourn about the 18th next.  No great question has yet come up for discussion.  Col. Williams told me this morning that the members of his boarding house had held a caucus last night and agreed on me for a candidate for Governor.  Really this thing is more spoken of than I had any idea.

	It is my purpose to carry Willie around to Taylors this evening, but I have no time to do anything.  Tonight I have to attend the Board of Trusteesattend the committee on the Penitentiary and I wish to hear Governor Hammonds speech in College.

	Today the gallery was crowded with ladies.  Col. Pickens & his wife & daughters were there & I found it difficult to distinguish the wife amidst the daughters.  They all seemed about the same age.

	It is now near five oclock & I have yet to eat dinner so I must conclude.  Your affectionate Husband &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I reced your letters by yesterdays mail & thank you kindly for them.  I also recd Annas & was truly astonished at the writing.    I had no idea that she could write so well.  Really she writes a better hand than I do myself, & I told Willie she could beat him.  I think Anna a most extraordinary little girl.  There are very few in the State who can read & write like her at her age.  Willie is the admiration of all the members & behaves like a little man.  Really he seems more like a man in his behaviour & conversation than a boy.  You say Fanny is an extraordinary little girl & I agree with you.  She is in my opinion the smoothest of all our children.  Frank will have to depend on his good looks for his success in life.  But I think he too has talents & talents enough to distinguish himself.  Like all parents our young ones are all ous.

	Last night Willie went with me to the Catholic Fair after I got through with the committee on the Penitentiary.  This was about eight oclock.  I never saw such a jam in my life.  It was indeed not decent for a lady to be there, for she was pressed in front, rear & each side, till not only the dress, but the figure of her person was changed.  The display was magnificent in every way.  In one room there were the most beautiful Tableaux vivant[s] the eye ever beheld.  Willie was en with them.  He passed through & under the crowd in a dark room till he got in front of the ladies & close to the tableaux.  There he stood for one hour looking whenever the curtain was raised. 

	Today he went round to Taylors & staid there till the hour of dinner when he returned to the House & did not eat anything till 4 oclock.  I started to go with him, but met Eloise Butler & Col. Haynes little sons & I then turned back & yesterday I saw Mrs. Isaac Hayne in the Gallery & from the Hall she looked very well.  I think her features good & her face a fine one.  She looks very different from the idea I had formed of her.  

	The Gallery for two days has been crowded with young ladies & they talked so much & so loud  that the doorkeeper had to hollow out three or four times Silence in the Gallery.  Mrs. Dawkins is here, Miss Thompson & Miss Pickens.

	The election of Controller General resulted today in the election of McCully.  Arthur Simpkins came to me & said on account of old associations I must vote for him after Pickens was out of the way.  I told him I had pressed my friend Col. Williams to vote for McCully.  He said Col. Williams & himself were kin & it was strange that he should be electioneering against him.

	We have not yet had any discussion in the House.  I made a few remarks yesterday on a bill which passed making it a whipping offence to sell spirits to a slave.  Tomorrow the great discussion commences on the Bank.  Col. Memminger came to me & said he wished me to hold back & not speak till the latter part of the debate, so that I might reply to the onslaught which would be made on him.

	   Tonight I am going down to meet the opponents of the Bank & arrange for the battle tomorrow.  Willie will write you a letter whilst I am gone and tomorrow I will write one to Anna.

	You need not have sent the money to pay for the shoes.  I went to look at shawls again today, but the store was full of ladies, & I deferred the inspection.

	Col. Irby says if he had known that I was going to bring Willie he would have brought his little son Jones.  Col. Ware says the same.  So next Winter I expect all the members will follow my example.  Willie has a cloth pair of pantaloons & silk vest.coat.  All fit well & he looks like a little man.  Major Henry calls him governor.  Willie says he expects Frank dreams about him at night with his eyes open.

	There are some beautiful canary birds here for sale.  Four dollars a pair & Willie is anxious to buy a pair for Anna.  They are sweet little things & I am almost tempted to do so.

	I wrote you last mail by Mr. Keith & about twelve oclock some time in Columbia.  If he did not put the letter in the Post office you were disappointed again in hearing from me.  But if you do not hear any mail you must know there has been some mistake or I am busy.

	General [James H.] Adams took me out the other day to tell me that my friends were going to run me for President of the Bank.  But I tell you all these little matters confidentially.

	I am invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow.  But it is likely I shall not be able to go.

	I must now go to meet my anti Bank friends at the State house & will leave Will at home to write you a letter.  Kiss all the children for me.  I am very impatient to see you all again.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Little Daughter

	You can hardly imagine how pleased I was to receive your beautiful letter.  I had no idea you could write so well.  Indeed you write better than Willie.  I told him so & that he must take more pains in his next letter to his mother.  You must write me another letter.

	There is a German who arrived here the other day with some hundreds of canary birds in little  cages & sells them at four dollars a pair.	 How would you like to have a couple of the little creatures.  If you will write to me perhaps I may purchase two of them for you.  They sing beautifully.  But strange to say all the singing & chattering is done by the male bird.  The female does not chatter at all.  This reverses what is common in our species.

	The other day in the State House the Gallery was filled with young ladies & little girls & they kept up a chattering all the time like the canary birds. & disturbed the members by their noise.  But as soon as they left the Gallery all was quiet again.

	In the course of four or five years I will bring you down here to Columbia with me.  I wish you had been here the other night to have seen the Tableaux vivant at the Catholic Fair.  They were beautiful little girls & boys & ladies standing, reclining & sitting like pictures & Statues.  Willie was very much pleased & I am sure you would have been too.

	Willie & myself have been invited to ride on the rail road to Camden next Tuesday & perhaps we may go if I can leave the Legislature.  But today the Bank question came up & it is too important a question to leave.

	I will now stop writing & finish my letter this evening after I return from the State House,  Something may occur which your mother would be glad to hear.  Willie shall write to you by the next mail.  He has some beautiful books which you shall read when we return.  They are full of pictures & such pretty stories that I have been reading them myself.

	I have just returned from the State House, ate my dinner went to the Post & recd your mothers letter of Wednesday.  I had just seen Col. Thos P. Butler who came down in the stage this evening & told me you were all well.  I was glad to hear from you by letter although it was a short one.  Willie had not eaten dinner today when the Legislature adjourned & therefore I did not go to dine with the Governor as I had been invited & had some idea of doing.

	We had a crowd of ladies in the gallery today & Col. Memminger your friend who you took for a man selling chickens made an able argument against the Bank.  Mr. F. P. Reed of Anderson replied to him, but in a very feeble manner.  General Adams will speak tomorrow.  I may speak Monday or Tuesday.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne & his lady in the gallery & spoke to the Col. after the Legislature adjourned.  He immediately commenced electioneering with me for his friend Dr. Stark.  I answered your aunt Eliza Haynes letter & wrote very politely & pleasantly.  She too had written me about her [husbands]  office more than about Willie.  I told her it would always afford me great pleasure to serve her as her family & that she had only to command my service.

	I am glad to hear Sam Earle has bought his Brothers land.  He has paid a high price for it.

	I did not receive a ticket to the commencement Ball & therefore did not go as I usually do.

	I have bought for your mother one of the prettiest shawls I ever saw.  It is a dress shawl & quite large cashmere.  White in the center & large wide borders of flowers extending pretty much across.  It is fine, though not thick & heavy, & is such as I see the little ladies wearing.  I think your mother will be pleased with it & the price astounded me.  I cannot yet understand it.  It was $4.00!!!.  If the man had said $15.00 I should have given it.  I had looked at a great many priced from $7 to $12 and was not pleased with any of them.  Passing by a store I saw the shawl & went in.  I know it will please your mother & although not as warm as a cloak or a blanket shawl is warm enough.  

	Willie is now talking to me & I must& go down to the State House as it is just dark.  

	You must write me again.   Tell Fanny I saw a great many cocoa nut cakes today.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Friday & was glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home & I am extremely anxious to return.

	The stage came in today at three oclock.  Col. Fair, Ware, Irby, Sullivan, Willie and myself went immediately to get some letters.  Col. Ware rece[ive]d three from his wifeCol. Fair none, Irby & Sullivan recd letters, but from whom I know not.  I suppose however from their better halves.

	  I have very little to write you since my last.  Yesterday Col. John Preston made a noble & eloquent speech in defence of the Bank, which I have mentioned in my letter to Wells.  General Adams made a good speech on the other side.

	Col. John Preston invited me to dine with him yesterday, but I could not go.  Willie was unwilling to be separated from me.  And the truth is all my linen was in the wash & I had not a clean shirt to wear.  But I have no disposition to attend any parties.  I like Col. Preston very much.

	Last night I was at the lecture on Geology by Professor Brumby in the House of Representatives.  It was a most learned & able & interesting speech.  I saw Col. W.C. Preston there & his health is better.  He seems very cordial towards me & said he was sorry I was not in Washington.

	I saw Col., Hayne & his wife but did not get to speak to them.  I spoke to E Butler.  Mrs. Hayne looks dowdyish in her dress.  In other words she looks like an Alabama lady.  But she has strong features & I thought rather

	After the lecture Genl Adams insisted on our going to the Catholic Fair but I positively declined & said one night was enough for me.  Today Col. Thos Pickens was giving me an amusing account of Tom Butler & Erwin Jones there last night.  I tell it to you in confidence & you must not speak of it.  Butler took $40.00 in raffles, won a gold watch & presented it to Miss Dangol, a beautiful, bold & impudent young lady, the daughter of a shoe maker, to whom he was very attentive & with whom he seemed desperately in love.  Jones was spending his money most freely in raffles & making presents to a Miss Beard who was equally bold & who lives in this place & was officiating as salesman.

	But I have done wrong in mentioning those things even to you.  But only think of Tom Butler head over heels in debt taking $40.00 in raffles & presenting gold watches to the young ladies!  His wife & children at home, perhaps needing some of the comforts of life.

	I have heard of Anne Williams & am afraid the fact of her coming down here at this time in the capacity of milliner will not add anything to her reputation, however pure her motives may be.

	Today has been a bad day & I did not go to church.  Willie has been reading his Testament. & I have been looking into the Bank question.

	You must send Wells letter to him the night you receive it, as he may wish to commence setting it up.

	Lands have risen very much in Greenville judging from Coxs & Dr. T prices.  The Rail Road can take at a fair value any ones land for depot or right of way.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your long letter & Annes & am very much obliged to you both.  It gives me great pleasure to hear from you. Willie & myself left theHouse at half after 3 this evening to go to the Post office.  The mail was not opened when we got there.

	I have not yet spoken on the Bank question but will in a day or two.  The committee of the two Houses meets tonight to nominate a President & directors.  Col. Gist who is on the committee told me that in all probability I would be nominated for President.  Mer. [Ker] Boyce came to me today & said the same.  I have never mentioned the subject to anyone & if I should be nominated my election would be very doubtful.  I have no idea Col. Elmore can be beaten.

	Mr. Choice came down yesterday & brought the three Clevelands.  As I was going down to the State House little Jerry spoke to William.  I did not know him.  He & Willie went about together.  They go to Charleston.

	I am afraid it will be out of my power to bring your bonnet.  Indeed I do not know how I shall get up with the birds.  The roads are dreadful & your bonnet would be exposed to the weather.  Moreover my money is coming to an end.  Your bonnet is very good & if you get a new one you had better get [it] in the summer.  

        Chancellor Dunkin gave me $25.00 forin court the other day.  If you ascertain she wants anything in particular you can purchase for her & I will pay when I return.
       
       I have just been elected one of the Trustees of the College.  General Martin was beaten [by] one vote, & he dislikes it very much.  I got all but four.
	    
	It was determined the other night in caucus to elect those [who] were not in the Legislature to Nashville & Judge Cheves, Robt. Barnwell, Elmore & Gov. Hammond were elected.

	My cases came up yesterday in court.  Four of them were tried.  Today they were trying the Edgefield cases.  

	I am invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow again, & have accepted the invitation.

	The Legislature meets tonight & I must now go to the State House.

	Tell Frank I will bring him something.  Willie is sitting by me & talking all the time.  

	You must excuse this short epistle & expect short ones from this out.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am pressed to death for time to attend to my business in court, in the Legislature, writing out my speech on the Bank &c.  The Legislature meets tonight & I now have to go down there.

	I have just sent Willie to the Post office & he returned with your letter to him.  I was glad to hear from you all. If I could bring your bonnet I would, but this is impossible nor have I seen any very pretty ones.  Nor could I fit you.  It is too late to repent about the birds.  They are pressed too.

	I made a speech yesterday on the Bank & am now writing it out for publication.  It was a good speech & has beencomplimented in the papers & by the Legislature of all parties.  You will see the notice in the Carolinian.  The Telegraph also compliments it though a Bank paper.  Immediately after my speech the vote was taken & the Bill lost by the vote of Smith & Earle against it.  If they had voted for it it would have passed.  Col. Ware is going to vote against it in the Senate & I told him he was misrepresenting his constituents.

	Willie is delighted with your letter & is now sitting by me reading.  He goes with me every night to the House & goes to bed about eleven oclock.  He sits in the gallery & listens to the speeches & tells me at night all that was done & said by the members.  

	How happy I shall be to meet you & the children again.  My name is still spoken of for high honors.

	General Martin sent me a large bundle for you.  I do not know its contents.  Yours, B.F. Perry

I have commenced on a sheet of Willies & have not time to get anything else.

	The Rail Road Bill giving $75,000 to the Greenville company has just passed the House for the road.

	I did not dine with the governor yesterday.  It was late when I got from the House.  

	Elford returns today & will reach home Sunday evening.

	I will write you a long letter next mail.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	The weather is bad & I will write you a long letter instead of going to church.   I am really ashamed of some of my letters to you.  They were written so hurriedly & so badly & so briefly.  But I have been hard pressed for time to eat my meals.

	The other evening after finishing the four lines sent you by last mail I went to the State House immediately, was waited on by General Adams, General Foster, & Col. Gist, who informed me that they had been appointed on a committee to know whether I would permit my name to be used as a candidate for the President of the Bank,  I told them that they could vote for me if they saw proper, but that I would not be a candidate,  The next morning two communications appeared in the daily Papers announcing the fact that my friends intended to run me in opposition to Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore.  This acted like a bombshell had been thrown into the ranks of the Bank men.  My bank friends came to me from all parts of the House & insisted that I would not permit my name to be used.  Col. Williams, Thompson, & others were urgent.  I replied to them that I was no candidate, but I could not permit the anti Bank party from voting for me.  

	Col. Williams said they were going to run me for Governor & he was afraid it would hurt my prospects.  Reed of Anderson, Henry of Spartanburg told me they were going to run me for Speaker next winter.  I have no idea of being elected President of the Bank.  But I do not know if it will hurt me to be voted for.  In fact Col. Gist intended that it would only be the means of the anti Bank party supporting me for something else.   

	I have written out my speech & will probably give it to the Carolinian tomorrow.  I has been a good deal complimented by both bank men & anti bank men.  The question has been lost in both Houses.  Smith & Earle voted for the Bank in the House, & Col. Ware in the Senate.  In the Senate there was a great deal of excitement.  It is thought that a difficulty has taken place between Col. Memminger and Col. Marshall.

	I have just packed up my clothes & sent off my trunk by Col. Irbys wagon as far as Laurens C.H.  The roads are in a horrid condition & I was assured Skylock would not be able to pull Willie, myself, & trunk through the mud.  From Laurens the roads will be better.  I shall leave here Thursday morning & reach home Saturday evening.  

	Tell Anna that her birds are doing well.  I went to see them yesterday in their new cage.  How I shall get them home is doubtful.  The weather is so cold I am afraid they will freeze.  The man from whom I purchased them, has gone back to Charleston & taken with him the others.

	Whilst I was looking & selecting the birds, two very plain & homely looking females came into the shop & made purchases of birds.  On their leaving the shop I was told they were Miss John Preston & old Mrs. Hampton.  I took them for some very common shopkeepers wives.

	I hope to hear from you tonight, & if anything occurs tomorrow I will write you again.  Tell Frank I am going to buy him a Californian hat.  Willie will have to wear it home, & put his cap in the buggy box.  Tell Fanny I shall bring her cocoa cakes.  If it was in my power to bring your bonnet safely I would do so.  I will look for one tomorrow & see whether I can find one very pretty.  If so I may risk its carriage some how.  You know it gives me great pleasure to grattify all of your wishes.  Families bonds have been more devoted than myself, & myhave taken so much pleasure in grattifying the wishes of their better half.  

	I will now conclude.  Willie has been reading his testament & is now talking to me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	
       I have just returned from the State House & left the Legislature in session.  It is now near eleven oclock in the night.  We have just eaten supper & Willie is going to bed.  Tomorrow I shall be so busy as not to be able to write.  I have not yet got through with my cases in court.

	I hope to leave here Thursday morning & reach home Saturday night.  But it is possible that I may be detained here a day longer ibn consequence of the court.  If so I shall dislike it very much.

	The election of President of the Bank takes place tomorrow.  I have no hope of being elected but will get a great many votes.  They are given to me by the anti Bank men as a compliment & as such I shall appreciate them.

	Dr. Metts of Union who has been electioneering for me told me that Elias Earle said he never wanted to defeat anyone as bad in his life.  He is a most pitiable fool & seldom votes on any question without consulting Col. Irby, & never votes differently from him.

	He &  Powell are enough to disgrace Greenville as her representatives.  He wrote Ben Yancey a letter wishing to be friends and promised never more to interfere with his brother.  Yancey showed me the correspondence.          

	There is likely to be a difficulty between Col. Manning & Col. Marshall.  It was said this morning a challenge had passed.  This originated out of the Bank question.  

	Col. Ware & Smith are both going for the Bank.  The Bank is lending money to the members of the Legislature.  Reed got $900 last winter.  In this way the Bank is buying up the members.  I think Elias Earle got money last fall.

	I have just purchased for you the prettiest bonnet you ever saw.  White is all the fashionnothing else worn by the Bell[e]s here.  And I think you prettier than any of them, & therefore to wear what the young ladies wear.  It is a beautiful bonnet with flowers.  I thought it would look so sweetly on you and the idea crossed my mind how sweet a kiss would be from your rosy lips encircled by the bonnet.  But I must now make you vain.  With your new shawl & bonnet on, I have you now in my minds eyes and how I should like to clasp in my own, the figure thus presented to my mind.

	The price of the bonnet was $6.00.  How I shall carry it up is doubtful.  Tell Frank I have bought him a Californian hat $1/12 cts.  I have also bought him a pretty little bow to shoot withalso one for Willie 25 cts each.  Tell Anna her birds are doing well & singing sweetly.  Tell Fanny I have bought her two pounds of cocoa nut cakesalso one pound of all sorts of candy and one pound of molasses candy to give the servants &c.  I have bought a Prayer Book $2.00new razors & strap 4.50.

	I shall buy a little hat for Vardry perhaps.  I enquired for a chair such as Susan wished and the man had none.

	My money is about gone.  I have recd only $6.00 from Col. Grisham since I have been here.  Dr. George I have not seen.  I have spent the money given me by Chancellor Dunkin.  But hope that my pay Bill will pay my tavern billhave some left.

	I hope tomorrow evening to hear from you again & I may then write if I have time.

	Col. Tom Butler spoke suspiciously of Anne Williams.  He had been to see herso had Jones.  Poor woman I am afraid she is lost or will be before she leaves here.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry   
	
P.S. I thought I had covers for my letter, but sent them all off in my trunk.  I must therefore take another sheet of paper & will continue my letter.

	Butler informed me that Lewis Thurston & Hetty Doyley were to be married this weekthat Lewis was greatly rejoiced at Moores marriage.  I saw Moore here the other day & he looked sad & seemed sad.  Butler says he has no principlethat he & Mrs. Thurston were engaged to be married.  She was expecting him the night the night the news came of his wedding.

	Tom Butler also informed me that  Butler the brother of Mrs. McBee had been off with Miss Gillison worth $50,000 & got married.

	My speech will be published next week.  I gave it to the printer today.  John Cunningham has written out his also.

	I must now go to bed & will add another post script tomorrow.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

P.S. Wednesday 3 oclock.  I have just returned from the Court House & have disposed of all my casestwo of them I had to continue.  So I shall start home in the morning.  Col Townes goes up in the stage & will beat me one day.

	I recd fifty nine votes for President of the Bank & Elmore 100.  This is about as I supposed the result would be.  It is a compliment & I regard it as such.  This is the voluntary offering of the members.

	I am delighted to return home again & see you & the children once more & forget in my domestic happiness all the excitement of politics.  

	Willie has been all day in the State House by himself.  He is now with me eating apples & we are going to look at the birds.  

	The weather is now good but looks like a change.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning before the Stage leaves.  This I do because you requested it, not because I have anything worth writing about.

	Butler Thompson came down in the stage yesterday and told me he saw you and the children at church on Sunday.  That Frank was misbehaving, & your were giving him looks & trying to regulate him.  He also said he saw you riding in the carriage on Monday as Ihim.  This I presume is a mistake, as Reuben was ploughingunless you were riding in your mothers carriage.

	Dr. Watts informs me that Mrs. Cunningham & Miss Pamela are well in Philadelphia & will remain there till May next.  Pamelas health is greatly improved, but Mrs. Cunningham is in bad health.
He also informs me that Mr. Cunningham had gone to Augusta to try to settle a difficulty between Yancey and Moroni [Moragne] editor of the Edgefield Paper.  They were to have fought last week.

	General Thompson is expected here this morning in the stage & I suppose Butler came down to meet him.  

	It is doubtful when I return home.  I do not think that we shall reach Dr. Andersons cases in time to try them this court.  There will be an extra court here the week of the Greenville court.  None of my cases have yet been reached.

	There is an extraordinary murder case to be tried this morning.  A Brother for the murder of a brother.  It is said the killing was in self defence.  They were quarrelling & the father was the only person present & now the principal witness.

	I hope you are getting on well with your household.  I wish you would write me by Thursdays mail.  

	I saw here Mr. Fulk the father of one of those young ladies at Dr. Simmons.  He was very particular in his enquiries about the school.  Butler Thompson said to me that the same enquiries were of him& he could not in his conscience say much in favour of the school.  He thinks Dr. Simons the greatest bore & fool in the village, & that the girls will learn nothing & that it is most astonishing how he has succeeded in humbugging the community.

	My old friends here are glad to see me & some of them persuading me to offer again for congress.  

	Tell Fanny I have made no money for her yet.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I ought not to write you again.  Yesterday morning I went with Butler Thompson to the Post office after the mail had arrived & was greatly disappointed in not receiving a letter from you.  I hope however you are all well.

	It is probable I may be at home tomorrow night.  Dr. Andersons cases have been postponed, till the extra court, which will sit the week after Greenville court.  The case of Dillard will be tried today & if so I shall leave tomorrow.

	I was employed by Sullivan to assist him in a new case of Dr. Andersons on Wednesday.  I have also had some goods luck in receiving money.  Mr. Kennedy paid me Fifty dollars.  Dr. Teague about fifty & his Brother fifty more.  Col. Irby has not said anything about his note & I am glad of this.

	There is a great deal of business in court, more than can be finished in another week.  The case of Dillon is good for a good fee, though I am afraid it will be good for nothing else so far as my client is concerned.  Miss Mory appears in bad health since her misfortune, but it is said is to be, as soon as her case is determined.  If she worried before it would abate & she has sacrificed her sister to maintain her action.

	I am very anxious to be at home again, & see you & the children & the improvements going on in the way of stables &c.

	Next Tuesday week or Monday there is to be at Greenville the most costly & magnificent circus that has ever been in the upper part of South Carolina.  Tell Willie the ponies are beautiful, & there is a whole circus full of them, & they play al sorts of tricks.  I am sorry shall not be at home top see the children enjoying the sight.  I shall be at Anderson court.

	I was invited to Major Wrights the other evening but did not go.  The Judge has been talking about hospitality &c.  We must invite him either to dinner or to tea during court.

	Kiss the children for me.  I am indeed happy that I am not in Washington & now I would not be induced to enter Congress, as I have said to my friends here this week, who have pressed me to offer again.  There is no place like home & we value it more when absent from those we love.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Anderson C,H,

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Tugaloo & will write you a few lines this evening as you requested.  The court has just adjourned & very little business done or to be done.  Judge Withers has gone to his room to sleep, the lawyers here are all gone home & I am left alone in my glory.  A young lady came into the sitting room to practice on the Piano & I have retired to write you.  By the y a Miss Smith enquired of me about you as an acquaintance.  She is going to school here & I believe from old Pendleton.  There is a house full of girls here, & most of them look like ought to be courted & married instead of going to school.  At least they are large enough to think of a beaux.  Judge Withers has been amusing himself & them by all sorts of sexist talk.

	I had a pleasant day to come here, but the weather has been very bad ever since. I found here Walker, Campbell & Long from Greenville.  They have all returned & a gentleman came to me in court this morning to carry some books to Greenville.  I told him Long was going over & would carry them.  He replied, yes, Mr. Craytons brother in law, I know him. I made no reply & thought it might someday be true.  

	My face is still swollen & not entirely, but I have slept gloriously for two nights past, going to bed at eight oclock, & waking at seven.  

	The papers bring us no news this morning that Mr. Calhouns health is better.  Very great interest is manifested here in his recovery.  They had a political meeting on Tuesday & appointed four delegates to meet at Greenville during court & elect delegates to the Nashville convention.  Col. Tom [Thomas Jones] Pickens is an anti Bank candidate for the Senate in opposition to Dr. [Alexander] Evins.

	Mr. Harrison tells me the Cotton was sent off last Monday, & you will probably receive a check for the amount before I return home.  I am sorry to see the last foreign news is unfavourable for cotton.    The corn will sell well.  Mr. Simpson spoke of going up to the sale, & invited me to go home with him.  

	As I passed by my farm last Tuesday morning, someone had thrown down the fence & pulled down the Barn to the ground.  Tell Reuben he must [page torn] to the fence or the stacks will get [page torn] & destroy the wheat.  Let Charles fill up the stable.  Jim might with the old plank of the fence build a new pig pen like the old one and some corn sheds against the fence.  

	You must attend to your garden & plant your seeds.  Major Seaborns agricultural paper comes out this week with my article on the profits of the farm.

	Write me a long letter to Pickens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter and the papers by Mr. Elford & for which I thank you kindly.  I was very anxious to hear from home.  It seems to me that I have been a long tome from home.  The weather has been bad, business dull, accommodations horrible, & labour considerable.

	The property sold well at the sale & amounted to $639.00!  The cotton will certainly bring $900.00.  This will make the crop raised by ten hands worth $1500.  I have collected a great deal of money for the Estate, but none for myself.  I may, however, receive some yet.

	My horse became quite lame again, & I have swapped her to Wellborn Perry for a blooded horse, which drives finely in a Buggy.  I gave him ten dollars to boot, & I am very much pleased with my trade.    He is a fine horse & well disposed.

	I passed by Mrs. Duboses & she was at church.  I did not see her, nor Lees family.  I did not go by my Brothers, but I saw him and most of his sons at the sale.  They are all well. 

	I will send your letters & packages.  I heard a scandalous report on Mrs. Dudaes oldest son & Miss Lee, which has excited a good deal of neighborhood talk, and which may be all scandal & noting more.

	The Judge is working very hard to get off from Pickens, & it is likely I may reach home Wednesday night.  The court sat tonight till after nine oclock.

	The convention excites a good deal of talk, & my name is spoken of amongst those from whom a selection is to be made.

	It is now late in the night and I must bid you good night.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter yesterday in court, whilst in the midst of Dr. Andersons case, and I was truly glad to hear you were all well.

	I have no paper & must therefore beg you to excuse me for not answering your letter more fully.  I have no time to write.  We commenced Dr. Andersons case Monday & are not half through it yet.  The result is very doubtful.  The Judge is as ill-natured as ever & behaves rudely to every one.  My only comfort is that he worrys himself more than anyone else.

	The governor is as vain say very cunning in selecting Col. Elmore, but he will not be successful in his cunning.  Col. Elmore will continue in the Senate.

	I am sorry Edward misbehaved when asked about the flowers. Col. Irby would give me $800 for Jim but it is not enough.  Negroes will increase in value before next fall if cotton keeps up.

	I hope Reuben & Jim are going on well with their respective work.

	I may be at home Saturday.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

P.S. Dont forget to look for the Bonnett for Harriott Perry as I know she will be expecting it.

Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have hardly time to write you a line.  Last night I sat up till twelve oclock writing.  We are in the midst of three or four slander cases & full of business & possible business.

	I recd your letter by Mr. Elford & was pleased to have so good a report from home.  In regard to our Paper I have to inform you that it is doing well.  Mr. Elford will return with some forty or fifty new subscribers & a good many of them have paid.  All seemed pleased with the Southern Patriot.  Mrs. Dubac was delighted.  I did not see her.  But I stopped at my mothers.  They were all well.

	Mr. Sharp informs me that his wife is pretty well & expects Miss Ramsay up in two or three weeks.  She will return again to Charleston after a short visit.

	I have written a long Editorial for next week giving an account of my tour to Tugaloo &c.  It is altogether uncertain how long I will be detained here, perhaps all the week & perhaps not longer than Wednesday.  Everything sold well at the Farm.  But I had a bad time last Sunday in coming to this place.

	I am truly glad to hear that the draft has arrived from Alabama.  It will come in good time.

	I think Mr. Elford is in better sprits than when I posted with him.  But I doubt whether you have hope so strongly developed as to supply & sustain the drooping spirits of anyone else.

	At Pendleton I met a young kinsman Robert Harris just from California with his pockets full of gold.  He gave me an interesting account of that country, & will be at Greenville next week.

	The mud is knee deep all over Pickens valley.  The Hill has been cut down.  And they talk of dividing the district & moving the Court House.

	I hope the children are all well & going to school.   Fosters wife & Harriett enquired affectionately after you & the children.  The first seemed surprised that my family had not increased since you were there.

	My reply to Col. Hayne has pleased a goods many persons about here.  I am glad your mother is pleased with it.

	In haste your affectionate husband. Remembrance to the children, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening & found the roads worse than I ever saw them.  It is well that you did not come with me in the buggy as we once spoke of doing.  Had you started with me, we should have been fastened in some mud hole.  It is enough to kill horses & break carriages all to pieces to pass over such roads.  Thirty miles above Columbia we had to turn off the road & than a neighborhood path.

	Mr. Elford & myself traveled down alone except a short time in company with Henderson of Laurens.  We had a very pleasant trip & I found Elford a fine travelling companion.  Believe there is nothing that attaches gentlemen to each other more than travelling together.  We stopped on the roadside & ate our dinners in the woods & had provisions enough to last all the way.

Letter 155
Saturday night we stopped at Faulks.  He complained bitterly of his daughters extravagance at Greenville.  He said she had spent thirty five dollars in two months.  We told him that was very moderate indeed.  That young ladies spent there that much at school in dressing.  He opened his his Dutch eyes in amazement, & said that Robert hadto him it was not at all , that he would be very far from encouraging a young lady in any extravagance.  

       Tell Willie I am sitting in the same room we had last winter, and the first thought which I had on entering the room was about him.  I looked at the bed & thought of his being in it.  I looked at the window where he used to stand & look at the poor turkies cooped up for slaughter, and thought of him.  I wish he was with me again.  It is pleasant to have some member of the family with me to talk to & love, either wife or child.

	You may say to Willie that the turkey pen has been connected with a handsome little garden with a summer house in it & the walls most fantastically laid off & looking as if they werewith marble.  A great metamorphis indeed for a turkey pen.

       As soon as I went into the barroom on arriving at the Hotel a tall fellow, rather good looking, who was standing there as keeper enquired of me how Mr. McBees family were.  Said his name was Alexander & that & that Mrs. McBee was his cousin.  He looked a good deal like Vardry McBee of.
	
	Tell Wilie that our friend Jim enquired after him very kindly.  I am now writing to you before breakfast, & have seen very few persons & can tell you very little news.  May not have time to write you again this morning.  I hope you will give me a diary on Wednesday of yourself & household since I left home.  Col.  Herndon, Col. Thompson, A.W. Hanger, Mr. Dean, Sullivan, Reed, Henderson are here.  Mr. Bobo was thrown from his horse on his way here & very seriously injured, so much so that Col. Herndon told me he did not think he would live.  His injury was internal.  He was throwing up blood.  It will be a great loss to Spartanburgh for Bobo & Henry both to be taken off.  They were for many years partners in law.

	The weather is delightfully cool & pleasant.  I hope you have had rain in Greenville.  Let me hear how the farm comes on, the children, the Servants, the horses, house & your plastering, & whitewashing and though last, far, very far from home, being least in my love and memory, how comes on your ladyship.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am truly sorry I was disappointed in writing to you by the last mail.
	The Judges & lawyers were all invited to ride on the Greenville Rail Road, & supposed we should return in time to get your letter & answer it.  But we scarcely got back in time to go to the meeting of the Board of Trustees.  And the Board of Trustees sat until twelve oclock last night regulating the affairs of the college.

	I am now writing you before breakfast in order to send my letter by Mr. Elford who says he will reach home Saturday night.  I will write you again by the mail if I have time.

	My cases are all disposed of in the Court of Appeals except Dr. Anderson & the Gilreaths.  We have been three days trying Gilreaths case.  Yesterday we heard of the death of Judge Richardson & the court adjourned whilst I was speaking.  This morning we have to conclude the argument & consequently have very little time to write you.  

	The Bar also have a meeting this morning on the subject of Judge Richardsons death & I may have to say a few words in praise of the deceased.

	I have not had time yet to purchase my clothes & shall not purchase many.  I see no fine clothing to suit me.  I have heard nothing of the Bonnet yet.  I saw yesterday a consignment at the Rail Road to B. Perry.  But the agent said it was for Perry & Matthews merchants of Edgefield.  I am assured it was the bonnet.  The package had been sent off before I went to the depot.

	I recd your long letter last night after my return from the college & read it after twelve oclock.  I was glad to hear you were all well & getting on well.  I am truly sorry to hear of the awful accident on Mr. Arthurs Rail Road contract.  Mr. Croft is very cunning & penurious & would resort to any scheme to cheat anyone & I hope Maj. Blake [will] not accept his proposal.

	I saw Dr. Thomas here yesterday.  He has not heard of Mrs. Thomas[] fall & injury,  He said he would average one dollar per day notwithstanding the rains on the rail riad.

	I had a long political talk with Mr. Robert Barnwell yesterday on the rail road.  He is a most agreeable & pleasant gentleman.  The ride was a pleasant one.  We [were] caught in a very hard rain, rode sixteen miles, the road is finished twenty miles.

	I have not had time to look at carriages yet.  After today I shall be at leisure till Saturday, when Dr. Andersons case is taken up before Chancellor Dargan.  Chancellor Dargan & Dunkin enquired after you.  So did Judge Withers & Frost.  In my agreement I have been paying Judge Withers for hissarcasm in Gilreaths case.  

	When I shall return is doubtful.  I shall not go to Charleston.  Tell Frank I am glad to hear he is still head.   Give my love to the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry.

My dear Liz

	I am invited to dine with Col. W.C. Preston today at 4 oclock & unless I write you now I shall; not be able to do so by this mail.  I always like to wait till the mail comes in before I write so that I may answer your letter.  In this way I was disappointed in writing to you by the last mail.

	Yesterday evening  at five oclock, a committee of the Board of Trustees consisting of DeSaussure, Petigru, Adams, Witherspoon & myself met at Mr. DeSaussures & spent a very pleasant evening in drinking wine, cracking nuts, eating fruits and conversing.  Today the same committee dine with the President of the College.

	This morning at nine oclock, the Bad had a meeting on the death of Judge Richardson & Chancellor Caldwell.  Mr. Pettigru was called to the chair.  Col. Dunkins offered the resolutions about Judge Richardson, & I made a speech which you will see in the Columbia papers.  Col. McCord & DeSaussure prepared speeches & Resolutions for Chancellor Caldwell.  Mr. Petigru presented both sets of Resolutions to the court of Errors & Judge Evans & Chancellor Johnstone replied.

	I shall lose my Will case for Gilreath.  Mr. Petigru heard a portion of my argument & said he thought I had made an impression on the court.  But the Judges refused to hear argument on the other side.  They are all prejudiced against breaking Miles. 

	I shall tomorrow argue Dr. Andersons case before Chancellor Dargan, hear opinions on Monday & probably start home Tuesday morning.  

	I saw General Martin yesterday.  He brought up with him the bonnet but has not yet sent it to me.  He said they were all well in town.

	I have bought asack coat at $7.00, pantaloons $5.00, vest 75 cts, straw hat $2.00, boots $7.00, six pair of socks $1.50, gloves $1.00two silk handkerchiefs $2.25, two shirts $4.25.  This is very moderate in the way of clothes.  But I think is a good supply till fall, where I will purchase a suit of cloth.  

	I have bought some books as usual.  This you know is my weak point.  I have firmness to withstand all other temptationsall but the temptation of books.  But my purchases do not amount to any great deal.  I thought I would save in the way of clothes enough.   To purchase the books--first & Louis 14th, The Queens of Spain, Women in France, The House of Orleans, Georgian Era, Cosmos, UtopiaThe Mexican War by a company of Mexican officers.  I have not been able to purchase the apple for Anne.  Some of my books will be for Anna & Willie. 

	In regard to the election of Judges I have very little information.  It is altogether doubtful who will be candidates.  A great many lawyers have spoken of, but all are uncertain.  
  
	In regard to the college everything is going on very well.  I will write you a longer letter on Sunday & Monday.

	I must now conclude by requesting you to remember me to the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter this evening & was very glad to hear from you & that you were getting through with your house cleaning.  You think I ought to be very kind to you on my return from the labour you have bestowed on the house in my absence.  I am always kind & ever affectionate.  You misconstrue my words & actions when you think otherwise.  And as to giving you money you know that is always done when I have it to give. 

	I shall start home Tuesday morning & reach you Thursday evening, & I assure you I shall be most happy to be with you & the children once more.  I see someone has spoken of me for Chancellor in the Charleston Mercury.  Col. Herndon wishes me to run for law Judge.  But I am not inclined to run for either.  I agree with Mr. Barnwell that it is a wretched life spent in taverns & from home. 

	I spent a very pleasant evening at Col. Prestons.  There was a large dinner party & several young ladies.  I had the pleasure of carrying one to the table & sitting by her all the evening without finding out who she was.  After dinner Mrs. Preston introduced me to another one whose name I did not understand.  We walked in the garden & she enquired about you & your mother & said you had paid her a visit when Miss McCall.  I think she said you staid with her.  Mrs. Preston seemed very kind & enquired why I did not bring you with me.  She is coming to Greenville this summer. 

	I have bought you a pretty presenta trunk for bonnet & handkerchiefs two dollars & twenty five cents.  I have bought some candy for the childrena few oranges & have closed my purchases.

	Yesterday I looked at carriagessome very fine onesone like Mr. Coxs	 for $400but I think a finer finished one $650 a magnificent affairothers at various prices.  The carriage maker said he would swap carriages with me.

	I saw Markleys son yesterday.  He seems a clever boy & was glad to meet me.  Tell John I saw his son [who] enquired after him.  He seems a good fellow.

	I had an amusing conversation with Col. Goodwyn today about Col McCord & his wife.  She is a tyrant over her husband & pays him handsomely for his mistreatment of his former wife.  She will not let any of his children come to see him & has made the Col.  Settle all of his property on her & her children.

	I was not able to attend the speaking in college & today I felt disinclined to go to church.  I shall hear the opinions in my cases tomorrow.  But the most of them will be against me.

	Tell the children I wish to see them all very much.

My dear Liz

	We arrived here this morning to breakfast.  There was a great crowd last night Fulks last night.  Judge ONeall, Col. Brockman, Col. Ware & many others were there.  I had a long political talk with Col. Brockman this morning, and he is all right in politics.

	I am sorry to inform you that Mr. [John Izard] Middleton has been beaten for Speaker by Simmons [James Simons] of Charleston.  The Bank men all voted against him, in order to have a Bank Speaker, so that they might control the appointment of all the committees.  To my great surprise Col. Jones voted with the Bank menno doubt to curry favor with the majority.  It ought to be known in Greenville that a man who was elected as anti Bank man, came down to Columbia & the first vote he gives is for a Bank Speaker to give the Bank the entire control of all the committees & a powerful bearing in strengthening the Bank.

	Willie & Frank behaved quite well.  They are both now sitting at my table reading books purchased for them by Mr. Duncan.  They both behaved well coming down.  They went with me to the State House & remained in the gallery till near four oclock.  General martin saw them, & said his whole family was here.  They are greatly admired by all who notice them.  Col. Herndon remarked that I was increasing my company.  He said he should soon have one large enough to bring.  Col Dawkins came down on the cars this morning with us & says Mrs. Dawkins will be here tomorrow.  

	We had a pleasant trip down, & enjoyed your good dinner very much. On the roadside.  Col. Hampton came to my seat in the House of Representatives this morning & had with me a long political talk.  He thinks with me & I find the whole state is turning that way.  My old friends here have met me very cordially.  This morning I stepped into a hot store to purchase ho & the owner subscribed for The Southern Patriot.  Burt makes a great many apologies for not publishing my piece, & says he ordered it to be done.  He proposed taking Willie & Frank to see the town.  Judge ONeall is with me in politics.

	It is said Judge Cheves is to be made Governor.  But I do not believe he will accept.  Col. Hampton told me that Col. Pickens had declined.  Hampton is spoken of for Governor.  But he told me that he would disgrace himself if elected.  He said Col. Hammond was a corrupt & bad man & ought not to be elected to the Senate & that he had letters in his possession that ought to damn him in public estimation.

	Petigru says that Memminger thinks the chancery will come to him by his course on the Southern question.  I am unable to say who will be judge & chancellor.  The elections will occupy the greater part of the Session.

	I have not yet made any purchase of clothing except a pair of boots & hat nor have I been able to  your mothers present for Fanny & little Susan.  But I will do so in due time.

	Since I have been writing I have received a long letter from General Thompson in Washington.  But strange to say he does not mention his marriage.  It was however advertised in one of the Charleston papers.  He writes encouragingly about our paper & I have just recd a letter from someone who neglected to sign his name but I think it is from Dr. F. Croft.  He says my Paper is favorably spoken of in Charleston & if I were to send an agent there would get a great many subscribers.  He directs me to send my paper to him in Aiken.  Henry L. Pinckney has written me a long letter about his office.  Dr. Gantt has also written me a letter electioneering for a half dozen candidates.

	I have not yet seen Mr. McBee.  Remember me kindly to your mother, Susan & Anne & in this message Willie & Frank have just requested to unite with me.  They also join with me in love to you, Anna & Fanny.  I hope you are getting on well with you household. & shall anxiously expect to hear from you by the next mail.  I wish very much you & the little girls were with me.  Frank is not altogether so pleasant a companion as Willie.  I really think Will is the most remarkable Boy for intelligence & observation that I ever saw.  

	I have written you a miserable scrawl & will try & do better the next time.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Willie brought me your letter from the Bar room last night about eight oclock & said he is a letter from mother.  Frank immediately professed that I should read it aloud, so that he & Will might hear what you had written.  I did so & they listened with great interest.  They were both reading books which Mr. Duncan had purchased for them.  Frank does not make such rapid progress in his, as Willie has done.  I had to purchase another for Will, & told Frank I would do the same for him, when he had read his through.

	I am not writing to you by candle light in my night gown & cap & day is breaking.  Willie & Frank are still asleep.  I make my own fire every morning.  Jim furnishes wood over night.  There is no trouble in kindling a fire with lightwood.

	Yesterday I saw Col. OHanlon & he gave me an invitation to visit him in the country & says he will send for me & a few others some day during the Session.  He is as warm & as firm as ever.  I met Col. Hayne in the streets yesterday.  He seemed very kind & sociable & enquired after you & your mother, Susan 7 Anne.  Mr. [W.B.] Carli[s]le the editor of the Columbia Telegraph came to me yesterday & invited me to an entertainment to be given by the Press of Columbia to all the persons in any way connected with the Press in South Carolina.  Whilst sitting in Col. Fairs room after my return from the State House, Col. Manning came in & invited us to take a glass of brandy in his room.  There were a good many persons, & Major Cant[e]y remarked that I grew younger someone replied that I brought my sons down with me to let the people know that I was a married man.  Dr. Goodwin replied that they were worth showing.

	I must, however, tell you that I had just sizzed myself off, in the way of clothes at ashop & was dressed very genteellyso much so that Burt enquired where I had got those fine clothes.  In purchasing them, Frank enquired if I had money enough to pay for them all &of his own accord offered his quarter of a dollar to help pay if I was short of funds.  The little fellow pulled it out in the store & made the tender.  My clothes have cost me $58.00.  Frank cost oversack coat, pants, hat, boots & cravat.

	Col. [Christopher William] Dudley, senator from the Peedee country, came to my seat in the House of Representatives yesterday and said he wanted to put me in nomination for Chancellor that he differed with me in politics, but nevertheless preferred me to Wardlaw or DeSaussure.   Memminger is not a candidate.  I told him it was out of the question to suppose the legislature would elect me.  He thought differently, & said that although they differed with me in politics, they had great respect for me &c &c.  He left me & said he intended to feel about & see what the prospect was.

	The Governors Message was read yesterday.  It goes for secession.  As soon as it was read Col Memminger & said we were about commencing a revolution & a change of our Government & it was proper to appeal to God for assistance.  He proposed [a] day of fasting &c.  Col. Jno. Preston & J[acob] P[inckney] Reed made more speeches in favor of the resolution.  It occurred to me that South Carolina would need assistance from Heaven in a contest with the Federal government and I thought it was well enough for some of them to have prayers said for them.  Judge Cheves was present & looks very well.  The Georgia elections are all going in favor of the union & this fact is not relished at all in South Carolina.
	I do not know that I mentioned to you in my last letter that Mr. Fulk indulged in a great deal of abuse of Dr. Simmons & said he had behaved badly, & that no one would send to him again.  I am glad Pickerel is so correct in his notions.  Cox is a union man, but is disposed to be prudent.    So are thousands in our state.  Judge Cheves speech is the most extravagant disunion argument I ever read.  The Legislature has ordered thousands of copies to be printed for distribution.  I met him today.  He did not recognize me at first.  When I mentioned my name, he said I had grown much stouter.  I said I had not had the pleasure of seeing him for several years.  He replied that it has been twelve years.  I saw you the last time, at Greenville, on my way to the Virginia Springs.    He then enquired after you & said you were the relation of his dear friend General Hayne who would any day have died for him.

	Col. Dudley had written a long communication announcing my name for the Chancery Bench.  He showed it to me this morning & I objected to its publication.  I know full well that I could not be elected, & did not wish to have the public attention directed to me sinceassociated with depot.

	The Board of Trustees met last night & elected Col. Preston President of the College.  He looks pretty well & he is much improved in health.  I voted for [Fitzhugh] McMaster as Librarian & not Rivers.  McMaster was elected.  Rivers got only 3 votes.  Judge Butler is  He asked my motive for bringing the boys.  I said I brought Willie for my companion & Frank for Willies.  He said it was a great improvement to them and mentioned a son of General McQueens who was a companion for his father always having travelled with him.  I saw Mr. Petigru last night.  I bought the spoons for $5.00very nice ones.

	The Georgia elections have cast a damper on the Legislature.  I told Col. OHanlon how you had rece[ive]d his letter.  Wenext Landry with him.    My love to all.  Tell your mother Mr. Ford enquired after her & claims kin.  He is a candidate for assessor.   B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter the night Mr. Rhett delivered his oration on Mr. Calhoun informing me that Mr. McLure of Chester had sent a list of subscribers to The Patriot.  This gratified me very much & I mentioned it to Mr. Petigru who is here.  McLure is an old union man.  Col. Grisham is here & said he had quit politics, but as soon as he saw my Prospectus he determined to take two copies.

	Dr. Lieber sent for me last evening to take tea with him.  He is a strong union man & so is Professor Williams.  They both will take The Patriot.  I had a most interesting conversation with Dr. Lieber & his Lady for three hours on politics.  When I left them the Dr said it was a treat to meet one like myself & unburden his heart to him.  He said he should call at my room frequently during the Session.  But that he disliked to walk the streets of Columbia so cold were the citizens to him.  He enquired how I got on in the Legislature.  I told him I found none of that coldness towards myself. That I was cordial towards all & they seemed, at least, to reciprocate my cordiality.

	Yesterday I introduced my resolutions on the subject of a Southern Congress, & the editors of the Carolinian & Telegraph come to me immediately for copies so you will see them in the papers.  I have no doubt, as I told Dudley, that the State will yet have to adopt my course after all the above heaped on me.  Some firery Resolutions have been offered for secession &c. [William Aiken] Owens of Barnwell wishes a convention.  Middleton wishes to postpone the election of Senator  B. Perry to keep the members of Congress from going on to Washington.

	There was quite an excitement yesterday, in the House, in consequence of hearing that some United States troops had been landed in Charleston.  Speech after speech was made full of patriotism & war.

	Rhetts oration was a good one.  He paid handsome compliments in it, to Lowndes, Cheves, Hayne, Legare, Jackson &c.  The cry of fire was raised toward the latter part of it, & I left with Willie.  There was a great crowd, & several packets pickedone pick packet was apprehended in Charleston as soon as he arrived.  Col. Maybin told me he now had one in his house & had his eyes on him.  He is from Baltimore.

	Mr. Petigru came to see me & left his card.  Yesterday morning he sat with me an hour in the House & we had a great deal of talk.  I told him you had kept his letter to show your acquaintances in the hope of doing good.  

	I am glad that you have seen Mr. Arthur & that he is no politician.  I hope you [are] informed well as to passing events.  I am sorry however that you think so badly of your church & its members.  The addition of Mrs. Choice surprised me.  I hope she will be more Christian & less vindictive.    But my dear wife I do not think that the professors of Christianity are a whit better than other people in charity, kindness, liberality all the social virtues.

	Willie & Frank are doing well.  Dr. Croft came here last night & expressed great surprise at seeing them.  Luther McBee came here the other day & is quite well.  Alexander has not yet reached here.  Mr. Kilgore is here.    So is Mr. Campbell.  Col. Irby has paid Elias Earle who came yesterday.  I have heard nothing from Dr. Anderson.  

	Since writing the above I have seen Col. Townes & recd your letter of Saturday morning.  I was truly glad to hear from you & that your family were all well notthe increase.  Townes told me you sent him my letter to read.  You must be careful about showing my letters as they are written for your eye alone.  I never saw such a gathering & coming in of wives as I saw this evening.  Monday is commencement & the Greenville Rail Road brought them down by dozens from Newberry & Fairfield.  I felt rather envious as I saw them approach their husbands.

	I have just been to a supper of the Press.  Judge Porter, Mr. Woodward Crowly of Virginia & many others were presentalso Col. Townes, Campbell, Reed &c.  I have left them & their war speeches to conclude my letter to you.  In the morning I go to spend the day with OHanlon & will carry the boys with me.  I have to start at 6 oclock.

	It is now twelve oclock in the night.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I went down to Col. OHanlons with Mr. Duncan & carried with us Willie & Frank on Sunday last.  
We had a pleasant excursion in spite of the rain.  The Col. Sent his carriage, two or three horses, four or five mules & negroes to meet us at the Rail Road depot & escort us to his house about four miles distant.  The carriage broke down & we all mounted horses & mules & road on.  Willie & Frank were delighted.  We met a most hearty & cordial welcome, a good breakfast, a fine dinner, plenty of wine & brandy & whiskey punch.  The Col. showed us letters from Gen. Jackson &c & we talked on the days of nullification.  	

       Today I went to the college commencement with Willie & Frank who sat on the platform whilst the boys were speaking.  I sat by Rob[ert] Barnwell our Senator in Congress, & he told me he had news on my political pieces.  He is opposed to separate state action, but is a disunionist & seemed to regret I was not one also.  The speeches of young Barnwell son of the Preacher, & Richardson grandson of Judge Richardson were very finesome of the rest not very good.  Rions, I thought a poor one, although he took first honor.  There was quite a display of Ladies although the day was so bad.  They do not seem to care for the weather, so they can see & be seen.  Col. Preston made a war speech to the graduates.
       
       There is no doubt a fixed & settled purpose to dissolve the union as soon as practicable.  This is agreed upon by all the politicians.    But some of them are afraid of being whipped into submission.  Col. Preston is sailing with the current & Dr. Lieber says is [the] very way tohis present position.
       
       Dr, Lieber came to my room this evening & we spent an hour in delightful conversation.  He said he should call again.  Professor Williams met me today in the college, & said he had heard of my visit to Dr. Lieber, and that he should call on me as it was pleasant to meet with sympathy.  I never saw a man or woman more encouraged than Dr. Lieber and his Lady were by my conversation.  He said again tonight I do not know how it is these men are all so civil to you.  I told him I made them so.  I was civil to them & cordial in my manners.  
       
       Mr. William Easl[e]y has offered to take Frank back to Greenville in his Buggy.  I may send him.  But Willie is not disposed to part with him.  Col. OHanlon wished very much to keep them both for several days.  Mr. McBee is going up with Easl[e]y.  Willie & Frank have been twice to Alex Taylors & taken dinner with them.
       
       Tomorrow the election for Judge comes on.  I think Wardlaw & Whitner will be elected.  Burt will be elected Secretary of State.  Young will be elected Solicitor.  Reed opposes him.  Jones cannot get a start, & I believe he has found it out, most effectually.  I am sure he would not get the votes.  Duncan has found out that he will not do, to depend on, in a political struggle, & so said to me.
       
       The great debate commences tomorrow on the Southern question.  It will continue for a week or ten days.  My impression is that a convention will be called & what then I know not.  They are beginning to despair of Georgia & a Southern congress doing anything.  The Augusta Chronicle Sentinel is now sent to me in Columbia.  The State of Georgia has gone for the Union by thirty thousand votes.
       
       The weather is now very warm & wet.  When it clears off it will probably turn coldif so have the hogs killed.

       General Whitner beat Col. Dawkins twenty votes & is Judge.  Wardlaw beat DeSaussure & Haynsworth a great ways & is Chancellor.  Burt is ahead for Secretary of State.
       
       Middleton made a disunion speech today & so did Keith of Orangeburg.
       
       Col. Hampton invited me to dine with him tomorrow at five oclock.
       
       I see a great many persons here from the upper country.  Choice, Rowland, Jno. Jones, the three Townes, Col. McNeely.
       
       Tell Susan Hoke I have sent to Charleston for her music.
       
       I hope to hear from you tonight.  I wish you were here.  I would very willingly exchange Willie & Frank for you.  The next session this must be the case.  There are a great many wives here with their husbands.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Frank is not inclined to go with Mr. Easl[e]y & therefore I shall not send him.  He is however very much in my way but a great favorite with all the members.  Col. Dudl[e]y told me tonight that it was the expression of all that Frank was a remarkable boy in looks & appearance.  I replied he was very different from Will & explained to the Col. the difference.  Tom Poe a little boy has just brought a message from his uncle that I would let Frank go home with him in the morning to the Peedee country.  Tom has given Frank a Harmonica which plays beautifully.  

	Someone gave me today a little china doll left with him by Mr. Barnwell.  I saw Mrs. Taylor & Martin in the gallery today but did not speak to them.  Will came to my seat in the House & pointed them out to me in the gallery.  I saw them looking at Will & myself in the House.  But I had at that hour to go to the College to meet the Faculty.  Mr. Barnwell, [John Izard] Middleton & DeSaussure & myself were a committee to meet Col. Preston, Dr. Lieber, Thornwell & the other Professors to arrange a matter of government for the College.  Will went with me.

	I am sure you will be greatly distressed when I inform you that Col. Ben Perry has beaten Burt by two votes for Secretary of State.  I voted for Burt & wished him elected in spite of all his prejudices against my politics.  He is really in friendship attached to me.

	I could not go to Coil. Hamptons dinner party yesterday in consequence of the meeting of the Board of Trustees in the College last evening.  Middleton & myself send word by Speaker Simmons [James Simons] as to our excuse.  


We had quite an interesting meeting of the Board of Trustees last night & transacted important business.

	Col. Ben Perry has just given a toast of champaigne wine & I have partaken of it.  This in consequence of his election.  Franks great ambition seems to be to eat two dinners.  He leaves the State House at ? past one, eats dinner & returnsthen at four he eats with me.  Willie stays till I eat.

	Col. Jno. Preston made a speech today whilst I was in College.  I told him I was sorry not to have heard it.  Mr. Harrison of Anderson told me today that he expected the Legislature would go with me after all.  Several persons have to my Paper.  I hope you & family are all well.  In the course of an hour I shall hear from you.  But before that time I have to close & mail my letter.

	I shall probably speak on the Southern question next week.  There seems to be a disposition to hear me.  I shall try & make a good speech.  Yesterday I was introduced to Col. Tomlinson of Georgia & a member of their state convention.  He said he was glad to meet a union man & I must send him my paper.

	I have bought a great many Books at 75 cts per volume which would cost 2.50 per volume.  They are English books & printed in England.

	I have bought a beautiful likeness of Terry  I saw Miss Martha Calhoun in the gallery today but did [not] speak to her.  There is a great display of Ladies in the gallery.  

	Kiss Fanny & Anna for me & tell them to kiss you for me.  Yours truly a lovingly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was very much gratified last night on receiving your letter & the one from Anna to Willie.  Tell Anna she writes a beautiful letter & I said to Willie she could beat him.  I had no idea she could write so well.  We are blessed my dear wife in our children.  They are very far superior in looks & intellect to most children I meet.  In behaviour I believe they are as good.  At the college commencement I noticed two little boys about Franks size on the platform in front of all the Professors & Trustees behaving very bad.  I thought to myself that if Frank was behaving in that way I should be terrible provoked & mortified.  Willie is a little man every inch of him, & I have never seen his equal.  Fanny is the prettiest & most intellectual child I ever saw.  Tell Anna I shall take great pleasure in hearing her play on the Pianno when I return home.  Willie is now reading by my side & Frank cutting with his knife.  I shall go to church after breakfast & carry Willie & Frank.  Col. Herndon asked me the other morning if I ever whipped my children & said he had occasionally to whip his.

	On Friday I heard the first sermon ever preached in the State House by Whiteford Smith.  It was a noble discourse eloquently delivered full of patriotism & liberty and good sense.  He urged wisdom & prudence in our deliberations & cautioned in strong terms against rashness & precipitation.  

	Yesterday Mr. Robert Barnwell sat with me in the House for an hour or two & we exchanged very fully our views & opinions.  He is very much opposed to separate state action & goes for a Southern Congress.  But he thinks disunion will ultimately come when the South is united.  I am confident of the reverse.

	Col. Pickens sat with me some time yesterday also & his views are moderate.  I think he will be elected Governor.  I saw a letter yesterday from Col. Hammond to Senator Gist of Union which denounced in strong terms separate action as folly & disaster.  He said the state would be crushed immediately by secession.  The opinion is that Rhett will beat Hammond for theSenate.

	I had another visit from Dr., Lieber last night.  I wanted him to go into the sitting room & sit with me there amongst all the members.  But he said no.  I wish to talk with you & not the other members.  So we went to my room & had a long chat, a good union talk& I am sure Mrs. Lieber would have been glad to have heard it.  I gave the Dr. when he left me Poinsetts recent letter in the Mercury to take home & read.  These letters of Hamilton & Poinsett annoy the disunionists very much.  

	The weather is now cold & I hope you will tomorrow, Monday, have those hogs killed.  They have been wasting my corn.  I am glad to hear that the stock are all doing well & some of them increasing.  Hochee no doubt would be very glad as Anna says for Willie to come home and give him a little variety by a ride to the farm & other places.  

	The Debate is still going on in the House on Federal Relations.  But the small guns have been firedthe big ones are kept in reserve for the latter part of the debate.  I shall probably speak about Wednesday.  John Read went off like a bag of wind yesterday & was for war & secession. [William Aiken]
 Owens followed in the same track.  When [William Ferguson] Hutson of Beaufort or Colleton made a pretty war speech, Jones tried to get the floor & finally succeeded for Monday.  My namesake Josiah B. Perry made a pretty good speech & was for secession.  What Jones will be for I know not.

	The committee of Ways and Means appropriated $125,000 yesterday morning to build a navy to fight the U. States.  Memminger & myself voted against it & were the only members of the committee who did.  The military committee are about appropriating $200,000 more to arm the state and fortify the coast.  I told them that this was a matter which the U., States ought to do!  Russel[l] Middleton was for the navy & was steamers.  I told him the U. States could send a half dozen ships as well [as] one to Charleston.  He is on our committee & seems a worthy & intelligent gentleman.

	I will make Willie write after our return from church.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz  

	The business of the session is now pressing so hard that I shall not have time to write you as often & as long as I have done.

	The debate on the Federal question is still going on.  Col. Memminger spoke all day today, & I tried to get the floor to reply but it was given to Col. [Elias Chumpton] Leitner.  He was generally expected too, & so understood that I should speak next.  I will probably speak tomorrow or the next day.  Col. Memminger alluded to me in his speech, & said when action comes, I shall then see my friend from Greenville in our midst as I now see him.  I have prepared myself for a pretty good effort.

	[James Washington] Harrison of Anderson came to me today & said he thought when the Legislature met I was alone but now he believed a majority of the House were with me.  I told him I began to feel as now always should in a majority [be] quite magnanimous.  It is true a majority of the House are with me in action, but very hot in words.  Such is Col. Memmingers position.  Col. [James] Chesnut made a very able speech yesterday, & took my ground of a Southern congress.  Col. [Erwin Patton] Jones made quite a failureabout fifteen minutessaid nothing but a few set phrases & I really felt for him but his vanity kept him from feeling for himself.  

	The Legislature have agreed in the House to adjourn on Friday week 20th Inst.  So you must send Breechees to Fulks Friday evening.  I will meet him there Saturday morning 21st.  He will leave home Thursday morning & stay at Laurens C.H.  I begin to feel anxious to get homewould be very willing to make my speech & go tomorrow.  The gallery was crowded with Ladies today & Mr.Mauldin pointed out one, whom he said favored you very much.  I did not think so nor do I know who she is.

	I hope to receive a letter from you in one hour.  The children are around me.  They stay with me altogether.  They come into the State House & stand by my side.  Some times the doorkeeper sends them up in the gallery.  But Frank whenever he sees him go off will slip in a boost of his dexterity.     

	They have had one ballot for SolicitorReed 63Young 51[Benjamin Yancey] Martin of Abbeville 45.  I think Young will be elected.  The Governors election will take place Thursday.  I think Pickens will be elected.

	I have just got the spoons beautifully engraved.  I have also bought a good many cheap, rare & valuable Booksalso a revolver pistola bottle of colognea hair brush & three beautiful plaster of paris figurinesa cheap pen & pencil for you- a ball & a whip & knife for Franka ball & several books for Willie.

	I went to church on Sunday & heard some beautiful music.  Miss Sally Elmore sings beautifully & I heard her voice above all the rest.  She is a second Jinny Lind.  My friend Dr. Thompson of Union thinks so.  He is the medical student I met in Philadelphia.

	I hope you & household are all well.  I assure you I am very anxious to see you & Fanny & Anna.  Tell Anna she must write again.  I hope too your mother & family are well & that Mr. McBee arrived safely at home.  I wrote a long letter to Mr. Carson the other day.  I would write as I promised to Mr. Croft but suppose he had gone below.

	I must now conclude & believe me dear Liz your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I recd a letter from Elford saying he had recd two hundred dollars from General Thompson.  He was in Baltimore & going on to New York.  I have also recd a most encouraging letter from General Thompson.  He says Elford is in fine spirits.  But strange again the General does not mention his marriage.  B.F.P.

	I have but a few minutes to write you.  The Legislature have just adjourned & meet again at six oclock & I am not waiting for dinner.  The children are playing ball in the room.  They have been with me all day in the State House, except when they came here for dinner.

	Yesterday I got the floor after Col. Leitner had spoken.  He spoke very badly, & the House was in  a[t]tentive.  As soon as it was perceived that I had the floor I saw persons begin to sit themselves.  There was some anxiety or curiosity to hear me.  It was known that I differed with the other members in regard to my notions about the Union.  Earlier as profound silence prevailed over the House.  I had spoken but a very short time before I saw the faces of the members turn pale.  They seemed amazed at my boldness and yet felt deeply the force of my argument.  The account or sketch of my speech in the Carolinian is very meagre & imperfect leaving out one half & changing one half of the other half.  I am now writing it out, & will publish it in extensor.  I spoke one hour but did not say half that I intended to say.  It is my purpose to write it out fully.

	Professor Williams of the South Carolina College came to me & said this morning that he gave me his heart as cordially as he did his handthat he was in exstacy with my speech although he did not hear ithis son did.  I saw Col. OHanlon sitting with a face beaming with joy but I have not seen him since.  Mr. Middleton said to me this morning that I had amazed the House with my ultraism & boldness.  I thought so too.  The newspapers have all spoken respectfully of my speech but regret that any one should hold my sentiments.  Col. McGowen [McGowan] replied to me yesterday evening but did not make a very able effort.  Col. Dargan brother of the Chancellor replied this morning & Col. Lyles of Fairfield.  They were all very respectful.  No one is yet elected Governor or Lieutenant Governor.  You will see the vote in the papers tomorrow morning.  Reed has beaten Young for solicitor, & it is a most cruel thing.  

       I see Choice is here with Mrs. Walker on their way to Greenville.  They leave in the morning & so do the Townes &.  I saw Mr. Hutson the other day.  We are both on the same committee.  He informed me that he was a relation f my wifes & spoke kindly to the children.  I told the children that he was a blood relation of theirs in his presence.
       
       We adjourn next Friday week.  that is tomorrow week 20th Inst.  You must start Reuben with the carriage Thursday morning so that he will reach Fulks Friday night.  I shall go up Saturday morning & get there by eight oclock.  This will enable me to reach home Sunday evening.
       
       Nothing of interest in the Legislature except the debate.  The Legislature will not do much.  I must now stop.  I shall hear from you tonight.  I was very much pleased with your long letter.  When I read it Willie & Frank had gone to bed.  Frank proposed I should read it aloud.  The little fellow listened some time but before I got through with the letter he had gone to sleep.  
       
       I hope to hear from you again tonight.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
   
P.S. Tell Anna & Fanny that I do not forget them although not mentioned in the body of my letter.

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night and was truly glad to hear you were all well.  It made me anxious to see you, & be at home once more. The scolding you gave me about spending money.  You must bear with my breach.  My books, my dear wife, & my little children are my only sources of enjoyment & happiness in this life.  It is impossible for me to exist without a fresh supply of books every year.

	I was sorry to hear of Scotts sickness.  I have had apprehensions for months past that he was not a sound horse.  If we loose him, Byron & Selim will have to be our carriage horses for some time.  Corn is now so dear that the expense of keeping a horse is very great and even the death of Scott would perhaps be a saving to us.  So you see I have a good desal of philosophy & am disposed to make the best of my misfortuneseven the scoldings of my dear wife I take patiently & put them to a good account.

Letter 170
Friday morning I visited with fifteen or twenty Senators & members of the Legislature the Lunatic Asylum & passed through all the buildings, saw all of the inmates & walked over the grounds & garden & green house, all of which are interesting.  I saw old Mrs. Alston.  She looked comfortable & happy.  In one room a sitting room or parlor I saw fifteen or twenty women, all neatly dressed & well behaved.  No one would have supposed that they were crazy.  In the male department a man stepped up to me & claimed my acquaintance.  His name was Lindsay from Spartanburgh.  He told me about a case I had at Laurens in which he was a witness, which was true.

	Yesterday there were a good many speeches made on Federal relations.  But the debate is beginning to loose its interest.  The Senate decided last night by a vote of 34 to 8 to call a convention of the state.  I do not think however the House will agree to it.  But it would perhaps be just as well to let them go ahead & have their own way till they find themselves checkmated.

	The Governor has just rece[ive]d a letter from the President in reply to the one he wrote about the troops in Charleston.  The letter places the Governor in a very ridiculous point of view.  I suppose it will hardly be published.  The President says to him that he is commander in chief of the army & navy of the U, States & has a right to dispose of the troops as he pleases & denies the right of the governor to ask for his reasons in his movements of the army.

	I have looked at the desks for your mother & they are from $4 to $12.00.  There is a letter writing case in the Library your mother may have.  It was given me by Mr. Headen & is of no use to me.  But I suppose it would not suit her.  I cannot get Susan Hokes music.  

	You must start Reuben for me Thursday morning.  He was stay at Simmons at Laurens & reach Fulks Friday night.  Saturday morning I will meet him at 8 oclock & we can get home in two days if the roads are not very bad.  So you may look for us Sunday night about nine oclock.  Mr. Duncan will go up in the stage, & reach home or Greenville C.H. Saturday 12 oclock a day and a half in advance of me.  I wish I could go with him.  You have no idea how anxious I am to get home to my wife, my children, my books & my office.  It is pleasant to leave home occasionally, but it is far more agreeable to my feelings to return home.  There is no place like home.  I shall eat your Christmas dinner promised to me & the children with great satisfaction but I hope the first meal will be supper & we will dine in the night to make the journey.  But the roads may be so bad that we may be disappointed.

	The children are well except a slight cold.  They have been a source of pleasure to me & a good deal of trouble.  When together they behave worse than separate.  As you say they are very much inclined to tease & plague each other.  By himself Willie is remarkable manly & a companion for me.    But with Frank he annoys me a good deal.  They both stick to me as close of leachesWillie all the time.  Frank is more disposed to go off.  I hope the trip will improve both of them--learn them behaviour & manners.  But Frank is pretty hard to manage at the table.

.	Tell Anna & Fanny that the plaster figures are for them & one for youthree in number.

	The House has been in session all day today & I have now just eaten my dinner at six oclock.  We meet again at seven oclock tonight, so I have but a few minutes to write.  The children too are both leaning on my table and bothering me.  They came home & got their dinners & are now eating raisins & almonds. They live well.

	The subject of a convention & Southern Congress has been before the House all day, & we have voted a hundred times almost on the various propositions & made as many speeches.  Still the final vote is not yet taken & is very doubtful.  I begin to think that we shall do nothing, neither call a Southern Congress nor a convention.  But the matter will be decided tonight.  Forty two votes are enough to defeat a convention and we had forty eight today.  But some may bolt.  Several gentlemen here told me that I am the only honest man amongst them all, who vote against a convention.  The House was a good deal excited today.  And several severe threats were made to Col. Memminger.

	I gave my speech to the Carolinian to publish today.  He says he will do so next week.  The speech is very long 45 pages & will fill one whole side of the Carolinian.

    	I am in the Columbia Telegraph this morning, a compliment to me.  He notices two articles in North Carolina & Georgia abusing me, & says that no one who knows me will doubt my purity of motive. 

         Mrs. Jones & her children came down here last night & I saw Tom Jones this morning.  Frank seemed delighted to see him & invited him to dine with him at Maybins Hotel, which Tom did.    So Frank is playing the gentleman quite young inviting his associates to dine with him at a Hotel.  I was engaged in the House.
       
       The Governor was inaugurated yesterday & quite a crowd as usual.  The speech you will see in the Carolinian.  

	I hope to hear from you tonight & next Thursday night.  Col. Corn of Walterborough & old Mr. Verdier have both taken a great fancy to Frank.  Verdier is a Frenchman worth $300,000 & no children.  He says he must have Frank & I told him to take him.  But Frank protests very strongly against any such arrangement.

	I must now conclude.  I will write you again once more before I leave Columbia.  Kiss Anna & Fanny for me, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I am almost tired to death with legislation.  For several days past we have met at ten and adjourned at 12 oclock in the nightsitting fourteen hours, with only a recess of one hour.  I am almost worn out.  Today I made a speech on a Bill concerned with Federal relations.  The question had been discussed a long time.  I tried once or twice to get the floor but did not succeed.  Some ten or fifteen had made speeches.  The question was taken and only three or four voted as I did in the negative.  I then got up and begged to have my vote recorded against the Bill & made a speech of some length which was listened to by the House with intense interest.  I felt what I said & I made the House feel.  When the ayes & noes were taken I had a majority of fifteen.  The vote stood sixty to forty five.  My four votes increased wonderfully.  It felt as I felt it take[s] a good speech.  The result showed it.  In the course of my words I replied to Campbell, who is a yanky, the son in law of Bennet.  He felt it & winced.  I told the House that I was a native of South Carolina.  General Bonham, Col. Boozer, Col. Dargan, Col. Thompson and many others came up & congratulated me on my effort & success.  The Bill was levelled at the yankys. 

	I rece[ive]d an invitation to dine with Dr, Lieber tomorrow with the boys Frank & Willie.  I shall do so.  The Dr. wrote me he wished to have a fraternizing conversation with me before I left.  

	Miss Calhoun & her mother sent me a message about going up with them on Saturday.  They have a carriage but not room enough to carry all the family & Miss Calhoun was going up in the stage.  I sent work I would give her a seat in my carriage.  She has returned for answer that she accepts.  Soi you need hardly look for us Sunday night.  I feel assured we shall not now be able to make the journey in two days from Fulks.  I afterwards saw Miss Martha Calhoun in the gallery.  She saw me & bowed to me but I did not speak to her as I wasan opportunity to speak.

	I have just seen Elford & he & Duncan will leave in the morning.  I will write you again by Duncan tonight.  Yours truly. B.F. Perry

	I have just recd your long letter & will write you a line in reply by Wednesday.

	I am truly sorry to hear such bad news about the horses.  If I had known of the lameness of Byorn I would have gone up in the Stage with Mr. Duncan.  But it is too late now to change your arrangements.  I am sure you have done the best as you always do.  I have as you know great confidence in your judgement & arrangements.

	I went to the Rail Road the other morning but could hear nothing of your bundle nor have I yet heard anything about it.  But I will ascertain & find out in the morning.  It is now after ten oclock &
The Legislature in session & will be till midnight.
	I shall try to get home Sunday night but think it almost impossible if Miss Calhoun takes a seat with us & we have to travel with her mother.

	I am glad you have sent something to eat.  The tin box I left at Fulks & told Reuben to car[r]y it home.  I suppose he forgot it.

	You are mistaken in supposing that I am not treated well by the members.  We are all cordial.  I shall be glad to meet your mother & family at dinner on my return home.  You did not say anything about the writing desk for your mother.  

	I am afraid I shall not be able to get the seeds or hops.  

	I am distressed to hear that the smallpox is in the Country.  The children ought all to be vaccinated

	I shall be truly glad to be at home again.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Monday night, 14 April 1851
Charleston

My dear Liz

	I have just come up from dinner & have one hour till eight oclock to myself.  At eight some Virginia young ladies are to pay Mr. Yeadon a visit & I shall have to be in the drawing room.

	Mr. Yeadon, General Combs of Kentucky & myself are all the white persons about the establishment.  I wrote a long account of my journey down here for the Patriot & will not repeat it to you.  President Fillmore is expected here the last of this weekwill stay with Mr. Yeadon.  His chamber is filled up in most magnificent style.  

	I saw your uncle Arthur & Col. Isaac Hayne this morning.  They both asked me if I was able to get a room & I replied I was staying with Mr. Yeadon.  They asked after you & Mrs. McCall.  I saw Captain Cunningham who likewise enquired after you.  

	I have been so constantly engaged today from breakfast till dinner in the convention that I have but little to write except what I have already written for the Patriot & I dislike to write the same thing over again.

	I met Miss Brenner on the& she is very much improved in her appearance.  She is to sing in Charleston this week.  Last night we started to church with the Virginia young ladies who are to take tea here this evening.  They are pretty and quite interesting.  Mr. Yeadon staid with their grandfather Mr. Winston when in Richmond in 1846.  He is now here a delegate.

	The Proceedings of the convention I have given in my letter to the Patriot.  Mr. Duncan is staying with Mr. Ford who married Miss Gerard.  Mr. Butler at the Charleston Hotelthe McBees & Irvine are there also.

	Mr. Yeadon is living in great style.  His family have gone to the country.  I am very pleasantly situatedquite private amidst all the crowds & bustle of the city.

	Tell Anna Mr. Gantt enquired how that very interesting little daughter of mine was.  I will now suspend my letter till after tea & perhaps all morning.

	Our company have gone & I am left all alone in my glory.  Yeadon has gone over to the Courier office & & General Combs has gone to Mr. Conners.  It is now half past eleven oclock & I will go to bed.  The evening passed off very pleasantly.  Mrs. Bryant came to receive the ladies.  She is a relation of Mr. Yeadons.

	I hope you & the children are all well & I also hope to receive a letter from you tomorrow evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am detained here by a very important case between Mr. Bobo & Col. Maybin of Columbia.  It will probably be tried tomorrow & if so I shall be at home Wednesday.

	I hope you will be able to keep up till my return, but I am afraid not.  You know my anxiety about the matter.  It is true I could be of no service, but it would be something to you to see and have a husbands sympathy and love in your suffering.  My return will be pleasant anywaypleasant to find you still about, & still more to find you with a sweet babe by your side.

	God bless you & preserve you & help you in your trying situation.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Mr. Spencer is just starting & I have time only to write you a line.

	Willie & myself are quite well, though I was very sick the night I reached here.  The pills & the fatigue of coming have exhausted me completely.

	I hope to be at home Sunday.  Nothing done yet in court.  I have written a long article for the Tri-Weekly on Saturday.  Willie is now asleep.  I have eaten breakfast.  

	I hope you & the dear little Baby are well & a great many persons here enquired after him.  Never was an infant more famous at his birth in the ordinary circles of life.

	I must stop & will write you again by Saturdays mail.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Mr. Elford & now he will write a short one to you.  It is late in the night & I hope you & little Hext the Union Boy are both sound asleep & as well as could be expected,  I go from here direct to Pickens on Wednesday.  There is not much business in court.

	Judge Johnston informs me that he left his wife in your situation, & that her health is bad.  Mr. Perrin Isaid his wife was also in the same condition.  Col. McGowan who was married last January was afraid for his lady to ride on the Rail Road in consequence of her situation.  He told me of a sad accident on the Rail Road a few days sinceCol. McCords daughter married to Mr.started on the rail Road to Augusta & was confined in the cars & brought forth a fine infant being & likely to do well.  I suppose the little fellow was travelling at the rate of twenty miles an hour when he came into the world.  My client Walker met with a terrible accident too.  He was coming too court with his wife, & she was confined on the road!  Truly these are beautiful times with you women folks.

	I hope your mother is keeping her promise & taking good care of you.  Howthe baby will be when I see it.  I shall be delighted to see the little fellow.

	God bless you & the children & preserve you.  If anyone comes to Pickens write me a line or send a newspaper.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have just thought of another piece of news.  Last court I saw here a fine, handsome your music teacher from New York.  Dr. Sloan a young man here fell in love with her & she with him.  Some months since she left Mr. Bensons & returned home.  Since that time she has given birth to a bouncing boy, & thrown all of her friends here with great consternation.  She was greatly esteemed & very pious.  Dr. Sloan has gone off & nobody knows where.  The young woman Miss Horton has exhibited a piece of writing in which they acknowledge themselves husband & wife.  This was pretty cunning & is by our laws a legal marriage!

	But enough of this slander.  The girls have left herevery few now at Bensons.  I suppose they are afraid of being served as Miss Horton was.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot which will please & amuse you.

	Dr. Anderson has directed me to call on Sullivan & get $300 balance of my fee & Sullivan told me this evening that he would pay it.

	I was employed in a new case today which may detain me here some time.  The principal business I had here has been postponed by the other side

	The election here has gone in favor of cooperation, & will throughout the district.    My impression is that it will throughout the state.  

	Write to me about the elections by tomorrows mail.  I hope you & the children are all well & doing well.  Hext, I am sure is a good boy, & I wish to see him very muchthis you may tell him.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I had not time to write you this evening before the mail closed.  I wrote a few lines to the Patriot which I knew you would see the night it arrived.

	My cold is better, but I felt Bad coming down in the stage.  [several words obscured by blotting]  Jones came down with me.  We stopped at the head of the rail Road ten miles above Newberry C.H.  The next morning we had a car full to Columbia.  Judge Whitner & his daughter were in companyalso Judge ONeal[l] & Chancellor Johns[t]on.  Col. Ware has brought his little son down with him.

	Tell Willie & Frank that a great many persons have enquired about them.  Dr. Powe says that his son often speaks of them.  Dr. Goodwyn enquired after them.  

	I saw Arthur Simpkins this evening.  He came to our room to electioneer.  He is a candidate for Commissioner in Equity.  He brought me a letter from Richard Harrison of Florida.  I shall vote for him.  There is a good deal of electioneering.

	Everyone seems kind & cordial to me& a great many have taken an occasion to compliment me for my course and the hottest secessionists in the Legislature have done so.

	I saw John Cunningham a few moments today but did not enquire about his mother & sister.  There is to be a meeting of the Cooperation party here tomorrow.  Judge Cheves is here.  Judge Butler is not here yet.  His niece is to be married next Thursday or perhaps Tuesday.

	    I had a pleasant interview with Governor Means this morning & he seemed in a good humour.  He told me that old Mrs. Hughes was in town & immediately afterwards I recd a letter from Dr. Roach informing me that old Mrs. Hughes wished me to intercede &c.

	I feel great anxiety about you & the children.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  The colds & fever are so common that I am in constant apprehension.  Goldsmith lost a negro woman with cold, as I came by his house & he is down with fever.

	Col. Brockman & Duncan are in my room & talking all the time & I am somewhat bothered.

	Let me hear all about your household affairs and especially the children.

	I have seen very few persons today.  In my next letter I will give you more news.  Give my love to the children & accept the same for yourself.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening, enclosing one from Anna and another from Willie, and for all of which I am very much obliged to you.  I hope to receive another tomorrow evening.

	The reference to William & Annas going to the writing school I am willing you should do as you please about and Frank too may go if you think he will learn anything.

	I have two little packages for Susan, sent by General Martin.  I will send them up by young Markley who goes up tomorrow.

	I met Col. Isaac Hayne this morning as I was going down the steps & he coming up.  We spoke and shook hands & passed on with the ordinary enquiries.  He did not ask anything about his aunt & cousins as heretofore.  General martin seemed kind & friendly. 

	We have just had a visit from Arthur Simkins & he was electioneering for commissioner.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this evening & gave me an invitation to tea tomorrow evening before I go to attend the board of trustees.  He wrote me a letter this morning inviting me to tea this evening.  The Dr. is delighted at the result of the election.

	Duncan, Brockman & myself are getting on very well in one room, except that the Colonel snores a little too much. 
	I am glad to hear that you are all well, & that little Hext has experienced no evil from his magnesium.

	Tell the children all that I will bring them some pretty presents & write them a letter shortly.

	In regard to my purchases I have bought a pair of boots & a hatlife of RandolphLives of the Queens of France & Scotland, Lady Wortley &c &c.

	I will now close my letter as the clock is striking ten & perhaps I may write you again tomorrow.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I thank you for your letter yesterday evening written on Monday last.

	I sent you yesterday by Mr. Powell two bundles for Susan & one for yourself with a letter from someone.  When I wrote you last I thought Powell was Markley.

	I took tea with Dr. Lieber last night & went from there to attend the Board of Trustees.  Nothing was done in the Board.  Dr. Manly of Alabama is spoken of as Presidentseveral spoken of as candidates for Professorship.

	The Governor gave me a blank pardon to fill up for Magistrate Hitt.  I will send it up this evening & present Taylor of escorting him to Columbia.

	I saw Mr. Buist yesterdayalso Col. Dawkins & Col. Herndon who all enquired after you & the children.  Herndon tells me he has five children & is alarmed at the idea of any more.

	Yesterday I was employed in court in a case of the Spartanburgh Manufacturing Company against Col. Maybin.

	Tell Willie & Frank that a great many persons have enquired after them.  I did not know before that they were so important persons in the Legislature.  Col. John Preston enquired with seeming interest about them.  He tells me that Mrs. Calhoun & Martha are at his house, & that there is no hope of Miss Martha living long.  She is in the last stage of consumption I believe.

	I am met by everybody with great cordiality a7 have had a good deal of amusement in talking about secession.  

	I have purchased the Pictorial Bible for you.  The subscription price was $25.00.  I gave $15.00.  It contains thousands of plates & illuminated letters.

	My cold is something better but going out last night made it worse.  We are getting on well in our room.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  I feel a deep interest in hearing from you every mail.

	Tell Willie & Anna to write me again & Frank too if he goes to the writing school.

	In haste yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mr. John Izard Middleton enquired kindly after you & children.  He said Mrs. Middleton arrived safely & were all well.

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter of Wednesday & will write you a few lines, as you have been so good a wife as to write me every mail.  I hope your kindness & love will never grow less.

	I have just come up from the supper table when I saw Judge Butler, who enquired kindly after you all & especially Willie & Frank.  Really these two young gentlemen are quite famous.

	I have had a great deal of pleasant chat with the secessionists, & they all seem to look upon me most favorably.  My article about Col. Memminger & looking to the Lord & being dismissed has been published in the Carolinian & excited a good deal of amusement at the expense of Memminger.

	Tomorrow Mr. Middleton & myself are to dine with the students in college at one oclock.  We dine there to see how the students live.  They complain of the fare dreadfully.  

	I have been placed on the committee to examine students applying for admission to the Bar next Tuesday.

	I have introduced my bill to give the election of Electors to the people & made it the special order of the day for Tuesday next.  I will make a short speech for it.

	Col. Brockman recd. A letter from Mr. Carter of Charleston very highly complimentary to myself in particular & the Greenville people in general.  

	The secessionists are holding a meeting tonight & the cooperationists had a meeting last night.

	Old Mr. Reese who wrote the letter you mentioned has been a great while a strong friend of mine, and I am truly sorry he is going to leave the state.

	I am glad you & the children & servants are all getting better of your colds.  

	My old friend Fre has been to see me, & was delighted at my presenting his memorial & having it printed.

	We are all getting on very well.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

P.S. I do not care to rent my Farm at all & especially to the persons applying.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter last night informing me of your purchases & that you might have to draw on me.  I will honor my draft you may make.  Let me know how much money you may wish & I will enclose it to you.  I have lent Col. Brockman two hundred dollars.

	Mr. Latta has been to see me & invited me to dine with him next Sunday in company with Judge Evans.  Mr. Latta enquired after you & your mother.  I saw Judge Cheves yesterday.  He was very kind in his enquiries about your mother, sister & yourself & children.  The Judge looks pretty well but like a hard drinker.

	I met Barnwell Rhett yesterday.  He was very cordial in his meeting & paid me some compliments.  Judge Butler has not yet arrived.  Sam Townes will go up this evening & I may send some package by him.  We are quite friendly & I voted for him.

	You must write me what you wish me to purchase for you & I will do so.  Tell Anna to write what she wishes me to purchase for her.  Also Willie & Frank must write me in the same way.  I will write to them as soon as I have leisure.  But I assure you I have no time to do anything.  Yesterday I was in court pretty much all day.  But you will see an account of the courts & Legislature in my letter to the Patriot.  

	I am glad your carpeting has all arrived & will be pleased to see it on my return to see the House looking neat, wife pretty & children hearty & cheerful.

	I must now quit & go to breakfast.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	I recd your letter this evening & was very much pleased with it.  As you were so good as to write to me & your mother did not, and as I wrote to her last night I will [write] you this evening.

	Willie & Robert Duncan have gone to the theatre.  Mr. Duncan and Col. Brockman are out & so are the other two boys.  Mr. Center is unwell & in his room so I am all alone.  Just as I had finished this sentence Dr. Blanding came in to see me & sat till after ten oclock.  Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams were here just before.  I have no time to write or do anything.

	Tell your mother that I have written an account of the first days proceedings for the Patriot & will not write them over again.

	We Are all getting on very well, & the members seem very cordial to me.  My old friend Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger is here & at this house and we have a great deal shot.  The old gentleman is failing rapidly.  Edmund Rhett sits by me in the convention & we have had a great deal of talk.  He enquired after your mother & grandmother & aunts.

	I have just received a long letter from Mr. [William Alexander] Rosborough of Chester very complimentary.  I have also recd a dogrel poem in printHamilton, Petigru, Memminger, Thompson, myself, Butler, Orr &c &c.

	I saw Augustus Hoke here yesterday & I suppose he has gone home today.

	I will not close my letter which is more for your mother than you.  I will bring you & Fanny something pretty.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your letter to Willie.  He seemed a little affected by it.  He has gone again to the Theatre tonight with Mr. Duncan.  He & Robert were very much pleased last night.  I should have gone too, but my feet are so much hurt by the pavements. That I cannot wear my boots this evening.  I am now all alone which is a sore thing.

	The Convention got on slowly.  Today the committee of twenty one was appointed, & I am on it with all the Judges, chancellors, Senators & ex Governors of the Convention.  We meet in the morning to decide what is to be done.  How long the convention will sit, & what they will do no one can tell.

	I shall not leave here before the last of next weekcertainly not before Thursday.  I am glad you are getting on so well with your household, and that you feel so much relieved from the annoyances given you by Minerva.

	Willie is behaving well & says he will write you tomorrow & that he will write to Anna also.  I have spent my time most pleasantly & agreeably.  Judge Hayne boards at Maybins & we have had a great deal of chat.  I have laughed a great deal at the secessionists & cooperationists.  Col. Stork told me this evening that he heard a bet made last night between two members of the Convention & a dozen bottles of wine that I would be elected to the United States Senate in less than ten years.  

	Someone sent me through the mail last night a dogrel poem in four cantos, abusing in very scurrilous terms, Hamilton, Petigru, Preston, Thompson, Memminger, Butler, Isaac Hayne, Orr, Pres[s]ly &c &c myself & the Southern Patriot.  It has excited some interest & curiosity.

	General Martin said jesting that he would [like] Willie to go & see his wife & Mrs. Taylor, but I have heard nothing more of it.  I think your kin are not very affectionate.  I was APPOINTED BY Judge Wardlaw one of the committee to examine the certificates of members.  This brought me in contact with them.  Most of them spoke to me & shook hands with me as they came up to the clerks desk, but I could not catch the eye of Perroneau Finley & we did not speak.  I have not met him since.

	I had a visit yesterday from Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams & Mr. Thornwell this morning.  Mr.  came to pay his respects this evening and gave meAddressabout the Mountain Men.  I recd a fine letter last night from [William Alexander] Roseborough [Rosborough].

	I must now conclude with my love to you & the children.  I am delighted to hear that Hext can stand alone.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry 

P.S. Col. William A. Williams arrived here last night & invited Irby, Col. Watts, and myself to dine with him tomorrow.  I hope he will also pay our fees.  He came down to challenge Scurry, but Irby, Watts & myself have decided against it, & he expresses himself to be governed by our opinion.  

	Judge Huger says that Mrs. Poinsett & Mrs. Pringle are not reconciled & that Mrs. Poinsett refuses to live with her.  The Judge says Mrs. Pringle is a woman of temper.  Mrs. Poinsett has gone to Stateburgh to spend the summer.

	I have just recd your letter and am only able to write a few lines in reply.  I have just finished a long letter to Elford about the convention & other matters & it is now late in the night.  General Thompson has just left our room.  Mr. Center is in another room.

	The Convention has done nothing yet. Tomorrow we will have a general discussion.  When we met this morning it was the most crowded house I ever saw.  There was great anxiety to hear the Report of the Committee of Twenty one.  After Judge Cheves had read the report, I presented my report  embodying the sentiments of myself, and it was well recei[ve]d.  The Convention then adjourned.   I saw General Thompson & Miss Jones at the State House and walked home with them.  Miss Jones seemed disposed to be pleasant & talk.  After dinner I walked out with Willie & my colleagues to threw Asylum &c.  Taylor & Willie his son came to see us this morning and left their cards.  My old friends Dr. Landrum & Co. OHanlon also came. 

	I am glad your household are all well.  I shall be glad to see you and the children and especially Hext stepping about.

	Col. Brockman has just informed me that Miss Harriet Walker is in the house opposite & married to a young man by the name Flemings and well married.

	I must now conclude my letter as I have nothing more to say.  Willie has gone to bed & the others are talking in the room.  I have not had time to see about my likeness.  Judge ONeall will be here on Saturday next.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter to Willie & he seemed pleased with it, and your good advice brought tears to his eyes.  Sine the return of the Duncans he is more of a companion for me & I value more his company.  I have bought for him the Scottish Chiefs & Traders of Warsaw which he is now reading & sitting at my table.  I am writing just after supper.

	Tell Anna I like very much her deportment in church in taking another seat, & reprising the officious attentions of a little boy.  There is nothing that I admire more in a little girl than retiring diffidence & especially towards the other sex. 

	Willie listens with great attention to anything said or written about Hockey.

	I am sorry to hear Mary is sick & hope she is better.  You must be in a bad condition for servants whilst cleaning the House, & you had better postpone it till the family are all well.

	It would be wrong to let Frank beat himself, or expose himself in any way.

	I had just had my likeness taken.  It is a noble looking face & headmuch larger than any previous daguerreotype of myself.  He is the best I ever saw.  Mine is in its rough cast & will be sent to Lexington in that condition.  This man Zealy says that Lexington requested him not to paint or touch the likeness.  Judge ONealls was sent back because it had been colored & was too small.  His charge was $10.00 including a frame.  He said anyone who had been in his room today recognized my likeness instantly.  I was fortunate in getting this man to daguerreotype me.  

	Mr. Rhett has resigned his seat in the Senate.  It is not known who the Governor will appoint as his successor.  General Jones of Edgefield told me today that no appointment would be made for ten or fifteen days.  Pickens, Governor Richardson & Governor Seabrook are applicants through their friends, but Governor Means does not fancy any of them.      

	I was told that my Report was to be published with the proceedings of the convention & will go forth to the world with the report adopted by the Committee.  I am glad of this as I wish it to be read.

	Today I have been rather lonesome.  Wallace Thompson came this evening & was full of my attack on General Wallace.  The Carolinian contains an extract from my editorial correspondence & complements my courtesy.

	Judge Huger left this morning.  I have had a most pleasant and agreeable week with the old gentleman & we have been very much together as he boarded at this House.  Mr. Finl[e]y spoke to me yesterday very cordially & I did not recognize him.  Judge Butler & myself were walking & met Mr. Barnwell & Mr. Finl[e]y.  I spoke to Mr. Barnwell & was not going to do anything more than bow to the other but he immediately called me by my name & shook hands.  The more I see & know of Mr. Barnwell the more I like him. 

	I shall probably get off from here Thursday morning.  The Trustees meet Wednesday night.  My cases are the first on the docket & will be disposed of in two days.

	Willie will probably write you tomorrow.  He says he does not know how we can write so much to each other.

	Dr. Blanding said to me this evening that he did not suppose that either John Preston or myself would receive the appointment of Senator.  Col. Martin of Abbeville said he would like to see me receive the appointment.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your long and most acceptable letter this evening & as you have been so good in writing my mail, I will do the same.

	I have just taken my supper & did have some idea of going to the theatre, but it is raining & the house would be unpleasant.  Willie is reading the Scottish Chiefs.  I read to him your letter.  He assisted me this morning in endorsing my briefs.  Judge Frost recognized him as my shadow.

	The court commenced the trial of my cases this morning.  We disposed of three of them.  Tomorrow the Court of Errors, which includes the Chancellors & law Judges sits on two more of my cases.  I hope to get through Wednesday & start home Thursday morning.  You may expect me to rouse you up about twelve oclock Thursday night.  But I will write you again tomorrow.

	I am glad the children enjoyed themselves so well on May day.  But I was sorry to hear that you had fatigued yourself.  I hope it has all passed over.  I am afraid to that the children may feel the effects of their potion.  You ought to take care of Mary.  She is such a beast that she will have no care of herself.  It may be slow fever, which is my greatest of terrors.  Do not commence your house cleaning.

	I hope Reuben and Charles are getting on pretty well with the farm.  Mr. Barrett was to send me some fodder.

	General Thompson left here this morning with his wife & sister in law.  They go on home & he returns to Columbia tomorrow.  No appointment of Senator will take place for ten or fifteen days.

	Col. Dudl[e]y came this morning & told Willie he would give him a keepsake to remember his fathers friend by.  I will get the articles you wish oranges & cocoa candy.

	I hear theof my resolutionsevery day.  Henderson of Laurens came down this evening & said
all the secessionists he met preferred them to the report of the Committee.

	I have nothing new to write you.  Most of the persons have gone from Columbia & this House quite deserted except by clerks & shop keepers, who are regular boarders.
     
	Every time I see a little baby I recall Hext to my minds eye. Tell Anna & Frank & Fanny that I think of them very often and you, my dear wife, are constantly in my thoughts & heart.  Good night, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line.  And I have very little to write.

	My horse did very well, never drove one which was more gentle.  He is gentler than Caleem.  Willie can drive him any where.  I am very much pleased with him.  

	As I came on Overtook Col. Townes & John Jones & even stopped on the road side & ate our dinner very pleasantly & they both drank of my wine & brandy.  

	I have been here all day without reaching my cases.  We will only be able to try Paris case.  The other will have to be postponed.

	I have met Chancellor Dunkin who enquired after you very kindly & seems very pleasant.  He asked for the Southern Patriot this morning & said he had not seen it since he left Charleston.

	Mr. Burt, Young, Perrin, McGowan, Sullivan are all here.  It is probable I shall not leave till Wednesday evening & stay at old Pendleton.

	I shall be glad to hear from you at Pickens.  But I am afraid no one is going from Greenville.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I am here quite well & shall leave this morning for Abbeville & will endeavour to return home Sunday night.  I feel much better than when I left home.

This is quite a pleasant place & I wish you were with me.

	I met my old friend Capt. Hugh Wilson & wife yesterday & he seemed very glad to see me.

	I am here & very anxious to hear from you & know how Edward & the fever are coming on.  I saw Col. Ware this evening who says he left Greenville after dinner Tuesday evening & heard Dyer speak of having some of the boys sick.

	Mr. Reed is quite sick with billous fever.  I saw him this evening.  His wife was confined two days since & is dangerously ill.  Norris the one who took tea with us is sick at Bensons with typhoid fever, says Mr. Harrison.
		   
	I spent last night at Mr. Hammonds & found Mrs. Hammond a very important witness.  I have examined Mrs. Reed & Mr. John E. Norris.  In the morning I start to old Pendleton by the way of  Garrisons & will reach there tomorrow night.

	Frank does very well & is great company for me.  Yesterday we fell in company with Bruce & old Mrs. Green & took dinner with them on the road to Anderson.  They were coming here.

	Tell Reuben & Charles when not better employed they may grub out the place we spoke of building a house at over on the Farm and which we commenced clearing last winter.  

	I hope to hear from you at old Pendleton Friday morning.  Take care of yourself & the children & the Servants.  Make them keep everything clean in the kitchen & rooms.  The sickness in Charleston is alarming.  It is now very warm weather & should it continue the sickness will increase.

	Good night.  Frank has just gone to bed to sleep.  How happy I should be to peep in & see you & the children.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am now writing to you an hour before day.  I have made my own fire & am sitting in my morning gown & slippers.  I believe this is the only time I shall have for all the evening my room is full of visitors.

	I will now give you an account of our journey down here.  Monday night we passed very pleasantly at John H. Harrisons who married Miss Benson.  Anna was much pleased with them.  Mrs. Harrison whom I went to examine is a very strange old woman.  She would not be sworn and would not answer my questions.  My visit amounted to nothing for I could not prevail on her to be examined.  Sometimes she would give me no answer at all. Her son tried to persuade her, but she was incomprehensible.  She is either fool or worse.

Letter 193
Tuesday we came to the head of the rail road & staid at Littles, a pretty good home.  Mr. Harrison Jr put up a good dinner for us & we did well on the road.  At Broad River we took a boat & fortunately it was a good day or we should have fared badly.  The boat was open & the stream full of shoals and dangers.  I am sure I shall never go down the river again much less up it.  I met Ransom Calhoun at the River coming up.  He came into the cars to tell me how bad the passage over would be.  The day before he started on the boat coming up, got out & walked eight miles, & reached the Bridge three hours before the boat, but the cars had gone before he reached the Bridge, & he had to stay behind.

	Anna wrote you last night.  I saw the letter on my desk & thought it was to me, & broke it open, but discovered my sins late & resealed it without reading.  She seems very well satisfied here & Janney tells me that he will not charge a cent if she stays all the Session.  He has a little daughter about her size,  & they have taken Anna into their room.  I have not seen or heard anything of Taylor or Mrs. Taylor.  I met Col. Hayne yesterday & he seemed very cordial.  His election is exciting some interest.  I suppose he will be elected.  My friends & acquaintances were all glad to see me & gave me a very cordial greeting.  I have received from Dyson three Hundred dollars by Dr. Campbell.  When I get the fee from Gladden I will send you a check to pay Dr. Irvine if he is at home.  When I have the money I like to pay my bills at once & be done with it.

	Nothing has been done in the Legislature before my arrival.  I took a part in the first debate that occurred yesterday on a contested election.  I think Judge Evans will be elected U. States Senator & Manning Governor.  There are about twenty candidates for Senator.  

	Mrs. Brooks & her daughter are at the House, & will remain here till after the commencement Ball.  The clock is now striking five, almost an hour yet till day.  Anna recd your letter last night only. It  ought to have been here the night before.  There is great irregularity in the mails.  I was glad to hear you were all well & doing well.  I hope to hear from you every day.  It is now raining very hard. & has been for the last forty hours.  I am afraid we shall have a terrible freshet again.  If the rains here have been as heavy in the upper country we certainly shall.  Reuben & Charles must see to the cows & especially the one General Thompson gave me.  I hope the horses are not injured by the trip.  Write me all about everything.  Tell the children to behave well & I will give them a present on my return, but nothing if they do not.

	I must now close my letter & write to others.  Sam Townes is sick.  Duncan, Morgan & McBee are all well.  McBee seemed glad to see me & appears very cordial.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am again writing to you before day.  I received your letters of Wednesday & Thursday last night after my return from the Board of Trustees.  I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  The mails are now so irregular that there is no certainty of hearing from each other.  For several days past the mails did not reach by the boot thethe end of the Rail Road.  Yesterday the cars ran off & the passengers came back.

	Anna is behaving remarkably well & is as fine a little [girl] as ever.  She stays with Janneys little daughter & amuses herself by going into the drawing room & listening to the Piano, helping about the house where Mrs. Janney is and riding out notwithstanding the bad weather.  It has been raining excessively since we have been here.  I have not even thought of Annas going to Charleston.  I wish her to stay a day or two after the weather breaks off & se the Town, state House, Mrs. Taylor &c.  She comes up to see me every morning after breakfast & then again after I return from the State House.  I have not seen here since receiving your two last letters.  I read to her your first letter & it affected her to tears.  She seems to have a good heart & an affectionate disposition.  I will not begin to enquire about sending her to Town [Charleston].

	Col. Isaac Hayne was elected attorney general yesterday by three votes.  I voted for him & so did [Perry Emory] Duncan, [William Pinckney] McBee & [Nathaniel] Morgan.  Brockman voted for neither.  Hayne spoke to Burt about my vote & Burt told him that I was a magnanimous fellow & would no doubt vote for him.  The contest excited great feeling I think. [Richard] DeTreville behaved badly in the canvas.  He offered to Duncan if he would vote for him to give him two votes for Jones.  Duncan informed him that he took no interest in Jones election.  I am afraid Jones will be elected by his usual duplicity & polarizing.

	Nothing of consequence has yet been done in the Legislature.  The election of U, States Senator takes place on Monday.  I think Judge Evans will be elected if he consents to run.  I am to see him this morning on that subject.  General Adams spoke to me yesterday about the governors election.  He seemed very cordial.    In fact all of my old friends & acquaintances have met me most cordially & paid me great respect.  Governor Means last night came up & walked back with me from the college.  My broken arm has excited a good deal of sympathy.  Col. Watts told me he expected I was like General Shields, who carried his arms in a sling & as a lady said in Columbia to excite sympathy.  I replied that my wound was very different from General Shields.  It originated in my awkwardness & Shields in patriotism & glory.

	I made a very judicious purchase of law books yesterday for Spartan D. Goodlett, who sent me $50.00 for that purpose.  I have bought nothing for myself except a new hat which I had made after measuring my head.

	You had better send for the corn which has& have her fed well at home, or she will get so poor that she will give no milk.  Make Reuben attend to the horses & cows well.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	Mr. Keith goes up in the morning & offers to take my letters.

	I went to the Episcopal Church today & heard a good sermon from Mr. [Peter] Shand.  Anna went to the Roman Catholic with Janneys little daughter.  She was greatly pleased with the ceremonies.  I did not see Mrs. Taylor in church.  I saw but did not speak to Col Taylor.  I went with Mr. Petigru & Col. Alston & sat very much in front of him, but he went out of the House & I did not see him again.

	Trimmier of Spartanburgh & his wife & sister in law are at the House, & going to Charleston Tuesday next.  Mrs. Trimmier who seems awoman just married said she would take charge of Anna inher to Town [Charleston].  I think I shall send her down in that way.  She is enjoying herself very much.  

	This morning after breakfast I found you Friday letter on the center table.  I was truly glad to hear from you and felt sorry when I thought you would not probably hear from me before this morning.

	I was sorry to hear John was sick & hope he is out by this time.  I was glad to hear of the return of our stock & that you were in beef by the return.

 	The Townes, Campbell, & John Jones & Gossett have all come from Greenville.  John Jones tells me Mrs. Thompson is up yet.

	Write me often & tell me all the news of Greenville.  Col. Augustus Townes is wishing to address Miss Garlington it is said.  I am glad Hillhouse is going to be moved.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter this morning & will not write you again, though I do not know when you will receive either of those letters.  The mails are all irregular& no doubt you began to think hard of my neglect.  Before you received my first letter.  I hope to hear from you again tonight but I do not know how.

	The cars below here ran off last night & killed Col. Richard Singleton & his grandson Van Buren, crip[p]led a great many other passengers & did other mischief.  This is a most horrible accident.  The rail road or culvert gave way, & cars, passengers & engines were all mashed up together!

	Anna & little Ellen Janney have just been in my room.  She seems very well satisfied but expresses a wish to go on to Charleston.  The weather & uncertain condition of the road here prevented me looking out even for an opportunity to send her.  I will carry her to church tomorrow, & Monday let her see Columbia, & then send her to Charleston.  My time is so much occupied here that I cannot pay any attention to her in the day time.  

	We did nothing in the Legislature today, but elect solicitors commissions &c.  Jones was elected treasurer.  No one of any consequence was a candidate.  DawkinsBonham were reelected solicitors.    

	The weather is now cold & likely to continue so.    Mr. Keith speaks of starting on Monday.  He is to call for the Greenville delegation tonight & give us an oyster supper.

	Anna took your letter this morning & read it & returned it to me this evening.  She says that she has written to you today.

	Col. Beaufort Watts asked me yesterday if Williams & Dyson had paid me $1,000 for a fee in the case of Scurry.  He said William promised him to do so.  I told him Dyson had paid me $500. & perhaps Williams might yet add $500 more.  The Col. expressed a great hope that he would.

	I have not heard or seen anything of Gladden & I shall draw on Hill for the $100 if not paid shortly.  Col. Brockman said he had the money to pay his note but he begged me to wait till holiday in January.

	I will now close this letter & write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter written on Sunday & was truly sorry that you had not heard from Anna & myself since we arrived here.  I have written you a good many letters & Anna has written two or three.  But I was apprehensive that my letters had not gone.  The greatest irregularity exists in the mails.

	Anna was to have gone to Charleston this morning but Mr. Trimmier postponed going till tomorrow.  This I am glad of, as it will enable Anna to go & see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.  General Martin saw me in the streets yesterday & got out of his carriage to ask me to let Anna stay with him.  He had just heard of her being in Columbia.  Mrs. Martin called to see Anna yesterday but she was out.  On her  She stated that she had called to carry Anna home with him.  They are keeping house.  Today I will carry Anna around there & let her go & see Mrs. Taylor.  Anna is delighted with Columbia.  She has been to see the Lunatic Asylum, Hamptons House, the governor &c.  She went this round with Mrs. Brooks & Mrs. Trimmier and Col. Jno. D. Williams family.	

	I was amused the other evening at Annas observation in the drawing room.  There is a courting scrape going on here between two little creaturesMiss  & our little  Dinkins.  Anna & Janneys little daughter were peeping & saw them kiss, saw her slap his face & heard him make some very impertinent remarks.  She told the whole scene & wished to know if that was not very near courting.  I told her I thought it was very near.

	I bought Anna a beautiful medallion for $7.00.  She was very anxious for one as some other little girls had them.  It is intended for a miniature.

	I am very much engaged here & have scarcely a minute to spare.  I am now writing before day.  In fact it is the only time I have to write.  Whilst I am dressing Brockman & someone is in my room till breakfast.  I am engaged on law matters till twelve oclock.  Then I am in the Legislature till near night.  After supper I am at the college till eleven oclock.  Last night I did not go to bed till one oclock.  I was in company with Mr. Petigru & Col. Aldrich. 

	Mr. [William Ford] DeSaussure was elected U. States Senator till March yesterday.  Judge [Josiah James] Evans will be elected today for six years.  Cols. Calhoun & Carew of the Senate spoke to Brockman yesterday to feel me about running for Governor in opposition to Col. Manning.  Mr. Middleton of the House came to me about the same time and said he had been requested by some of his friends to enquire of me if I would have the office if elected.  They said the secessionists were all going to vote for me.  I said to Middleton it was an office not to be referred to as sought for but that I did not wish to be voted for.  He said Manning had no pretensions to the office except his property.

	In the Board of Trustees last night we had an interesting discussion in which Mr. Barnwell, Judge ONeall, Col. Manning , Mr. Petigru, Mr. DeSaussure & myself took a part.  There is likely to be a serious rebellion in the college.  One hundred of the students have signed a pledge to quit unless the stewards hall is dissolved.  We meet again tonight.  

	I am glad to hear John is out again & that you are all well.  I must now conclude my letter & dress.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from seeing Anna start to Charleston.  She went off in good spirits with Mrs. Trimmier & Tolleson of Spartanburgh & their families.  She was greatly pleased with Columbia & said she was willing to stay here longer.  Yesterday Judge Butler & myself started with her to see Mrs. Martin & fell in company with Mr. Robert Barnwell, Col. Preston & Col. Hampton & whilst delayed in our walk, we met General Martin & his wife, and they took possession of Anna.  She staid with them till night.  Mrs. Martin told me that Mrs. Hayne was expecting her to stay all the winter in Charleston.  She will have two weeks to stay before I start home.  I gave her $28.50cts & told her if she wanted more money to write me.  I would have given her more, but had nothing but four hundred dollar bills left.  Gladden has not paid me nor Col. Brockman.

	Yesterday evening whilst in the drawing room, a servant told me that there was a gentleman down below in a carriage who wished to see me.  I went down & found Governor [David Lowry] Swain of North Carolina, now President of the North Carolina University, & an old school mate of mine.  He said he had come by Columbia on purpose to see me & was about being turned off for the want of a room.  I told him to get out & Iboth my room & bed with him.  He did stop & we spent the evening very pleasantly.  I introduced him to Judges Butler, Wardlaw & Withers, Col. Manning & others.  Professor Brumby was an old acquaintance & I sent for him.  Towards eleven oclock Mr.  got a bed & room for him, & we did not sleep together.  We had not seen each other for thirty years.  He said he remembered mywell, but that I was much fuller & stouter.  He left this morning.  I introduced Anna to him.  He enquired after my family & told about his.  Professor Brumby begged that Anna might go & stay with his little daughters.

	We had several ballotings for U.S. Senator yesterday.  Judge Evans is ahead & will be elected today.  He said he had nothing to do with it, and that I had the entire control of his name to run him or withdraw him when I pleased.  This is what his son told Dr. Zimmerman.  Pickens, Chesnut, McGrath, & Preston were all run.  The secessionists still speak of running me for governor.  We are doing very little in the Legislature.  Today we shall have some discussion on the Electoral Bill.  I may make a speech.

       I recd your letter last night & am thankful that you write me every day.  I hope to hear tonight that you have recd all of my letters.  You had perhaps better purchase some hogs to kill.  Consult Mr. Hoke about it.    Though it is rather warm just now, I will send the money if needed.
       
       Give my love to all the children.  Write me about them.  I have no time to write & must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night dated Dec. 1st and was surprised you did not mention Mr. Keith.  I wrote by him & he promised to call & see you & deliver my letter to the Patriot & am afraid that he has neglected to deliver that also.

	Yesterday I made a speech on the Basis of Representation, whilst this Bill for the division of Pendleton was under discussion which has now for me some honor.  Dr. Broyles told me it was the best speech he had ever heard.  There was a crowded House.  The Senate had just adjourned, & the Senators came in to hear me.  Mr. [William R.] Tabor the editor of the Charleston Mercury told me at dinner that he was very much pleased with my speech & had listened to it with great interest.  The Reporter of the Charleston Courier came to me for a copy of it & I have written it out for him.  I think the speech will be read with interest & gives the people some valuable information in regard to basis of representation.

	We have had a good deal of discussion in the Board of Trustees & I have generally taken an active part.  The question before the Board is a rebellion of the Students on account of the Commons.  Mr. Barnwell & Mr. Thornwell made capital speeches on the subject.   

	The electoral Bill has been postponed till Tuesday next.  I may speak on that question.

	My name is mentioned in speaking of candidates for Judge., but it is too soon to expect that position after our political excitement.  The secessionists still talk of voting for me for Governor & Manning is a little uneasy about it.

	I saw Mr. Carter the book seller in Charleston yesterday.  He told me that I ought to expect some high appointment from {Franklin] Pierce.  That whilst at the North last summer he heard a friend of Pierces speak of me & said that Pierce himself had frequently done so & valued my character.  He took down my name in full to President Pierce.  

	I hope to hear from Anna tonight.   Mrs. Brooks & her daughters are still here.  There are now a good many ladies coming in to be at the Commencement ball.

	Mr.  spoke to me last night & made himself known.  He enquired after your mother, you & sisters & children.  He seems a very excellent man, said he was with me in politics & always had been.   

	Mr. Miller of Georgia & President of the Senate of Georgia was introduced to me yesterday & said he took great pleasure in reading my Paper & was a subscriber to it.  He got me to present his petition for the city council of Augusta about the bridge to the Legislature.

	Tom Butler was not elected to carry the votes to Washington.  A young man from Spartanburgh named Edwards now in college was elected.

	I am sorry you worry yourself about the servants.  Take everything cooly & dont expect them to do well.  We have good servants at this house.  I make my fire before day because it is no trouble, and a pine drys in my room & may kindle instantly.

       My friend G.M. Thompson the Boot and shoe merchant made me a present the other day of a superb pair of boots worth ten dollars.  This was clever in him.  I paid him the Bill for negro shoes thirty dollars.  I have also paid Lyons & sons the money collected for them of Kilgore amounting to $64.00.  I am now left with $300.00& $100 due me from Gladden.
       
       We had quite an accession yesterday from Greenville.  Sam Mauldin, Joab Mauldin, Dr. Pasley &
Hasan [Hamlin] Beattie.  It is rumored that Sam Mauldin is crazy & attempted to kill himself.  Sam Townes & Frank Townes will leave here this morning.

	I must now dress & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  I wish to see you all very much.  Anna was a great comfort to me whilst she remained here.  It is a great thing always to have someone near you when from home who is dear to you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just sat down to write you a letter.

	Your letter & Annas have just come to hand, and another one from Anna to me.  I have been engaged in the Legislature late tonight, & at the supper table got into conversation with Mr. Petigru & Col. Chesnut & sat a long time after anyone else had realized.  The house is full of ladies, & the table is crowded with them.  They are dancing & promenading & almost seen over me at every turn I make to get through the crowd.  There is not one of them as pretty as my wife & so you need not be jealous of me.

	There is a young lady here from Georgia a Miss Baxter, daughter of Judge Baxter, who is said to be talented & is bold & good looking.  Col. Keith has been wishing to introduce me to her.  I heard a good story in reference to her.  She dresses in the extreme of fashionable dress & open bosom &c.  Dr. Bailey a member of the Legislature was a competitor in the boat race in Charleston & beaten by a boat called Becky Sharp from Georgia.  This he disliked very much.  He was looking at Miss Baxter dancing the other evening & enquired who she was.  Hearing that she was from Georgia, he exclaimed another Becky Sharp.  The expression was told to Miss Baxter & no doubt pleased her very much.

	I liked your last letter very much and hope you will always write me such.  I do not care to be praised in your letters, but I like expressions of your love for me.  I hate scalding & reprising.  I wish you were here with me most sincerely.  There are some pleasant ladies.  Mrs. Chesnut is not one of them.

	I saw & spoke to Mrs. Elford & Miss Crayton this morning.  Joab Mauldin & Miss Crayton are gone to his wedding.  He is married tomorrow.  Mrs. Elford will go to Town [Charleston] in the morning.

	Mr. Beattie & Mr. Cox are here.  Greenville has been pretty strongly represented this winter at this House.  Mrs. Brooks leaves here in the morning.  Dr. Pasley goes up to Greenville & I expect him to carry this letter.

	In the Legislature not much done.  General Harrison told me this morning that everyone said my speech on the division of Pendleton was the speech of the session.

	Col. Glover has been elected Judge. He beat Col. D.  We have some thought of running Elford for Glovers place.

	My speech is published this morning at length in the Carolinian.  Anna writes me for $10 more of money.

	I must conclude & will write you tomorrow.  All well, yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your scalding letter last night.  It is anythingpleasant to receive letters repining & grumbling from ones wife.  I wrote you all the complimentary notices & remarks made by gentlemen about me, and therefore instead of being gratified & pleased with them, & loving me the more for them you burst forth in a passion because I cannot be what some of my friends would desire to see me.  This is poor consolation to me.  For God sake my dear wife divest yourself of this disposition & habit.   It makes both you and myself unpleasant.  Look on the bright side of the picture & not the dark.  It is just as easy & far more consoling.  I did not write to you to create the belief that it was possible I could be elected either governor or Judge at this time but to show you that there were members of the Legislature who thought of me for those high offices.

	My speech made the other day on the basis of representation & the division of Pendleton has been very highly complimented.  [Nathaniel] Morgan came to me & said that whilst listening to the speech & seeing the effect it was producing. [he] could but feel proud of me as a colleague & that he too was from Greenville.  He said that if the people of Greenville could have been there to have heard it, they would never have thought of opposing me again.  McBee also complimented the speech.  Augustus Townes told me that he spoke of my speech in a crowd of gentlemen & they all commented in high encomiums on it & me.  The speech will be published.  Col. Glover asked me for a copy of my notes of the speech.  They all say it embodied information which was new to them.

	The Electoral Bill was postponed yesterday till Tuesday.  The Bank Bill was discussed & I took a part in the discussion.  

	Another terrible accident happened on the Charleston rail road.  The two night trains met & broke everything to pieces.  One man was killed & a great many injured & crippled.  The cars did not reach here till four oclock last night.  I have not yet heard from Anna.  Perhaps I may when the mail is opened.  There was no accident on the train the day she went down.  

	The ladies are crowding in here from all parts of the state for the commencement Ball.  Janneys house is full of them.  I wish you were here.  Next winter I will engage a room for us & you shall stay all the session.  Hext by that time will be out of the way.

       Dr. Keith of Orangeburgh & Mr. Dantzler his cousin [Olin Miller] Dantzler a member of the Legislature went off the other day to fight a duel in North Carolina.  It is said that Judge Butler has had them arrested as he passed through Charleston.  
       
       Col. Brockman has just been in today to pay me his morning visit & says Sam Mauldin is in a very bad way, & wishes to destroy himself, tried to jump out of the cars as he came down.  They keep a constant watch over him.  Joab is on his way to Darlington to get married.
       
       I must now conclude my letter.  Last night I felt worn out & exhausted by the loss of sleep & went to bed early.  I could not attend the meeting of the board of Trustees last night.  This morning I feel pretty well.  My arm & hand are improving.  I am beginning to use the hand a little & this morning was able to button my shirt sleeves for the first time.
       
       I am very much pleased with Janneys Hotel.  It is far superior to Maybins.
       
       Tell Willie I should like for him to be here next Fall to enter college.  Ham[lin] Beattie is here for that purpose.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
           
P.S. In regard to Susan & McBee I have nothing to say.  I am sorry to ever hear them mentioned.  Morgan had a long talk with me about them the other morning.  He said Luther made a pretty good story on his side of the question.  Therefore I told him of his conduct which shocked Morgan very much.  Yours &c, B.F.P.

My dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning & it gave me great pleasure to hear that you had safely arrived in Charleston.  There have been so many Rail Road accidents lately that I was uneasy last night when I did not hear from you.

	I was glad to hear that all of you aunt Elizas family were well & that you had been out visiting your aunt Hayne & the Coles.  You must give my love to all of them.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last evening.  They were all well.  She professes great anxiety about you & your good behaviour.

	I will deliver your message to Miss Janney when I return to the Hotel.  I am now in the House of Representatives.  The cars did not reach Columbia till four oclock this morning.  This was the reason I did not receive your letter last evening. We have a house full of young ladies at Janneys.  They have come from all parts of the state to attend the commencement Ball.  Some ten or twelve are in a room next to me, & this morning they made so much noise & such bursts of laughter & screams that I could not sleep. I thought they must be crazy.  I am sure you would not behave so reckless.

	I have just written a letter to your mother, but since receiving yours, will write her again & enclose yours to me.  

	In regard to your returning to Columbia exercise your own pleasure.  I shall be glad to see you here as soon as you get through with your visits.  It would perhaps be well enough to avail yourself of Mr. Trimmiers returning to Columbia.  I wish you were here now.  You would enjoy yourself more than you did last week.  
	  
	I am glad to hear you speak of practicing.  It is well enough to unite study & pleasure.  

	If you wish any more money, write to me and I will send it to you.  Your mother wishes you to get a cloak, comb &c.

	I must now conclude, your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I went to church this morning & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Thornwell.  It was late when I reached the Chapel & it was crowded.  Governor Means saw me without a seat & beckoned me on the platform & I sat by the side of him.  This politeness on the part of his Excellency I appreciated.

	The Hotel is running over with Ladies.  I never saw such a crowd of young ladies in the market.  They seem to show by their freedom of swooning that they are anxious to be courted & are here for that purpose.  I think it would make them happier than theynow are to be married.  But how long their happiness would continue is doubtful.

	Tomorrow is commencement and after that event we shall begin to be more quiet.  The ladies will begin to depart.  I wrote a long letter today for the Patriot & which you will see.

	Poor [Samuel] Mauldin was today placed in the Asylum.  He remonstrated most earnestly against the act.  It was, says Mr. Duncan, the most trying act of his life to leave him in the Asylum.  He begged & plead[ed] not to be left there.  It is a melancholly thing.  I drew up his papers last night for his restraint.  He had become dangerous to himself.  He is an opium eater & nothing but opium will appease his mind & nerves.

	Amongst the persons here are Leitners & Bobos daughters.  Miss Leitner enquired after you & Willie this morning.  I met a Miss Bobo who said she was at school at Greenville when we were married & attended a party at Mr. Crofts give[n] to us.  Col. Perrin & his daughters are here.  My friend McLure of Chester & his daughters.

	There was duel fought Friday between Dr. Keith & Mr. [Olin Miller] Dantzler of the House.  The former was shot in the arm.  He is here & walks about with his arm in a sling.  Dantzler was untouched.

	I met the reporter of the House this evening who is an Irishman.  He had been reporter for Congress and said that he had seldom heard such a speech as mine on the floor of Congress.  He said he had heard of my reputation as a debater but that I had far surpassed his expectations.

	This morning I shaved with my left hand.  This is a decided improvement in my arm.  

	I recd your letter dated Friday morning last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  
	
	I will write you after the commencement is over.  We have agreed to adjourn on Wednesday the 15th inst.  I will write you about sending the horses & carriage in time.

	Nothing yet has been done in the Legislature.  My speech will not make its appearance till Tuesday morning.  It is very long.  B.F. Perry

Letter 204
7 December 1852
House of Representatives, [Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I rece[i]ved your letter written Sunday this morning.  The Mails could not be opened last night in time to get our letters & was scolded by the Barkeeper.  

	I wrote you everything I knew or had heard of to Sunday evening.  I went to the Commencement in the College & was pleased with the performance of the young men.  P.E. Griffin of Society Hill delivered a very fine Poem representing a conversation between Sir William Wallace & Bruce.  In speaking the part of Bruce he addressed me so personally as to attract the whole College.  Governor Means said that Griffin had made me the Sir William Wallace of his Poem.  The first part of his address  spoken by Bruce was very much like some of the abuse heaped on me by the Secessionists, ambition, traitor &c. &c.  But at the close of the Poem finding out the real sentiments of Wallace, Bruce says to him, now I acknowledge you as a Patriot pure & devoted to your country.

	There was a very large concourse of persons in the College & a vast number of young ladies all wishing to look interesting & desirous of attracting the notice of the young of the other sex. Whilst I was standing on the Platform or Stage near the crowd as they were going out of the College, I saw Mers. Hodge & Thompsom & spoke to themdirectly after words a lady came by & spoke to me, said she supposed I had forgotten her, said that she was Mrs. Barclay, introduced me to her daughter, said she had been at my house, knew you & the children, & enquired most kindly after you.  I had no remembrance of her at all.  She got separated from her company whilst speaking to me & I walked home with her & her daughter.  But still I did not find out who she was.  Col. Garlington says he supposes she is the widow of Barclay the painter of portraits.  I am sorry I did [not] recognize her.  She was quite intelligent & seemed pleasant.     
  
       Last night the Ball came off at& the college boys behaved badly & the young ladies refused to go back to the dancing room after the supper.  The Boy Henry who waits on me said the College Boys got drunk & yelled & screamed.  
       
       I am glad you have heard from Anna & am very willing she should remain in [Charleston] Town as long as her friends desire her. But from her letter to me I think it likely her friends have not been very pressing in their solicitations for her to stay with them.
       
       I had a note this morning  from Miss S requesting me  to carry a bundle to Mrs. Arthus which she sent.
       
       I am glad you are getting on better with the servants & hope you will begin to look on the bright side of everything in stead of the reverse.  Our happiness is in our own hands, & if we makeu up our minds to fret & worry & opine at anything that does not go at as we would wish, we shall always be unhappyon the contrary if we look at the real  pleasures & comforts that we have we shall be satisfied & happy.  Instead of repining for honors & pleasures & property we cannot acquire, let us enjoy & appreciate those that we have, and thousands & hundreds of thousands as good as ourselves have not & never can obtain.  I believe the happiness of every individual is in his own hands.  If he wills to be happy he may be and if he desires always to look as the dark side of the picture & consider only his misfortunes  he will most certainly be unhappy, whether President of the United States or a king on his throne or a peasant in the woods or a member of the Legislature from Greenville with as good a wife & as fine children as I have.

	I am writing to you amidst the confusion of the House & have not time to read over & correct it.

	I shall be glad to see Elford this evening.  Poor Mauldin attempted to beat his brains out in the Asylum after being left there.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Glover clerk of the House will be elected Judge in the morning over Col. Dawkins & Col., Fair. 

P.S.  Mr. & Mrs. Efford and Miss Crayton have just arrived & I think you for the letter & will write you tomorrow again.

My dear Anna

	I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, and to hear that you were well and enjoying yourself amongst your kind relations.

	I received a letter also last night from your Mother.  They were all well & she sent me your letter to her.  I had sent her your first letter to me.  Also you see how much we value your letters.  

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here going down to Charleston.  They have letters for you & Mrs. Elford will call & see you.

	Enclosed I send you ten dollars which you desire.

	Mr. Janneys little daughters enquire a great deal about you. & say I must write for you to come back.  They are anxious to have you with them again.  One of them said she was going to write to you.

	I have to write several letters this morning & must conclude this.  In regard to your coming up with Mrs. Trimmier you can do as you please.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this morning at my seat in the House of Representatives.

	Your letter last evening enclosing one from your Aunt Hayne was rece[ive]d last night after my return from the State House.  I was glad to hear from you & your punctuality as a correspondent lays me under great obligations to you.  If I had time I would write you more of a statement & love in my letters but I am so much pressed by business that I have no time for indulging in such feelings.  My letters to you all seem matters of fact epistles & will be amazing to our descendants one hundred years hence.  I was sorry that you did not hear from me the day you wrote me.  But your goodness and love have contributed to the right course whenever you do not hear from me.  The mails are very irregular& I really have not time to write.  I find that at Mr. Janneys I am compelled to spend more of my time in conversation and company than I did at Maybins.  There is more society there& it would be rude not to participate.  There are more persons too to see me than [I am] used to.

	I made a speech the other night on the Charleston Institute & on appreciation for the same.  Mr. Tupper came to me the next morning and said if the Institute awarded premiums for eloquence they would most assuredly bestow on me the first premium for that high gift for my speech.

	I read your Bill of groceries to Brockman & Elford & they both said it was impossible for our familyon that amount of Sugar, and that our servants must steal it.  Elford told me as to the quantity he used & said it would be no doubt be twice as much if he did not keep it locked up.  I am afraid our servants do steal the sugar.  Brockman said it was a pretty good bill for a grocery store.  I reduced the quantity of sugar considerably butall the other articles.

	Elford leaves here tomorrow.  Mrs. Elford went on the other day with Mr. Cox & some Baptist preachers to Charleston.  I Am willing fore Anna to stay & come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.  Mr. & Mrs. Trimmier have returned.  I rece[ive]d a long letter from Anna this morning.  She is very much pleased with Charleston & seems to enjoy herself very much.  I am very much grattified to know that Anna has drawn forth the good opinion of her friends in Charleston.  She is a very sensible & most affectionate little girlfar superior to the ordinary girls of her age.    She too a happy cheerful disposition which is a great thing for anyone.  It makes life pleasant & add to the happiness of others.

	Mr. Beattie will leave in the morning & if anything occurs I will write you tonight by him.  The Legislature has gone down to the college at this time to witness the laying of the new cornerstone of the chapel & will be back in a few minutes.  President Thornwell delivers an address in the House of Rep[resentative]s this morning & the ladies are now assembling.  I must conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 206
Friday night, [10 December 1852]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, and will now add a few lines more.  Mr. Butler leaves in the morning & will carry my letters.

	After writing to you this morning, President Thornwell delivered a most eloquent address at the laying of the cornerstone of the new Chapel before both Houses.  I introduced a resolution to publish it.

	We have elected H[osea] J[efferson] Dean of Spartanburgh the clerk of the House in the place of  Col. [Thomas Worth] Glover.  I claim some credit for having elected him.  He got no votes but Greenville & Spartanburgh the first ballot.  He fell a long ways behind & we still voted for him.

 	Nothing has been done in the Legislature this day, but ballot for clerk.  The weather is very bad & raining very hard.  Mrs. Brooks & her daughter left yesterday & went thirteen miles & had to return.  They left this morning & the day has not been much better.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne this evening.  He told me that he saw Anna last Sunday & she was enjoying herself very much.  He went down on Saturday & returned Monday.  

	Mr. Duncan has promised to carry me up in his carriage.  It will leave home Wednesday morning & stay at B.F. Mauldins or Ackers that night & the next morning get to the rail road by twelve oclock.  We expect to reach Donalds in Abbeville Thursday about that time & then come to Col. Wares that night.  You may expect us home Friday evening.  Anna can stay in Charleston & come up with Mrs. Elford.  This is my present arrangement.  This will prevent the necessity of sending Reuben & the carriage after me.  Instead of coming through Laurens we shall go up by Cokesbury in Abbeville to Donalds the head of the road.  

	In connection with the rail road, let me tell you that Col. Brown the Engineer died having made use of $8,000 of the Rail Road money.  This accounts for the style in which he & his wife lived.  How few persons are perfectly honest!

	I must now conclude, B.F. Perry

Letter 207

Columbia

My dear Liz

	Your letter of Thursday was not rece[ive]d till this morning.  Last night we were sitting in the House of Rep[resentatives] till midnight fighting over the Bank of the State.   I made a speech of some length & it was very highly complimented.  I think it was about one of my best speeches.  The House was greatly crowded & they listened with much attention.  Col., [Benjamin Faneuil] Hunt & myself had several passages ofin debate.  He was very rude & wrong in his statements & my victory over him was complete.  The speaker had to reprove him & this morning he called me up to his chair & said that his remarks were intended for Hunt & not for me as he stated to the House.  He further said that if the Speaker ever reproved Major Perry for a want of courtesy or dignity in the House or in debate he would go very far out of his way.

	I do not know whether I mentioned last night that Dean of Spartanburgh was elected Clerk of the House. I wrote you two letters by Mr. Beatty [Beattie] last night which I suppose you will get Sunday morning.  I am now writing in the House & interrupted every moment by business or Members coming to my seat to consult me & transact business.  

	As you like to hear what is said about me I will tell you what several members have said, who are now serving for the first term.  Dr. [Allard Belin] Flagg told Brockman that he was never more surprised in a man in his lifethat I was just the opposite in everything that he had heard about me.  McKay of Georgetown said he expected to see a fierce warbut that he had found me civil, courteous & dignified & was greatly pleased with me.

	I recd a letter last night from Anna.  She says she will stay & come up with Elford & his wife.  She writes me that she is enjoying herself very much & wishes me to come down & see her before I return home.  But this I shall not be able to do.

	I am glad to hear you are all well.  I think Easl[e]ys wife will have trouble enough unless he is more amiable to her than the rest of mankind.  I am glad to hear that Willie & Frank are employed in such athletic exercise as cutting wood.  I wish them to have good constitutions & would be unwilling to see them spend one year on a farm, working and studying alternately.  

	I hope our servants will now do well & am glad you continue pleased with Becky.

	I am very anxious to meet you all again & will leave here most joyously next Thursday.  Imy wife & children better than fame or honors or country or anything else on this earth & had & had rather be with them.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Letter 208
12 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d this morning your letter written on Friday & am sorry you did not hear from me that day.  I wrote you by John Jones and he ought to have arrived there Friday morning.

	The Legislature sits every night till eleven or twelve oclock & I do not get your letters till the next morning.  The Greenville mail is not opened till about nine oclock & that is after Janney sends to the Post office.

	I have written you so often lately that I have nothing to write this morning except that there is  proposition to adjourn on Friday next instead of Wednesday  which I expect will be concurred in by the Senate.  The House have found it absolutely necessary to protract the session two days in order to get through with the business of the country.

	A large box came to Maybins Hotel for me yesterday by the rail road from Charleston.  I suppose it is from your aunt Eliza.  But how I shall get it up is doubtful.

	You directed me to buy some dye for my whiskers.  This I have done, & this morning I applied it.  The whiskers are as black as a crow.  The application will remain for one month, & then the whiskers must be dyed again.  

	This is Sunday morning & I believe I shall not go to church but remain at home & write for the Patriot.  I hope you have received the two letters I sent you by Beatty.

	I recd a letter yesterday from General Thompson.  He said nothing about his family or wife.  I supposed she would have presented him with an infant before this time.

	My old friend F has invited the Greenville delegation to dine with him today.  But I dislike to go out at all.

	I begin to feel homesick & am willing to adjourn at any time.  A little absence from you and the children is pleasant, because it affords so much pleasure in returning.  But after two weeks the time drags heavily.

	I will either come up with Duncan or in the stage.  You need not therefore think of sending the carriage & horses for me.  It is probable we shall not adjourn before Friday.   So you may expect to see me next Sunday perhaps in the morning in the stage.

	Give my love to all of the children & tell them how anxious I am to see them.  Dont Hext begin to talk yet.  I am afraid he will forget me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	I was glad to hear from you last evening & to hear that you & all of your friends in Charleston were well.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mama yesterday & they were all well.  She wrote a great deal about you & said she was affected to tears, on reading your aunt Elizas letter giving an account of you.

	It will not be in my power to go to Charleston before I return home.  I suppose the Legislature will adjourn Wednesday, though we may sit till Friday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford will take charge of you and bring you home.  If you want any more money write to me & I will send it to you, or Mr. Elford will let you have it.

	Mr. Trimmier & his family passed through here the other day.  I did not see any of the ladies as they went to another Hotel.  Mr, Janneys House was full.

	The Governor is inaugurated today & there will be a large concourse of ladies & gentlemen to hear his speech.  I wish you were here to witness the ceremonies & see the crowd.

	I have not got the key of the carpet bag.  I left it at home.

	You must remember me to all your friends in Charleston & say to them that I should be very glad to see them.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

The State House

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line now, for I am afraid I shall not be able to do so tonight.  But I am writing amidst the confusion of the House.

	The Governor Elect [John L. Manning] has just been inaugurated & I have been to see him & take a glass of champaign.  He said to me that he should look to me as one of the counsellors & advisors of his administration & one of the most important.  Governor Means said to me that I now would not notice him, but paid all my attention to the Governor elect.  I replied that it was proper to pay first my respects to the rising sun.  He interrupted me by saying that he hoped I would not forget the setting sun.  I assured him that was no danger of that.

	Col. Brooks came to me just now & said I was the most remarkable man in South Carolina.  That I was the more abused & traduced than anyone in the State, and yet I had more influence in the House of representatives than anyone else and commanded more the attention of the members than anyone in the House.  He said the Edgefield delegation were particularly influenced by my speeches & votes.  That Mr. [Wiley] Harrison of that district who was a very hot secessionist said he wished his name commenced with a P and mine with, so that I would have to vote before him& he might know how to vote, as he always wished to vote as I did.

	I recd last night a letter from [John] Livingston of New York enclosing the proof sheets of my Biography.  He says the likeness will be sent me in a few days.  The sketch makes sixteen pages & reads pretty well.  With a good likeness I hope the Biography will be creditable to me, & I feel under obligation to General Thompson for the sketch.

	I recd last night a letter from Anna.  She seems well pleased & happysays she had no idea you & I would value her letters so much as we have done.  I wrote to her this morning & said she must come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  It is yet doubtful whether we adjourn on Wednesday or Friday.  

	Tell Willie that Anderson who is in college enquired when he would be in college, last night & young Buist returned home from college this morning.

	I will now close my letter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	Last night I made a speech to the largest town meeting ever held in Columbia on popular Education & was most raptu[r]ously applauded.  I spoke for an hour.  Professor Reynolds followed me in a beautiful speech on the same subject.  I have been all day writing it out for publication.  

	I have just stopped to write you a line.  Your letter Saturday evening was read & as usual gave ne great pleasure.  I am truly glad that Tuesday is so near at hand.  I want to see you & the children very much.

	Col. Dawkins came up from Charleston Friday.  He says five sixth of the people there are indignant at Taber.  His coming here in relation to resign & he has done so, He was burnt there in effigy there too.

	I send you a letter which I recd from Dr. Douglass, a Senator from Chester for many years.  It is only a specimen of what I hear hourly every day.  Your affectionate husband, B,F. Perry

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[i]d two letters from you this morning dated last Saturday & Tuesday.  They were here last night, but I can never get my letters now till next morning.

	I thank you again for your punctuality as a correspondent.  One of your letters was a very long onethe other acknowledging the receipt of my letter by John Jones a very short one.  Together they made two pretty good letters.  I am glad Hoke has purchased some pork for you.  I expect you were pretty well out of meat.  It is cheaper to purchase pork than bacon, but I suppose we shall have to do both.  Two thousand & three hundred pounds will not be enough.  

       Your house will no doubt look very neatly with new carpets & sofas &c.  And I only wish I was there now to lounge on the sofa instead of having to trudge through the rain & mud & darkness to the State House, which is a half mile from the Hotel.  I went down there this morning at ten oclock.  We sat till four & adjourned for dinner.  Now we return at six.  I have just dined andsitting in the parlor & am writing my wife.  This is like a good husband.  I am not at all interested in any of the ladies here, not even Becky Sharp, and did not make her acquaintance although Col. Keith & Mr. [William R.] Tabr of the Charleston Mercury both made the proposition to me.  They are all or nearly all gone now, & we are quiet once more.  What a terrible rumpus young ladies in the market kick up at a Hotel when fifty one are all assembled together.  They make more fuss than gentlemen & shout as much as college boys.

	We adjourn positively on Thursday night & leave Friday morning.  You may expect me Saturday evening with Mr. Duncan.  His carriage & horses will go down one day too soon & have to remain at Donalds.  

	I will enclose you all of Annas letters as I have not time to write you any longer.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  You need not write me after receiving this letter as I will be on my way to Greenville.

	I hope you find old Lasly & his girls useful.  Yours truly & affectionately. B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter last night, which gave me great pleasure as all your letters do.  I received one from your mother at the same time requesting me to send to her all of your letters to me.    She says your letters to her are short, but well written.  You see my little daughter both I and your mother value your letters & how much we love you.

	I should be glad to see you before I return home, but I cannot go down to Charleston.  The Legislature adjourns tonight & we all leave here in the morning.  I hope to be at home with your mother, Willie, Frank, Fanny & little Hext Saturday evening and should like to have you in the group or family circle.

	You will come up with Mr. Elford.  I have sent him funds to pay your expenses & to let you have more money should you need it.  

	Enclosed I will send you some stamps to put on your letters as you requested.

	We have bad weather & so much rain that you will not be able to see much of Charleston.  The winter is an unpleasant time to travel or visit.

	I am very much fatigued by our night sessions.  We sit every night till eleven or twelve oclock.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am now in the State House writing to you amidst the confusion & noise of threw members.  Last night I recd a letter from you, but you had recd none from me since writing your previous letter,  I have written you a half dozen letters unacknowledged.

	We had quite an achievement here last night about twelve oclock.  I made a speech on the Blue Ridge rail road, which had a happy effect, & with Mr. Trenholm of Charleston carried that great measure most beautifully.  It is generally conceded that we changed the decision of the House.  I intend to write out my speech on that subject.  We did not adjourn till midnight.  On returning to the Hotel I recd your letter.  There was also a note from Gen. Thompson saying that his wife was delivered of a noble boy & she was doing well, & requesting that I would telegraph the glad tidings to Wilmington, N.C.    The note was written to Mr. Duncan.  I suppose he hardly knew what it was about.

	Your Box is a very large one & I do not know what I shall do with it.  If it gets wet on the stage it might be ruined.  It cannot come up in the carriage.  I must however do the best I can with yourclothing.  I am afraid if Elford & Brockman were to see it they would think of that as they did about the sugar.

	I must now conclude my letter & go into the Senate to electioneer for the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  

	I shall be at home Saturday evening.  Your affectionate husband &c, B.F. Perry

	The Hotel.  5 oclock pm.  I have just taken dinner & will add a line before I go back to the State House.  I had sealed my letter.  Nothing however has happened during the day except I have been very much complimented for my speech last night on the Blue Ridge Rail Road Bill.  General McGowan, Mr. Gourdin, Mr. Trenholm and many others said I spoke very handsomely & carried the House against the previous& judgement.  The President of the George Town Bank said, that Mr. [Charles Alexander] Thornwell, a member of the Legislature, & brother of the President of the college, pointed to me today & said that whom shunned two years ago by all politicians as death, & now sir he has more influence in this House than any now on the floor & is more courted by the politicians and aspirants.

	I have to go back to the State House.  If anything special is heard from Anna tonight I will write you again.

       I have just been to the Post office & recd your letter enclosing one from Anna.  I am afraid I shall not have time to write you this evening & am therefore writing you now in the House of Representatives whilst the clerk is reading over the journals of yesterday.

	I recd a letter from Anna last evening after writing to you.  She writes cheeringly as to her visit.  I would send it to you but it is at my room & I will be at home the day you receive this letter.

	Your Box gives me much trouble.  If it gets wet it will be ruined and now there is nothing but rain.  I do not think it can be sent on the stage.  Mr. Bryant in whose book store it is says I had better not send it to the Rail Road till the weather breaks off.   He will then send it to the Rail Road & a wagon will take it from Newberry.  It will come safer than by the stage.  But I will enquire more about [it] before I leave here.

	Last night the Senate came over & voted for the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  It has this moment passed the third reading in the House and is the law of the land.  This is a great achievement & has drawn on me many compliments & praises.  The Columbia papers this morning speak in high terms of my speech & Mr. Trenholms & attribute the passage of the Bill to those speeches.

	I leave in the morning bright & early.  If anything takes place worth writing I will add a postscript this evening.  I assure you I shall be most happy to meet you & the children again & be once more at home.

	I have authorized Anna to draw on Mr. Elford for any money she wants.  He will have $100 from Hill & Gladden.  I am glad to hear that Anna is so well thought of by her relations in Charleston.  I think all of our children are very superior to most children of their ages.  This, however, is the opinion no doubt of every parent.

       My arm is so much better that I can begin to use my hand a little.  But it pains me occasionally.  I am glad that Hexts eye was not hurt worse.  The children ought to be careful.  It is a wonder more accidents do not happen.
       
       Yesterday I had a present of a gold pen from a Book seller Mr. Middlekoff.  I weas purchasing some paper of him.  He & his wife sit next to me at the table.  He has lately opened a book store in Columbia.  Yours most affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines whilst Frank is dressing for Breakfast.  The Bell has rung & Frank was asleep.  On being waked up he expressed great mortification that I did not wake him sooner.  We had a terrible drive here on Sunday.  The roads were almost impassable.  We reached here by night by hard driving.

	The Will case was set down for trial today,  I came one day too soon.  But I employ it very well in looking into the case & examining the authorities.  I am very confident of success & we get a fee of $500 if successful before the ordinary & $300 if not.  

	I shall not be at home before the last of the week perhaps Saturday.

	I have nothing new to write you.  My friend Keith has a son born last week.  He has two daughters before.

	I arrived here safely this evening at five oclock & will write you a few lines.  I cannot forego the opportunity of writing you.  If I wont till I arrive in Washington you will not hear from me in a week or ten days.  It gives me much pleasure to write you when absent as it does you to receive & read the letters.  When I leave home I think a great deal more about my wife & children than when at home.  I will not say I think more of them for they are always equally & incalculably dear to me.

	General Thompson & myself had a very pleasant journey on Sunday to Donalds.  We had a great deal of talk about everything.  We reached Donalds about an hour before sunset and there found Frank Burt on his way to Washington.  He is going on to get office and was delighted to meet us and will travel with us.  He expressed himself under great obligations to me for my kindness in his favor.

	I met also at Donalds Wallace Ioor going to Newberry.  He did not know or was not disposed to talk about his visit.  I thought he was seeking employment.  At Cokesbury we took on Col. William Taylor of Camden.  He said the State had gone over to the Perry partythat I deserved great credit &c.  He was a hot secessionist.  He said I ought to be elected over Orr to Congress & he had understood I could beat him.  We took up Col. Keith of Orangeburg just below Cokesbury.  He was a terrible fire eater, but met me most cordially.  Thompson said that he was glad to see that all of the secessionists were so cordial in their relations with me.  Col. Keith said they all respected me a great deal more than they did the Cooperationists.  He gave me two dollars & requested the Patriot to be sent him.  He speaks of going on to Washington with us

	It is uncertain whether we go through Charleston or not.  Thompson is unwilling to risk the water.  

	Janney was very glad to see me.  His little daughter enquired a great deal about Anna.  Janney said where is your little daughter?  Why did you not bring her with you.  Anna seems to be a great favorite with them all.

	I have seen Middlekoff & got a second volume of Harper.  My trip to Columbia has not cost me one cent nor will my lodging here tonight.  

	I shall expect to hear from you on my arrival at Washington.  I wish I could be with you tonight & see all the children & hear you teach them their lessons.  I can imagine you all seated around the fireHext nursing, Anna reciting geography, Willie reading Virgil, Frank looking over his lesson & working it & Fanny lying on the sopha.

	God bless you all.  Good night.  I must write to the Patriot.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just arrived here & it is now nine oclock in the night, but before retiring to rest, I will write you a few lines.  Mr. Burt with whom I am rooming has just gone to bed.  General Thompson has gone out somewhere & will probably come back late.

	I wrote you in Columbia & will now continue our journey & its incidents owing to my persuasion.  Thompson agreed to come by Charleston.  He was anxious to take the stages.  Burt told him I was very self willed & would have my own way about everything & he had better yield.   It was well we came the Boat rout[e], for we should have been delayed one day on the other rout[e], besides travelling seventy miles on stages.

	We fell in company with my friend Thompson the boot merchant in Columbia & several other merchants going north.  In Charleston I passed from the cars to the Boat without stopping.  I met Dr.in the Hamburgh cars & a great many other acquaintances.  Just as I was getting out of the car a woman came up to me & proposed putting herself under my charge going north, which I most uncivily declined on the ground that I was otherwise engaged.  Who she was I know not & did not ascertain, although she went on with us as far as Weldon.

	We passed through Wilmington without stopping.  General Thompson saw none of his friends there.  The evening I wrote you in Columbia he came to my room & wrote one page I noticed, whilst my letter contained Three.  I thought to myself he had been married only two years & I had been married fifteen.  Several amusing incidents have happened which I shall not have time to write.  When we got into the cars & on the Boat it was mentioned by someone that we were General Thompson & Major Perry.  Shortly afterwards a man by the name of Perry went up to Thompson & said he looked so much like his Father that he supposed they were somehow related, as they were both of the same name.  Thompson told him that he was mistakenhis name was not Perry and that my name was Perry.  The young man replied that he thought I was General Thompson & requested him to introduce him to me that he [k]new the family of Col. Jones into which I had married & that he understood I was a great Whig.  General Thompsonhim & said if he had taken me for a Whig he would have got into the wrong box most decidedly.  He had made the same mistake that Perry did.    

	Yesterday at Suffolk in Virginia a party got into the cars.  Amongst them there was a young lady to whom General Thompson gave his seat by me & went into the baggage cars.  She enquired who the gentleman was who was so kind & on my telling her it was General Thompson, she observed that she knew him from character & that he had married a Miss Jones.  When the cars arrived at Portsmouth I escorted the young lady to the Boat & found that she was on her way to Washington in company with a friend & his family her relations.  We came on to Baltimore together.  I introduced General Thompson to her & we spent our time very pleasantly on the boat with her.  She proved to be a Miss Ballow & looked very much like Judge Cheves daughterespecially Mrs. McCordquite intellectual & handsome.  She said I reminded her very much of Governor Graham of North Carolinaboth in manners & appearance.  We also met on the boat a daughter of Commodore [James] Bar[r]on who killed [Stephen] Decatur in a duel.  She is married to a Captain Prendergrast of the Navy.  I made her acquaintance.  She lives in Washington & gave me a very pressing invitation to call & see her.  She was in company with Col. Payne of the Mexican Army & who was one of the commissioners thatin the Gardner case.  After I had been introduced to him he told Thompson that he had been more anxious to see me than any man in the United States.  He said pretty much the same to me the next morning & we have become quite gracious.  He has been summoned as a witness in the Gardner case & came on to Washington with us.  Miss Ballard also knew me when told by Thompson that I was the Southern Patriot.  Thompson said to Burt today that I was the most popular man in the Southern States of all the South Carolinians.

	In Baltimore we staid three or four hours.  I paid Redwood his money $517,36cts.  I bought a fine sack coat for $20 & six shirts for $12.00.  Burt & Thompson also fitted themselves up with clothes.  Baylis Crayton passed through Baltimore yesterday.  We reached here after dark& I have seen no one but General McQueen of South Carolina & General Hamilton.  

It is said Gardner will not only be acquitted but vindicated.  Col. Payne has no doubt of his innocence.  

	I hope you & the children are all well & getting on well.  It seems like a month since I left home.  I should like very much to see you all.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow & I will write you again tomorrow night if I have time.  But if the Gardner case is taken up I may not have time.

	I am quite well but will take some pills as I lay down to sleep.  Burt is now snoring at an awful rate & will prove an unpleasant roommate I am afraid.

	I must now stop & write Elford a letter for the Southern Patriot.  My whole passage here has been only &213 or 24 dollars!

	Kiss the children for me and tell Anna I will have her locket attended to & your broach also.

	Yours truly & sincerely.  Nothing special as to the President or his cabinet.  B.F. Perry

	I was going to write you last night, but Col. Orr came to see us, and insisted on our going with him to the Presidents Soiree.  There were about two thousand persons in the White House & about it.  I never before saw such a crowd of human beings pressed together.  There was no moving or passing about in the greatRoom.  The crowd were about two hours in passing by the President.  When Col. Orr pronounced my name, the President enquired if I was the Editor of the Southern Patriot, & on being informed that I was, he clapsed my hand & expressed the deepest joy in meeting me.  But the crowd behind pressed me on & we had no commotion.  I shall go up to see him today or Monday.  He is a fine looking man. His wife is a very large lady & not very good looking.  I saw General Scott & was introduced to him again.  The ladies were all ugly.  I do not think I ever before saw so many ugly women
assembled at any place.  They were all well dressed of course.

	General Hamilton is here & we had a political chat this morning.  He said we had been most terribly abased in South Carolina, but things were now quiet.  Col. Campbell of Alabama expressed great pleasure in meeting me.  I went in the capital yesterday & wrote a long account of my visit for the Patriot which you will see.

	 Last night just as I was starting to the Presidents I was introduced to Mr. Ingersoll of Connecticut a young member of Congress.  I enquired of him if he was from New Haven & he said he was.  I then mentioned that I had frequently heard Mrs. Perry & her mother Mrs. McCall speak of Mr. & Mrs. Ingersoll of New Haven.  He said they were his parents & expressed great interest in you & your mother-- enquired which one of the daughters I had married, & said he remembered all of youthat your youngest sister was buried in his fathers ground.  He is a very handsome fellow & his name is Collin [Colin M.] Ingersoll.  He enquired if I was the editor of the union Paper in South Carolina--said he was glad to meet me &c.  I saw him again at the Levy with a young lady.  He is single & said to be courting Missof Alabama.

	General Hamilton mentioned to me this morning that Dr. Arthur Hayne was expected here & was an applicant for office in Charleston superintendent ofor something of that character.  

	We now have a terrible snow storm & it will be almost impossible to get out today.  I saw Mrs. Schoolcraft or Miss Howard last night at the Presidents, but I avoided speaking to her & Col. Orr did the same.

	The trial of Gardiner has not yet commenced.  The counsel seem confident of his acquittal.  I have not yet seen him.  General Thompson & myself are to go to the office of his lawyers soon.  It may be that the trial may not come on.  Two of Gardiners witnesses are not here yet.

	General Thompson went last night to see the spiritual& is a believer.  He was put in connection with General Glasscock & tells marvellous communications made.  He ought to have called up the spirit of his departed wife & held a communication with her.  General Hamilton did so with his two dead sons.  I am going to see them today,

	I am enjoying myself very much here but very anxious to hear from you.  I hope to hear this evening.  I am writing for the Patriot so much that I shall not be able to write you every day.  B.F. Perry

	I have not yet heard from you & it is one week since I left home.  This is Sunday morning.  It seems to me one month.  I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  I trust however that you are all well & doing well.

	Yesterday I went to hear & see the spiritualwith General Thompson & Mr. Burt.  I have written a full account of all they did for the Patriot which you will see & which would fill my letter to report.  Everything wasstrange.  I was at Burts again yesterday, & Mrs. Burt believes in the rapppings.  Frank Burt told her he was going to enquire all about & Armistead, whether they lived happily &c.  She told him that he and I ought to enquire about our wives at home & see whether they were not carrying on a flirtation in our absence.  I thought the age & appearance of Franks wife rendered such an enquiry unnecessary on his part.  Mrs. Burt seemed very kind, & I must have reminded her of old times before she ever saw Burt.  He said she looked for my gray hairs as soon as she saw me, & wanted to know what had become of them.  Burt is becoming gray.  She said she knew my head of old, & intimated  She has grown quite fat & will weigh about two hundred.

	Whilst writing the above Col. Orr came to dine with us.  Judge Butler also came to see us, & sat for an hour or two with us.  Col. Orr has just left & it is now near six oclock in the evening, and I must finish my letter.  I intended to write you a long letter.

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Orr & sent a pleasant evening.  Saw Mr. Soule of Louisiana & his wife.

	I have not yet heard from you.  I saw Herndon & Thompson this evening.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I went to the Post office this morning & had the pleasure of receiving two letters from you.  I called at the Post office with Col Orr on our return from the Presidents.  The Col. told me to tell you to keep the thousand dollar check you had received for pin money.  I told him that you had sent me the letter, but kept the check.  I was truly glad to hear from you for I began to be uneasy.  General Thompson has now gone to the Post office to enquire for his letters.  I suppose he thinks his wife loves him as much as mine does me & will write him as soon.

	My visit to the President was a pleasant one indeed.  He met me most cordially & we talked a long time although there were others waiting to have a reception.  He told me all about his administration &c.  He said the Patriot was the only paper in South Carolina he cared to read for a great while.

	On my return from the Presidents we called to see Col. Clements of Alabama.  He expressed himself under many obligations to me for the notice I had taken of him.  I saw Mr. Stephens of Georgia & he enquired if I was the Editor of the Southern Patriot.  Everybody seems to know me about as well here as they do in Greenville.  Col. Orr introduced me to Mr.  [Benjamin D.] Naebors [Nabers] of Mississippi & began to tell who I was & Naebors stopped him & said he knew me perfectly well.  I have not been to the Senate today.  Judge Butler & Governor Aiken called to see us this morning.

	The case of Dr. Gardiner has not yet been taken up, & his witnesses have not yet arrived.  It is uncertain when it will be taken up for trial.  The doctor was at out room this morning with Col. Abbott one of his witnesses.  I am very much pleased with Dr. Gardiner indeed & have no doubt of his innocence.  Col.  Orr says I must argue the case of Dr. Earle & Chase in the Supreme Court if it comes on whilst I am here.  Both Orr & Thompson say this city is now the finest opening for a lawyer in the United States & think I would make a fortune here in a few years.

	As to getting office under the President there is no office within his gift worth having for a poor man with a family, who has a practice worth three thousand dollars at home.  Frank Burt is trying for the office of auditor worth three thousand dollars & expects to live here without his family.  He is in debt & poor fellow.  I am sorry for him.  Unless he gets an office he will have to sell his negroes or lose.

	I am getting very tired of this place, & if Gardiners trial does not come on, I shall not stay a great while longer.

	I hope to hear from you again tomorrow.  I see Livingstons Book neatly bound containing all of our likenesses.  I hope you & the children are all well.  There is a daguerreotypist herebut I have not yet been to see him.

	Mrs. Blake is here & doing well.  Col. Orr spoke of her daughter the grown one being an interesting young lady & said nothing about any scandal of her.  I hope the story told you by Mrs. Hubbard is not correct.  General Thompson & Gen. E told me last night the Col. Bentons youngest & single daughter had a child recently.  What a horrible circumstance.

	Wilborn Perry & Major Miller & his two daughters passed through here last night on their way to New York.  I did not see them but Col. Orr did.

	Give my love to all the children & believe me yours truly and sincerely, B.F. Perry

	I recd two letters from you this morning & in one of them you mention the horrible circumstance about Col. [Thomas Edwin] Ware killing his father in law Adam Jones.  It has shocked me so that I am unfit for anything.  It is the most horrible & unexpected event, which could well have happened.  I thought Col Ware one of the coolest & most self possessed men I ever saw.  Col. Hoke sent me Col. Wares letter.  I am sorry I am not at home to comply with his request.  I hope however he will succeed in getting bail, & that he will also succeed in justifying himself before his country.

	Your letters seem to be filled up with offences & horrors.  I am sorry you permit these things to occupy so much of your thoughts.  If you were now situated as poor Mr. Burt is in poverty & a probability of your property being sold you might feel anxiety about yourself & the children.  But we are comfortable with a competency about us & in the enjoyment of health, & I doubt exceedingly if I could make any change that would not be disastrous in some way or other.  Let well enough alone.  I have a pretty certain income of $2,000, a good house to live in, servants enough, & a healthy climate with schools for our children.

	I received a note from President Fillmore last night requesting me to dine with him on Thursday next.  Neither General Thompson nor Mr. Burt are invited.  I shall go & have so written to him.

	Last night I attended the consultation of the council in the Gardiner case in the law office of Bradl[e]y & Carli[s]ledid not get off till twelve oclock in the night.  Then we all. Bradly, Carlile, Dr. Gardiner, General Thompson, Brady Jr & myself, went to an oyster House & took supper.  I did not get to my room till after one oclock.  We went on the whole case.  Thompson told me that Dr. Gardiner was very much taken with my appearance & was now anxious to have me as one of his counsel.  It is doubtful when the case will come on for trial.

	Mr. [Charles Magill] Conrad Secretary of War called to see General Thompson this morning & I had the pleasure of his acquaintance & conversation for some time.  Governor Aiken & Mr. Clingman called to see us this morning.  I have been down to the House this morning & made the acquaintance of a great many members.  They all knew me perfectly well.

	You can give the check to Mr. Elford & let him get the money & pay off Dr. Irwin as soon as he returns.  I have written to P. H that I cannot take less  I have not yet seen Mrs. Blake but will attend to your bag before I leave here.

	I have not much to write you today & Thompson & Burt are in my room talking & they confuse me.  Thompson recd a letter from home this morning.  You have written me four & his wife one to him.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter this morning giving me an account of your mothers visit to Col. Goodlett.  I should be very glad if Susan could be contented anywhere, but I am afraid that is impossible.   I feel well assured she will not stay at Col. Goodletts six months.  But do impress on her the necessity of her continuing there and being contented if she goes there.  Her character is in some measure at stake.  If she leaves there again it will [be] said that no one can please her or live with herthat she is a discontented nervous woman with whom no one can get along with.

	I wish to see you all again very much & I wish to be at home again.  To me there is no place like home.  I would not give up the society of my wife and children for all the fame & honors what the world can bestow.

	General Thompson & Burt and Col. Colcock have gone tonight to the spiritual rappers & asked me to go with them.  But I am rather disgusted with the humbuggery.  Yet stranger things are revealed by them.  Thompson believes as firmly as he believes in his existence.  Armistead Burt told me a very remarkable thing which occurred with him & Mrs. Burt & Mrs. Bell the other night.  They made the table dance about over the room & then they enquired if the spirit of any dead person was present.  Immediately there was a loud coffing.  They enquired whose spirit it was.  The spirit replied John C. Calhouns.  They asked & were answered a great many questions correctly.  This was all at Burts room & no one present but Mrs. Burt & Mrs. Bell!.

	I have seen Tom Thompson & Tom Thurston here.  Major Miller of Pickens District & Willborn Perry returned here this evening from New York & came to see us.

	I am now all alone and it is about nine oclock.  This is the first evening I have been alone since I left home.  Thompson & Burt will soon return with morethings from the rappers.

	I am fully determined that you & I will pay a visit to the north next summer.  Your notion of waiting till the Court of Equity is over is a good one.  Then we can stay as long as we please.  The other thousand dollars &due from Alabama shall defray our expenses.  Whether we take Willie & Anna is another matter.  I think you will enjoy traveling some to make you like Greenville & home.  I assure you there is no place like it.  I am here now amidst all the great men & yet I wish I was back at home.  I dine with President Fillmore tomorrow,.  This is the last dinner he will give as President.  The great men & ladies of the U, State will be there.  Col. Orr is to introduce me to President Polks brother tomorrow who will go with me to the dinner party.

	I recd a letter this morning from Elford giving me the particulars of Coll Wares catastrophe.  It has excited great consternation with the whole South Carolina delegation.

	The Gardiner case is not likely to be tried for some weeks yet & if so I shall return home.  Dr. Gardiner called to see me today, but I was out.  Col. Payne a witness in the case went off today & told me the case would not be reached for two weeks.  I sent Thompson to make enquiries about the case, but have not yet heard the result.  

	President [Franklin] Pierce is now in Washington, but very few persons have called to see him.  It is likely he will dine with President Fillmore tomorrow & if so I shall see him most favorably.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	There was no Southern mail this morning & consequently I have heard nothing from you today.  I hope to hear tonight or in the morning.

	I have just dressed myself & am going to the Presidents to dine at six oclock.  It is now half after four oclock.  Tomorrow I will write you about the dinner.  I did not wish to go to the dinner party alone & Col. Orr was good enough to introduce me to General Polk, brother of President Polk, who is going from the National Hotel & is to go with me.  I am to call for him ten minutes before six.  He seems a pleasant gentleman.  Sunday we dine with Governor Corwin, Thompson, Burt & myself.  

	I have nothing to write you.  President Pierce keeps very close and sees very little company.  I hope to see him today at President Fillmore.  The case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up next Monday week, the week of Spartanburgh Court.  I do not know yet what I will do in reference to it.  I shall remain here anyhow till the last of next week.

	I have rece[ive]d no letter from you for two days.  I went to the Post office this morning myself, but could find nothing for me.  I hope it is owing to the Boats not connecting with the Rail Road owing to the winds, which very often happens.  Tomorrow I may get two letters from you.  General Thompson has not rece[ive]d any letters either for two days past.

	Last evening I spent a delightful time at the Presidents & everything was magnificent, which I shall mention in my letter to the Patriot.  Just before we sat down to the table a naval officer came in, in full dress,  & I thought his name was announced Commodore McCall.  Consequently I thought he might be your uncle.  I looked at him & thought I could see a striking family likeness between you & him.  I had heard that you favored your Father.  I watched the old fellow & was pleased with his manners.  I thought they were something like yours.  My mind was made up that he must be your uncle.  I was thinking of letting the old man know who I was but first concluded to ask the Presidents son , a young gentleman who seemed master of ceremonies something more about the commodore.  In reply Mr. Fillmore told me his name was McCauly & that he had just returned from the Pacific on duty.  Away went all my conjectures &c.

	I was very much pleased with the President.  Commodore Stockton was there.  Governor Winthrop, Governor Jones of Tennessee, Mr. Thackeray an English writer of distinction & a good many members of Congress.

	Today I went to see the Washington Monument & the Smithsonian Institute.  Then I went to the Capitol.  Col. Summer came yesterday & he went with me to the Institute & the Capitol.  There Armistead Burt took possession of me & we rambled all over the city.  He carried me to where there were a great many pretty things for sale & into a great many nice stores.  I bought six more shirts for $12.75, six silk pocket handkerchiefs for $5.25cts.  They are now used Burt says instead of Linen.  I am glad of it for they do better. 

	General Thompson went to see General Pierce this morning.  I have not yet been to call on him.  This is the first day he has recd company generally.

	I hope you & the children are all well. I am very anxious to see you all again.  Burt asked me this morning how many children I had.  I noticed a pretty little child.  He said he did not notice such things.  Yours affectionately, B.F.P.

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  It has been three days since I heard from you.  Neither General Thompson or Mr. F. Burt have recd any during the same period which consoles me in some measure.

	As I was coming upstairs last evening I met General McQueen of South Carolina, who married Miss Pickens a lady we saw at the Chick Springs from Alabama.  He had a letter in his hand to his wife & said that he wrote to her every day & that she wrote to him every other day.  I said that you & I wrote every day.  He said he liked me better now than he ever did.  I told the expression to Col. Summer this morning in the presence of General McQueen.  Col. Summer replied he was not surprised at the General writing every day for he had not been married long, but that I had been married fifteen years.  I dont think General Thompson has recd but two letters from Mrs. Thompson.  He has become inwith the spiritual rappers & goes there every day to talk with the spirit of his daughter, father, uncle and others.  But I believe he has never yet called up the spirit of his wife.  He believes most implicitly in the rappers.  I think it is all humbuggery.  Eliza Jones spirit told him yesterday that John Jones was going to marry Harriet Thurston.  But dont mention this to anyone.  It distresses the General.  She said she wanted to send a message to her children &c.

	Last night I was by myself for some time & I commenced writing you a long letter& immediately Thompson & Burt came in & prevented me.  F. Burt fell down last night & hurt his face & arm so badly that he will not be able to get out again for some days.

	Today I went to see A[rmistead] Burt & we walked to the Fair, which is the most beautiful collection of pretty things I ever saw.  It has made me more anxious to go to the worlds fair.  We will certainly go.  After dinner I went back to the fair with General Thompson but he soon tired & left me.  I have just returned.  The building is the new wing of the Patent office & was crowded.

	Armistead Burt & myself are to go & see the President Monday next at ten oclock.  You speak of office.  There is not one within the gift of the President that I could accept.  No man with a young family living in Greenville ought to accept of any office whilst he is making three thousand dollars a year.  You may depend on my judgement.  I know that any such office would ruin me.  I know your interest, my interest & the interest of my children& nothing shall make me sacrifice them.  You must yield to me judgement in this matter.  

	I am anxious to see you & the children & dont think I can stay away much longer.  Home & Home sweet home, there is no place like it, with a good wife & good children.  B.F. Perry

	Last night after I had gone to bed, they sent me from the Post office two letters from you & one from Sam Earle.  I was greatly relieved when I received your letters.  I had not heard from you for three days which appeared to me a very long time though I suppose there are many members of Congress who do not hear from their wives once in three weeks.  Your letters were dated Saturday & Monday.  General Thompson received one of the same from Mrs. Thompson dated Friday.

	This is Sunday & I am to fine with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  He has a fine library & collection of paintings & General Thompson says he has invited some friends to meet us there.  I find my little respect paid to the Sabbath here & very little going to church.  Very near to this Hotel is a very large Episcopal church which is under the charge of Mr. Butler whose wife figured so conspicuously  in the Anderdanck trial.  He is a clergyman of decided talent & eloquence.

I do not think your mother would be pleased boarding out & I am afraid Susan will not be.  Though I am in favor of your mother selling her House lot if she can for a fair price.  Real estate and every species of [property] has risen very much lately & is still rising.   Negroes are selling in Virginia for $1,200.00.  Women are worth $1,000.00boys 10 years old $800.00.  Major Miller & Willborn Perry who came on to purchase negroes here returned without buying, and stated they could purchase much cheaper in South Caroline.  Lands are rising everywhere & it will be a good time to sell.  There will be a terrible crash in the world before many years in consequence of these high prices & speculation.  If I can get a high price for my house & lot, I might be induced to sell with your consent.  Everything here is very extravagantbeing further north may be cheaper.

	You speak of wishing to go to Charleston in the spring.  I am very willing if we can provide the ways & means of going there & to the worlds fair both.  But I wish you to go there & see the world.  We will make a northern tour & you will be better pleased with Greenville.  There is nothing that makes me better satisfied with home than to go from home provided they have good sense & a good heart.

	General Thompson came in last night & informed me that he had seen the Cherokee chief & was about to be engaged by them again, & if so he would share his fees with me.  I hope something favorable will result from my visit.  I do not regret my trip however if nothing comes of it except my seeing the world & the great men of the world.

	This week I shall return my visits & see Mrs. Blake & get Anna medallion filled.  How much I wish to see you alllittle HextFannyFrank, Anna & Willie & yourself.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday after writing to you I went & dined with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  General Thompson & Col. Summer were of the party.  We met a good many ladies there, but none remarkable for beauty or talent.  Miss Corwin is a good looking young lady.  She is quite young, and presided at the head of the table with grace & dignity.  Mrs. Corwin had gone home.  Miss Ellicott of Pennsylvania was quite agreeable & rather pretty.  I had the honor of escorting to the table Miss Smith of Ohio, sensible & ugly.  We spent a very pleasant evening & I am delighted with Corwin.    But you will see my letter in the Patriot.

	Today I went to see General Pierce with Armistead Burt & General Thompson.  General Thompson introduced me as the Editor of thePaper in South Carolina.  He replied I know him perfectly well & am very happy to meet him.  He seems quite cordial and sincere, plain & unpretending.  He said we ought to have placed so quiet a man as he is in the Presidency.  Mr. Burt told him he was going off this evening & the President replied I wish I could go with you.  I observed I had no doubt he was sincere in this wish to get rid of the crowd which was worrying & annoying.  He said never before had his sleep been broken, that he could always heretofore sleep, but now that was not the case.  We staid but a few minutes & as we retired he asked General Thompson to come back tomorrow about some matters.

	I have today had my daguerreotype taken in a broach for you & in the medal[l]ion for Anna.  Your broach is a very pretty one (gold) and fashionable.  My likeness in it is said to be very good.  A very handsome woman, Mrs. Clements of Virginia, said so, as I was puitting it up.  The broach with my likeness cost only five dollars.  The likeness in Annas medal[l]ion only one dollar & fifty cents.

	Today has been raining.  I saw Tom Butler in the rotunda of the Capitol.  He said he left home Monday & all were well.  He looked very well.  I saw also doctor Hayne whop is here to get the appointment of Port Physician of Charleston.  He said all of your friends were well in Charlestonthat Mrs. Hayne had recd a letter from Greenville just before he left stating you were all well.  I saw Johnson of Columbia & Boatwright &c.

	This morning Col. Orr introduced me to General Bailey of Virginia.  He said he was very glad to meet me if I was the man he took me to be the Editor of the Patriot.  In returning from the Presidents I met Mrs. Bailey & her daughter in ashop & was introduced by General Thompson.  She is a very pleasant lady & told me that her daughter could make a table run all over the room & could raise a tumbler of water from the table by mere touch.  They do not account for it & cannot, nor had they been to see the spiritual rappers Mrs. Fox & her daughter.

	Mr. A. Burt & his wife were here this evening.  I wish I could go with them but I suppose you wish me to stay till the coronation & give you an account of it.  I am very tired & would not live here for any consideration.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  General Thompson goes to the rappers every day & communes with his deceased wife, child, mother & Father & says he is a new man.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter s-dated Wednesday, in which you say you have not yet heard from me in Washington.  I am greatly surprised at this for I was certain you would hear from me the morning you wrote.  I wrote the very night I arrived here which was the Thursday before you wrote the last letter recd from you.

	I am glad to hear that Judge ONealls opinion of Wares case was so favorable.  Tom Butler gave me all the particulars this evening.  He came to our room to see us.

	General Thompson has heard nothing from home for several days.  He complains that your letters come one or two days sooner than his wifes.  He is very much taken as I have already written you with the spiritual rappers.  He visits them daily & calls up the spirits of various persons.    He was telling me this evening a wonderful story about the spirits too long to relate.  

	I will tell you a good story in relation to Col. Summer & myself.  General Thompson & myself were sitting together at the table the other day & Miss Doty daughter of Governor Doty of Wisconsin was sitting opposite.  He said to me Summer is in love with that young lady.  Then he enquired of her if she heard.  She said no.  He got up & told her that his friend Col. Summer of South Carolina was in love with her.  She flashed her eyes across the table at me, thinking that I was the Colonel.  For one or two days she remained under this impression & Summer says she was crying me the whole time.  He said when we [were] sitting together he could catch her eyes, but when he was at the table alone she looked another way.  

	I have been interrupted as usual in my letter.  I thought I was safe for this night.  But in comes Thompson & Summer after Burt had gone to bed & I had to quit writing.  It is now after eleven oclock & I must quit & go to bed.  I had commenced for the purpose of telling you all the chit chat & anecdotes.  

	I will write you again tomorrow.  I have already written two letters today.  I suppose you & the children are all well & asleep.  It is the greatest comfort when from home to hear FROM HOME.

	I have just bought Livingstons Book very handsomely bound for eight dollars.  It is for sale in the book stores & it is something to see my own likeness & life in a book which will be read by thousands of people.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is a very bad day.  The rain is pouring down, and I am not able to go out.  I am now all alone, but how long this will be the case is doubtful.  I have therefore concluded to write you a letter.  I will write till I am disturbed.  But I have nothing to write you.  Nothing has occurred since last night [at] eleven oclock when I finished my last letter to you.

	Having no incidents to mention I will comment on the City of Washington & the thousands of strangers who are now here seeking offices, wives, husbands, & pleasure.  I suppose there are at this time in the city at least five thousand women from all parts of the United States seeking husbands just as openly as the men are seeking offices & I presume nineteen twentieths of both classes will be disappointed.  It is hard to saywhich class of seekers are the more active & indefatigable in their respective pursuits.  The ladies seem to wish to excite love in all their actions & mode of dressing.  I will mention one or two instances & leave you to judge for yourself.  Last night at the supper table, which is a huge round table where each one can see everybody else.  Two ladies took their seats opposite to me with their entire bosoms open to their belts and their white gowns covering their breasts just in such a way as to expose the whole bosom.  One of them deliberately put her hand on her breast & compressed it so as to push it a little under her dress.  I must confess I never saw such a fine pair of breasts in my life, full & pleasing, fair & beautiful, swelling & sinking with every breath drawn.

	This morning I saw two others come to the breakfast table very neatly & prettily dressed, but with gowns opening in front & exposing a part of a white underdress below the waist!  These latter ladies are said to be the Miss Stephens from South Carolina., but I think they are from New Yorkthe two last night I was not able to learn anything about.  They have a way too, of placing the elbow on the table with the hand raised, by which means they are enabled to expose to view the whole arm naked with beautiful frills encircling & fingers covered over with jewelry, a very pretty sight.  In the Streets, in the Capitol, at the Fair, there is one complete jamdresses as various as the statescloaks like gowns are much worn.  I have not seen a long cloak at all.  

	The gentlemen are very much whiskered & bearded & mustached.  They are from all parts of the world, England & China, California, France, Australia, Maine, Canada Russia &c.  

	The trial of Dr. Gardiner does not commence till Monday & may take two weeks.  I do not think it proper for me to stay & risk the chances.  But I have determined on nothing yet.  As soon as I do I will write you.  I am tired of this crowd & cease to take much interest in the proceedings of Congress.  Mr. Armistead Burt said to me yesterday as he was leaving the Capitol for the last time that he intended to shake the dust off his feet & quit the place, that he had been here ten years & was utterly disgusted with Congress & the city.

	I have written you so many letters, & you were so long in receiving the first one that I am afraid you will not have time to read all of them before I return home.  When they begin to come you will get them by half dozens.

	Mr. Burt has just come up & brought me your letter of Thursday & yet you have heard nothing from me.  That is strange very strange.  B.F.Perry

	I rece[ive]d no letters from you yesterday, but I hope to get one this morning.

	Yesterday in looking into a jewellers shop I saw the most beautiful tea set I ever laid my eyes on.  It was the prettiest pattern & just opened.  Tea pot, coffee pot, sugar dish, cream pot &bowlSilver.  I enquired the price & was told forty dollars only so I thought it would be a handsome present to bting you & purchased it.  It is in factware & outwardly silver.  No human being can tell it from silver.  The ware is nowsilver entirely.  I am sure you will be pleased with the set.  I think such a purchase a very judicious one for all time to come.

	There was nothing doing yesterday & I have nothing to write about & in fact have no leisure to write, as someone is always in my room.

	I think it probable I shall leave here for home by the way of Baltimore Sunday morning.  This will enable me to get home Wednesday or Thursday.  The trial of Gardiner will not take place for some time
& I cannot stay for it & in fact have not been employed in it regularly.  I have heard nothing more of Thompsons Indian case.  He has kept me here waiting about that.  But after all a tolerable practice at home is far better than any practice abroad.

	The Inauguration will take place tomorrow & I shall see the crowd, but do not expect to see anything else.  President Pierce has gone to Baltimore to meet Mrs. Pierce & will not return before this evening.  

	I am delighted at the idea of returning home & meeting once more my dear wife & children.  I have seen a great deal by coming here & [am] amply compensated for my trip.  In great haste, yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d this morning after writing to you a letter from you dated25th of Feb[ruary] in which you stated that you had just rece[ive]cd two letters from me and were delighted with them.  I was glad to hear that you had at last rece[ive]d some of my letters.  I have written to you every day since I have been in Washington.  I wrote to you the night I arrived here, six full pages & did not go to bed tired as I was till twelve oclock.  I am grattified too that my letters are read by you with interest.  If they only give you the same pleasure to read that they do me to write I have nothing to complain of.  I love youlove to write to you.  You are my sweetheart, my wife, & the mother of my children & when absent from you my love for you & the children is called into action.  It is then just as strong in my heart when at home as it is when abroad.  But it is inactive or when I dont feel the strength of it till separated from you.  In our intercourse through life you may have found me self willed & seemingly harsh, but this very conduct has been the consequence of my love.  I am more disposed that my children should behave [more]  properly than my servants & hence I reproach them perhaps [more] often than I do my servants.  I do nothing in revenge & therefore do not correct my servants as often as I ought perhaps.

	But I have got to moralizing & will quit it with this expression that I love with an ardent sincerity justice & right in all things.  I am a good [husband] from principle & nature as well as from affection & love.  You too are a good wife from the [same] feeling & principle.

	General Thompson is constant in going to the spiritual; rappers & calling up the spirit of his daughter, wife, father & mother.  Mrs. Thompson in Greenville does not know that he has been in Washington with his first wife.  He told me confidentially the other day that he asked the spirit of his first wife if she was willing for him to marry & she said yes.  He asked if she loved his second wife & she said yes.  If she preferred his marrying her to anyone else & she gave the same reply.  I told General Thompson last night that he was permitting this thing to take too strong a hold of his mind & that it was a fallacy a humbuggery & he ought to throw it off.  That these spirits had told him all sorts of lies & he ought not to believe anything they said.  They told him his cloak, which he lost in Charleston was found & he would get [it], which is untrue.  They told him that Mrs. Jones his wifes mother died in 1825.  But they have told him so many pleasant things that he wishes to believe them.  

	He came to our room the other night & told me that he called up the spirit of his mother & she made a bell ring & move all over the floorthat he requested his mothers spirit to touch him & she did so all down the thigh & leg.  He told her to put one of the bells on his arm & he told her to take it off & the bell got off.  I give you this as a specimen of his wonderful sayings & delusions.  I laughed at him & told him I would have him put in the lunatic asylum as we passed through Columbia.

	I have now written you two letters today & will stop & go to dinner.  I am afraid I write you & Elford so much that you will not read my letters & he will not be able to publish them.

	Give my love to your mother & sisters and tell them all that it would now be my greatest pleasure to meet them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  I hope I may tonight as we have two mails.

	I am somewhat indisposed with A Bad cold & did not go out to the Inauguration.  It is snowing & has been all day & I felt no inclination to risk my health in such weather.  I saw the crowd pass by this Hotel & saw the two Presidents in Gen. Pierces superb carriage & horses.  The General rose as he came opposite the Hotel bowed & waved his hat to the ladies.  There were supposed to be seventy thousand persons at the Inauguration.  The speech is spoken of in high terms.

	I was in hopes that my stay in Washington was at an end & thought of starting home Sunday.  But Dr. Gardiner came to see me this morning and insists on my remaining for his trial next week & offers me a fee of one thousand dollars.  The heads of the Cherokee Indians came this morning & wished to employ General Thompson & myself in the formation of as treaty for them with the President.  Their fee will be enormous if we succeed in effecting the treaty.  I am likewise anxious to see more of President Pierce.  Thompson says if Judge [James Moore] Wayne should die & his health is bad, that Pierce will appoint=t me to the Supreme Bench of the United States.

	Under all these considerations I will stay until after the trial of Dr. Gardiner.  I do not know that I should make one thousand dollars at home.  In the mean time I shall see what can be done with the Cherokee chiefs.  If we succeed in that matter it will be a fortune.

	I have just come up from the dinner table & dined with Col. Colcock, Gen. McQueen, Col. Orr & Mr. Woodward & Gov. Hubbard of Maine.  General McQueen drank to our wives.  I stated that we wrote every day.  Col. Orr said he wrote once in two or three weeks.  Woodward said he did not write at all.  Colcock said he wrote every mail.  We had quite a pleasant party at dinner.  The crowd here is what you would have no conception of.  It will diminish from this term.  The display of the military was grand.

	I am not interrupted by company and really I never have time to write you composedly.  

	Give my love to the children.  Tell them I have bought the coined likeness of General Pierce & General Scott about the size of a quarter of a dollar for them.  They are very pretty.  Give my love to your mother & sisters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Gadsbys Hotel

His Excellency President Pierce

	Most respectfully I ask permission to say a word in favor of my friend Francis Burt Esq of Pendleton South Carolina who is an applicant for office from your Excellency.
	
	I am myself a citizen of South Carolina, and a union democrat, who claims to have been one of the first to urge the propriety of the States voting for the Baltimore nomination.

	When South Carolina, with seeming unanimity, declared her purpose of resistance to the compromise & a fixed determination to dissolve the Union, I threw myself in the breach, and resisted the action of the state by the establishment of a union Paper in the town of Greenville.  My speech in the legislature of South Carolina in defence of the compromise & the Federal Union, and the establishment of the Southern Patriot was the beginning of an opposition which gradually grew & increased till the state was saved from a bloody revolution.

	For myself I ask no office or reward for the sacrifice of my popularity & influence in South Carolina in defence of the Union & the compromise.  The wildest term applied to me was that of traitor, but I knew my own heart & disregarded it, Although I ask nothing for myself, I do ask for my friend who was then politically opposed to me and whom I know to be honorable & capable & meritorious.  His appointment will confer a favor on me & be highly acceptable to the State of South Carolina in whose service he has spent many years of his life & held a high & responsible office, Treasurer of the State.  

	I am with great respect yours &c, B.F. Perry

	I have been all day today engaged in the Gardiner case, which will be tried or commenced next Monday or Tuesday.  I have been at the law office of Bradly & Carlisle with Dr. Gardiner & Col. Gates.  I am going back there as soon as I write you a line.

	On my return to dinner General Thompson informed me that he had made a contract with the Indians.  We are to have five hundred cash any how & five percent on a half million if we succeed.  This is a pretty good fee.  

	I will write you again tonight.  My room is full again & I must stop.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday morning and I have just had my breakfast and sealed myself to write you a long letter.  But in all probability before I have written a dozen lines there will be persons in my room & interrupt my writing & I never will again have a room so public & appropriated to other persons.

	I wrote you a short letter yesterday for I was engaged all day.  I am disposed to study my case today also.  I think I shall be able to make a good speech.  There are facts & circumstances enough in Gardiners case for a good speech.  I am afraid it will take a long time to try it.  This I regret for I am exceedingly anxious to return home.  I have at this time too a very bad cold which distresses me a great deal.

	I do not know when our Indian business will commence.  This may deter me some time & perhaps render it necessary for me to return to Washington.  I will write you as soon as anything is ascertained in reference to it.

	I hope upon the whole that my visit to Washington will be a fortunate one for methat it will be the turning over a new leaf in my life.  This Indian business will necessarily throw me a good deal with President Pierce, & make me acquainted with him.  He may in the course ofevents take a fancy to me as you say that his character & mine are very much alike.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you Friday night dated Sunday preceding, but I have heard nothing from you since.  I hope to hear this morning when the mail is opened.  General Thompson received no letter from Mrs. Thompson & seemed mortified.  He thought I suppose that his wife ought to write as often as you did.  He requested her to write every other day.

	I am truly glad to hear that Susan is going to remain with your mother.  It is the only proper place for her.  I know full well she will be satisfied nowhere else.  It is more respectable too, and more becoming than for her, separated from her husband, to be boarding out.

	I regard to your mother selling her house for a fair price I approve of it.  She may purchase again or go elsewhere.  If she goes from Greenville let her go back to Charleston & board in some private house.  There she will have friends & relations to visit & see her.  It will cost her much less than keeping house & be more agreeable.  I doubt the policy of her going north.  But she may try it.  How Susan is today I know not & shall never advise again about her.  She has acted foolish from the day of her marriage to the present time.  It was an unfortunate marriage but it was her duty to make the best of it & especially for her childrens sake.  A woman who is so sensitive & selfish as that as to sacrifice her own comfort & convenience for the sake of her children is either bad or foolishthe latter I attribute to Susan.  I think she & your mother the most unwise people for this world & this life that I ever knew and yet I believe they are good & far better than others who before prudently [page torn]

	How I wish to see you & the children!  Nothing neither money nor fame can compensate me for the loss of my family, society & the care of my wife and children.  I am here the associate of Senators, Governors, Judges & high functionaries of government but I had much rather be the associate of you & William & Anna, Frank, Fanny & dear little Hext.

	I must now conclude my dear wife.  Your affectionate husband.  I have no idea when I shall be at home.  But hope the week of Laurens court.  B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you yesterday after I had written to you.  General Thompson rece[ive]d no letter & was greatly mortified.  He must think that his young wife has neglected him.  He is in constant communication here with the spiritual rappers in beautiful poetry & said she loved to watch over him in sleep & play about his breast.  He sent this poetry which is very pretty to his wife in Greenville.  I think there is a want of propriety in talking to the second wife so much about the first.  It must excite her jealousy. 

	My cold is still bad and today I have to go into court.  I took pills last night.  You must still continue to write to me.  I am afraid from your last letter you may think I am now on the road home.  I wish I was.

	Congress has adjourned & I shall not have the pleasure of seeing Ingersoll again to make the enquiries you desire.  But all will go to him.  However next summer & to the Worlds Fair.  Whether we had better carry William & Anna is doubtful.  We will take them a year or two hence when it will do
Them more service to see the world.

       I have been preparing on my case & shall henceforth have veery little to tell you.  General Thompson says that there is great expectation from my speech & many are anxious to hear it. I have the reputation here of being a very fine looking man which I am sure will please you.
       
       I was met the other day in the street by Mr. Bailor of the Cotton Plant who asked me if I was not Mr. Perry of South Carolina.  He said he had understood I was in the city & he knew me from a description he had received of me.
       
       I must now conclude & go to Breakfast.  The spiritual rappers told General Thompson last night that his child was sick with cold.  I ought to go & consult them about you & the children.  They tell everything that is to happen.  Indeed they have made some wonderful revelations and it is impossible to account for them.
       
       I hope you are all well.  God bless you.  Give my love to the children & to your mother & sister.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
       
P.S. Col. Summer has gone on to New York to court a young lady Miss Doty after two days acquaintance.  He wrote her a note & she wrote him an answer.  She is daughter of Governor Doty of Wisconsin & now a member of Congress.

	I have just returned from court & found your letter of Monday last.  I am so glad to hear from you that I will write you another letter to acknowledge the receipt of it.  No letters come for Genl. Thompson & he is distressed about it.  

	I was admitted to practice in the court here this morning & the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up tomorrow.  I made a few remarks this morning in the case before the court & produced a decided change in the mind of his Honor Judge Crawford as to the right of the U, States to take up which case the district attorney pleases.  I feel that I am prepared to make a good speech in the case if it comes on.

	I am sorry you say you may not write me again.  I hope my letters received will make you do so.  I may be here eight or ten days yet.  

	There is still a great crowd of persons in Washington & office hunters in great abundance.

	General Thompson speaks favorably about our Indian business & thinks we shall be successful and realize fifteen thousand each in the case.  In great haste, your affectionate and devoted husband, B.F. Perry

	I have rece[ive]d a letter from you today in reply to the one I wrote you of dining with the President.  General Thompson brought it up to the Court House for me from the Hotel, & I was glad, in the conclusion of it you said Mrs. Thompson was well.  He was very anxious & had no letters from home.

	I made a speech this morning in the Gardiner case on a continuance of it, which was well recei[ve]d.  Mr. Bradly & Mr. Carlisle both spoke of my effort in the highest terms to General Thompson.  I saw the effect of my speech on the Judge, Jury & crowd.  They seem to say with their eyes & faces this is admissible, better than we are accustomed to hear.  I carried the point & the case will be taken up tomorrow or Friday at furthest.  The counsel for the United States the district attorney & Mr. May turned pale & their faces looked cadaverous as I was pouring forth some of my burst of feeling & passion.  I am satisfied I have made a good beginning & I hope I shall make a good ending.

	I have nothing more to write you as my time is taken up with this case.  If I succeed well in it, Thompson says I will be employed in the Equity suit.  He has just written to his wife that I had made a speech & acquitted myself admirably as he knew I would, & that she must call & tell you so.

	It is uncertain when the case will be disposed of.  I am now in it & must remain.  But I shall be at home in a week or two I hope.  Write me every day & tell me all the news.  Your letters are my greatest comfort during my absence.  I am glad you read with so much interest my letters in the Patriot.  I have a dreadful cold.  The weather is now wild.

	I will write for the Patriot occasionally but not as often as I have done.  I hope all things are going on well at home.  Go & see Mrs. Thompson & write about her to me so that I may read your letters to the General.

	God bless you & the children.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Last night I rece[ive]d two letters from youone dated 22d February & the other 2d March.  How one of them could have been so long getting here I cannot imagine.  In the one of 22d Feb. you mention having rece[ive]d Judge Evans letter.  The Judge told me that he had written me a letter before leaving home, and I thought [it] strange you had not mentioned it.

	  General Thompson has not heard from home for two weeks & he was affected to tears last night when he brought me up your two letters & had none for himself.  He thinks some of his family are sick & made me run over your letters to see if you mentioned anything about them.  He says he knows Mrs. Thompson has written to him.
	I am very much obliged to you for writing so often & our attention to each other when absent will show our friends how much we think of each other.  Col. Colcock met me the other morning & asked if I had not written to you the conversation of General McQueen Woodward Orr & himself about writing to their wives.  I told him yes.  He said he thought so.

	I hope today to receive a Patriot containing my letters.  It must be full of them.

	I will tell you when I return all about the spiritual rappers.  They are very remarkable indeed.  Governor Corwin came to our room last night & told what had been done in his own family.  His son returned from college & laughed at his father for believing anything about it.  Whereupon the governor & his daughter & some young ladies and his son sat around a little table, put their hands on the table and their fingers pointed in the direction he wished the table to turn & it began to move & as his would wish or direct the table would turn aboutno one touching it.  Then he asked for a spirit & the table would spellhe repeating the alphabet & the table stopping at the right letter till the whole word was spelled!  This is true.

	I hope the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up today & that it may be finished this week.  I am most impatient to get home.  General Thompson consulted the spiritual rappers yesterday in the presence of Gov. Tallma[d]ge & Col. Colcock as to the trial & my speech.  The spirit told him that the trial would not take place till tomorrow & that I would make a great speech & excel all the other lawyers engaged on the case.  I hope the spirits tell the truth in this instance.  It is probable we will have to return about our Indian business.  

	I must now close my letter.  The books from Livingston will no doubt go safely to Columbia.  I have already got the two volumes for $8.00 very handsomely bound.  I have bought six more shirts, six pairs of drawers & a new hat and six silk pocket handkerchiefs & three pairs of socks.  I wrote to you about your tea set.  It is the prettiest you ever saw.  I have bought a new trunk for us to travel with next summer.  Your loving husband, BV.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Last evening Dr. Gardiner came to me room & said that my speech had produced quite a sensation.  He expressed himself pleased with it and I might say was in ecstacies at it.  He seems encouraged by it & I think we all are in good spirits.  After writing to you yesterday I went out to see about my shirts& the merchant who is a very gentlemanly man said that he was pleased to see that I was employed in the Gardiner case, that he was one of the Jury &have the pleasurer of hearing me  speak &c.  He had been in the Court House at some stage of the proceedings.  Thompson says that the case is so much talked of & written about that it will give me a national reputation at once.  I hope good will come out of my trip to Washington.

	I am afraid that you will stop writing to me under the impression that I am on my way home.  But this is not likely to be the case for some time to come.  Mr. Burt leaves here this morning.  I wish I could go with him most sincerely.  Col. Orr leaves tomorrow.  Colcock goes today or tomorrow.  Judge Butler & Judge Evans have to remain for some time as Senators.  Tom Butler is here as large as life.  Tom Thompson was to see us last night.  I met Tom Thurston in the streets yesterday evening.  I went to the Appollo Hall last evening.to see Mrs. Blake but she was giving lessons in dancing.  I sent up my card & wrote a note that I would call again.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  General Thompson saw general Pierce last night and is very much pleased with him.  The Indians came to see us last night.  Thompson thinks we can make the treaty at once.  This would be great luck.

	God bless you and the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you last night, on my return from a visit to Judge Butler, dated the 4th Inst., and whilst reading it Mr. Beattie & Mr. Grady came into my room with General Thompson.  I was truly glad to see them & we sat up & chatted till after twelve oclock.  They did not arrive here till nine oclock in the night.  I have sent by Beattie Annas locket with my likeness & your broach with my likeness.  I have also sent by him some medals for the children of Pierce & Scott, who you have no doubt rece[ive]d before this letter reaches you.

	But Beattie & Grady had left home two days after I did & therefore could tell me no news.  I sent the locket & broach for you to have something to see & talk about, though I had rather kept them & exhibited them myself.  I am a good deal like Anna in this respect when she wished her Christmas presents kept till she returned.

	I have bought your silver goblets of the most beautiful pattern in the world for fifty dollars.  They are of the Abbotts&beautifully.  They were at the Fair for exhibition.  These with the tea set will be a handsome present for you.  They were so beautiful I could not resist every temptation but that of beauty.  They are used instead of tumblers.  Tumblers are out of fashion & glass goblets will last always & glass tumblers break directly they are cheaper & as a matter of economy it is better to purchase them.

	When Burt left here yesterday I had to let him have fifty dollars to get home.  His brother Armistead Burt told me to furnish him with money & he would refund to me and told me to say so to Frank Burt.  So I am now about able to get home myself after the Gardiner case is over.

	Judge Butler invited me to dine with him tomorrow & see his mess.  

	I must now conclude hoping to hear from you again tonight. I am glad to hear Willie is improving.  I hope he will study hard.  Anna must attend to her studies too & music lessons.  Fanny must be a good girl & study her lessons.  Frank I hope will be quite improved when I see him.  Hext I hope will talk.  God bless you, B.F. Perry

	I now have a room to myself.  It is a great comfort.  I was glad when Burt went off though sorry in some respects.  It is horrible to be tied to anyone or have to room with anyone but my wife.  I never will again under any circumstances permit myself to be so imposed on.  But when we arrived here it was the only chance.  They gave Thompson a room without a fire place & me & Burt a room together with a fire place.  The same evening Burt went off I came up to my room & saw a gentlemans cloak &c on Burts bed & every indication that I was to have another room companion.  This threw me into a violent passion & down I went charging on the Bar keeper.  He said your friend Col. Summer has returned & wishes to go into a room with you.  I replied that I was very glad to learn that my friend Col. Summer had returned & that I wished him treated with more respect than to be thrust into my roomthat the Colonel was a gentleman & entitled to a separate room.  This I communicated to the Colonel also & he was provided with e room.  I would not again room with anyone if I could do so without paying board.

	I am not all alone & have just come up from my supper which has induced this long preface to my letter.  I am feeling & enjoying the luxury of being alone & thought I could not do better than to write you although I have already written you one letter this morning.

	The Gardiner case was not taken up today.  I suppose it will begin in the morning and in the morning I shall have no time to write you.  I rece[ive]d a note from Mrs. Blake as I went to tea saying she would be happy to see me this evening or tomorrow morning.  But I shall not be able to see her.  I cannot venturer out at night with my cold and in the morning I shall not have time.

	We had an interview with the Cherokee Indians this evening & General Thompson read a note from the Secretary of the Interior saying he could not make the treaty at this time.  It is probable that some time next summer will be fixed on for making the treaty.  If so you and I can come on to Washington & stay till it is over & then go to the Worlds Fair & New Haven.  This would suit exactly.  I shall always be happy to have you for a roommate at Washington.  It will give me great pleasure too to have you always as my travelling companion & guardian spirit.

	If I have time I will go & see the spiritual rappers again before I leave Washington & propound the questions you desire.  Thompson goes twice a day & talks with his wife, daughter, mother, father, friends, negroes &c &c.  Mrs. Cornelia Thompson his present wife has written him [to] not go any more.  She does not like it.  I expect she is a little jealous.  She says it is all nonsense and that God will not permit a spirit to reveal that which he wishes to conceal.

	You think I would idolize my second wife.  I dont think I could love her more than I do you.  But I hope both you & I have too much good sense & love for our children ever to marry again if either of us were to die.  I think a man is a great fool to marry the second time & a woman a still greater.  Senator Crittenden & his first wife have both been married three times.  I feel a contempt for such folks, and as to the woman I look upon her as wanting in virtue.

	I saw yesterday at the breakfast table an old tottering, gray bearded paralytic man come walking in with a buxome young woman.  They had just got married in New York & were taking a jaunt to spend themoon.  I should suppose and so thought when I saw them that it would be moon without anyto the bride.

	The office hunters & seekers are still here & some of them have their wives with them.  The Hotel is still full.  But a more anxious set of fellows I never saw.  General Hamilton told me the other day that it was intimated in the Charleston Courier that I was here seeking the consulate at Liverpool & that General Thompson had come on to assist me.  I have written a very severe reply for the Charleston Courier & not one to be published in that paper.  I see from the last Charleston Courier several extracts from my letters & notices of me stating that I am employed in the Gardiner case &c.  The Washington papers & the New York papers all announce me as one of the counsel of Gardiner & that I am from South Carolina &c.  Thompson says that if I acquit myself well in this case Gardiner will employ me in the Equity cases which will pay enormous fees.

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  Tomorrow I shall get any letters you have written on Sunday.  Saturday no mail leaves Greenville which accounts for my not receiving any letters today.  You must continue to write to me till I tell you to stop.  Let me hear all about the children & tell me what they are doing & how they are.  If you want money you can borrow of Elford.

       I see now I shall not be at home before the last of return week & perhaps not till Anderson court.  As I have got into the case I must stick to it.  It will give me some fame anyhow & perhaps be the means of turning over a new leaf in my book of fortune.
       
       	I met Dr. Hayne in the streets today.  President Fillmore has gone to Charleston where he is to be the guest of Governor Aiken for some days.  He then goes to New Orleans & returns up the Mississippi river.
       
       I hope your mother Susan & children & Anne are all well.  Remember me to them.  Give my love to the children.  It is now about nine oclock & the mails here just arrived from New York.  I will go down & look at the papers & then go to bed & make up for my loss of sleep last night with Beattie & Grady till after midnight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have rec[eive]d no letters from you for the last two days.  It is now nine oclock in the night & I have just returned from Bradleys office & got my supper.  We have commenced the Gardiner case & it opens badly.  All day till four oclock we were closely engaged in the Court House.  Since that time we have been engaged in consultation.  I feel fatigued & depressed but I hope the base may take a better turn tomorrow.   made a very able opening speech against Gardiner & his counsel Bradley & Carlisle  [have] been not disposed to make one in reply before offering testimony.  I have at last got Bradley to agree to a different order of battle.  He will open in the morning.  I told him my rule was to fight every inch of ground & always keep a bold front.  The case is full of mistry.  No one can tell the result.  General Thompson is quite uneasy.  But my rule is not to despair.

	I hope you have not stopped writing to me under the impression I am returning home.  I shall certainly be here all of next week.  Mr.  the assistant of the district attorney who spoke this morning is the brother of Mrs. McCray.  I met him at the Virginia Springs in 1846.  He seems very kind & friendly on meeting me in court & wished to know if I had been able to get comfortable rooms & seemed disposed to provide for me &c.  I met his brother Dr.  the other day.  He came to see Burt when he was sick.  He told me that his sister had become very large & was married to a gentleman in Baltimore.  

	Col. Orr & Summer left here this morning.  Col. Summer sends his compliments to you & says that although he never had the pleasure of seeing you he entertains a high opinion of you from your children whom he has seen, Frank, Willie & Anna & also from your husband whom he regards a man of taste &c.  The Col. came back from New York rather cooled in his love affair.

	I have nothing new to write you & shall Have nothing for several days to come.  The Indians came down to see me this evening just after I had got out of court but nothing further has been arranged in their business.  One of them is a full blooded Indian and cannot speak English.  The others are half breeds.  They know Mrs. Doctor Butler very well.  William is cleverTom not very well.  Judge Hicks one of the delegation was raised about Bachelors Retreat in Pickens.  Adair another one of them used to know my family.  

	How little I expected to be gone so long when I started.  The Patriot & my letters are greatly read & sought for in Washington.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	On my return from the Court House today at four oclock I met General Thompson with your letter in his hand at the door of the Hotel waiting for me to open it & tell him the news from Greenville.  He did not receive any letters today, nor did he yesterday.  Your letter was dated last Sunday & you spoke of the deep snow.  It was refreshing to be rewarded with a letter from my wife after a fatiguing day in the court House.  

	The case of Gardiner goes on better today & I think a change has taken place in the minds of the Jury after hearing the statement of our side of the case from Bradl[e]y.  he made the opening speech for Gardiner & Carlisle & myself will argue the case after we have gone through the testimony.  But we are all making speeches on points of testimony throughout the day.  The newspapers are reporting our speeches.  I see a pretty full report this morning in the Republic of the arguments yesterday.  I see it stated in all the newspapers that I am here as counsel for Gardiner.  The Southern Standard this morning had long extracts from my letters & pronounced them the best travelling gossip it had even seen.  

	General Thompson has just come up from the Reading Room & says that the gentlemen there who were in court today state that I outspoke all of the lawyerslongsome of them said there was no comparison between my speaking & that of the others.  I only addressed the court for a few minutes.  I am pleased that my mode of speaking is so much admired.  When I come to make theargument I hope to do well.

	After writing the above I went down to supper & whilst sitting at the table talking to Major Wigg of South Carolina who has just got a claim passed Congress for fifty or sixty thousand dollars on account of his grandfathers losses in the revolution, and who was the brother in law of Col. Isaac Hayne the martyr,  I was requested by Mr. Colcock to go with him & various others to see Governor [Nathaniel P.] Tallma[d]ge & hear him talk about spiritual rappers & I went with them.  It is now Sunday morning before breakfast.  I did not return till near mid morning from Governor Tallma[d]ges & on my return found a short letter from you dated Monday last.  I was glad to hear from you again a day later than my letter rece[ive]d yesterday morning.  General Thompson  came into my room & I read a portion of your letter to him.  If Mrs. Thompson only knew with how much interest he looks forward to the reception of a letter by me from you she would certainly write him oftener.  

	My visit to Governor Tallma[d]ge & the rappers I will write out for the Patriot. He told the most wonderful & marvellous things done by the spirits to him.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you yesterday after I had written & deposited my letter in the mail in the box in which you state that you had rece[ive]d three letters that morning (Sunday) from me.  I am sorry that my letters reach you so much together.  It must be a task to read them all together.  

	I was glad to hear that all were well & that you were preparing to have beef.  I think you might wean master Hext now & feed him on beef stake.  You stated he was twenty 0ne months old.  I dreamed about the little fellow last night.  How happy I should be to see you all.  No consideration could induce me to absent myself from you & the children as these members of Congress do from their wives & families.

	Yesterday I dined with Judge Butler & his mess. Consisting of Senators Mason & Hunter of Virginia & Atkinson of Missouri & Holmes of Charleston.  I spent a very pleasant day.  Judge Butler & myself took a long walk in the forepart of the day & were starting to walk again after dinner when we met two Englishmen calling to see him.

	The trial of Gardiner goes on today.  How long it will last no one can tell.  You will see a report of the whole case in the daily Republic of Washington.  You cab get the Republic at the Patriot office.  I will not stop until the evening & write you a line after I come out of court.

	It isa now eight oclock at night & I have just returned from the Court House.  We sat in court till half after four oclock in the evening & then Mr. [James M.] Carlisle one of Dr. Gardiners lawyers insisted on Mr. [Joseph H.] Bradl[e]y & myself going home with him & taking dinner.  I am glad I went, for he lives in more magnificence than the President himself.  He married the niece of Madame Calderon, the wife of the Spanish Minister, & his wifes sister is married to one of the Spanish Legation.  His mother, wife, sister in law & her husband the Spanish secretary, an another Spanish attache.  Bradl[e]y & or some of the Navy were present.  His house is a palace & furnished like one.  I went up into a chamber to wash my hands, & thereby saw the whole house.  His wife and the whole household were so cozy & familliar, that I felt at home amidst all the splendor around me.  I was in a pleasant mood, & had become very intimate with Carlisle & made myself easy with his wife, mother & childrenthree pretty little boys the oldest not more than five years old.  The Spanish gentlemen were good looking & familliar.  Mrs. Carlisle said she had enquired a good deal every day about the case, Dr. Gardiner & his counsel, & asked how Mr. Perry looked whilst the case was going on.  I suppose Mr. Carlisle carried me home with him to show me.  I spoke in high terms of Madame Calderons Book, saw her portrait.  His youngest son is thirteen months old & talks, but cant walk.  

	We have made no progress in the case today.  No letters from you, so I will bid you good night.  God bless you & the children, B.F. Perry

	I am so much occupied night & day with Dr. Gardiner, his counsel & his case that I have no time to write you.  I am afraid too that his case will result badly.  The testimony yesterday was very strong against him.  We are all alarmed for the first time.  Gardiner seems less alarmed than his counsel General.  Thompson feels very much the weight of the testimony.

	I read a long letter from you yesterday informing me that Cox, Will & Jenkins will had been sustained.  This is good news.  I am glad my letters are in demand.  They are so here.

	I have had a dreadful cold & my hands have all pealed over again.  The cool fires are very bad.  The room is too much heated at night.

	I Am almost crazy to leave Washington & get back to you & the childrenmy home & my comforts.  It has been near five weeks since I left home.  There is no telling when the case will be ended.

	I am not sorry that I have taken the trip for I have really seen a great deal & become known to a great many & I hope it will be of service to me hereafter.  But I am now through with all that & wish to be at home again.  

	You must request Col. Townes & Mr. Elford to attend to all my matters at Greenville or on the circuit.  I shall be at home before Greenville court if I have to quit here in the midst of my speech.  

	I am sorry to hear that my old friend Col. Dunkin is sinking.  I hope he may live till I return home & see him once more.

	The Senate is still in session.  But I have been nowhere except to the court House.  Mr. May the principal counsel for the Testates has shown me great politeness & attention.  He is an able & most eloquent advocate.  Thompson tells me that there is great public expectation to hear me speak & that I have already produced a very decided impression on the Court & crowd.

	I rece[ive]d lst night a letter of encouragement from Col. B.F. Heard of Charlestonalso a letter from Dr. Gibbes of Columbia about my letters in the Patriot.  

	Write to me every day & tell me all the news you have. Give my love to your mother & Susan & Anne & all our dear children.  Tell them I hope to see them improved very much when I return.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d no letter from you yesterday& I have no news to write you except that my cold is better & I am the most anxious to return home that was ever in Washington.

	The case of [George A.] Gardiner progresses slowly & I am tired out with it.  The present aspect of the case is a bad one.  What turn it may take I know [not].  I am afraid however that the Government Has some strong testimony to offer yet.  They have already produced a pile of letters of Dr. Gardiners to prove that he was at a different place at the time he alleges to have been at his mines.  We shall prove the existence of his mines, but there is anthat the government will show this is all storm & pretense.

	I hope to hear from you this morning.  It is a great comfort to hear from you & I feel deeply the disappointment.  I wish you would write me more about the children in all of your letters.  I wish to know all about you & them.  Let me hear how they get on at schoolhow they behave what they are doing.

	But I hope to be at home before you can answer this letter.  I must now conclude & go to breakfast.  If I had anything to write longer.  Your affect[ionate] husb[an]d, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you this morning whilst at Bradl[e]ys office before going into the court House.  General Thompson brought it to me but rece[ive]d none for himself.  Your letter was dated Saturday & Sunday & you stated that you had not rece[ive]d any letters from me Sunday morning.  I am always sorry to hear that you do not rece[ive] a letter from me, or that you have rece[ive]d two or three at once.  I am afraid you tire in reading them when so many come at once.  

	I am glad to hear that Anna is like her papa & does not desire honors & distinctions.  Anna is a smart little girl & I have always thought she was a remarkable girl for her agesensible & affectionate.   Willie, too, I think will be like me & let honors sent him instead of hunting them.  He will I hope, however, will be like me in another respect & improve him mind & cultivate his nature, & moral feelings.  Frank is a chop of good looks & good principles & will be a favorite everywhere.  Fanny I think will make a great woman & a very handsome woman.  Hext has his tallents to devellope yet & god bless the little fellow.  How I would like to see him.

	I am not able to give you any good news as to Gardiners case.  We have made more progress today than any day heretofore.  I hope we shall get through next week.  I will make my speech first & leave.  It will take a day for each one of us to speak.  General Thompson is prepared for the worst & has his address already written to publish & in case Gardiner is convicted.  But I will never give up till a verdict is found.  

	If I were to come to Washington to live I would like very much to have Elford as a partner.  I have no doubt at all that we could make a fortune here is a few years in various professional pursuits.  Bradl[e]y and Carlisle are making a small fortune every year.  Carlisle lives like a prince as I wrote you.

	I hope something good will come of my visit to Washington.  I ought to be compensated for my absence from home & from my dear wife & from my children.  

	I am glad you have Susan with you.  do not hold everybodyat all.  I pity her & commiserate her condition.  But her misfortunes are owing into her want of worldly wisdom and patience & suffering and Christian forbearance.  By fretting at everything we soon become so that nothing can please us or satisfy us.  But as you say I must think with you on this subject & will promise to do so like a good husband.  

	I will write for the Patriot.  But I am so much engaged that I can see nothing to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday morning and I shall have time to write a long letter in the course of the day.  I am now waiting for breakfast.  I hope when the mail comes to the Bar at nine or ten oclock I shall receive a letter from you.  I had no letters from you yesterday nor did General Thompson receive any.  It is some consolation when one does not receive a letter from Greenville that the other has.  But I receive two or three to his one generally.

	I intended to write you last night but I dined at Mr. Bradleys & did not return till late & then found the Cherokee agent Judge Hicks waiting to see me.  I am in hopes we shall be able to accomplish the Treaty before we leave Washington.  Judge Hicks had seen the Secretary of the Interior & he expressed a willingness to take it up as soon as he could Col. Thomas an agent of the North Carolina Cherokees came to see me yesterday & expressed the same hope.  This will be a comfortable thing if we can accomplish it.

       The Gardiner trial goes on slowly & the testimony very much against him.  I hope to get through in the course of this coming week.  At least I think we can get through the testimony & I can make my speech.  But everything is uncertain.  Gardiner is the greatest mystery I ever heard of.  He seems unmoved & perfectly innocent & indifferent.  He is a very handsome fellow & has a fine open countenance, a sparkling black eye, black whiskers & beard under the chindresses very neatly & is amiable & accomplished & talented0has been a universal favorite wherever he has been.  Still I am afraid he perpetrated the fraud.  I am likewise afraid he may be convicted.  This I would not say to anyone but yourself.  You & I are the same person you have often told me & therefore in writing to you I am only thinking to myself.
       
       We had a fine dinner yesterday at Bradl[e]ys & this evening he is to take us out to his farm eight miles from the city.  It is an old family mansion to which he moves in the Summer.  Brad[le]y has three daughters & one sonone daughter married & two single all being in the house with him and all grown.  His single daughters are pretty & one of them quite intelligent.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y looks ten years too old for her husband.  He got married at nineteen! And looks quite young now.  General Thompson made some remark to Mrs. Bradl[e]y about her husband which I dont remember.  But she replied to him by anto his having been twice married that gentlemen who had so many wives never grew old.  
       
       	Late last night Mr. Carlisle came to our room.  He is a most excellent gentleman & was to have dined with us at Mr. Bradleys but his wife had some company when he went home.  I told you in a previous letter that she was the niece of the Spanish ambassador & one of her sisters to one of the Legation with a Spanish name which I cannot pronounce.  They live in great style.  Thompson says Carlisles mother was a greater woman & that he made his fortune by his& he is still a young man.  I thought his mother a very fine interesting old lady, & carried her to the table & had a great deal of talk with her.  If she ever was, as Thompson says, it is a magnificent change for the old lady in her old age.
       
       I will now give you some account of Gadsbys Hotel, the table, company &c.  You no doubt would like to see just how I am situated.  The Hotel is a pretty large one but not like the National.  In the dining room there are three large round tables at each one of which some twenty or thirty persons may be seated, all facing as it were each other.  There is nothing on the table but butter & bread.  You take your seat & a servant enquires what you will have for breakfast.  He then goes & cooks or brings you whatevet you directcoffee, buckwheat cakes, beef stake, mutton chops, omelette, eggs, fish, tea &c.  Sometimes you have to wait twenty or thirty minutes.  During this time you talk or read the newspapers.  They dine at ? after 2 oclock & at 4 oclock.  You eat at either table as you please. The servant brings you what you will have.  A bill of fare is by your plate.  Supper is any time between six and ten at night.  
       
       I must now go to breakfast & will write you another letter if I have time.  
       
       God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
       
P.S.  Your letter of Monday is rece[ive]d.  I thank you for it.   Will write you again this eveningno letters to General Thompson this morning.

	I wrote you yesterday morning & after closing my letter I rece[ive]d yours of Monday in which you mentioned that Col. Ware would come up & see me as soon as I returned home.  I shall certainly be at home in time to prepare for his defence.  I hope to get off this week.  But I must have patience and endeavour to make something out of the Indians or Gardiner before leaving.

	Yesterday evening General Thompson & myself rode out with Mr. Bradl[e]y to his country seat eight miles into Maryland.  I was delighted with the trip & the country and Cherry  the name of Bradl[e]ys mansion.  The house is one hundred years old.  His father was assistant Post Master General under General Washington & lasted in office till the administration of General Jackson.

	I have written an account of my visit to Bradl[e]ys farm for the Patriot.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y is as native of New Haven & her name was Tuttle.  But Bradl[e]y tells me there are none of the name or kindred there now.  He said he thinks he has heard his wifes sister who married Sterly speak of Mrs. McCall in New Haven.  She was then perhaps single.

	My letters to the Patriot reflecting & sneering at the secessionists wishing office have excited a good deal of interest in Charleston.  The Mercury has opened his fire on me.  Last night I rece[ive]d a letter from Gilmore Simms complaining that I had done him injustice & that he was not a secessionist.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. B.F. Hunt encouraging me about the Gardiner case.  I also rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Gibbes about my letter to the Smithsonian Institute.

	You say your mother thinks so Badly of her kindredthat I must confess they are not great favorites with me.  Arthur Hayne hardly enquired after you all & I saw nothing more of him after speaking to him in the House of Representatives.  He staid here some time.  Ingersoll did appear to take more interest in enquiring after you all than Arthur Hayne.  This however was very natural.  The only heard from you presumably and the other had not for many years.

	I had you before me last night in my dreams.  I wish the dream could be realized, & I could be with you & the children again.  It is pleasant to go from home occasionally, but it is still more pleasant to return home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I came out of the Court House this evening at half after four oclock tired & hungry & exhausted, & thought I would go to the Post office & see if I could not get a letter from home, from my wife to cheer me & comfort me in my lonelyness & distress, and sure enough two were handed me & one from Judge ONeall & one from Mr.Carter of Charleston.  But my dear wife how can you scold your husband so poor fellow, when he is away & wants comfort!  Did you not read about what I said about Carlisle having a sweet wife & children to greet him & smile on him & love him when he comes home exhausted & fatigued in  Keep your scolds till I come home.  I can bear them better there than herenever say one unkind word to me from home.  I had rather receive no letter from you at all.  You must remember what I do is not without consideration & reflection & is for the best.  Moreover I have a right to do as I please with my own money which I have worked hard for & who=ich no one gave me.  I provide for my family pretty well & am not very extravagant.  It is just such nervous sensibility on the part of Susan that has made her life an unhappy one.  He husband is a fool & has nothing to sustain him but the bottle when he [is] crossed or vexed.  had good sense enough to reason the matter with you.  But never write me any more such letters.  They crush my heart when away, far away from you.   

	Poor Col. [Benajah] Dunham!  His death has made me sad.  I am not well myself.  The Gardiner trial is going badly.  The prospect of getting him is remote.  General Thompson got a letter from his wife this evening and Ihim the one you enclosed.  I also read him what you said about Mrs. Thompson.  He insisted on hearing it.

	Judge ONeall  & Mr. Carter are bursting with indignation at the  appointment of the secessionists to office.  They wrote me that the people of Charleston are indignant at the appointment of Colin [Wiliam John] Graysons place.
	The best way to please the President is to keep away from him & make his acquaintance at some other time.  But I shall go and see him before I leave Washington.  Judge ONeall begs me to go & tell him about the secessionists & that he must appoint Union men.

.Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you this morning in which you stated that Mr. Elford had returned from Laurens Court & had been to see you.  I thank you with Mr. Elford that I have lost nothing by my trip to Washington although I should make nothing by it.  I have seen a good deal of the world of men by my visit, and I shall return to Greenville better satisfied to remove there with you & the children.  It does one great good to go abroad occasionally & it makes him love his home more.  We want a change too occasionally.  Variety is the spice of life.  Sameness is tiresome &c.

	The Gardiner case goes on most slowly & seems to be endless.  We commenced the examination of a witness yesterday & will not finish with him till twelve oclock tomorrow!  I am afraid if you do go & see Mrs. Thompson till you have good news to carry about the Gardiner case, your visit will be postponed a long time.  I am thoroughly convinced of the whole matter being a fraud & my strong  apprehension is that he will be convicted.  This however you may keep to yourself.

	I hope you will go & see Mrs. Thompson as often as you can.  I think how all I can learn from you & the servant [is] that she does not like the spiritual rappers.  It is a pretty good idea that I have visiting the General to leave the spirits in Washington & not carry them home with him.  Remember that one of these spirits he has been talking so much with is that of his first wife.  It would be dreadful indeed to a second to have the spirit of the first in the house with her & talking to her husband!  I thought these spiritual rappings &would excite Mrs. Thompsons--a wife is not willing to have a divided allegiance in the heart of her husband.

	I do not suppose I have lost much by my absence from Greenville.  Tell Mr. Elford to sign my name to the draft of a thousand dollars & get the money for it.  Let him write my name like I sign it & send off the draft & pay Dr. T

	I hope Becky is not very sick, & that her sickness may be such as you suppose.  

	I think when we meet again, we shall have been absent so long from each other that [we] will have to be married over again & I will present you with the tea set & the goblets as a bridal gift.

	If I can find time I will procure a cheap & beautiful ring with my likeness in it for you.  I will have your likeness taken on a locket for myself or on a broach.

	I must now quit & go into consultation with Bradl[e]y and Carlisle.  It is now seven oclock & we went at that hour to examine Col. Abbot & Captain Slocum.

	God bless you & the children & preserve you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I went to the Post office again yesterday evening & rece[ive]d a letter from you & one from Col. Ware.  I am glad you were in amood & wrote me aletter.  I thank you for it.  General Thompson was  not with me but rece[ive]d no letters from his wife.  I read him what you said about your mothers visit to Mrs. Thompson & the fine appearance of his boy.

	I am glad my dear wife that you value my letters so much & read them so often.  I was afraid that I wrote you so much & that I should tire your patience.

	I am glad so much respect was paid my old friend Col. Dunham at his funeral.  He was a public spirited & enterprising man.  I should have been most happy to have seen him once more before his departure
	
	I have nothing to write you.  The Gardiner case occupies my whole time & I see and hear nothing out of court of any interest.

	My Mobile correspondent & friend on the Kennedy case, Mr. Campbell has been appointed to the Supreme bench of the United States for the Alabama & Louisiana district.  I am glad of it for he is a gentleman & an able lawyer.  

	Col. Ware wrote me a letter from Laurens court & was very anxious to see me.  He had not rece[ive]d my letter.  I wrote him a letter immediately & am surprised he did not receive it.  I shall write him again this morning & will certainly be at home by Greenville court if I have to give up Gardiner & his case.

	From present appearance I am afraid I shall not be at home much before Greenville court.  My patience is worn out by the dilitory proceedings in court.  I am heartily disgusted with the case & would leave it now, but for General Thompson.  He says it would prejudice the case, and he would die here if I left him.

	Yesterday evening I went from the Post office to see theof Mr. Henry an account of them for the Patriot.  I rece[ive]d the Patriot yesterday & read all of my letters with great interest.  I think they must be interesting to the people of Greenville & to the whole state.  They are copied into all the papers everywhere.

	After returning late last night from Mr. Bradl[e]ys office I took two pills with a mixture of calomel & I feel better this morning.  My cold has been a most dreadful one indeed.  I was under the necessity of using two or three handkerchiefs every day.  

	I must now conclude as I have to write to Col. Ware & the Patriot.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning enclosing one to General Thompson from Mrs. Thompson.  It was handed to me just as I was preparing to start to the Court House.  I did not expect any letters from you today nor do I know how a letter written on Saturday night could have reached me so soon.  But I hope heretofore I shall get my letters sooner.

	In regard to my returning home, you need not look for me till Greenville Court.  I shall certainly leave here in time to reach home Sunday before Court.  Whether I shall be able to get off sooner is very doubtful.  The case goes on very slowly.  I begin to think Gardiner may be acquitted.  But they have not got through the testimony on the part of the prosecution.

	Tomorrow is good Friday & court has adjourned until Saturday.  I have written some account of our conversation & remarks in court about good Friday for the Patriot.  I wish I could see the Southern Patriot tonight & perhaps you are now reading my letters to the children.  It is eight oclock.  I have spent the evening with Judge Evans in the reading room & have just come up to my room.  The Judge is very social & clever.  He says he will spend next summer in Greenville.

	I have not seen Judge Butler this week.  In fact I see no one & am almost as much out of company as if I were at home.  Tomorrow I may go to church.

	I doubt whether Mrs. Thompson will write often of her fifteen year marriage than she does now.  I have alluded to our correspondence in my last letter to the Patriot.  We are like lovers still and something we have lovesor rather you give me a lovers scolding.  But it is said that there little affairs increases ones love.  But you ought to know that mine cannot be increased.

	I have noof your proposing so utterly impossible a thing as for Susan to live with us.  It is out of the question for a thousand reasons.

	Let me tell you something more about the spiritual rappers.  There are some young ladies in this Hotel. The Miss Blounts, who tried last night & made the table run all over the room && answer questions.  All persons are not mediums.  When you sit around the table you must have your attention fixed on the matter & your wish for the table to move constantly in your mind.

	    I wish your mother may be able to sell her House & make a trip to the north.  It would perhaps improve Annes health & make them all better satisfied with Greenville.  

	I am glad you made Anne decline theof Mary.  She is too young for so high an honor.  I am glad likewise Miss Brooks was elected.

	My dear Liz how happy I should be to see you & be with you tonight at our own home, surrounded by all the children.  I will see about the ring tomorrow as I have leisure.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your very short letter this morning dated last Monday morning.  Your letters come much quicker than they did some weeks since.  General Thompson has been lodging complaints against the Post office in Charleston with the Post Master General.  But a short letter from you is better than none.  To know that you & the children & servants are all well is sufficient for a good letter from home.

	I am getting on very slowly on the Gardiner case, but think from present appearances that he will be acquitted.  I am afraid however that the testimony will take so long that I shall not be able to argue the case & get home to Greenville Court.  You may expect me Sunday night before court.  I can leave here Wednesday morning & get home Saturday night next Wednesday week.  This seems a long time to look forward to returning home.  General Thompson says I am acquiring fame & will get a good fee.

	I met this morning Frank Key a lawyer the son of the author of the Star Spangled Banner who told me there was no doubt of our acquitting Gardiner.  This seems to be the general sentiment.  Thompson says the case will give me a national reputation & be of service to me at home.  I despair occasionally & then I am in better spirits.  

       This being good Friday there is no court as I wrote you last night.  I went up to the daguerreotypist to get the ring you requested.  He had none that were pretty but said he would send to get an assortment tomorrow.  I am to call Monday morning.
       
       General Thompson rece[ive]d a letter from Mrs. Thompson this morning & she mentioned seeing you at church Sunday.  She writes more constantly now than she did at first.
       
       I am to analyze the testimony in the Gardiner case today, & make out the heads of my arguments nor have I much to write & will therefore make this a short letter.
       
       I hope you will write more about the children & tell them to behave themselves or you will write they are not good.  I hope the children were pleased with the medals sent them.  I think Mr. Beatty might have come to see you & tell you about seeing me.  I am glad you are pleased with the broach & are wearing it.  The eyes have a sleepy appearance& I was afraid you would notice it.  I wish I could have your likeness taken for myself in a handsome locket.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines before going into court, as I will not have time to write afterwards in time for the mail.  

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Tuesday and General Thompson rece[ive]d one from Mrs. Thompson.  He has complained to her & she now writes oftener.  

	I am sorry to hear Becky is unwell & hope she may not get worse.  I am glad you mention in your last letter all about the children.  Here are the letter I read with most interest.  You must not worry me so much about office, fee, & seeing the President.  Be assured I will do in thewhat my best judgement dictates.  The President is annoyed to death at present & I have no doubt hates the sight of a man.  Thousands are calling every day & can only say howdy & good day.  There is not a moment to talk with him.  You speak & pass on.  In the Gardiner case I will do the best I can.  In regard to office there is none that I would have.  Have nothing for the pictureto my dear wife butondo no good & only fret & worry me.  And I have enough to fret & work about in this case & in my absence from home & anxiety to return home.  Your letters should soothe me & comfort me.  Kindness & love is what I want from you & the children not so much of advice and scolding &  Look on the bright side of our picture.  It is a beautiful onehealth &--a fair standing in the worldand hope in our childrengood & pure heartsand with these we ought to be happy.  

	Yesterday a black & dirty fellow came in the Hotel to sell pork.  General Thompson said to me that fellow is happier than any man he leaves behind him in Washington.  I replied yes the President not excepted.  There is constant & unpleasant vexation in office & honors.  If you could only see the miserable looking faces here among the office seekers you would feel thankful that I was not amongst them.

	I still have a bad cold & constant blowing of my nose, which annoys me very much.  I am prepared to make a good speech in this case but in allwill have to close for Greenville court before the case is argued.

	I must now quit & go into court.  There is some sharp sparing in court every day between May & Bradl[e]y & Carlisle.  I tell them we are more cautious in South Carolina.

	God bless you & the children.  Give my love to all of them & to your mothers & sisters. Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I will write you a few lines before setting off for Charleston.  I have been so much engaged here that I have not had time to write you.  I have written two letters for the Patriot & will write another this evening., all of which will go in the same mail.  Willie wrote you yesterday whilst I was at the College.  He & Anna went to Mrs. Taylors yesterday & Mrs. Taylor is to send for Anna to dine with her today.  There is no one at Taylors but his wife.

	You will see my letters to the Patriot & I will noy repeat what they contain.  We had a pleasant trip down.  Mrs. Jenkins, Mary & Matilda Croft came down with us & Anna spent most of the time with them.  Col., Perrin & his daughter came also from Abbeville.  Anna was put in a room with Miss Perrin.  She has now returned & Anna is rooming with the  They all seem glad to see her.  I took tea last night with Professor Brumby & saw his wife & daughters.  The whole Board of Trustees took tea there after adjournment in College.  Mrs. Brumby enquired very kindly after you & especially your mother.  She asked me if Mrs. McCall was much broke in appearance.  I replied that I thought not that she look[s] exceedingly well for a lady of her age.  She asked if she looked as well as Mrs. W  Hayne.  I told her a great deal better & much younger.  She replied Mrs. Hayne was the younger which I knew.

	I went out shopping this morning & bought a waist coat & cloak for Willie five dollars-- a pair of pants & suspenders for myself ten dollarsa pair of boots for Willie & cap $7.50a hat & pair of boots for myself $14.00.  This is all.  Willie has lost my diamond breast pin.

	I saw Mr. Brown in his studio this morning.  He seemed delighted when I told him General Thompson & others said your likeness was perfect & better than mine.  He told me what he had promised you & I replied that you were still disposed to adhere to his promise.  Mrs. Brown has been unwell with a cold but I saw her this morning.

	Willie & Anna are both behaving remarkably well & much noticed.  I have introduced Willie to most of the Professors in College.  I had a long talk this morning with Dr. Lieber.  I also met Dr. Thornwell & had quite a chat with him.

	Mr. Brown directed me to Youngs jewelry store where there weas a perfect music box.  The price is $75.00 & it plays almost equal to a piano.  I saw another which played twelve tunes for fifty dollars.  But I did not purchase either of them.  At some future day in New York I will purchase one for you.  I have had my cane nicely mended, 75 cts & new crystal in my watch & Willies.  I have exchanged my prayer book & got one with a gold clasp a late fashion of binding.

	I carried Anna out with me this morning shopping.  She is now with the& Will is reading Dr. Liebers book on Civil Liberty in the room where I am writing.

	We reached here yesterday to dinner & had a very pleasant trip down.    You will see my letter to the Patriot for all that.

	Willie & Anna have gone out visiting your kins people.  I have been shopping.  I bought the frames for our portraits at $18 each.  They will be sent up in seven or eight days.  I gave your Bill to& to fill & forward the groceries.  They do not want the money before next year (February will do).  I thought after getting all the expensive articles the other items though numerous would not amount to much.

	Yesterday evening we walked over the Battery & around the city, Willie, Anna & myself & Col. Irby.  We met a good many acquaintances.  Dr. [Samuel Henry] Dickson & Judge King have both promised to call & see me[Richard] Yeadon also.  I saw Col. Hayne & Col. John Cunningham.  Mrs. Cunningham has returned home to remain & will not return to Philadelphia at all.  Miss Pamela will remain in Philadelphiadoes not intend returning.  Singular to be thus separated from an only daughter & the sick & bedridden daughter from her mother.

	I have stopped at the Mills House & it is truly a Palace.  I am glad I did not stop at the American.  Sitting at the dinner yesterday Mrs. Beadon said her daughter asked if Willie was the brother of Anna whom they knew to be my daughter.  She replied they are so unlike they could not be brother & sister.  She is the niece of Col. Davie of Chester & a very pleasant lady.  Beadon [Richard Stobo Bedon] is a Senator from one of the Parishes.  We have to spend a great deal of our time at the table eating dinner & breakfast.  But the fare is superb.  I told Mrs. Beadon that we had five children & they were all unlike each other.  I went over Bancrofts store with youngthis morning.  I have not yet seen Augustus Hoke.

	My dear Liz, this letter was broken off very abruptly yesterday & I did not have an opportunity of finishing it.  This morning Mrs. Edward Hayne sent for the children to dine with her, but I intend going to the& they will not get back in time.

	Last night Col. Beadon & his daughters & myself & children went to the Theatre & were all very much pleased.  Anna & Willie

	Col. Pickens & his daughters are at  We have a pleasant company.  Willie & Anna yesterday visited Col. Arthur Hayne, Mrs. WHayne, Mrs. General Hayne, your aunt Hayne, Mrs. Turner.  Your uncle Arthur said he would call & see me this morning.  They saw Mrs. Emily Hayne in visiting.  They have not yet been to Mrs. McCalls.

	I shall return to Greenville Thursday if possible.  I hope to hear from you today.  I have a great deal to talk about when we meet.  But not time to write it.

	I must now prepare to visit Sullivans Island.  Your uncle Arthur called & staid so long that the hour for taking the boat has passed over.  He invited us to dine with him Monday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter of Friday this morning and thank you kindly for it.  I am in such confusion here & so much to attend to, and so many of my friends to me that I have not time to write as I did in Washington.  I have just written two sheets for the Patriot.  I know you are willing for write for the Patriot although it may interfere with writing to you.

	Yesterday Anna William & myself dined with Judge Henry & his children.  It was a very pleasant party. The children looked well.  Today we dine with Col. Arthur P. Hayne.  Yeadon wishes me to dine with him before I leave.  Wednesday we dine with Mr. Robinson who carried me to his house & put his carriage at my service.  He has been very kind.  Mr. Spratt editor of the Standard has invited me to take tea at his house tomorrow evening.

	This morning when I went downstairs Col. Pickens told me it was announced in the Standard that I had called at that office & was staying at the Mills House if anyone wish[ed] to see me to go there & ask for the finest looking gentleman in the House & I would be seen.  You will see the compliment in this mornings Mondays Standard.  This mornings Courier also notices my arrival & compliments me.  Coil. Pickens & his daughters are here & will remain till next week.

	I have done all Annas shopping.  She has gone to see Mrs. W.Hayne this morning & your aunt Mary McCall.  Willie has gone to Sullivans Island with Pierce Williamson.  I am to go with Judge Henry to the College at twelve oclock.  Yesterday I saw Mr. Petigru at church & at Judge Henry.

	I have concluded to stay till after Wednesday & perhaps Thursday.  You will see me in Greenville Saturday night.  I went to church yesterday with Col. Arthur Hayne and saw Mrs. Hayne.

	I must now conclude.  I am glad you & the children are enjoying yourselves.  I wish you were with me.  It is more pleasant for us to visit town together.  There you will be in a different circle from your friends.  My friends and your relations are distinctive.  When we are together we see them both.  Next spring we will go down together.  I saw General Martin on Saturday & one of his little sons.

	I arrived here yesterday evening very much fatigued, but went to bed at eight oclock & feel quite well this morning.

	We had a pleasant trip down in the way of company and so forth.  The cars were crowded before Abbeville.  A good many came from Andersonamongst them F. Burt who greeted me most cordially.  

	Janney & his little daughter enquired where Anna was.  Flora Jones came up to me with Col. Irbys daughter & spoke & enquired after Anna.  They are now here but go back to school this morning & will return Saturday.  Janney says he can find a room for Anna.  There are no ladies here now, but will be on Saturday.  She would have been rather lost amidst so many men & no ladies.  Miss Irby & Flora Jones enquired if Anna was going to the commencement Ball.  I told them yes.  They spoke of not going, but I am sure they will.   

	I will be at the rail road depot at four oclock to meet Anna & Willie on Saturday.  Give them something to eat on the road & tell them not to get out of the cars on the road.

	The House is very full but upstairs seems quiet & pleasant.  I have seen a good many of my acquaintances.  There was nothing done yesterday in the legislature or court.

	Judge Frost has resigned& it is said that Chancellor Dargan & General Whitner intend to resign.  The labours of a Judge are now so arduous & keep them so much from home, that a man who can live without the, is not disposed to be a Judge.

	I am writing to you just after breakfast & just before going to the court of Appeals as you expressed a wish to know the time of day my letters are written.

	Col. Brockman lost his trunk yesterday, but it was found at Caldwells Tavern last night about eleven oclock.  The trunk had money in it.  Duncan & Elford are here & quite well.  Morgan has not come.  I am afraid he is sick.  McBee is not yet here.  I have heard nothing from old Mrs. Butler.

	I hope you and the children are all well.  Send all of my shirts by Willie.  Tell Reuben to haul out the manure & Charles to spade up the garden.  Let Reuben work all the horses occasionally to exercise them.  I have just been interrupted by a candidate for officeMr. Evans of Marion.  He was a long time giving me a history of parties in his district.

	I have but a few minutes to write you before breakfast, & will conclude my letter after breakfast.

	Last night I went to the meeting of the Board of Trustees & did not return till late.  Just before starting I met Dr. Campbell who brought me a message from Hopkins Williams that he would be down this week & pay me a few in the case of the State against Scurry.  This will be [a] good break if the old man does pay me $500.  I met Redwood last night & paid him $175 which I had for B Kelly &c of Baltimore.  He told me that Redfield had in Baltimore a most beautiful & splendid Pony for me & was going to write me about sending it on to me.

	I saw Captain Cunningham last night.  He says Miss Cunningham is improving very much since her return from Philadelphia.  Pamela is all over in biles & sores which the doctors think are evidence of returning health.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I met Mrs. Anderson & her little son.  She says her son & Mrs. Beadons son were very sad after Anna left Charleston that she was so lively the boys were greatly smitten with her.

	There is nothing doing in the Legislature.  P. McBee came yesterday & says old Mrs. Butler is as low as she can be to be alive.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear from you.  I am glad to hear Willie is working.

	There never was such a crowd before in Columbia.  Dr. Crook & Dr. Craft are here.

	I shall expect Willie & Anna Saturday.  You will receive this letter Friday night.  Tell them to be careful about keeping their seats in the cars & not to get out.   Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the College & will write you a few lines although it is now ten oclock in the night.

	Willie & Anna arrived here this evening about half after four. I went to the depot at three& found a good many waiting for members of their family.  The cars came filled with women kind principally.  All Abbeville came down.   Mrs. Jones & Betty Robinson were aboard.  Janneys House is like confusion compounded.  I gave up my room to Anna, Betty Robinson & Flora Jones.  They are stowed away very comfortably.  I took shelter with Duncan & Elford..   They gave up one bed to me & Willie.  But since that Willie & Willie Beattie have got a room in the garrett.  Duncan told me that Jones was very much effected by my kindness to his daughter & Betty Robinson who were roomless.  He proposed speaking.  I told Duncan I cou[l]d do nothing about it & had no objections.  His wife refused to look at me when I spoke to Betty Robinson.  Flora seems very kind.    

	Willie & Anna got down safely amidst the crowd.  Miss Perrin sent her brotherto come & take a seat by her.  She is a very interesting young lady.  I left Anna under her chargeI went to College.  Mrs. Trotter enquired very kindly after you & Anna.  The room is full of ladies.  Col. Carn has his wife here.  There are several ladies from Newberry&c.  Anna has already rece[ive]d a ticket to the Governors Ball.  Col. Wheaton presented me with a ticket as one of the aides de camp.  I think Anna had better go to Balls.  She will see & learn a great deal.  I will let Willie go to the commencement Ball.

	Professor Lewis R. Gibb[e]s of the Charleston College has been elected Professor of Mathematics in the South Carolina [College] in the place of Professor Williams who is paralyzed.  We made the election this evening.  Dr. Gibb[e]s of this place invited me to his party last night but I did not go.  Notwithstanding my Editorials in the Carolinian the Dr. seems friendly & kind.

	I will send Anna to see Mrs. Taylor. Tomorrow we go to church.  The next day is commencement.  Col. Herndon saw Anna this evening & was pleased with her.  He said she was a fine specimen of Greenville

        I will now close my letter.  Duncan is just going to bed.  Elford is writing & will return home Monday morning.  It is now almost eleven oclock.  I will write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

In the meantime his sisters will board at the Mansion House.  They are in bad health.  I have told Mr. Allston he could have my carriage to ride out with his sisters when he desired it.  You had better go & see them.  He thinks perhaps he may purchase a house already built & asked me if I know of any for sale.  I told him of your mothers house.  He may wish to see it.

	I have no time to write.  Anna does not care to go to the Ball tonight.  I will send them tomorrow to see Mrs. Taylor.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry

My dear Liz

	It is now six oclock in the evening & I Have not had a moments leisure since I got up; but as Anna has not written to you as I expected she would do, I will drop you a line.

	It is a hard matter to get Anna & Willie to do anything here & I begin to think there is too much confusion & company for children so small as they are.  I am afraid they will get spoilt.  Willie Beattie & young Buist leave here in the morning & I am glad on Willies account though he will deeply regret it.

	We had a little discussion in the Legislature today on the law prohibiting the circulatory small bills.  I made a few remarks.  Tonight I am invited to a party at Hammerscolds the German orch  Col., Jno Preston delivers a speech in the college chapel at about seven oclock.  There is also a meeting of the Editors this evening.

	I will write to the Patriot after I return from the college.  Anna & the young ladies speak of going to the college.  They went down to the State House this morning.  I have written Henry T. Thompsons report for him & will offer it tomorrow.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & will keep my letter open till I start to the college.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & am glad the groceries have arrived.  They will give you enjoyment in opening them & arranging them in the store house.

	You need not fear about Anna & Willie enjoying themselves.  I am glad thew cars are running to Greenville.  	I suppose Mr. Allston has arrived before this time & delivered my letter.

	I will not close my letter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the State House & ate my dinner.

	I see that Willie has been writing & I hope he has written to you.  But I cant find him.  I will however write you a line for fear he has not.

	Anna is downstairs & is going to walk to the Asylum with Miss Waistcot, Flora Jones & others.  She is enjoying herself very much.  The House is full of young ladies, but I hope they will go off in a day or two.  It is utter confusion.

	Today we had a little debate on the Electoral question.  I have not spoken.  There has been a great military parade here today.  Mrs. & Mr. Green are here from Greenville & Mrs. Green is rooming with Anna.  Mrs. Jones has become very civil to me.  But I have very little to say to her.  Flora Jones seems a clever girl & very kindly disposed.  Tom Earle is here & I saw him at a distance.

	I understand that Tom Beattie last summer carried on a systematic begging of money from all his acquaintances in New York.  He got fifty dollars out of Col. Herndon.  Herndon & his wife are here.  Anna has not yet been to Taylors.  Mr. Petigru came up this evening & also Barnwell Rhett.

	I will not close as company has come into the room.  If I get a letter from you I will write you again.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & thank you for it.  I am glad to hear that all of the groceries have arrived.  You can employ yourself for some time in fixing & arranging them.

	I enclose you an appointment for Henry D. Doyley as cadet.  You will please send it to him.

	Anna has just come to ask me to let her go to Charleston with Mr. & Mrs. Green who have invited her.  But I told her that she could not go.  That if she wished to leave Columbia she might go back to Greenville.  She was anxious to read your letter, but I was afraid she might talk about something in it.

	I will now close my dear wife.  Everybody seems to know that I write every day & frequently speak of it to me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from the State House tired & fatigued & have eaten my dinner.  I will write you a line for I find it impossible to get Willie or Anna to write.  After all I believe a husbands has more affection for his wife than a child for a mother.  Captain Brooks & his family have just arrived & the Captain has just come into our room & is talking to me whilst I am writing.  He will go up day after tomorrow.

	Anna is considering about going to the Governors Ball.  She does not wish to go.  But as all the rest are going, I told her she had better go.  I think that she isthat she has not a Ball dress.  Elford has just come down & brings me no letters.  I hope to hear when the mail is opened.  Elford says he saw Fanny & Hext yesterday & you were all well.

	We had considerable discussion today on the Calhoun monument & about that discussion I will write to the Patriot.  My room is now full, & they are all talking as I am writing in one corner.  They are all crowded here like boys & it is like living in a boys den.  I am tired of it.

	John Cunningham is here.  I saw him paying attention to Mrs. Brown today & drinking champaigne with her at the table.  Young Gantt on the other side of her & Brown next.  Poor fellow looked uneasy.  I doubt whether [page torn] any better thanought to lie.  She seems awoman, fond of attracting admiration.

	It is now raining & the weather is cold.  Mr. Arthur came into the room just now to see us.  It seems that EVERYBODY FROM Greenville is here.  Barnwell Rhett came up & spoke to me today.  He said he saw from my paper that I had been in Charleston & was greatly pleased with the Ballet troupe.    He asked if you were with me.

	I will now close till I hear from you.  The mail will be opened in a short time.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter.  I am surprised that Allston did not send over your letter.  I gave him a letter to Hoke & to Trevers.  See if they have rece[ive]d their letters.

	I will now conclude.  Hoyt wrote to rent my place for Mr. Dickey.

	The Legislature speak of coming up to Greenville Tuesday evening & going back Wednesday.  The President of the road has invited them.  It may be that a good many members accept the invitation.  I may come myself, & you must prepare to entertain two or three members.  I will write you tomorrow more about this matter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Today the Electoral Bill was discussed in the House & I shall speak next Monday.  Willie did not go to the Ball.  The crowd will go off in some measure tomorrow.   I hope so.  I enjoyed the Ball very much & had a great deal of pleasant chat with the governor & others.  I made only the acquaintance of Mrs. Chesnut amongst the ladies.  Mrs. Brown was there escorted by Mr. Murray.  I think he is a most devoted lover.  Poor Brown must

	I have just read your letter.  I am glad Mr. Allston called to see you.  The weather is shockingly bad.  Yeadon & Dunkin are now sitting by our fire reading the Southern Patriot.  It is in great demand.  I am glad you have got the pictures hung up.  I am afraid the bad weather will discourage the Miss Allstons.

	This is Sunday & Anna & Willie have gone to the Episcopal church with several others from this Hotel.  I am preparing for my speech tomorrow on the Electoral Bill.

	Yesterday I dined with Governor Manning.  Mrs. Manning enquired about [you] & the children.  She asked why you did not come down with me.  Said she always used to see me with a little Boy in the State House.  Asked me if it was my little daughter at the Ball the other night.  We had a very pleasant party.  But I had to meet the committee.  There was a granddaughter of Mrs. Singleton there, also Mrs. Dickinson a widow & Miss Manning sister of the governor.  Miss Dehad just returned from Philadelphia where she had been at school for four or five years.  She is one of the most intelligent & amiable & handsome young ladies I have seen.  Mrs. Manning told me that the Governor had told her a great deal about the mountain girls & beauties, that he had said so much about Miss Sally Thompson that she was anxious to see her.  Mrs. Manning did not seem like Mrs. Chesnut who told her husband whilst he was flirting with a young widow Mrs. Evans that it was a game she could play too although her hand was a little out At present.

	Just before going to church I was told by Mr. Petigru that Miss [Julia A.] Hext a poetess & authoress was in the House & a relation of your fathers & desired to make my acquaintance.  I saw her & made Anna acquainted with her.  I took her book of Poems to read & shall have to purchase a copy or two.  She is poor & from Barnwell.  I will send you a copy of Mrs. Brooks in the morning.  The eldest Miss Brooks is to be married shortly to someone from Darlington.

	Anna is quite a favorite with everybody & is uncommonly most talkative in company.  She attracts attention.  Willie is improving & wearing off his rough points.

	Yesterday Munson of Charleston was elected Judge.  There is a proposition to elect three Judges.  If so I may be put in nomination though I dont think I should wish a seat on the Bench.

	Mrs. Jones & Miss Robinson go up in the morning.  I and Jones speak but we are not very cordial nor have I had much to say to Mr. Jones.  To Betty Robinson & Flora Jones I have said a good deal.  

	The children have returned from church & I must conclude my letter.  I am sorry I shall not hear from you tonight.  The company are all breaking up.

There was a great crowd, & it is said I made a good speech.  Col. [William Aiken] Owens replied.  [William Ferguson] Hutson has the floor tonight & perhaps General [Samuel] McGowan may reply.
	  
	Anna & Willie are all well & enjoying themselves very much.  I will now tell you the particulars between Taber & myself.  He wrote me a note.  You will see however the whole correspondence in the Carolinian of today.  The course I pursued has met the approbation of almost everybody.  A great many came up to me in the House & congratulated me this morning on the noble stand I took.  Mr. Petigru, General Bonham, and Col. Dawkins came to my room last night to express their warm & cordial approbation.  Col. Isaac Hayne took a warm interest on my side and approves most heartily my courseso do Col. Jno & Col. William C. Preston.  Dr. [Ozey Robert] Broyles said he should put me in nomination for Governor for my noble stand.  Professor Brumby expressed his hearty approbationSenators [Samuel] McAiley and [Christopher William] Dudley.

	I have sent Willie down to get letters & I hope to hear from you.  Willie says the mail is not yet rece[ive]d at the Box.  I shall have to conclude my letter.

	I am writing to you before breakfast.  Mr. Duncan & Willie have dressed & gone down.  Anna still has my room with Miss Waistcot [Westcoat] a very nice young lady hardly grown & the daughter of a member [Jabez J.R. Westcoat] from Edisto Island.  There was no room for Anna & Miss Waistcoat was in a room with her father.  I shall remain in Duncans room till the end of the session.

	Just after sending my letters to the Post office last night, I rece[ive]d yours of Monday.  You must get money from the merchants or Mr. Hoke.  Mr. Grady will pay all of your Bills till I return.  I have paid a debt in Newberry of $78.00 & to Redwood of 180 which hasme of my funds.  You were entirely too quick in sending for our dollars Bills &c.  

	Col. Preston has sent me a bundle of rose cuttings.  There is some mystery about it.  I thought it was intended for one of the other Perrys, & they have remained in my room till they are almost dead.  I sent them out this morning to have them buried & if alive when I go up I will take them.  They are all labelled.  After writing to you I went to the State House & did not get off till 10 oclock in the night.  We discussed & lost the Electoral Bill at that hour.  But it will come up again.

	Anna & Miss Waistcot are going to the Asylum this morning in company with several others.  Willie will go with them.  I have just been down to breakfast.  Anna tells me that Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Isaac Hayne & Miss Hayne were in the gallery yesterday when I spoke on the Electoral Bill.  They bowed to her, but did not get in speaking distance.

	I am still receiving the congratulations of my friends for the bold & just stance I took  in refusing Tabers challenge.  I am glad you are pleased with the Allstons, & I am truly glad they are going to reside in Greenville.

 	After writing you last evening, Mr. Allston called to see me & expressed himself very much pleased with Greenville.  He told me he was at your House with some company the evening before.  He was very much pleased with our portraits & said yours was very superior.  He said he was an amateur painter himself and that he had never seen any portrait more accurate or more beautifully painted.  He preferred the eyes looking from you & said the effect was much better.  He said he had made friends in Greenville & was going to build there.  He was delighted with Mr. Bacon as a teacher & spoke in high terms of his sons playing.  He thought Mr. Arthur very much like governor Manning.

	I rece[ive]d two letters from you last night & in one of them you speak of another letter you had written Tuesday which I did not receive.  I am glad your party went off pleasantly.  Poor Wheaton seems a good fellow, very kind & friendly, but vain & foolish.  He is engaged to Miss Boggs as he told me & showed her likeness in a ring.

	Yesterday we were all day in the Legislature till ten oclock in the night.  After writing to you, I went down & made a speech on the Judiciary Bill.  It was thoroughly discussed & lost.  There was some sharp sparring between Campbell & Owens & Thompson & very amusing.  

	I am now writing to you before breakfast &whilst waiting for Anna & Miss Waistcot to dress & go to breakfast the others are eating.  They are to come to my room when ready.  I may not be able to write you this evening.  We are all hard pressed now for time.  The Legislature will not be able to do much.  

	I am now anxious to see you & the little children dear little Hext especially, & Fanny & Frank.  Miss Hext says she was akin to your father.  She is now staying at Mr. Guignards.

	I have nothing of interest to write you, since writing you last night at twelve oclock.  Luther McBee has just been in my room & says he returns in the morning.   Mauldin came down this evening  & is going to Pedee for his wife.  Dr. Austin & his daughter came down yesterday & go back tomorrow.  It seems to me I see more of Greenville here than I should at home.

	Anna & Willie are doing well & enjoying themselves very much.  Willie took a deep interest last night in the torch light procession & the crowd.  

	This morning a committee of citizens waited on me & invited me to address the citizens of Columbia in the Town Hall tomorrow night at eight oclock.  I have consented to do so.  I am becoming a wonderfully popular man in Columbia.  In Charleston I learn Taber was also burnt in effigy last night.  A militia company which he commanded there have requested his resignation.  Poor fellow seems to have no rest for the sole of his foot.

	The affair has produced quite a stir in Columbia and all over the state.  General Adams came to me & said he hoped I would not consent to run for governorthat he thought he would beat Wallace but he did not know so well about myself.  He said he was informed his constituents had nominated me for governor.

	We have not had much discussion today in the Legislature.  We meet again at six.  It is now five & I must conclude my letter.  I must think of my address tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have only time to write you a line.  It will be the last too that I shall be able to send you before I have the pleasure of greeting you myself in proper person.

	Nothing has occurred today worth writing.  I made a few remarks on the Lunatic Asylum and defeated the proposition to remove it.  

	I see Mr. Taber declines publishing his address in a note which appeared last night in the Charleston Mercury.  He tries to evade the matter.  I am sorry for the poor fellow & if I had known the extent of the mischief that I was doing him I should have spared him.  But his address was on outrageous popular feelings.

	I have written out my address & shall publish it in the next Patriot after my return home.

	It is now after four oclock & I have just been with Anna to purchase an Album for one dollar.  She seemed very anxious to have one. I have never seen anyone crying herself so much as Anna has.  If she were larger I would not have her here as there is too much association with gentlemen for a young lady.  Anna is very smart & lively & makes herself interesting to everyone.  I think she has more mind than any girl of her age I ever saw.  Willie does better & behaves more like a man since his associates William B & B have gone.  He now associates with men & listens to the scholars in the Legislature.  

	Tomorrow we adjourn.  I am very anxious to see you & the children.  I hope to hear from you when the mail is opened.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My Dear Sir [George D. Tillman]

	I have recently been informed that you heard & remember Mr. Tabers Address, last December in the College chapel, & that your opinion of the principles of the Address is in accordance with my criticism.

	I should be glad to hear from you in relation to this matter--your remembrance of the addressThe impression it made on your mind in regard to the education of the masses eviltheeffects of common schools & the system of reading and writing.

	I should like also your opinion whether or not the address is precisely the same that was delivered.  Are not some expressions modifiedsome left out & some added.
  
	  I do not know that I shall ever make any further publication in regard to Mr. Taber.  But your reply should be written with a view to publication.  I wish to show it to my friends & others.  

	I had intended writing to a number of persons but after publication of the address, corrected with a view to accuracy, I concluded it was not worthwhile.  Judge ONeall & Dr. Lieber sustain me entirely in regard to criticism.

	I hope you have seen my reply to Taber & the letters accompanying the reply.  I have just written a second reply to his last publication in the Mercury.

The up train yesterday had a great many of my acquaintances whom I met for a few moments & amongst them George Butler of Arkansas.  He is on his return from Washington & wishes very much to see me in Greenville he said.

	There are a great many persons going down this morning & amongst them Mr. Taber who is at Janneys. He has been sick & is just returning.  Mr. Robert Cunningham went down yesterday.  [William H.] Thomas the Editor of the Mountaineer is going down & here.  Beattie says the next sale of that paper will be a blowup & it will fall through.

	I have just recc[ive]d your letters & was glad to hear from you.  In passing down street this morning Mr. Yeadon purchased the prettiest sugar dish I ever saw for a present to you.  Yesterday I was trying to get a large gold pen & Col. Allan of Barnwell presented me with his, which is the finest I ever saw, & has his name engraved on it.  I have noticed it very handsomely in the Patriot.

	I sawPinckney last night.  He told me that Mrs. P had written you about the  Mr. William Elliott his uncle told me that he saw me in the convention & enquired who I was  in so complimentary a manner that he would not repeat it.

	It is not at all probable that I shall take my part in the proceedings of the convention.  It is thought best to let the gentlemen from the other states speak.  The whole affair is a humbug.  We had speeches today from Dawson of Georgia, Pike of, Maury of the navy & General Cowles.

	I will settle Dr. Geddings Bill.  Dr. Dickson enquired after you.  I will tell Yeadon as to your message about naming the child.  

	After writing the above I went to Brown to supper & then to the Ball.  The Ball was a magnificent affair but not a great many ladies present.  I staid till supper & then left.  It was not very pleasant to me but I spent my time in talking with the gentlemen & saw Miss Polly Thompson there but did not speak except to bow to her as she passed along.

	I have just finished dressing & it is only six oclock in the morning.  We breakfast at eight.  I therefore have two hours of leisure and will spend a portion of the time writing you a letter.

	Yesterday morning was very busy preparing for an argument in Court.  There is another case which will come up today & for which I also have to prepare.  Last night after receiving your letter, I had to attend the meeting of the Board of Trustees & could not answer it as I desired to do.

	I was glad to hear you were so well & so well pleased with your rooms & house.  I suppose Fanny and Hayne are equally well satisfied .  I received no letters last evening from home.  But Col. Townes came down  and reported that all were well so far as he knew.  He tells me they had quite a may day celebration in Greenville.  

	Fannys cloak & your comb are both safe in my possession

	Last night I was appointed chairman of the general committee to whom all the business of the Board of Trustees was referred &it will be a serious labor to consider & report on all the matters referred to us.  Governor Means, Mr. DeSaussure & [C.P.] Sullivan are members of the committee.  The Board meet again next Monday when I shall have to have my reports ready.  Our committee meet tomorrow evening to consider & dispose of the business.  The next morning I go down to General Adams & stay till Monday morning.  I still have to write out my reports there.

	Next Wednesday the law students are examined & I am on that committee.  It will therefore be out of my power to return to Greenville before Thursday next and about that time my cases in the law court of appeals will be reached.  So all my movements as to Greenville & Charleston are uncertain.  I think it probable however that I shall not be able to return to Greenville till you do.  You can spend all of your money in a couple of weeks & exhaust our credit at  & Wickenberys.

	Look at the carriage & write me what you think of it.

   	Chancellor Johnson saw me at the Post office after receiving your first letter & enquired about you.  I repeated to him your conclusion good bye notwithstanding the Virginia lady  which amused him greatly.  I sent your letter, with a few lines written on it to Anna, the evening I rece[ive]d it, without thinking of that expression.

	I hope you are enjoying yourself with your friends and that they admire the admissible pre[page torn]tion in which they find you as young in appearance as when you were married.  I hope too they admire Fannys sweet bright face & lovely complexion & the noble appearance of Master Hayne.  Our children are a fine specimen of the cross between the mountains & the seashore.

	If I were not so busy I could spend my time very pleasantly here.  But I have to work sop much & so constantly that I have no time for conversationhave not been in the drawing room since you left.  Governor Manning has carried me up to his room three evenings after dinner where we spend our time very pleasantly.  Col. Watts, Col. Herndon, Governor Means, Col. W. Thompson, General McGowan &c. have been of the company.

	Last night the Trustees had to act on a case of suspension of two students for passing a challenge to fight.  One of them was Albert Rhetts son, the son of my old friend Sally Taylor.  The other was by the name of [John Charles] McClenaghan.  They were both restored to college.  Mrs. Rhett has taken a house near the college to educate her son & was greatly mortified at the circumstance.

	I have now written you a long letter, too long for you to read with any interest I am afraid.  But I do not know when I shall be able to write you again.

	Be careful about the smallpox on account of the infant who is not vaccinated.  I hope God will protect you & the children---begin to wish[page torn]all very much & to see you all[page torn].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	Since writing you this morning I have rece[ive]d a most valuable, useful & beautiful present for Anna from Mr. E the district attorney of the United States who met her in Columbia last winter.  I asked him & Reed to[page torn] after getting through business there [page torn] Captain H  I was looking at a very fine gold thimble in a magnificent tortoise shell case & spoke of purchasing it for my little daughter.  Mr. E immediately said he begged for permission to send it to her as a present & would do so.  He said he went with Anna to the College chappel last winter & had a great deal of amusement with her.  She seems to have made a most favorable impression in all  who saw her here last winter.  I value the thimble & case very much for I know it will please Anna & be of use to her.  It is the finest thing of the kind I ever saw.  The price was $7.50.

	I have just been over to see Col. Pickens and his daughters who are at Hunts Hotel.  They will remain here till next week.  The Col. enquired about you, Anna & Willie & would have been very glad to have seen you.  His daughters seem pleasant & intelligent.

	I have just seen Mr. Irwin of the Mansion House & will send Annas thimble by him to her in the morning.  

	I finished my business in the Court of Equity about half after one today.  I think I am pretty sure I have succeeded in all my cases before the Court of Equity.  

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The mail has come in, but not yet opened.  It is half past four oclock in the evening.  Governor Means & Mr. DeSaussure are to come to my room to decide on the college matters referred to us as a committee.

	I must therefore bid you goodbye till Monday next.  There is to be quite a large party going to Governor Mannings residence tomorrow.  I go to General Adams & then Sunday to the governors.  Your affectionate husband now, and at all times, past, present & future, B.F. Perry

	I have rece[ive]d only one letter from younone from Willie or Frank.  Tell them they must write to me.  I am anxious to hear from you.  I hope however you are all getting on very well.

	I do not know when I shall be able to return to Greenville, perhaps not before your mother returns.  I am very busy in the Court of Appeals & next Saturday I have promised to go down to General Adams, fifteen miles below Columbia & stay till Monday.

	Your mother write me that she just sent you a long letter yesterday.

	You must write me how you get on with your household, and all about the children the servants, the horses &c.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before breakfast.  I have just finished looking over my notes of evidence and argument preparatory for my speech this morning in the case of Keys & .  Harrison & Reed argued the case yesterday & McGowan & myself will today.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & was glad to hear you were all well & had been to see your aunts.  I was also pleased to know that you were ready to return whenever I desired.  When that will be I am not able to say.  I desire to stay a day or two in Charleston when  I get there.  I shall be detained here till the last of next week.

	Since writing you Governor Manning has invited me to go down with him to his magnificent residence in Sumter & stay till Monday.  I told him I was engaged to General Adams & he proposed that I should divide my time & visit both which I am now inclined to do.  There is a large party of gentlemen going down with him.

	I have not heard from Anna or Willie since the letter I sent you.  But persons from Greenville say all are well.  I am very anxious to see the little children again & know they must be lonely there by themselves.

	We have a great crowd here now.  Jann[e]y turned off eight or ten persons yesterday evening.  I still have the same room.  Governor Manning has the gentlemens parlor for a bed chamber.

	I shall not be able to write you again before Monday.  You will not hear from [me] till Tuesday evening next.  I go in the morning to General Adams with Coil. Herndon.  We shall stay there till Sunday 12 oclock & then to Governor Mannings by four oclock, stay all night & return Monday morning.

	I shall probably go down to Charleston the last of next week and stay till you come up.  I do not think it worthwhile to run back to Greenville just before we are going to return.  It is probable I may get off Thursday, stay in Charleston Friday, Saturday & Sunday, come up to Columbia Monday, stay here two or three days & return home.  But all is uncertain on account of my law cases.

	I will write you positively on my return next Monday.  I am anxious to be with you & the children again.  I wish to be all reunited once more at our home & I hope we shall enjoy home more for our absence.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Since writing you a line on your mothers letter this morning, I have rece[ive]d a most beautiful, valuable & useful present for you from Mr. E the district attorney of the United States who you saw in Columbia last winter.  I was in Captain Heiseys toy shop looking at a gold thimble, in a magnificent tortoise shell case, & said I Had a notion of purchasing it for you.  Immediately Mr. E asked permission  to send it to you as a present.  He said he was much pleased with you last winter & hoped you would accept it in remembrance of him.  It is a very superior article, & a most beautiful & useful present for a young lady.  If I have an opportunity I will send it up to you.

	I have just got through with my Equity business in Court & will go down to General Adams in the morning & from there to Governor Mannings & return Monday morning.  I will then write you as to my movements.

	I hope Willie & Frank & Hext are doing well & behaving well.  You ought to behave like a lady at all times & I hope you do, & will show your skill in keeping house.

	I have just seen Col. Pickens & his daughters whom you saw in Charleston.  They & Col. Pickens enquired after you & Willie.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you state that I may come down Thursday & you will come up with mesend you more money.  This unsettles me again in my arrangements.  I had determined on returning to Greenville & staying there for some time.  I will now be governed entirely by my own convenience in my movements.  When I can get away from here I will go to Charleston & stay two or three days & we will return to Columbia,

	I do not know when my business will be reached.  Mr. Fillmore is expected tomorrow or the next day.  I wish to see him.  Tomorrow I examine the Students.  Today I get my pensioner discharged	 on the ground that the young woman was unworthy of credit in her statements so I have made that much inof my cases in the court of appeals since my stay in Columbia.

	Easl[e]y & McDaniel both inform me that several of my Equity clients at Greenville are wishing to see me.  It is important that I should return home as soon as possible & stay there.  I am neglecting the business in which our bread & the bread of our children depend.  I am sure you cannot wish that.  And there is no fun in running up & dow  the rail road this hot weather.

	.

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are to take this letter.  I will write to you again as to my movements & business.   

	McDaniel told me that Hoke said Hext was complaining & not very well.  But Willie & Frank say nothing about it in their letters written Sunday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford say nothing about it.  I suppose it is one of Hokes pieces of news.

	I must now conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate husbandthe more affectionate because I restrain you from doing wrong.  If I loved you less I might let you have more your own way.

	One of my cases which would have taken a day or two being an issue how chancery. Judge Whitner declines trying, as he has been of counsel in the case.  There is one other which I hope to reach today or tomorrow morning.

	Mr. John Maxwell paid me fifty dollars as separate fee for my services in the case of himself & Anderson.  Keith & Perry will be an additional fee.

	I suppose the election is known by this time in Greenville, and I greatly fear that Powell is elected.  Keith has been beaten in this district.

	There was a great gathering last night at Mr. Robinsons in front of the Methodist Church, but I did not go to eat a hot supper.  There are a good many persons at B from below.

	I saw Mr. Sharpe Monday.  He says Mrs. Sharpe has been very ill for four weeks past but is now better.  He told me to say to Mrs. McCall that she would have written to her but for her indisposition.

Perhaps I may be at home tomorrow & maybe not till Friday or Saturday.  Mr. Elford & E are going to leave today & I am now writing to you before breakfast.

	Harriet Perry has sent you some money to pay for a cloak or something of the kind fashionable.  Can you get such an article in Greenville or will you have to send to Charleston for it.  If you have to send toyou had better do so at once as she will need the cloak soon.

	I have seen my brother & Warren.  I have rece[ive]d $245 for the wheat which was sold.better crop than usual on my own account.  I have also rece[ive]d some little money.

	Steeles pony was not a pretty one & I did not purchase.  I was assured[page torn] would not be pleased[page torn]it.  I had rather have[page torn] one at Anderson, or we may get some other one.

My dear Liz

	I am writing to you before breakfast, & will not close my letter till evening.  You have frequently requested to note what time in the day I write you.

	We had a pleasant trip down here & fell in with a great many members & other friends on the way.  Judge Wardlaw partook of mybeef & raisin.  We had no dinner on the road except our lunch.  There were quite a number of ladies in the cars & amongst them a daughter of Elias D. Earles on her way to Sumter.

	Brockman, Duncan, McBee & Mooney are with me in the Congaree House.  I have a fine room, but the others are not so well provided.  The House appears to be well kept & very neat.  Some improvements have been made.  Mr. T is here as a boarder & as cordial as ever.  He enquired why Anna did not come down.  Said she could room with his daughter.

	There are a great many candidates, a house full of them, and amongst others, tell Willie his fellow student DeLorme is a candidate for doorkeeper.  He came up to me and wished to voteme in the canvass.  It is probable I shall vote for him.

	I saw Henry Cauble at the depot, & he called round to see me last night.  He looks well & seems very much improved in his manners & appearance & intelligence.  He is well pleased with the school but says only forty have been able to stand the discipline out of ninety who entered.  Dr.  Austins son was dismissed for having too many black marks opposite his name.

	Dr. [C.G.] Metts of Union, a member of the Legislature, took me out last night to consult about my running for Speaker & expressed an earnest wish to elect me.  But I told him my politics would prevent that.  He told me it would make no ions with him.  Col. Simmons will be elected probably without opposition.  Cunningham is here very active & busy.  Col. [Louis Trezevant] Wigfall & his wife are here.  

	I have not yet made the enquiry about Wilie & Frank but will do so & have no doubt by keeping them in my room where board with be moderate.  They may come down next Saturday if they will promise to be good boys, & keep their seats in the cars without moving about or attempting to pass from one car to the other.

	I have just returned from church & will finish my letter.  I went to the Episcopal church & heard Mr. Sams of Beaufort.  I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin, all of whom I spoke to.  They enquired after you & family.  I think Mrs. Taylor was at church but I did not get to speak to her.  After church Col. Aldrich, Col. Drayton & myself went to call on Governor Manning who is keeping house.  Mrs. Manning will be here on Tuesday.  The Governor enquired after you.  We took a glass of brandy with him & spent fifteen or twenty minutes very pleasantly.

	I came off & forgot to put up in starting from home my dressing gown.  Send it down to me by Mr. Wells who will come down Tuesday.  Bundle it up & direct to me in as small a canvass as possible.

	I hope you and the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  

	If I have time tomorrow I will write you again, but that is doubtful.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I am now writing to you about seven oclock in the evening.  I was in hopes to hear from you but did not.  I made them send the second time to the Post office but no letter.

	We had a busy day in the Legislature, & you will see by my letter the officers elected.  Poor Dean has been turned out by Col John T. Sloan of Pendleton.  It is horrible to be dependent on the Legislature for office.  I would almost as soon beg my bread.   

	John Cunningham was seated today in the seat I occupied for several years past & I thought he looked ashamed.  In the course of a few minutes Mr. Wagner came to me & asked me if I would not prefer my old seat, said I ought to have it & that persons wishing to see me looked to that seat as mine.  He proposed a change & I went back with all of my colleagues to our old seats.  Henry Richardson & Wagner took the seats reserved for the Greenville delegation by Mr. F.

	I went this morning & paid Bedell $76 & sent a draft to Easter of Baltimore for $116,50 cts.  Tell Anna Mr. Beadon asked where my little pet was and Mr. Evans & Mr. Siegling enquired after her kindly. She seems to have made a very favorable impression last winter.  Col. Haskell, a member from one of the Parishes & brother to the one who married Judge Cheves daughter says Miss Mardens school is the best in Charleston.  He has educated two or three of his daughters there.  Col. Keith speaks in high terms of the school.  He enquired after your mother.  

	I have very little to write you & must now conclude.  I shall expect to see Willie & Frank Saturday.  They will go back the next Saturday.  I have not yet had an opportunity of speaking about their boarding, but have no doubt I can arrange it.  Anna will come down towards the end of the Session.

	How I should like to be with you all tonight.  I hope you are all well.  Mr. Ioor says the people of Greenville are all well.  

	Dr. Lieber called to see me today & left his card.  Good night, yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have just returned from dining with Governor Manning & it is now about nine oclock in the night.  I rece[i]ved your letter last evening & Sunday evening I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  I have not seen Mr. Wells, but understand that he brought my dressing gown.  I have not seen that either.  He is out somewhere. 

	I had a very pleasant time with Governor Manning.  Col. Orr, Col. Wilson, Col. Watts, Mr. Richardson, a German architect & another gentleman whose name I did not learn were all who came there.  I did not see Mrs. Manning who arrived today.  She is likewise in a condition not to show to advantage.

	Duncan informs me that Mrs. Simmons & Mrs. Croft arrived this evening, but I have not seen them.  Tell Willie that DeLorme has been elected doorkeeper & when he comes down he may let him into theHall.  DeLorme seems a clever boy & was very grateful for our effort.

	There was nothing of any interest done today in the Legislature.  I introduced a Bill to give the election of Electors to the people & also to give state aid to the Blue Ridge rail road.

	Look in those pigeon holes over where I sit & write in my office & you will see Dr. Gantts deed & the paper I drew for him.    Get them & give them to him.

	I must now conclude as I have really nothing to write about.  I am sorry for poor Luther McBee.  His brother Pinckney recd a letter from Alexander Monday evening but did not represent him as so low as you suppose him to be.

	Mr. Wells has just been to my room & has gone to bring my gown.  I have just seen at a distance Simmons & his bride & two other ladies & I suppose they are all to sleep together.  .  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

	I have just recd a letter from you & one from Willie & thank you for them.  Willies I ought to have recd last night.

	I did not write you last night because it was about eleven oclock when I returned from the Board of Trustees.  Dr. Thornwell has resigned as President of the College.  Who will be his successor is doubtful.

	Today I have been mostly in the Federal court listening to [James Louis] Petigru & Dr. Tre  argue a case originating in secession & abolition excitement.  I have written an account of it for the Patriot.

	I heard of the death of Luther McBee yesterday evening & I ft over your letter tonight in reading portions of it to Col. Brockman.  I am sorry for him.  He was foolish, but not a bad hearted man & I never have had but one opinion in regard to him with & to Susan.  She was too sensitive & not disposed to bear & concede his faults as a good wife or husband should be towards their other half.  This intercoursehappiness as well as his.  In married life we never can give unhappiness to each other without participating in it ourself.  It is like the poisoned cholic which returns to [word obscured]which prevented it.

	I enclose you a pardon for poor Pittman.  Send it at once to him, & when he can give security to keep the peace he can come out & leave the state.  I am afraid the poor fellow is crazy.  

       Wells has just brought me my briefs & says he will pay some attention to Willie & Frank that they need not attempt to go from one car to the other or get out of the cars or stand on the platform.  Let them keep their seats & keep their heads in the cars.  Pickens Butler lost his hat this evening as he came down, & had to come in town bareheaded.

It is now about ten oclock & I have just returned from a caucus on the Electoral question.  I have therefore time only to write you a few lines.  Nor have I anything of interest to write.  

	The Bill dividing Pendleton passed today & I made a short speech in favor of it.

	Mr. Pinckney Butler went home yesterday & will return Monday.  I think I shall go up with Willie & Frank tomorrow week & stay till Monday.   Next Saturday, tomorrow week, is fasting & prayer & the Legislature will not meet so I can come home & bring Anna down with me, & be better prepared to go to Charleston after the adjournment.  I shall have seen my wife & family. 

	Tell Mr. Elford that I have not yet seen the Patriot.  The Mountaineer came tonight but no Patriot! This is abominable and inexcusable neglect on his part & I can act outraged at it.  They never send the paper together to any of us when it is published.

	Send Elford likewise word to send the other briefs that he is preparing in the case of Bates & Christoipher.  Wells says he lives at his house most of his time; a man may be in love without neglecting his business.

	When you receive this letter Willie & Frank will be in Columbia, & you will be lonely.  I wish I could be with you.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees and it is now after ten oclock.  Wilie & Frank arrived here this evening safe, whilst I was in the State House.  I barely saw them before I started to the College & now they are just going to bed.  They went to the circus whilst I went to the College & Frank is greatly pleased.

	I hardly had time to read your long letter.  You have certainly got on a way of sermonizing.  I am always the same.  I do not believe that religion consists in being scared, or on the authored observing of religion.  I never expect to get to Heaven by going to church & saying prayers.  To be religious you must be good, in all the relations of life, & do your duty assigned you on this earth.  We must control the evil impulses & passions of our nature, & be kind to all & assist all we can help.  We must learn patience & endurance & long forbearance, & be content with out lot on this Earth because it is Gods will we should be here.

	There is a great crowd in Columbia tonight.  All the professors in the Furman University are here.  Nothing was done in the Legislature today buy make minor elections.  Your kinsman young Peroneau who sent back the Patriot so promptly is a candidate of assessor of Charleston.  DeSaussure came to me to enquire if I was supporting him & to announce him as a candidate.  I replied that I was not.  [Theodore Dehon] Wagner attempted to electioneer with me.  I voted for Dawson [on] the first ballet and the second ballot for Johnson, a brother of Judge William Johnson of the Federal court.  No election is yet made.  Reed & Fair have been reelected solicitors.

	The Speaker Simmons paid me a high compliment tonight.  He said he had no doubt about a question of order till he thought I doubted it.  That made him hesitate.  He knew I would not attempt to deceive or mislead him.  I must now conclude my dear wife by hoping you are in a better mood & not so [two words interlined, illegible].

	It has just occurred to me that the cars do not go tomorrow.

	I have just returned from the College Chapel & heard a fine sermon from President Thornwell.  I have just written an account of it for the Patriot.  Willie & Frank went also.  I saw a great many persons from Greenville there, the professors of the Furman University amongst them.  It was the first service in the new chapel.  There was an immense crowd.  The Building is a magnificent one, a sort of Grecian Temple.  The manse was fine.  I saw Miss Brenan in the Gallery, but did not speak to her.  Somehow or other I do not feel the same interest in her, since her intimacy with Alston.  I spoke to Mrs. Lieber & the doctor.  I saw [Richard T.] Brumby & his daughters, but did not have an opportunity of speaking to them.  Tomorrow everybody will be at the Chapel.

	In regard to my opinion {page torn] poor Luther, I have no doubt his God has dealt mercifully with him, & as I said before he was not a bad hearted man.  It is perhaps better for him, & his family that he is gone.  He could have been of little service to them or consolation to them.  I am sure however Susan feels deeply his loss.  Many a tear fell from my eyes whilst reading your letter.  Tell Susan I deeply sympathize with her & hope she will now devote her life to her children. & unite herself in thought & feeling with the family of her husband.  It is her duty & her interest to do so cheerfully and Freely & uncomplaining.  She must be affectionate & kind to them & neither complain of nor resent their supposed neglect of herself.  The McBees are all affectionate & good people in their way.  They are a plain people, & it is Susans duty to be one of them in dress, living & everything else.  They will do a good part by her children.  But if she begins to complain & fret & worry & tease them as she has heretofore done, she will make herself odious to them.  She must be economical & prudent.  If she has grievances she must keep them to herself, & not tell them to her mother, & they will be for [page torn].

	I have today had to attend the Judiciary committee, the court, the Legislature, again the committee, & last a caucus, from which I have just returned near twelve oclock in the night.  You must therefore expect nothing but a line.

	Yesterday I argued the Croft case.  Today I have been in the Greenville academy case.  

	I saw Col. OHanlon & he will carry Willie & Frank down to say castle tomorrow & they will stay two or three days with him.  They will not return Saturday.

	I dine with Col. John Preston tomorrow & have the invitation being sent yesterday I suppose there will be a large & magnificent party.

	I was glad to receive your letter this evening.  Easl[e]y came down also this evening.

	I saw General martin this morning who said Mrs. Martin had rece[ive]d a long & very interesting  letter from you on the death of poor Luther McBee.

	I saw Col. Hayne also today & spoke to him for the second time since I have been here.

	There was a great parade here this evening & Frank was very much pleased.

	I must now bid you good night by assuring you that you are mistaken in supposing that your love for me is greater than mine for you.  Seldom has a husband loved his wife as I have.  But these things will not do to write about.  When we meet we will talk about them.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

	Shortly after I had written you and gone to bed, I was awoke by the fire bell.  The whole square opposite the Hotel is burnt to the ground.  The sight was a terrific one.  The women were horribly alarmed.  The whole house is in the greatest confusion.  The fire is yet burning.  DR. Gibb[e]soffice $30,000 is utterly destroyed.  The streets are full of furniture.  Willie & Frank have stood in the piazza fir three hours looking on.  The fire broke out ? after one oclock.  It is now after five in the morning.  I have no idea of the loss, but it is very heavy.  The fire broke out in a grocery where last night a man was killed by the son of Chancellor Caldwell.  His body is burnt up.  The murder, the grog shop & the fire will furnish Judge ONeall with atheme for a letter or temperance lecture.  In great confusion, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from dinner with Col. Campbell & his Charleston Mess composed of Senator Mordecai, King, Richardson, Johnson, Wagner, Wilson &c.  I was interested to meet Col. Brooks member of Congress & also met young Lowndes who has just graduated.  I spent a very pleasant evening & we had a good dinner.  

	On my return to the Hotel I found your note & was glad to hear you were all well.  I was glad too to hear that Mr. Sto had paid you a visit, & thought kindly of me.

	I wrote you yesterday that Willie & Frank had gone down to Col. OHanlons.  He desired to keep them two or three weeks, but they will return Monday. & perhaps go home Tuesday.  Col. OHanlon is as kind & affectionate as ever.  He is bitterly opposed to Adams election.  The election was today ordered for Monday next on my motion.  The opponents of Adams wished to put it off & succeeded till I moved in the matter.  The House immediately acquiesced by a large majority on my motion.  Not three minutes before I made the motion, they decided not to have the election even on Tuesday.

	I have been engaged all day pretty much in the court & have made good progress with my cases.  I hope to get through next Monday.  The case of Bev & Coleman I shall gain.  I shall also gain the academy case, but I shall loose Bates & Christopher, but I shall also gain Youngs case.  How the other cases will go is doubtful.  But on Monday they deliver opinions.

	The Electoral Bill was postponed today after McCreadys speech for me & Sullivan till Tuesday.

	I am distracted by the division of my labors.  I cannot serve two masters.  My case business is now becoming too extensive for me to continue in the Legislature & do justice to my clients.

	Yesterday I was stopped in the street by General Owens of Fairfield who is moving to Florida.  He wished me to seed the Patriot to him & whilst I was taking down his Post office Dantzler & other hot secessionists friends of the General came by & he told them what he was doing.  Today I was stopped by Erwin of the Pedee who paid me $5.00.  Sp a lawyer of Edgefield also subscribed.  Erwin said I had saved the state.  Col. Simons the speaker expressed himself of Preston as strongly as I ever did against the brag[g]art spirit of South Carolina.

	My dear Liz I wish to see you & the children very much, & am truly sorry I cannot go up in the morning.  But my law cases will prevent.  In walking home tonight with Col. Brooks he said Washington was a most corrupting & demoralizing place.  That he was not able to carry on his family, and should quit after this term.  That there was no real happiness after all except at home in ones family circle.

	Enclosed I send you an Editorial for the Patriot  which you will please send up to Elford immediately.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter last night & enclosed some editorials for the Patriot with an article of Judge ONealls.

	I have very little to write now in addition to what I wrote then.  I did not go to church today as I heard such a fine sermon yesterday, and also I had to do a great deal of writing in reference to my cases in court.  

       The Case of the Greenville Academies has been referred to the Court of Errors & must be reargued on Tuesday next.  I have understood the chancellors are divided, Wardlaw & Dargan for me & Johnston & Duncan against.  The law Judges are now called in to settle the matter.

	Willie & Frank have not yet returned from Col. OHanlons.  I suppose they will tomorrow morning.  If so they may return to Greenville Tuesday or they may stay to the Inauguration of the Governor.  He is to be elected tomorrow at ? past twelve.  I suppose General Adams will be elected.

       Col. Jno S. Preston was confirmed today in the Episcopal church by Bishop Davis.  Col. Wade Hampton Jr. was also confirmed and a large number of others as I was informed.
       
       I am sorry you did not write me a longer letter than the one I rece[ive]d last night.  But were [glad] to hear from you is something, & I should be very glad to receive just as short a letter this evening which is Sunday, a day we have no mail from Greenville

	Col Fair & wife [&] Col. Herndon & wife are here.  Mistress F has a son about Haynes age which she brought into the room to show me today.  It is very much like her but does not look so well as Hayne.

	I have been from home so long that I almost forget how Hayne looks.  God bless the little fellow.  How I should like to see him tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just had time to read the longletter you sent me by Mr. Thompson.  It is now ten oclock & I have to write for the Patriot after writing to you.  I have just come back from the committee in the State House.

	Willie & Frank returned today from Col. OHanlons & were very much pleased with their visit.  They wish to stay here till the Governors Inauguration Wednesday so you may look for them Thursday.

	The decrees in Crofts case & Boles case were confirmed today.  Tomorrow I have to argue again the Academies in the Court of Errors.

	General Adams was elected Governor today & they are now serenading him.

	I must now write for the Patriot.  Good nightGod bless you & the children & make you happy as you ought to be.  Yours affectionately. B.F. Perry

	It is now nine oclock, & I have just returned from the committee & still have to go & meet [George Alfred] Trenholm & Gourdin on the Blue Ridge rail road Bill.

	I have been all day in court arguing the academy cases & Yanceys cases.  I have no doubt I shall gain both.  Tomorrow I have two or three other cases.  My business in the Legislature is very much neglected.  

	The Electoral Bill was postponed today whilst I was absent.

	I rece[ive]d your letter just before I went to meet the committee.  Willie & Frank will go home Thursdayyou may expect to see them.  I wish I could go with them.  About one third of the members went home last Saturday & returned Monday.  Judge Whitner did so. [William Dunlap] Simpson & [W.P.] Henderson returned home to Laurens.  

	But it is impossible for me now to leave till the Legislature adjourns.

	I must now bid you good night as I have now to go & meet Trenholm as already stated.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I was not able to write you last night.  The Legislature did not adjourn till near eleven oclock in the night.  The Blue Ridge Rail Road was under discussion.  I was engaged in Court till half after one when Mr. [Thomas Martin] Wagner came for me to go & open the debate.  I made a short speech in favor of the Bill.  But I was too much fatigued to do justice to the road or to myself.  It is inconceivably perplexing to be running from the Courts to the Legislature.  I am first on our court & then in the other & needed in the Legislature all the time.  In this way I am not able to do my duty in any place.  

	I am now writing to you in the House of Representatives and persons are passing by constantly & stopping to talk.  But I am afraid tonight it will be as it was last night.  The Blue Ridge is still under discussion.  

	On going home last night I met your uncle Col. Hayne again & he walked with me to my Hotel.  He said he had heard my speech.  He seems very kind.

	I read your letter last night & think with you that I had better come home & go with Anna to Charleston.  It will be much more agreeable to my feelings to return home & see my wife & children than to go a differentafter the adjournment of the Legislature.  It will be better for Anna likewise than to come down alone or with some stragler.  Mr. Elford is in Charleston & will not return to Greenville till after the Baptist convention on the 20th.  I saw Mr. Pressly this morning who informed me that he left Elford in Town yesterday.

	If I have time I will write you again tonight after receiving your letter.  We adjourn next Thursday.  

	I wrote Mr. Yancy the success of his case.  I have also succeeded in Major Seaborns case & wrote him too yesterday evening.  It gives me pleasure to communicate good news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	 Willie & Frank have just finished packing up & gone to bed.  The Legislature has just adjourned & it is ten oclock.

	I send you two dollars worth of candy which Coil. OHanlon gave the money to Willie to purchase & he lost one dollar of it.  There is a great variety of candies.  I also send Fannie a box 1.00 & a ring 1.50 as she is not going from home & Anna is.  I also send Hext a gold watch, made out of India rubber, price 62 ? cts.  Buy a ribbon & let him wear it.

	Tonight I met your uncle Col. Hayne in the streets.  I said to Willie that gentleman looks like Col. Arthur Hayne.  He turned round to follow after us.    He is to be here several days.  He says all are well in Charleston.

	The Legislature will adjourn next Thursday 21st December.  If Anna has no good opportunity of coming down I had just as leave return home, & go back with her to Charleston.  If I were to go home first, I should enjoy my trip to Charleston much more, & would stay longer.

	The Greenville academies was decided tonight allowing the trustees to make the transfer of the Academy lands on the terms we proposed.  But the Court would not permit the two corporations to be united.  But everything is gained that I petitioned for in the first instance.  [George F.] Townes deserves the universal execration of the whole community & ought not to be countenanced by the Baptists for he has greatly bedevilled them.  

	Governor Adams was inaugurated today & gave me a most cordial invitation to go & see his wife & daughters.  He seems a good friend personally & I believe he is sincerely so.  He has always been kind to me & he put me in nomination years ago for President of the Bank.

	I have been engaged in Court all day & shall be tomorrow morning.

	The Blue Ridge Rail Road comes up tomorrow & I have to speak firstTrenholm & Memminger follow.

	I must now stop.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now five oclock & I have just eaten my dinner & have till seven to go back to the State House, where I shall have to stay till eleven oclock in the night.

	I wrote you a letter this morning in the State House, but as I did not write you last night, I will write again.  I am waiting for the post office to be opened, so that I may get your letter & then I will reply to it.  I hope to hear that Willie & Frank reached home safely & found you all well.  I hope also to receive a Patriot & read over again my letters, or rather look at them for I have not time to read them.

	The discussion in the House on the Blue Ridge Rail road is going on.  Col. Memminger will conclude the debate this evening, & I have no doubt the Bill will pass.

	I spent a good deal of today with your uncle.  He came & sat with me sometime in the Legislatureenquired where Willie was & what he did.
	
	I have just been down & got your letter & read it.  I am glad to hear you were all well.

	You may now regard it settled that I will come home before going to Charleston.  Anna therefore need not come down.  It would be unpleasant to go from home after the adjournment of the Legislature when all the other members were hastening home.  

	I must now close my letter & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

This morning I went into court & then to the Legislature & sat till four oclock & thence to dine with Dr. Furman.  Then I went back to the Legislature & have just returned from the House fatigued & tired.  We adjourn on Saturday & I will return Sunday night.  There is to be an extra train to carry us up on Sunday.  

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Dr. Furman & in going there I met Miss Brenan in the street & shook hands with her & had some little chat.  She enquired kindly after you & mother.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few moments to write before going down to the night session, from which I may not return in time to write you.

	I will send you an editorial to read & send up to Elford.  But, now, it just occurs to me that the cars do not run tomorrow.  I shall have all day Sunday to write you.

	This evening I met old Mrs. Ioor & Mrs. Edwards her granddaughter I believe.  I was going to pass by Mrs. Ioor not noticing her till she spoke.  I was glad to see her.  She came down last Monday I think.

	I have just seen Dr. Irvine & Col. Irvin on their way to Florida.  The Dr. has not yet said anything in reference to his sessions case.  I have not seen Mrs. Irvine.

	Mr. Leary is still here & wishes to settle in Columbia.  I saw young Douglass with him.

	We had quite an animated discussion today in the House in which I participated on the SavannahRail Road.

	There have been a great many robberies here.  Col. Irby lost one hundred & thirty three dollars last night, stolen out of his pockets whilst asleep.

Letter 314
Sunday morning.  I find myself in quite a predicament this morning.  In order to be secure against robbers last night, I put my clothes in my trunk & shut it down.  It never occurred to me that the key of the trunk was in my pantaloons pockets.  So I am in my shirt & drawers & nothing to put on but my dressing gown.  The boy waiting on me has been all over the house for keys but none will unlock my trunk.  The mechanics are all away from their shops and here I am not knowing what to do.  The breakfast bell has rung & I have written a long Editorial waiting my lick but all in vain.

	Since writing the above I have had all the keys in the house sent me, but none fit.  It is now eleven oclock & I have now put on an old pair of pantaloons & gone down & got my breakfast.

	The agony is over & a blacksmith has come & broke the lock of my trunk.  I am now dressed & ready for dinner.  Col. R.F.W. Al[l]ston understanding I could not leave my room sent me a book to read.  Col. Drayton told me he would have offered a pair of his pantaloons, but he did not like to have his britches split.  Whilst I was dressing at eleven or twelve Col. Carroll came to pay me a visit & talk about a matter in the Legislature.  I have been disappointed in going to church & will now conclude my letter as I have not any more to write & shall not hear from you tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now near midnight & I have just returned from the Legislature.

	I could have written to you after dinner but I met my old friend S.A. Marenick from Texas & had to spend the hour with him.  He looks as old as his father did when he died.  He came up to me in the room & I had no idea who he was.  He said he had been looking for me.  I have justfrom him.  He goes to Pendleton in the morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight.  Becky may go to Charleston with Baylis [Earle].  I shall stay at home three or four days.

	I am glad Brackenridge is dead.  I should have disliked to have seen him again.  I hope the other horses are well.  You must buy corn for them.

	Mr. [Perry Emory] Duncan has heard that his son is sick & will go home Wednesday or perhaps tomorrow.

	I will write you a line this morning for fear I may not be able to write this evening.

	Last night we had a terrible session.  Neither House adjourned till near midnight.  The Blue Ridge Bill passed the Senate.  The Augusta Bridge is still under discussion & I may speak on it today.

	Mr. [William Dunlap] Simpson of Laurens said last night after hearing Col. Preston on the Rail Road, said he had never heard him before, but that he did not make anything like as good a speech as I made at Asheville last summermonth.   

	I wrote you last night about meeting Marenick.  He shocked me to look at.  He looked about seventy.  His hear as white as cotton.  He lives in San Antonio.  He had heard of Major Bell but had not met him.

	I am exceedingly anxious to get home again & would not for any consideration go on to Charleston without going home.  On reflection I rather think I shall have to remain in Greenville till after saleday.  I must be at home on that day and it will be almost impossible for me to get back.  In going [on] a trip to Charleston I like to take my time in staying there after travelling two hundred & seventy or eighty miles to get there.

       I rece[ive]d a letter last night purporting to be from Reuben.  He says that Mr. Crawford is going to Augusta & that he & Mrs. Crawford are so much attached to his wife they would buy then sellthat the Bible says a man must forsake father, mother & brother & cleave unto his wifethat Georgia seems to be his trial & he had as well make up his mind to go.  The letter looks as if a negro may have written it.  It is signed your boy Reuben.  But he speaks of Reuben in the letter as if it was written by someone else.
       
       It is now six oclock in the evening & I have just taken dinner.  I will finish my letter before going down to the State House.  Nothing has been done in the Legislature except discuss the Augusta Bridge to empty chairs.  I took no part in such a debate.
       
       I rece[ive]d your letter just this minute, also one from Alfred Huger requesting me to give my support to the repeal of the law relative to Colored seamen.  He says he has always entertained the highest appreciation of my judgement & political principles as well as respect for me personally.  I also rece[ive]d a Book from Judge Butler.
       
       I am glad to hear you mention all the children by name.  I wish I was with them & you.  I am tired & sick of Columbia & would like to go up in the morning with Mr. Duncan who returns to see his sick child.
       
       I also rece[ive]d a letter from W.S. Lawton who says he has a son at Greenville at schoolthat his son writes him he has heard me make some fine speeches.
       
       Mr. Arthur was here yesterday but I did not see him.  Mr. Leavy has been crazy from drink.
       
       I am glad Lindy is going to be married, & hope she will do better.
       
       The Greenville academies have been decidedthat the Trustees have the right to sell the lands & transfer the academies without applying to the Court.  This is the view I always had of the matter but filed the petition at the insistence of Dr. [Andrew B.] Crook to pacify all parties.  [I] have introduced a clause in [word obscured] incorporation bill to blend the trustees of the Academies & Furman University.
       
       I have seen nothing of Miss Brenan.  She did give a concert, but I did not attend nor have I seen Mr. Hasle.  
       
       I must now conclude & go to the State House.  But I shall not stay there longer than nine oclock for I am worn out in sitting up with loss of sleep.  My money is deposited in Bank $700.00 & I have $75 in my pocket.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just read your letter & have but a few moments to write you before going down to the House where I shall be till midnight

	I have had a bad cold & a sore throat which I think I caught Sunday whilst sitting in my dressing gown waiting for my trunk to be opened.  These night sessions have increased my indisposition & I would notdiet but for very pressing matters.

	I shall rejoice to be at home once more & only wish I was nowwith you & the children before the fire & could go to bed at nine instead of sitting up till midnight.  

	We had quite a snow here last night for a few moments.

	I saw Mr. Wells just now.  He says Mr. Elford came down with him.	 

	I saw Captain Cunningham here yesterday.  John seems disposed to be civil and kind but was very shy at first.  I think there must be something forbidding and austere in my appearance when I do not like a person.  It is seldom anyone takes liberties with me.

	I rece[ive]d a message from Miss Brenan last night that I must go & see her.  She goes to New York Friday.  I shall not go.  I have not time.

	I saw Governor Adams today & told him to say to Mrs. Adams & his daughter that I regretted extremely not being able to go and see them.  I told him you had been criticizing his Inaugural & said it seemed he opposed everything I had advocated.

	He told me that I was under solemn promise to go & see him next May & every May & that he should prepare for that.

	I saw Col. OHanlon today who enquired about you & Willie & Frank.

Mrs. [John] Pettit. My dear Madam

	Your very acceptable letter was received by me, whilst attending the sitting of our Legislature in Columbia.  Mrs. Perry was kind enough to enclose it to me.  

	You must excuse the liberty I take in publishing it.  Several of the Senators & representatives to whom I showed the letter said it was it was too good not to be published.

	I have just enclosed to you a Poem by Col. [William John] Grayson of South Carolina, long a member of Congress, & recently a good Union manThe hireling and the Slave.  I hope you will accept it, as a memento of my regard for you, & your political principles.  It has high merit in South Carolina, & is just published.  It comes from your own sunny South & dear old Carolina.

	I sincerely regret the loss of Mr. Pettit in the United States Senate.  My friend Judge Butler spoke in very high terms of him last Summer to me.  It would have given Mrs. Perry & myself great pleasure to have seen you and Mr. Pettit in Greenville.  I have ordered the Southern Patriot to be sent to you.  I scribble for it as Editor, but my Professional vocations as a lawyer are so arduous that I cannot pay the attention to it that I desire.

	   I will write you again shortly.  Mrs. Perry unites with me in regards to you & Mr. Pettit.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

	We reached here yesterday evening.  Nikerson seemed very glad to see me & today at dinner s[page torn] me a bottle of old sherry wine.

. 	After breakfast I went to K & purchased groceries--a barrel of crushed sugar[page torn] ten centspowdered sugar at 9 cts and for servants at 6 cts.  I thought it just as well to purchase these things as to be sending to the stores in Greenville.  I purchased five boxes of candles.   [Page torn]was cheaper than tallowalso bought BuckwheatBrandy, champagne, coffee, tea, soap, prunes, doi[page torn] figs, oisters & pickle beef.

	After returning from K I paid Reynolds a visit & bought a most beautiful fashionable barouche &$275.00.  It is just like one purchased by Lowndes whose daughter was married the other day for her.  I am sure you will like it.  It can be made very close or entirely open.  

	Anna went to see her relations this morning & delivered all your letters.  They were all glad to see her.  Your uncle Arthur called to see me but I was out.

	This evening I carried Anna to see Miss [Victoria] Murdens.  We were both pleased.  Tomorrow I will take her & leave her there.  She goes into a room with Miss Cane [Cain?] & Miss Palmertwo Senators daughters whose fathers I know very well.  Miss McLeod is also to be here from Statesburgh who says she went to school with Anna at Greenville.  Her house & everything seemed neat.  Judge Frost told me this morning he would like to pay Anna some attentionthat he has two daughters about her age.  

	I will go up to Augusta Saturday & see what has become of Reuben & be at home Tuesday night if possible.  I may have to go on to Mrs. Harrisons at Marietta.  I think he went on with her women.  They can tell me his plans.

	Sam Townes is here in a drinking spreesay nothing about it.  He is bordering on delirium tremors & Dr. Dow attending himbut dont mention it.  He will come up with me if he is able to travel.  I have met Hastie & wife here who are both very pleasant.  Some Griffins & others from Newberry came down to go to Miss Boles school.

	Your letters to your mother have been a source of great satisfaction to all of us.  We all look forward with interest to hearing from you, & feel disap[p]ointed  when we do not every two or three days.  But we know your time is so much taken up with your studies that you cannot write as often as you otherwise would.

	I will endeavour to arrange so that I can go down for you the first of April.  Write when your vacation is.  I wish to be in Charleston at the great Fair on the 11th of April.

	Enclosed I send you five dollars to purchase paper & such things as you desire.

	In all matters I wish you to conform to all the rules & regulations of your school & pursue your studies diligently and be a good girl.  You must remember that at home you have not been under much restraint.  It will be of service to you, in all after life to learn to be systematic in your conduct & business.  It will be of great service too to learn to be governed & restrained & not have your own way.  When you return home your mother will have less trouble in managing you, as you will have become accustomed to be governed.  

	I have directed the Patriot to be sent you regularly & if you do not receive it, the fault is at the Post office in Charleston.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  The Female College here will open shortly & they have a prospect of getting a gentleman highly competent to take charge of the school. 

	We are all pleased with our new carriage driver Wiley, & he is a very good looking & sensible & well disposed servant.    Your mother likes too the Barouche which I purchased in Charleston.  

	Your little acquaintances here are all well, and enquire about you.  They will be glad to see you on your return in April.  How long is your vacation?

	Willie & Frank commence their college studies next week, & I shall be very glad to have them at school once more.  They are running wild.  Willie hauls wood from the farm & Frank stays every night at your aunt Susans.  Fanny goes to school.  Hext is playing about the yard & visiting the stables.  Hayne is a prisoner in the house this cold weather.  The little fellow is delighted to go with me over the house.  He is learning to walk & will be able to meet you at the door when you return.  Your  affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [John Pettit]

	I received your letter the other day, and am glad to hear that Mrs. Pettit received regularly the Southern Patriot.  I was very much gratified in my return from the Legislature of the State last winter to learn that you had ordered the Patriot to be sent to her.

	I am publishing this week your very able & most acceptable speech on the Slavery question.  Your views too on the right of the States meet my hearty approval & although I am as you express yourself to be a States rights man.

	I was in hopes to have seen you & Mrs. Pettit in South Carolina this spring.  It would give as great pleasure to meet you & greet you in Greenville.  I forwarded to Mrs. Pettit last winter, a copy of a Poem of some merit, by Col. Grayson entitled The Slave & the hireling.  I hope she received it.  The author was for many years a member of Congress & is one of the faithful Union men in South Carolina amidst all the faithless secessionists.

	Mrs. Perry unites with me in our respects to Mrs. Pettit & yourself & I am truly yours &c., B.F. Perry

My Dear Daughter

	I received your letter containing your roll of merit or standing in your school & was very much gratified with it.  Your progress in your studies & your behavior in school are creditable to you and your teachers.  You have talents & a capacity to study far above ordinary girls and you should endeavour to improve them.  It gratifies your mother & myself so much to hear a good report of you.

	I would write you oftener, but your mother writes so constantly that it is unnecessary.  We were very much alarmed about the fever but hope that at risk is over.

	I will go down for you about the 12th of April if you insist on it.  But your mother thinks you ought to stay till May.  Write me what you wish to do.

	We are very much obliged to all of your relations for their kindness to you & especially to your aunt Mrs. Hayne.  It was good in her to take you out of danger.  We thank her a thousand times for it.  

	We are all well.  Your mother has been busy planting out flowers & gardeningriding our occasionallyonce to Pine Mountain last week, where we may one day live.  Willie studies hard & brought home a very high standing in College last week.  He was perfect in his lessons in Latin & Greek.  Frank does not hurt himself studying, but has a respectable position in his class.  He thinks too much of his pigeonsboll &c.  He spends a god deal of his time at your aunt Susans with Vardry & Alexander.
Fannie is now going to the Academies & seems fond of her books.  She & Annie are very much together & has been to visit old Mr. McBee.  Hext is the picture of health & strength, romping & playing all day.  Hayne is lively, walks & tries to talk, has a breaking out on his head which disfigures his appearance, but is going off.  You will be glad to see how much the little fellow has grown.  The servants are all well.  Edward is in Columbia.  Wiley does well.  Lindy is with your grandmother.  Your Pony is so fat & gaity that you will hardly be able to ride him.

	I go in the morning to Anderson Court & will return the latter part of the week.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My Dear Daughter

	I received your letter last night, & we were very glad to hear from you, & to learn that you were well, & enjoying yourself so much at Dr. Caines.  You must give my respects to Dr. Cain & thank him & his family in our name, for all their kindness to you.  You must also invite your little friend Anna Mos to come & spend some time with you next summer.  I know Dr. Cain very well & served a long time in the Legislature with him & always entertained a very high regard for him.

	I am glad you have an opportunity of seeing the plantations of the lower country, & learning something of the society of the Planters.  You must not stay too long.  It is not healthy for a mountain girl to remain on the plantations late in the Spring.  I shall be in Charleston the first of May.

	When you go back to Town, I had rather you should stay with Miss Murden till I go down for you.  But you can do as you please, & as your mother directs.

	We are all well.  Fanny & Frank are taking lessons in dancing.  Hext & Hayne have grown a great deal.  Willie is making fine progress in his studies, & has the highest standing in his class, although there are some grown men in it.  You Pony is so fat & gaity, that I am afraid you will not be able to ride him when you return home.

	Your little friends here are making a great many inquiries about you, & when you will return home.  The Baptist school is doing very well here one of the best teachers in the Southern States.

	Your mother writes you so often, & tells you so much of the news, that I suppose you are well posted up in regard to Greenville.  I would write you oftener if your mother did not write you so constantly.

	We are all anxious to see you & the servants will give you a warm greeting.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have just written a letter to the Southern Patriot in which I described our journey down here & could not repeat it to you.

	It is probable that the Western circuit will be taken up Friday next.  If so I shall have to go down to Charleston next week.

	I have just seen Edward who has been a little sick with cold.  He prefers living in Greenville, & does not like Mr. Antwerp much.   I shall see about it after tomorrow.  He is perfectly well now.  I will write to Anna tomorrow.  Jones went down after Flora & could return the middle of next week.  He completed his trade with Wilson & got the necessary funds.

	I hope Willie has returned safely & that you & all the children are well.

	I went to the college chappel to hear Thornwell this morning & have seen nothing of Col. Taylor & his family.  Dr. Thornwell seemed glad to see me& so did Mr. Brumby who enquired after you.

	I am in a roomCol. Owens of Barnwell.  Col. Watts informs me that Arthur Hayne is sick in Boston & that his wife is still acting as though she has just lost a brother.  The Col. says Arthur will kill himself drinking brandy.  He once travelled with him & said he would drink a tumbler full of brandy & it did not seem to move him.

	The Congaree House is not much improved.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.    I was afraid Willie had met with some accident.

	Edward has been unwell, but is now perfectly well.    He had a cold.  He looks rather thin.  Sunday he did not seem willing to stay with Mr. Antwerp.  But early this morning he came to tell me that if he had to stay in Columbia he would prefer remaining where he was.  I went up & saw Mr. Antwerp this morning.  He praises Edward a good deal for his intelligence & good behavior.  He says he is much better than any of his servants.  He says however, that he did not know much about such work as he is doing.  He proposes to give me one hundred dollars for the clothe, pay his taxes & doctors Bills.  He says his clothing costs $50.00, as he clothes his tailor boysthat Edward will be worth fifty dollars more at the end of the year by the instruction &c.  I gave him no overseer. He says in payment Edward may have two weeks to come home & eight or ten days at Christmas.     

	We had no court of Equity today.  Young, Herndon, Dawkins, Boylston, Thompson, Aldrich & a great many other lawyers are here.

	I was pleased with Mr. [William Henry] Millburns lecture.  He has produced quite a sensation in Charleston & Mrs. King has become seriously affected under his peaching says Col. deTreville.  She leads him up to the Pulpit & escorts him all over the cityHe taking her arm!  Piety badly lead.

	Today I argued the case of the church in Spartanburgh & commenced Dr. Bivings case, but it will take about all day tomorrow.  I shall get off from here the first of next week.  Governor Adams has given me an invitation to his house, Saturday next.  I am appointed to examine students next Tuesday.  I wrote to Anna this morning.

	I am getting my gold chain mended & borrowed a vest chain to wear.  They are now all the fashion.  I wish one for myself.  Willie may have the one I have been wearing.  Will that do him?  Write me.

	Col. OHanlon called to see me yesterday but I was out.  He left word that he would be back in a day or two.  Dr. Lieber called yesterday & I was out.  Dr. Thornwell called this evening, & presented me with a copy of his book on Truth with his presentation on the blank leaf.

	I will write to Dr. Croft & answer the other letters you sent me tomorrow.  I saw Mr. Green today.  He came up from Sumter to see me, & seemed greatly pleased with my settlement with Loring.

	I left Greenville Saturday & shall probably get through my business here this week.  You must therefore prepare to return next week.  At present, however, my movements are uncertain, but I hope to get through with my cases this week.  You must write me immediately & let me know when you will be ready to return home.  We shall all be glad to see you in Greenville once more.  I suppose your mother has informed you that we think of sending you to the Limestone Springs this summer.

	Governor Adams is going to give a party at his residence Friday & I suppose I shall be there.  Col. Jones went down for Flora last Sunday & I suppose with return here tomorrow.  A great many of your acquaintances during the session of the Legislature have enquired about you.

I finished the case of Dr. Bivings & Leitner yesterday & went to Dr. Blanding.  He has fastened the plate & tooth which gave me so much trouble very well & I can now talk, speak & eat without apprehension of the plate falling out.  In the evening I was with Professor McKay [McCay], Dr. Goodwyn & Col. Beadon  examinisg the plans of the new State House.

	Dr. Theodore Croft will write me to death, but I have promptly attended to all his business & have so written him. I was glad to receive Annas letter.

	The Committee to whom were refe[r]rred the various reports on the state of the College submitted to the Board of Trustees have carefully considered the same and respectfully ask leave to Report.

	In considering the documents refer[r]ed to them, your Committee have had reference only to such matters as required the immediate action of the Board.  They can barely allude to the present condition & prosperity of ethe college, the dilligence & progress of the young gentlemen connected with it, theirexceptionable deportment, together with the attention & ability of the Professors, as sources of high congratulation to the Board as well as to the whole State.

	Your Committee concur entirely with the President of the College, in recommending the appointment of a committee whose duty it shall be to visit the Laboratory, Cabinets, Library, observatory and rooms of the college, enquire into its internal affairs and report the same to this Board.  Such committee, would, no doubt by their visits & enquiries, have, in the language of the President a fine effect upon the officers & students.

	In obedience to the suggestion of President Thornwell, your Committee recommend the appointment, now, of a Board of Visitors to attend the examination of the Senior Class next fall as is required by the laws of the College.

	They concur with the President in his complimentary notice of the liberal and patriotic action of His Excellency the Governor in assisting with the contingent fund to rebuild the burnt wing of the College, and have no doubt the some will meet the hearty approval of the Legislature.

	In relation to the various matters of expenditures brought to the view of the Board by the President of the College they would recommend, hereafter, a more rigid observance of the rules & laws of the College which require all repairs to be made at the expense of those who occupy the College Buildings, and which forbid all expenditures of money without a previous appropriation by the Board of Trustees.

	They recommend, however, that the following sums be paid when the Treasurer is in funds to meet them.

	One Hundred sixty nine dollars & ninety six cents, expenses incurred in rebuilding the fencing & so forth of Professor Brumby. [this paragraph lined through in Perrys hand].

	Three Hundred & Forty dollars for the new fence around the Presidents House.

	Three Hundred & five dollars & ninety six cents for the fencing about the new Houses of the Professors.

	Thirty eight dollars and sixteen cents for shingling L House.

	Eight dollars & sixty two cents for tearing down the college walls.

	For Printing, to pay the present Bill of eighty seven dollars, & for necessary expenses of the examination one Hundred & fifty dollars.

	To pay the postage on the quarterly reports, which the committee recommend instead of monthly reports, fifteen dollars.

	To pay Brittons account for printing Professor McCays Address, Sixty Five dollars.

	To pay Walker & Evans Bill for printing addresses of President Thornwell & Mr. Petigru one hundred & fourteen dollars & fifty cents.

	Your Committee are unwilling in the present embarrassed condition of the funds of the College, to recommend the appropriations for the additional repairs to the lot of Professor Brumby. 

	Nor do they think there is any obligation on the part of the Board of Trustees to pay the expenditures made by Professors Lieber & Brumby in relation to the lightening rods which they have recently had attached to their Houses without the authority of the Board.

	Your Committee have considered the application made by the architect in relation to the fourteen Hundred dollars which he has become responsible for on account of the construction of the College Hall, & a majority of them think that this amount should be deducted from the sum due the contractwhen the Hall is finished, if the same can be done without prejudice to the Board or liability on their part. [This paragraph lined through by Perry].

	In relation to obtaining the necessary aid from the Legislature, for rebuilding the burnt wing of the College, your Committee would recommend that the matter to the view of the Legislature by His Excellency the President of the Board in his annual message.  

	All of which is respectfully submitted.  B.F. Perry, Chairman

	I have nothing to write you.  I shall go to Charleston in the morning & stay there Thursday & Friday & be home Saturday.

	I hardly think it is worthwhile for Frank to come & meet us.  It will cost three dollars & he will loose a day from school.  But still if you are disposed to let him come you may.

	I hope you will have all your house arranged by my return.  I can do all the shopping in two days in Charleston.

	I have just had my supper, written a letter to the Patriot & a long visit from Mr. F, who desires to be remembered to you kindly & affectionately.

	I have had a long visit too from Dr, Gibbes Editor of the Carolinian & Mr. Miller Editor of the Yorkville Paper.  They all have electioneering schemes.  Dr. Lieber paid me a visit yesterday evening after my arrival.  The election of President of the College comes off this week.  Dr. Laborde met me yesterday & thanked me for my notice of his Book, and invited me to a Literary club which meets at his House Tuesday evening.  He reads an Essay on Woman & then the subject is discussed by all the members & visitors.  Ladies are to be present but not to enter into the discussion till supper.  The society meets every fortnight.

	I have not seen the Governor, nor many members of the Legislature.  There was a great dinner here today in the new dining room & all the Town invited.  We have quite a number of ladies boarding here and amongst them Mrs. DL Fair.  Col. deTreville tried to get a room here for his daughters next week & could not.  I do not know what the young ladies will do at Commencement.  The House is very much enlarged & improved.  Janney has purchased the American after January.

	I did not go to church today.  The weather is bad & the rain is falling.  Col. Brockman & Duncan have gone to a private boarding House.  I met on the cars Mrs. Teter & husband.  She looked rather scared.  Mrs. Mauldin of Anderson was with her.  I saw Mrs. Daniels going north, who enquired after you very kindly & said she remembered Willie as a bright eyed light haired boy.

	I shall expect Willie & Anna Saturday. The servants have put two beds in my room, so that I might have a bed for my little sons to sleep in, (says Sam).  Anna knows the room.

	I shall expect to hear from you tomorrow night or evening.

	I do not think I shall have time to write you tomorrow.  Tell Fannie, Frank & Hext I will bring them a present and kiss dear little Hayne.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I asked me to say at which house Miss Susan Hoke shall stay.  I think it probable she would enjoy herself more with the young ladies she goes down with at the American.  I will go there & see her & take care of her.  But we [have] very pleasant company at this Hotel.  You ask me to name the Ladies.  They are changing constantly.  Mrs. D. L. Fair is here & tells me that she will take care of Anna.  There is a Miss Sedgwick a cousin of the authoress here, who sings & plays finely.  Mr. Wheaton whom you saw at Pendleton is here with two daughters who sing & play charmingly.  There is a Bride Mrs. Bail[e]y formerly Miss Bozeman of Charleston.  Dr. Winsmith of Spartanburgh has a daughter & a Miss Mills with him.  Mrs. Col. Herndon came today.  There are a good many others I do not know.  Do not send Frank till I see Col. OHanlon again.  Then if he insists on it he may come down.  But I dislike the expence.

	  I have just been in the drawing room & heard some very fine music.  Mr. Birdsall came to my room & invited me to go down & hear the Miss Weatons sing & play.  Tell Anna I have bought her a very beautiful writing desk ofwith flowers all over it.  It is a beautiful thing.  Price $15.00.

	I rece[ive]d your short letter last night just before I started to the College & was glad to hear you were all well.  I shall be glad to see Anna & Willie Saturday morning.

	I dined with Governor Adams Tuesday & they were very kind in their enquiries about you & the children.  I went from there to Dr. Labordes & staid till twelve oclock.  We has quite a literary meeting an account of which I have written for the Patriot.  Tonight I am invited to Mr. G.M. Thorp,but cannot go.

	I saw Mr. Blake yesterday who said he came up as far as Kingsville with Miss [Suzanne Mandeville] Sparks who spoke in terms of great admiration & affection for you & me & sent her best respects to me.  Her father who was with her said if anything was to happen to Mrs. Perry his daughter would try & take her place.  Mr. Blake said he was not willing that Mrs. Perry should yet take her place among the angels in Heaven.  Miss Sparkes will not be in Columbia.  I saw Col. Keitt last night.  He was in Charleston with Miss Sparks.  I saw Col. Wilson with him & it may be true that they will yet get married.    

	I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin.  Their families are all well.

	Last night at the Board of Trustees I made a speech & a warm one in favor of Dr. Lieber as President.  Mr. Barnwell spoke in favor of Professor McCay.  Mr. Petigru spoke in favor of Dr. Lieber, the    
election taking place Wednesday.  It is very doubtful who will be elected.

	I hope Wily & Charles will go on clearing.  I should suppose two or three weeks was long enough for Minerva to stay at Pendleton.  I am glad Stroud sent the corn.

	I received your letter this morning & also one from Willie & a line from Frank.  After reading your letter I went down to the State House to meet my committee, but the members did not attend & I have returned to write you a letter.

	You must think me very foolish to suppose I am going to interfere in legislating on the subject of temperance.  I have always & uniformly expressed myself decidedly opposed to the Moi Liquor law.  I Am glad to see the cause of temperance& am sure it does good.  But I am not for legislating in that way.

	I am sorry Frank will be disappointed in not coming with Willie & Anna, but he may come down if Col. OHanlon insists on it when I see him.  I should like to see you all tomorrow.  It is very probable I may come up next Saturday & stay Sunday if we have no pressing business before the House.  Frank may then come down & stay with Col. OHanlon till his school commences.  Next session we will engage a family room & parlor or rent a house as General martin does.  

	I saw Col. Preston Brooks today on his way to Washington.  He begged me to write him & said there was not a man in South Carolina whom he regarded higher or whose good opinion he valued more. This was said in front of Taber & he must have heard it.

	By the by General Bonham tells me that young Brooks and Miss Mary Adams are engaged to be married.  He said it was pretty conclusive from what she said to him the evening we dined with the Governor.

	Col. Evans the district attorney has been very cordial to me & speaks with great pleasure of Greenville.  He goes in the morning & will return Monday.

	My commentaries on Boyces speech have been highly complimented by a good many persons.

	You say I must write you every day.  I have scarcely a moment to spare to do anything.  I am so much engaged I have not time to converse with my friends & acquaintances.

	The Judiciary Bill has been under discussion today & will be again tomorrow.  It is expected that I will say something on the subject & I must now close my letter & prepare some notes.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just had dinner & Anna has gone with the Miss Adams to the Presbyterian church.  This morning Sue Hoke & Anna, Willie Gill Watson & myself went to the Episcopal church.  Last night we went to hear General Casey deliver a temperance lecture in the State House.  Afterwards we had dancing & singing till eleven oclock.  There is quite a crowd of ladies here.  Sue & Anna seem yp enjoy themselves very much.  They went to see the girls at the American Hotel after returning from church & paid a pleasant visit.  I gave up my room to them & have taken possession of Col. Irbys room with Willie.  The Col. has gone home & will not return till Tuesday.  In my room there are two beds.  When Irby returns I will have another bed put in the room & stay with him.  But roomwas in more demand.  A very large concourse of ladies came down Saturday & are now at this Hotel.

	I was glad to meet Anna & Sue & Willie at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening.  Willie has bought him acap.  I am sorry you did not receive my letter Friday night.  There is great carelessness at the Bar in sending off letters.  Wells came up to take my letter & I told him I had mailed it.  I will send this by Wells.  

	I saw Armistead Burt yesterday.  He is at this House.  He came up & took a seat at the table by Anna & told her he saw her when she was a baby that he was one of my oldest friends, but that he was not quite as old as I was.  Anna denied this promptly & said I looked much younger.  He is three years my senior.  He said I did not change at all.  I told him you looked.  I told him you looked about seventeen.  He said it was strong proof that I had made you a good husband.  That case & distress wore out & broke down a wife faster than anything else.  He seems very kind & I have great regard for him.

	Tomorrow I will probably make a speech on the Judiciary Bill.

	I have not seen Col. OHanlon since I wrote you.  I expect it is better for Frank to stay at Home nor do I suppose [page faded]my power to return him before the session ends.

	Willie & Anna will go to Charleston Wednesday morning. Col. Dargan had a good deal of chat with Anna in the college.

	I have just returned from the College& will write you a line.		

	Professor McCay has been elected President over Dr. Lieber, eighteen to ten votes.  I am very much grieved & mortified at the result.  Dr. Lieber will now quit the College I expect.  He will be sadly disappointed.
	  		
	Anna & Willie are dancing & the room [is] full of ladies.  Sue Hoke is not dancing.  I will go down in a few minutes & tell Anna as she goes off at six in the morning that she must retire.  Sue Hoke speaks of returning Thursday morning.  Willie will stay a day or two in Charleston & return here without going to the Cains.  Gill Watson is here & speaks of going down to Charleston with them.  

	I made a speech today on the Judiciary Bill & carried it by seven votes.  If I can push the Electoral Bill through I shall be greatly delighted.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening.  It was very short.

	I must now quit & bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Miss Susan Hoke has just gone to the American Hotel to spend the night & go up in the morning with the Greenville ladies there.  Anna left this morning for Charleston & I am now restored to my own room again at eleven oclock in the night.  This I am extremely glad of as Col. Irby is a bad bed fellow, snores & grits his teeth most horribly.  I have slept scarcely at all the last two nights as his bed fellow,  What his wife does, poor woman,  I know not!  He has to wet his head before going to bed & then put a wet towel under his pillow to put around his head in the night to keep it from burning up.  But he is a good fellow & I like him in all respects except as a bed fellow.  Sue Hoke has enjoyed herself very much & expresses a wish to come back next session.  Her frank manners & livelyhave gained her a good many friends & admirers.  She would not dance & this was a drawback on her amusements.  They are dancing here every night.

	My speech on the Judiciary has been very much complimented.  Whaley & Pope came to my seat & thanked me for it.  [John Etienne] Tobin told Governor Adams that it was the only argument on my side of the question & yet[Mem]minger spoke on that side.

	Col. & Mrs. Preston have sent me a note inviting me there tomorrow evening at 8 1/2 oclock in the evening.  They are to have a magnificent party I suppose.  

	Today I made several short speeches on the State House.

	Tomorrow the electoral law comes up & I shall have to say something.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Franks.  But I have not seen Col. OHanlon.  I must now conclude.  Douglass & Donaldson are both admitted to the Bar.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Tell your mother that I have just rece[ive]d her letter written after your grandmother had dined with you.

	I suppose Susan Hoke has been over to see your mother & told her all about Columbia.  I have not seen Col. OHanlon since I wrote the first time.  Willie will return tomorrow & perhaps go home Monday or Tuesday.

	I am sorry bee turns out a such egg day, but the egg shells ought to be in the nest if Burt sucked them.

	Tell Fanny I hope she ids getting & saying her lessons also.  Tell Hext he ought to begin to learn his letters and tell Hayne he must begin to talk when I return home.

	Say to your mother that Mrs. Martin is not in Columbia.  Anna did not see Mrs. Taylor or any of the family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night just before I started to Col. Prestons magnificent party, & thankful I would write you till after my return.  But I did not get back till after two oclock & slept till Mr. Wells was about starting.  I have not yet had my breakfast & will write you now for fear I may not have time tonight.  Today the Electoral Bill is discussed.  I made a short speech yesterday on that subject.  Tomorrow the Bill providing for a separate court of appeals comes up, so it is impossible for me to think of returning home.

	I have just come back from breakfast & have to go to the State House in a few moments.

	I went to the party last night with Col. Alston & Harrison.  There were a great many persons there & I have never seen a more magnificent display.  I cannot, nor I have time to describe the party.  Col. Preston introduced me to Mrs. Preston, who asked me to take a seat by her, & we commenced talking about the mountains.  But in a few moments she had to rise to receive other company & I had to give up my seat.  It reminded me of much of the Presidents levee.  Mrs. Preston stood to receive her company.  The Col. was near the door to greet them first.  The rooms & entry (three rooms) were all full.  The ladies were richly dressed, & amongst them were Flora Jones & Sally Thompson.  Judge Withers had a very pretty daughter there about seventeen & vert talented.  Governor Manning & his wife were there.  Miss Sally Thompson says Governor Manning in Columbia & Governor Manning in Greenville are very different persons.  I went up to leave to Mrs. Manning & she held forth her hands & said she wad glad to see Major Perrythat I had treated her unfairly in visiting her house in her absencethat [I] must pay another visit & stay longer.  She is a real cordial. Warm hearted Virginian and still a fine looking lady.  We supped at one oclock.  About two oclock we broke up.  There was dancing, waltzing &c., good wines & rich brandy.  What a fine thing says Col. Watts to be rich.

	Tell Frank if I have time I will write him tomorrow morning & I will get his cap.  Willie will come back tomorrow & probably go home Tuesday.    Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  I was in hopes you had seen Susan Hoke & that she had told you all about her visit to Columbia.

	I have seen Edward several times & I have also seen Mr. Antwerp.  Edward looks very well & dresses finely.  He seems well pleased & Antwerp expresses himself pleased with Edward.  I told him that he had not improved him as he agreed to do.  He said he would pay more on account of it.  He is to make me an offer for the next year by letter at Christmas.

	Willie came back last night.  He said Mr. Cain met them at theHouse & took charge of Anna.  He went to see all of his relatives in Charleston.  Anna wishes the Southern Patriot sent to her.  Tell Elford to send it.  

	The bundle you sent Anna came safely by Peter although I had not known it till Willie told me last evening.

	The letter of Miss Sparks was inclosed to me & I gave it to Susan Hoke open.

	This is a great day.  Willie has been to church, but I have been in my room all day reading the equity report.

	I have purchased two beautiful oil paintings as large as portraits in fineframes representing Scotch scenes for twenty dollars.  I will send them up by Willie.  I dont know when he will go up, as he wishes to stay a day or two & listen to the debates.
  
	Pinkney {Pinckney] went home Saturday & did not let me know.  He says his wife is sick.  I am sorry I cannot go home occasionally.  It would be a great pleasure.  A great many of the members are gone today.  They went yesterday & return tomorrow.

	I made another speech yesterday on the Judiciary in reply to General McGowan.  The Bill was defeated but we will try it again tomorrow.

	The ladies here are gone, & the Hotel seems quite deserted.  We shall probably adjourn the 19th Wednesday.  Willie is now in the room with me, reading a novel.  He has no news from Charleston.  I suppose you have heard from Anna by Miss  She went to see Mrs. Eliza Hayne but none of the rest of them.

	I went up to the toy shop yesterday and looked over the pretty things.  Ask Frank, Fannie, Hext & Hayne what I must bring them.

	I broke my key this morning in my trunk & cannot get into the trunk again till tomorrow.  Bad luck with my trunk.

	I will go & see Mrs. Adams next Tuesday if I have time.

	In great haste.  I long to be at home again with my dear Liz & the children.  Hereafter I will never stay from you more than two weeks or you will have to go with me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now after eleven oclock but have just returned from the special committee Zeide way.  I have only been to write you a line.

	I recd your letter & was greatly shocked to hear of the sad fate of the poor little girl Sarah.  I do hope my dear wife it will make you all careful about fire & candles.  You know my constant apprehensions on that subject.  Do make the servants put out their fires & candles at an early hour.  

	Willie is asleep.  I will keep him here a day or two.

	My candle is giving out  & I must bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just recd your letter & am truly sorry to hear that Mr. Bs John is so low.  I am afraid Mary will catch the fever & bring it into our yard.  This I would not have done for thousands of dollars.  Keep her away from him as much as possible, and if he dies do not let her stay all night with the Corpse.  It could be fatal.  Make all the servants clear out their rooms & whitethem.

	I recd a letter from Anna this morning & she writes that she has just written you.  She was very much pleased with Columbia & says that P Hoke made her stay here more pleasant.  Willie went to the race course today & is now gone somewhere.  It is eight oclock.  He will probably return Thursday.  The next letter I will send by Willie.
	I recd a letter from Mr. Elford saying he had recd Eighty five dollars for me from Edings on his Edings note.  Edings is one of my Pickens clients.  He wishes me to write him what to do with the money.  If you wish any of it send for it; otherwise he can pay it over to Mr. McBee.  I will write him to that effect.  I will write him to pay it over to you.  He writes me that he has purchased out the Mountaineer  & will consolidate the papers in the next two numbers.  I am glad the old Mountaineer is done & I suppose you are.  But I suppose you will not like the name being retained.  I am glad of it, as we will have it as a trophy in our banner.  

	Willie tells me that he met Willie Taylor in the Senate chamber yesterday, but he said nothing to him about going to see him!

	We have agreed to adjourn next Wednesday at ten oclock.  I will probably be able to get home that day.  I am very anxious to see you all again.  Although I have had Willie & Anna with me it is not like having you & Hayne & Hext.  But above all you.  For the last eighteen years I have been so much with you at home I feel at a loss when away from you.  There are few men who have spent so much of their time with their wives as I have or who have loved them more.

	The Judiciary Bill was defeated again this evening by two votes.  I was all day engaged arranging & defending it.  But it was lost by not following my advice & reducing the court to three Judges.

	Governor [James H.] Adams is in a peck of trouble about the censure which the committee have passed on him for returning theLegislation, resolutions.  He threatened to resign.  So you see that all have their troubles, the Governor as well as your husband.

	Col. [Thomas] Dawkins is here with his wife.  I do not fancy her much.  The Col. drank so hard that he was crazy this last Fall, so Col. Herndon told me.    

	I like softness & sweetness in women, not bold fussy women, blue stockings & conceited ladies.  The other day I had occasion to speak of Judge Hayne whilst the gallery was filled with ladies.  I said he was positive to a reflection on his honor as a lady was to an imputation on her modesty.

	But I must now quit & write to Mr. Elford.  I had nothing to write about & yet I have written a long letter,

	Good night my dear wife, your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I now have nothing to do at night until my committee business is over.

Letter 347

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & I have time to write you a long letter.  The weather is bad & I shall not go to church.  I have just finished a long letter to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  The union of these two names sounds horribly to ears yet awhile.

	I rece[ive]d Franks letter last night with a line added by you & for which I thank you.  General McGowan asked me if it was a fact that I wrote a letter to my wife every day.  He said he had heard so & told his wife so, & that it has elevated me very much in her estimation.  She desired him to do the same, but that he would not find time to write more than twice a week.  I told him that you & I both wrote to each other every day, & that also wrote to the Patriot daily, notwithstanding my arduous duties.  He expressed great surperize.

	I have not written to you a full letter since I dined at Col. Prestons.  The dinner was superb one & I never ate more or drank more.  We did not rise from the dinner table till after ten oclock in the night!  I had promised Governor Adams to go to his house that night to attend the Literary Club if I could get off in time for eight oclock.  But I had to forego that pleasure.  I was very anxious to be present at the governors.  Generals Bonham & McGowan who were there said I was very much enquired for.  I suppose some of the literary gentlemen desired me to speak at their debate again.

	My. Account of the meeting at Dr. Labordes has excited a great deal of chat with the ladies & the Patriot is in great demand, although a copy is sent to each member.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks the other day by her son of the Drs quitting the College.  Mrs. Dawkins manifested great interest in seeing the Patriot & the Col. got a copy for her.

	I dined with Col. Campbell & Count deCha the other day.  We had a very pleasant party & the Count gave me a pressing invitation to visit him next summer in Henderson.

	Last night I was invited to take supper with the governor after the adjournment of the Legislature.  But the House did not adjourn till midnight & I came home & went to bed.  I wish very much to see Mrs. Adams & her daughters before I leave Columbia, but I am afraid I shall not have time.

	We shall have to sit up all night now till the Legislature adjourns if we do the business of the House.  I shall not be at home till Thursday & may not have time to write you again.  I hope Willie was able to tell you a good deal about Columbia & the Legislature, and I will tell you a great deal when I return home.

	I am my dear Liz exceedingly anxious to see you & the children & be with you all again.  It is actually painful when I think of having to stay till Thursday.  But some of the members, my friend Col. [Benjamin Henry] Willson [Wilson] for instance, seem perfectly willing to stay a week or two longer and have actually tried to force the Legislature to rescind their order for adjourning.  They are perhaps happier, & have more enjoyment from [here] than at homenot so with your husband.  When I think of my position at Greenville, never from home more than a week whilst on the circuit & receiving five thousand dollars a year, I feel happy, & would not exchange my situation for any office less than that of the Presidency.  Whaley & some members from below said to me I had been spoken of as Judge if there was an election, but that they had said I would not accept.  I told them they were right, & that I was doing much better than to be a Judge.  

	In regard to my likeness I have not time to sit for a daguerreotype & I do not think a better one could be made than the one you gave Elford.  He need not wait for any other if he intends having an engraving of me.

	I shall expect a long letter from you Monday night.  You can write me Tuesday evening & I will get it Wednesday night.  

	Last night on returning from the State House I fell in company with General Martin.  He seemed very kind & cordial & enquired after you all.  He said he never saw me.  I did not go into the Senate & he did not go into the House.  I have seen nothing of Taylor for two weeks.  Last night I walked to the State House with Isaac Hayne & General Bonham.  Hayne wishes his salary raised four or five hundred dollars.

	Tell Willie I went for his wal[l]et yesterday.  They were at work on it & said it should be ready Monday.

	I will now enclose & write a letter to Anna.  I was glad to read her letter to you.  I have not yet written to her at all nor have I heard from her but once.  Flora Jones is going with Mrs. Allen to Montgomery to stay with Mrs. Young awhile.

	Tell Frank & Fanny I hope they are studying their Books & will learn faster under your instruction than they have done at school.

	In January you & I will go down for Anna & stay awhile at the Mills House.  I shall receive $500 of Williams at American sale day in January & perhaps my Mobile money with Strouds &c.  A few days from home together will be pleasant & it is so pleasant to travel with you & leave all the children at home.  Our trip to Pickens was a pleasant one.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I thank you for your letter & desired to have answered it sooner, but I have no time to write to you except on Sunday.  We very often sit in the Legislature till midnight & yesterday we met at eleven and adjourned Sunday.  Monday weafter twelve in the night!

	I was glad to hear you were enjoying yourself so much, & your little friend & her father were so much pleased to see you.  I hope she will come up next summer and stay with you.  You must remember me to Mr. Cain, & tell him I often think of him & should be pleased to meet him again.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last night & she enclosed one of your letters to her.  Willie staid with me till last Friday.  He returned from Charleston on Saturday after you left him.  Your mother has written you all the Greenville news.  I shall go home Thursday morning.

	There are no ladies at the Congaree House now.  They all left a few days after you did.  I sent up your writing desk by Willie.  It is a beautiful thing & you must take special care of it when you return home.

	Flora Jones has gone to Barnwell & is going to Montgomery with Mrs. Allen to stay with Mrs. Yancey.  I met her & Sally Thompson at a great Ball at Col. John Prestons.  It was one of the most splendid entertainments I ever saw.  Susan Hoke went home the day after you left. 

	Frank writes me a letter every day or two & his last one was quite a long letter, and he gave me a good bit of news.

	I have ordered the Patriot to be sent you.  Mr. Elford has purchased the Mountaineer & the two papers have been blended.

	I must now conclude & go to dinner.  I think of you & Susan Hoke very often when I start to my meals.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

I have just dressed & have time only to say that I am well & will be at home Thursday.  We did a great deal yesterday & I was speaking for five hours last night with short intervals on the state Capitol.  I did not sleep well but feel quite well this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from General Thompson at Wilmington in great agony about his child who was extremely ill.  He requested me to forward the letter to Batten which I did.

	I have only a few moments to write you my last letter from Columbia this Session.  Tomorrow night I shall have the joy & satisfaction of meeting you & the children once more.  I wish it was tonight.  As the time approaches the more anxious I am to be at home.  There is no place to me like home sweet home, & perhaps I have more to make my home sweet than others, which is the reason of my love of home.  But I am somewhat differently constituted from other husbands & fathers, & you too are different from most wives, & we have both taken pleasure in making each other happy.

	I returned last night just before midnight from the Legislature & left the House in Session.  President McCay came to me in the morning & said Mrs. McCay desired me to go & take tea with her that evening, but I could not.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks for my notice of the DL.  So I am in good repute with both them today.

	You wrote me some time ago for money when I had not a cent.  You forgot that I started with my little in hand & had to give Willie thirty dollars to pay his expenses to Charleston & Anna ten or fifteen whilst regretting that I had no money.  Mr. Spain came up & tapped me on the shoulder & said he was authorized by Mrs. Green of Sumter to pay me fifty dollars.  I thought to myself that it was always so, good fortune attends me & money comes when I get out.  I went down into the Governors Room & he paid me for Ware sixty three dollars which I shall keep for interest on Wares note.  Presently the Clerk of the House came & brought me a check for John Watson for one hundred & twenty five dollars & Watson owes me a little.

	I dined yesterday with Col. Wag[e]ner & had a pleasant time with his mess.

	I went up to Heises to buy some taps & he made me a present of a fine silver headed walking stick.  I bought some candy, three dollars, a whip with a whistle, crackers, a knife for Frank, a cap for Willie &c.&c.

	I must now stop as the agent is about leaving Miss Hayne for me & I will pay you back the kiss tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry

	I have scarcely time to say I am well as you requested me simply to say when I have not time to write you.  Yesterday I dined with the Charleston mess & had a pleasant evening with Count Chais, Col. Campbell Wilson & others.  The House did not adjourn till near midnight last night & I have slept rather late this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night which was gratifying to my feelings as a husband & lover of my wife.

	Yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing my Bill giving the election of Electors to the people pass by one vote.  All the other Bills on the subject were defeated, & we spent the whole day in voting.

	I will write you a long letter Sunday and have a great deal to say.  But it is thought that the Legislature cannot adjourn on the 19th.  I do not suppose I can leave here till the adjournment.  But I am very anxious to be at home once more.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just recd your letter of yesterday dated Charleston, stating that you had arrived safely and all were well!  I am truly glad to hear all are well, but I am sorry to hear you are in Charleston again.  I hope you did not after I left you Tuesday morning get out & take the downward train.  

	I shall not be able to get off in the morning but hope to reach my case tomorrow & be at home Friday evening.  Have the carriage at the depot for me & I should be happy to meet you & the children there.

	I went down to the rail road depot this evening & ascertained that my boxes were put on board the Greenville cars & will leave in the morning.  But I hear nothing of the carriage.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & brought a bundle for you.  Mrs. Elford will be here tomorrow.  He told me of the death of Butler Haynes daughter.

	How anxious I am to be at home ever more.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.

	Harman was tried this morning.  I do not think there was any chance for him.

	I have gained all my cases in Equity.

	I must now conclude.  Mrs. Brown sent me word that she had some potters to send you.  Brown has come back to suit his affectionate wife.

	I have about ten minutes before breakfast to write you.  Mr. Elford & myself are in a room together.  There were about four hundred passengers yesterday on the Greenville Rail Road.  Five cars full.  The largestever on the road and the taverns are crowded.  The stockholders paid nothing.  Hence some came from Greenville who only own two shares forty dollars.  We had a dusty ride down here.  I thought I should never get clean again.  But after washing I went out & bought me some clothestwo coats, two pants, four vests, a& pair of gloves for $28.00nice clothes too.

	I met Col Ware & Mr. Duncan returning home yesterday.  They have purchased 1800 acres of land in Georgia at $12 per acre.  Mr. Furmans intended bride was on the road.  She is tall & pale & rather pleasant looking.  

	The Rail Road convention meets this morning & will get through tomorrow.
	
	The committee & convention is much talked of.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  Mrs. Col. Fair came down with the Col. & enquired after you.

	I went to the officelast night and could find no letter from you.  I told the fellow there must be a letter & he assured me there was none this morning.  Elford found your letter as he went in to mail one for himself.  It was lying on the desk.  He brought it up to me just as I was sitting down to complain of your negligence.

	I am now writing to you before breakfast & Elford & Mauldin who has been rooming with me will go up this morning.  I will send the letter by Elford.  I enclose you the $20.00.  I was glad to hear you were all well, & that you had got through with white washing.  I am sorry your money will not pass.  If you wished to purchase anything of the merchants I am sure they will not refuse the Bill.

	I called to see Antwerp yesterday & he paid me $32.50 for balance of Edwards bill.  This is rather better than I expected,

	The Rail Road Convention adjourned yesterday.  We had a great deal of discussion & some sparring between Judge ONeall & myself.  In my Report I give the President & directors a caution about their extravagance & selling bonds too low & the Judge did not like it.

	I saw Col. OHanlon yesterday.  He seems very kind & cordial & enquired after you & the children.  He said the other day in company with my friend Thompson & Mr. Green talking about the nominee from the Presidency he said he would be glad to see me nominated & that they all concurred  with him!  This is surely an evidence of strong feeling on his part.  He introduced me to Co. Ben McCulloch of Texas.  He is a rough unpolished &man & I think Miss Sparks had better have Col. Keitt.  He has been to see her & has also been to see Col. Pickens daughters so said.

	Col. Orr arrived here last night.  He says there will be a vacancy for midshipmen in September but that the applicant must be not under fourteen nor older than fifteen.  Frank is yet too young.

	Tell Frank I will get his sword.  But an officer has no use for a drum.  I hope he is not going to turn drummer.

	Dr. Fair has been very polite to me, but I have only seen Mrs. Fair once.  Mr. LeConte the new Professor & his wife are boarding at this House.  He is a very pleasant gentleman indeed & moderate & unpretending.  But his wife, whose acquaintance I have not made, seems one of the most magnificently dressy & pompous women I ever saw.  She is a New Yorker & came to the table, dressed as if for a Ball, with bare arms & shoulders.    She is a large woman & the Professor a small man.

	I have seen none going to Charleston yet.  I saw Edward Buist one evening.  He enquired about Willie.  President McCay & Professor LaBorde had called to see me at the same time & Edward seemed shy of them & staid but a moment.  The College is doing well.  There is a fuss about Dr. LaBordes defence of Dr. Lieber in the subject of slavery.

	I must now close my letter to you & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Tell your mother not to be in a tieabout selling her land,& quit saying she will take $7.00.  Hanckle will give $8.00 just as quick as seven.  He perhaps does not wish to buy at all.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday morning & I have just breakfasted & will not write you a few lines for fear I may not do so after awhile.

	I rece[ive]d your short letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well.  But would have been better satisfied if you had stated that Anna had returned as well as Frank from Paris Mountain.  I hope Wiley drove the Barouche, for I should not like to trust the horses with any of those young men in going up the mountain.

	Tell Frank I have bought him a sword for 15 cts.  The preparation for bedsteads I started to purchase, but the shop was full of Ladies & I passed on.  I have bought a fountain pen which writes all day without being dripped in ink more than once.  This is a great convenience.  It is like writing with a pencil.

	I have nothing of interest to write you last night.  General Casey made a Tennyson Lecture but I did not go out to hear him.  I sat in my room & read [Samuel] Rogers table talk a very interesting book of sketches of men & anecdotes of men.

	The delegates to the Convention are coming in pretty rapidly & we shall no doubt have a large representation.
	
	There was quite an excitement here the other day against Dr. LaBorde for some expressions of his on the slavery question.  They thought the article was written by Col. Preston & his enemies caused the excitement.

	The church Bells are now ringing & I will finish my letter this evening.

	It is now after supper & I will finish my letter.  I went to the Episcopal church and heard a good sermon from Mr. Shand.  I saw Alexander Taylor & he said they were all well.  I did not see Mrs. Taylor.  I sat with Mr. Ford who has charge of the Male Academy in this place & boards at this Hotel.  He married a Georgetown lady.  Taylor invited me to sit in his pew.

	After dinner Col. Orr & myself went over to see Col. Pickens & spent the evening.  His daughters are with him & came into the room.  I had a good deal of chat with the youngster.  There was a Mr. Taylor with Thompson [a] Virginian who may be a B of the eldest.  I see Maxwell from Georgetown is here who is said to be engaged to one of them.  I spoke of Col. McCullough to the youngest in connexion with Miss Sparks & I thought she seemed confused.  She enquired what I thought of Col. McCullough & seemed to wish to have my opinion of him.  

	There was a young Pringle a delegate here this evening who enquired after you & said he heard of your very often through his aunt.  Col. Wilson is here from Georgetown.  We have a large number of delegates already arrived.  Tomorrow I shall be very busy & you need not expect me by the next mail.

	I must now conclude my letter & write one to the Patriot.  I hope you & the children are well & shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  Col. Orr spoke to me about occupying the district Judgeship in place of Gilchrist who is dead.  I declined it.  He has telegraphed the President not to make the appointment till his return to Washington.  Col. Moses of Sumter, Col. McGrath & Mr. Evans are the  The salary is $2,700.  We could not live in Charleston on that salary.

	The other day after the Rail Road Convention adjourned & after I had spoken several times Mr. Wardlaw a cousin of the Judges came up to me & said he has long heard of me but never had seen me before & that I was a man after his own heart from the speeches I had made.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I barely have time to acknowledge the receipt of your letter last night.

	I have a great deal of writing to do this morning before the Convention meets & I did not get to bed till twelve oclock last night.

	We had a glorious meeting last night & a noble speech from Col. Pickens, President of the Convention.  There were perhaps 120 delegates present.  We will adjourn tonight.  I shall try to be at home next Saturday.  My cases in court were disposed of yesterday.  Col. Brockman, Bolling, McKay, Jones came down.  Flora Jones came up from Barnwell last night & is at this Hotel, but I have not seen her.  Tell Anna all the other servants enquired after her.

	God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees, but I will write you a few lines.

	It is probable that I shall not be able to leave here before Tuesday morning.  The cases of mine in the court have been restored & will not [be] argued till Friday.  The Board of Trustees have appointed me on a committee with Col. Memminger, Mr. Barnwell, Governor Means & Col. Dawkins to consider & report all the college difficulties & matters.  This will detain me some days.  The Governor has made up a party for my special benefit, according to past agreement with him, to go down to spend Saturday & Sunday with him.  He would receive no excuse.  The Court of Appeals deliver opinions on Monday.  So I think I shall not be able to leave here till Tuesday.  You must write to me.

	Governor Adams has promised me sixty rifles for Willies company.  He will give me the order tomorrow, and I will have them sent up at once, to Greenville.  This will be good news for Willie to communicate to the Students.  The Governor seems very cordial & says there is not a man in South Carolina he would sooner oblige or prefer having at his House.  He enquired after you & Anna very kindly.  Tell Willie Chancellor Johnston enquired after him very particularly.

	Col. Jones & Flora go up in the morning.  Col. Pickens has just called to see me, but I was at the College.  Col. Memminger introduced me to his two sons who took tea here this morning.  They seem very clever young men or boys.  This evening I speak with Col. Memminger & Professor LeConte.  I have not yet made the acquaintance of Mrs. LeConte.  Captain McCullough said what is very true of herthat she looked too much like she desired the admiration of the world to care much for her husband.  He seems a most amiable & interesting gentleman.    

	I saw Mr. Jann[e]y who enquired after all of you & desired Anna to go & stay with his daughters.  He said they had just returned from school.  They said they saw me on the streets, but I did not recognize them.  He seemed very kind.  Captain McCullough is addressing Miss Pickens, so says Col. Watts, hence her curiosity to know what I thought of him.  Flora Jones told me that Miss Sparks was dead but this cannot be so.

	I will try & get Franks company the& him the epaulettes.  Willie & Frank their hats & Anna a prayer book.  I have not spent much money in the purchase of books & have bought only a fewPrescotts, Philip, McCauley, Tre, Washington, Allisons continuation of his History & Rogers Table Talkfifteen or sixteen dollars worth.

	It is all better for me that I cannot be a Judge or do anything else than work for the support of my wife & children.  I do this with a hearty good will & enjoy it, & see more pleasure than if I were in Congress or on the Bench.  My reputation will be better too in the sight of my God & man.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and also the bundle & thebox to Mr. Reynolds who goes down in the morning and who promises me to see them delivered to your aunts.  The Box to you, came up this morning, Mr. Wells says he will take it up in the morning.  I have put him in charge of it.

	He told me this evening that he had carried a receipt for you to Dr. Boatwright & it made four bottles.  He paid $2.00 & that you took only one of the bottles & returned the others to him.  This was a most untho act on your part.  To oblige you he gets amode , & because it amounts to more than you desired, you leave him to pay the $1.50.  He said he knew I would pay it when he mentioned it to me.  I did pay him.  You can send & get the other three bottles.  Dr. Boatwright asked me how you liked the preparation.  He said it was the best preparation of the kind that he had ever seen.  I never heard anything about it & could tell him nothing.

	I shall probably return home Thursday.  The Board of Trustees meet Wednesday night, & I shall not stay to my subsequent meeting.

	You can tell Willie to say to his college friends that I have not yet seen the Governor.  He was to come up tonight or in the morning.

	I got your preparation for bed bugs & will bring it up with me.

	The convention adjourned this evening after appointing as delegates to the Cincinnati convention Governor manning, Pickens, McGrath, Gadberry, Porter, McBeth, Wilson, Dudley, Moses, Farrow, Orr, Brooks, Sullivan, Palmer. Allen & Brown.  I could have been appointed but I could not have gone without a great sacrifice.  My business would have been ruined for the next Court of Equity.

I must now conclude my letter & go to bed as I did not sleep much last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz
	
	It is now near eleven oclock & I will write you a few lines, before going to bed.  I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & strange to say you still write about sending the bundles.  They were sent long since.

	I shall be at home Tuesday evening.  I dislike staying here but circumstances have rendered it.

Necessary.  All day today I was engaged with Barnwell, Memminger and Dawkins on College matters.  We report tomorrow evening.  I spent the day pleasantly.  We called the President of the College & all the Professors before us to give us information.  No doubt McCay did his duty in the riots.  We have expelled Rhett and [John Charles] McClenag[h]an.

	I have bought Willie, Frank & Hext hats $3.00, $6.50 & $1.00Panama and Leghorn hats.  I bought Willie & Anna gloves $3.50 and a Book for Anna which I hope she will read & study.  The Ladys guide to perfect gentility.  It is an admirable book.  I have bought two bottles of the balm of a thousand flowers.  It is good for anything.  I can shave with two drops of it & it makes a fine lather.  It is a good tooth wash &c.  I am now so sleepy that I will finish my letter in the morning.

	I have just dressed & will write you a few additional lines.  I feel better this morning than I have since I have been in Columbia.  Slept well & my system is [in] a better condition.  But I begin to wish to be at home.  I am afraid my business is neglected there.  My clients will wish to see me.  And I wish to see you & the children.  It isa pleasant to go from home occasionally just to have and enjoy the pleasure of returningfor after all there is no place like home.  Someone says in Rogers Table Talk that he pitties the man no matter how great and how rich who has no one to love.  I have my wife & six children to love & provide for & it is my greatest enjoyment & happiness.

	Col. OHanlon dined with me the other day & seemed very cordial but he is a tiresome   egotistical man.  He told me that Mrs.Jones had written him a letter recently wishing to boron $2.500 & pledge the honor of a lady for its return.  The colonel did not answer the letter.    He did not appreciate the security.  But this you must say nothing about.

	I rece[ive]d a Patriot last night through Mr. Wells, but none through the office.  Chancellor Dunkin spoke to me for a copy when I received it.

	I have nothing now to write & must conclude & write to the Patriot.  I suppose I shall not hear from you tonight & Saturday night.  I shall be at Governor Adams--so I shall not hear from you now till Monday morning and Tuesday morning I start home.

	Governor Adams returns this morning & will give me the order for the rifles.  I will immediately have them boxed up & forwarded to Greenville.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I have barely time to write you that I have got through with my cases in court & Dealers vsof the College & but for my promise to the Governor could return home this morning.

	Chancellor Wardlaw & Aldrich & Boylston go with mew to the Governors & will return Monday morning.  We shall no doubt have a pleasant trip.   

	I rece[ive]d your letter last evening & should like very much to get the one which will arrive here this evening and which you say shall be a long one.  But I shall not have the pleasure of reading it till Monday morning.  You can write me by Mondays mail again.

	I wish to see you & the children very much & regret that I cannot go home this morning.  

	Tell Willie that I got the Rifles & accoutrements yesterday & they will start on the Rail Road in boxes Monday morning directed to me.  They will reach Greenville Tuesday evening.

	I am with great love & affection, your husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I write you merely to let you know I will be at home tomorrow evening.

	I saw Warren yesterday who told me they were all well at the Farm & his Fathers.  They had just heard of the death of Clark Perrys wife.  She died of typhoid fever in Texas & left a little daughter ten months old.  It is a sad fate for the poor girl remote from all friends but her husband.

	Warren paid me about five hundred dollars for the estate from the sale of wheat & bacon.

	I have got a good many new cases here but no money.

	Elford, Donaldson, Easl[e]y & Sloan Duncan came on with me on Sunday.  Elford told me that Dr. Edward Jones had cut his throat in Jail.  I presume the family have no regrets on the subject.

	I have not had any conversation with Keith yet on the subject of your settlement.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

	I arrived here this evening safe & well.  We had a pleasant time coming down.  Dr. Crook, Col. Wilson, McKay, Donaldson& many others aboard the cars.  We had to walk a part of the way & have our baggage changed where the terrible wreck occurred.  

	I left Wiley at Newberry C.H. & he will return Friday.  I gave him three dollars to pay his passage back.

	We came very near being left this morning by the cars.  The omnibus was so long behind time.

	Jann[e]y is here & very kind.  I have seen Col. OHanlon.  He enquired about you all.  I saw Buist who enquired about Willy & says if he will read Homer he can enter Junior class very easily.  

	I have bought a Raylin $20 as good as Sudd..at $30 pants $9.00 vest $6$1.00.  So I am clad for the winter.

	I have four letters to write this evening, & therefore must bid you good night.  I saw Col. Perrin who told me he would have the Bonds here.  I paid Dickeys money $1000 to Col. Goodwyn President of the Bank. 

	Take care of yourself & the children & I will try and take care of myself.  I lost my trunk containing the ponbut found it at Hunts Hotel & all is safe.

	Let Wiley purchase some shucks for corn feed.

	Kiss Arthur for me & give my love to all the children.  Write to me in Charleston.  Mr. Arthur was aboard the cars & Jeter & his wife.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just breakfasted and will now write you a few lines.  I wrote you from Columbia.  The next I started from this place & reached here safely about two oclock.  The trip down was very pleasant although there was an immense concourse od=f persons on the cars.  Col. Wilson & Mr. Pinckney Huger & myself sat together & had a good deal of pleasant chat.  Mr. Huger told me his sister [was] in the cars when the terrible accident happened two or three days before.  But the car she was in jumped the gap in the road & she did not know that anything had happened till she heard the screams of the passengers in the cars below which were crushed to pieces.

	I found on my arrival here that the South Carolina Institute had a magnificent private parlor & bed chamber attached engaged for me next to the ladies drawing room.  Tell Anna I am in the Bridal chamber which she saw here once.  I wish you were with me.  It would be very pleasant.  I shall perhaps never be so handsomely accommodated again.  It would be pleasant for you to have a private parlor to receive your visitors.  The House is very much crowded & Governor Means seemed a little curious [at] my superior accommodations to himself.  

       In the evening after my arrival Lawton & DeSaussure & the Vice President of the Institute called on me & carried me to the Hall.  It is beautiful & the paintings & sculpture are truly magnificent.  The whole collection is wonderful, beautiful beyond description.  The Standard & the Courier both sent to me for a synopsis of my address to publish after delivery.  But I preferred the whole address being published & declined.
       
       Yesterday evening Mr. Taylor the President & Mr. Reynolds called for me to go over to deliver my address.  I met in the parlor a large number of gentlemen.  Col. Hayne & Judge King &  Mr. Thornwell amongst them.  The evening was wet & rainy, but there were one thousand persons in the Hall, who paid twenty five cents each for admission.  If the evening had been good there would have been two thousand.  Reynolds said there was a general wish & curiosity to see me & hear me speak.  I told him I supposed they had a curiosity to see the Traitor who had done so much to keep the State in the union.
       
       I was an hour & twenty minutes delivering my address & then skipped over parts of it.  The audience listened with profound attention.  My voice filled the great Hall completely and all heard me distinctly.  The gentlemen on the stage congratulated me on the address & said it was one of great ability && would do good.  I think it was well rece[ive]d, & I have been much flattered.  After the address I supped with the Institute & got home at eleven oclock.  We had a very pleasant time.  Today I dine with Mr. Lawton & sup with Mr. Yeadon at ten oclock.
       
       I have a great deal more to write, but not time to do so.  I hope you & the children are all well.  Col. Hayne enquired how his little godson comes on.  I shall go up to Columbia Sunday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just reached here safe & got my supper.

	Franks letter was handed me on my arrival.  I rece[ive]d but one letter from you in Charleston.  Your aunt McCall sent me a little box which is in my trunk & which I will send up by the first opportunity.

	I had a pleasant time in Charleston & could hardly break loose from my friends there.  Mr. Petigruvery much on my staying today & dining with him & Col. Alston & Lady.  I dined yesterday with Col. Alston & Mr. Petigru & Mrs. Alston at their private table at the Mills House.  Judge McGrath insisted on my taking supper with him yesterday.  Mr. Johnson brother of Judge Johnson also invited me to dine with himalso Mr. Yeadon. 

	My speech has attracted much attention & has drawn forth a compliment from the Mercury which I will send you.  It has been published in the Courier & Evening News.  The Institute will publish it in pamphlet form in a week or ten days.

	There was an immense concourse of persons today on the Charleston cars.  I had a pleasant seat with Col. Harleston Read, Col. Simmons the Speaker & Col. Boylston.  There were six cars full.

	I see General Thompson here on his way to New York.  I have not seen Mrs. Thompson.  He had no news from Greenville.  I see none of the Greenville delegation here.  They will come down tomorrow I suppose.

	The weather was very warm in Charleston & I could not wear my Raylin.  I had therefore to buy me a frock coat to speak in which cost me $22.  I paid noBill at the Mills House.

	Mrs. Wilson came down the day I rece[ive]d your letter but I saw nothing of her.  I was a good deal with the Colonel.

	This Hotel is very full & I have my old room.  Dr. Fair & Lady are opposite to me and he made an appeal to my gallantry as I went down two young ladies to have the room for three days at the commencement Ball.  That their coming to the Ball depended on their getting a room opposite Mrs. Fairs.  I told him if I could stay anywhere else they might occupy my room three or four days.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  I saw Mr. Robert Duncan in Charleston.   Barnwell Duncan came to see me.  I left McKay & wife & Donaldson in Charleston.  They will be up this week some time.  

	I am very much fatigued & will write you tomorrow or the next day.

	I paid Kle &65.00.  He has the finest fresh butter I ever saw & says he can supply us at thirty two cents a pound.  I think one pound of his butter will [go] further than Mrs. Brockmans & is much sweater butter.

	Good night.  I must write a line to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening written Sunday.  I was glad to hear from you.  But really your Bill astonishes me.  If the Bonnets & dresses were for summer or you and Anna were going to Columbia it would be all right.  But nobody will see either Bonnett or dress & next summer they will be thrown aside.  Willies chair was unnecessary at this time.  But you know what is done is over with me & I never receive to it like you.  I shall not have money enough to pay the Bill & pay Willies college expences.  I am now sorry I did not bring my money with me.  You can borrow a check from Mr. Cox for $130.00 and I will pay interest till I return.  But perhaps the better plan is for me to send you the keys & let you get $130 out of the Beaureau.  I will send the keys by Mr. Wells or would ina check payable to your aunt give her name to Cox & send him the money.  It will cost fifty cents.

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot & have not time to write you anymore.  The correspondent of the Carolinian speaks in high terms of my speech.  All who have read it speak in high terms of it.

	I am glad Willie got back safe & that you are all well.

	I dont know what to say about Franks coming down.  If he comes he must come in his present clothesdont purchase any for him.  We have spent money enough for the present.  I think he had better stay & come down towards the close of the session.  But if he wishes let him come & stay till after commencement.

I called at the bar & was told they had rece[ive]d the letters & there were none for me.  I went to the Post office & got no letters.  On my return to the Hotel your letter was handed me.  It had been put in a wrong box.

	I have just been to see Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham at Hunts Hotel.  Mrs. Cunningham had gone to see Howp Gardens & I did not see her.  I saw Mr. Cunningham.  Pamela is in Charleston.  Mr. Cunningham is going to move there entirely & isa a candidate for Bank director.

	I was invited to dine with Governor Adams today, but declined his invitation as Col. Orr was going to dine with us.  You need not give yourself any fears about Franks getting into the money.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this morning, & I hope he will remain in the College a year longer at least.  I spoke to him about Williealso spoke to Professor LeConte.

	There was nothing done in the legislature today.  I must conclude & get a cup of tea & go to College.  Alex McBee & his Bride are here.  I saw Alexander but have not seen his wife.  I congratulated him & he blushed & appeared ashamed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I received your letter this evening & am happy to hear you are progressing so rapidly in your studies & lessons.  If you wish to, you can come down Thursday.  You can get ready, I suppose, in a few minutes.  Willie can also come down with you if he desires to do so.

	Tell your mother I have nothing of interest to write her.  We had a little speaking in the Legislature & I took a part today.  I sent up the box & keys by Mr. Wells.

	Tell Anna that Mr. Evans who gave her the thimble is married.  He enquired very kindly about herso did Col. Beadon.

	It is very warm tonight & I am sitting with my windows up & door open in a perfect perspiration.  

	Tell your mother that Mrs. Brooks Governor Adams daughter Had a fine son last night to greet its grandfather in going out of office.  Col. Pickens has declined running for governor & Col. [Robert Francis Withers] Allston will not be elected.

	Why does not Anna, & Willie & Fanny write me.  I saw a student of the College tonight a protg of Yeadons, who says if Willie applies for Junior they will not examine him on Homer but the memorabilia of Xenephon.

	Tell Hext & Hayne that I think often of them & long to see them all.

	Col. Moses has invited me & some other gentlemen to go down to Sumter with him Saturday evening.

	Last night after writing to you I called over to see Col. Dawkins as I went to the College & saw Mrs. Cunningham.  She is altered very little & seemed as cordial as ever.  She enquired most affectionately after you & the children.  She asked how you looked & I replied as young as you did when we were first marriedlooked about seventeen.  I saw Mrs. Dawkins also.

	Col. Moses has invited four or five of us to go down to Sumter & spend Sunday.  I have promised to gomay be gone before Willie reaches here Saturday evening.  If so he can take charge of my room till my return Sunday evening or Monday morning.  In haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

There will no doubt be a large audience to hear me.  The ladies are all here & will go.

	Willie is at the College undergoing his examination.  I have not seen him since breakfast.  It is now dark.  There are forty applicants.

	Write the day & year Frank was born, & I will send it on to Col. Orr.

	I have just heard as a great secret that Col. Pickens is to go into the Buchanan Cabinet.  I am delighted at this, as he is my friend in policies & feeling.  I saw him yesterday.  I am invited to President McCays tomorrow evening and to dine with Senator [Moses Cohen] Mordecai on Saturday.  The Jews seem to have taken a fancy to me.

	Col. Fairs little daughter is here & he enquired after Anna.  Governor Adams proposed the other night that we should send our daughter to Charleston next winter to the same school.  He is cordial & you do him great injustice.

	Col. Isaac Hayne walked home with me today & invited me to take a glass of brandy in his room.  He was more sociable & friendly.

       I shall not have time to write to the Patriot tonight I am afraid.
       
       I have just seen Willie.  He has been examined in fact & his examination will close tomorrow.  He thinks it doubtful whether he can enter the Junior class.
       
       The Bonds your mother will get will have interest from July.  Col. Perrin said nothing about the prior interest & I did not see proper to mention it.
       
       I must now close.  I hope you are all well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	The nine oclock Bell is just ringing & I have not had a moments leisure all day.

	Your letter has just been read.  Willie has been admitted into the Junior class alone.  There were fifty admitted into the Freshman & Sophomore.  Professor LeConte says he did well in his department.  Professor LaBorde admitted him in his department without an examination.  Dr. Lieber says he passed well.  Rivers says he did tolerably well in Greek.  I have not seen Preisdent McCay.  He called to see me this morning before he examined Will.  Willie is much pleased with his success.

	I did pretty well in my speech today on the Judiciary& there was a con[siderable] audience present.  

	Miss Brenan gives a concert tonight, but I have not time to go or to go to Mrs. McCays party.

	Enclosed I send you my letter to the Patriot as you desired.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I wish you would answer all of my letters & say I am absent in Columbia & will write when I returnespecially the letters from Col. Dunkins sisters agent.

	I enclose you a long letter which you must accept as one to yourself as you did not write me today.  Annas letter to Willie was rece[ive]d.  Willie will return Friday or Saturday.  He passed his examination very well & is pleased at his admission.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees& it is now near eleven oclock.  I have never been so busy before of a session, because I have been more in company & dining out.  I have really enjoyed myself very much.  But I am very anxious to see you & the children.  But for my engagement to dine out on Saturday, I would go home & return Monday.

	Tell Anna I bought her knife today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & Willie will go up in the morning.

	The Rail Road Bonds draw interest from 1st July last.  I have the two Col. Perrin sold me in my trunk.  Captain John Westfield has just offered me two at 80cts in the dollar, $850 for two Bonds worth $1000 & $35 Interest due 1st Jan[uar]y.  He is to wait with me till 25th December for the money.  I have agreed to take them & he is to give them to me in the morning.  He is on his way to the north& says by making sale of them to me he can raise funds of Cox to go on.  Tell your mother to write me immediately to have the money ready.  She can take the Bonds at what I give.

	I have just given Willie $25.00 to go & buy the furniture for his room of a student who is leaving & sells cheap.

	Willie will tell you all the news.  I will write to Col. Orr tonight about Frank.  It will be pleasant to have Frank provided for for life.  Willie can make his way at the Bar.  Hext will go into the army.  I am congratulated by all the Professors in having a son in college.  I think they will respect Willie on my account & that he will do well.

	I am very anxious to return home & would do so with Willie if I had not agreed to dine with Mordecai.  I know he has made large preparations & it would disappoint him.  I may go up tomorrow week.  

	I have rece[ive]d a free ticket on the Charlotte Rail Road & now they charge me nothing on the Charleston Road so I can go where I please on the rail road without cost.

	Nothing of great interest occur[r]ed today in the Legislature.  I spoke a short time on the amendment of the Constitution. 
	
	I thank you for your favorable opinion of our childrens exhibiting my talents.  You ought to tell them that they inherit talents from both of us.  It is well for a great man to have a great wife as much so as it is for a great woman to have a great husband.  The children partake of the talents of both.  

	Mr. Pinckney has left a package for Susan which I will send by Willie.

	I must now close my letter & bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & a cold rain day & I will spend it in writing instead of going to church.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from Fannie & one from Anna to Willie.  I am glad Willies admission into college gave you all such pleasure.  It is a high honor to enter junior class.  I hope Willie arrived safely at home last night & told you all about Columbia.  All who saw him were pleased with his appearance.  Burt regretted very much not seeing him.  Yeadon did not make his acquaintance which he regretted.

	I have not seen Col. OHanlon but twice.  Yeadon enquired how old our youngest child was & on being told six months, he said he was afraid that it would be a long time before his namesake would make his appearance.  

	I have written to Col. Orr about Frank & told him you had your heart very much set on the appointment.

	Tell Fannie I thank her for her letter & she must write me another.  Tell Frank if I come home next Saturday he may go down with me on Monday.  I am anxious to see you all & Sunday is a miserable to spend in Columbia.  I shall get back on Monday to sit in the evening.  There is nothing, however, before the Legislature in which I take much interest.  It will cost me nothing to go & come back, & it will be delightful to see you & the children once more.  It seems almost an age since I left home.  So many things have taken place.

	I gave my note to Westfield for $850 for the two $500 Bonds.  I am to pay the 25th of December.  I shall write Elford to make payment by that to me.  Westfield has other bonds to sell but he asks &12.50cts more for each one of the others which is what I gave Co. Perrin.

	Tell Anna to write me.  [Peter] Stokes says that his little daughter writes him almost every day.  Tell Hext I will get him some presents & Hayne also.  I almost forget how Arthur looks. 
	I saw Paul Hayne yesterday evening.  He is lecturing here, & says he is coming to Greenville.  He looks the same & enquired about you all.

	Tom Jones came down the other day & said he wanted Frank to come with him.  I see Pools son here.  It seems that almost one half of Greenville has been here.

	Col. Al[l]stons wife & daughter came up yesterday he says to console him in case of his defeat for governor.  But I suppose to enjoy the pleasures of his election.  She is a very pleasant lady & smart.  Most of the ladies have gone & amongst them Mrs. LeConte who was a great Belle & dresses most magnificently.  She seems [word obscured] ambitious of the notice of gentlemen as if she was a single lady wishing to make conquests.  I admire her husband a great deal more than I do her.

	I was invited the other evening to a large party at Captain Adam but did not go.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Theodore Croft wishing the appointment of aid to the Governor for Edward.  He writes most urgently.

	I have seen nothing of Alex Taylor or his family.  General Martin I see every day.

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot.  Must stop to have my room cleaned up.

	The members all seem astonished that I can find time to write my wife every day.  If they loved theirs as I do mine they too would find time.  But I do not tell them so.  Indeed I think most of them care very little about their wives when absent.  We are a model couple.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.  Several letters came to me tonight &  one to Willie from Willie Beattie which I enclose.

My dear Liz

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot in lieu of one to yourself.

	I have nothing of interest.  We had considerable debate today on the slave trade & I took a part in it.

	You will see that Al]l]ston is elected Governor.  I went up to Mrs. Al[l]ston at the supper table & congratulated her on the election.  She seems very meek & modest about it.  Mr. Petigru was sitting by her side & he is much pleased.

	Dr. T. Croft is here & wishes an aidfor Edward Croft Theodores son.

	You must not trouble yourself about Willies room [word obscured] will do very well.  I will see about a set of drawers for him.

	I am glad you are having the hogs killed.  It is now turning warm again.

	I had a very pleasant evening with Burt yesterday.  He enquired very kindly about you & the children & says he is coming to Greenville next summer.

	Col. Dudl[e]y told me a great deal about Miss Sparks.  His daughter is just married & will be here this week.

	If you desire to you can come down with me next Monday as I expect to go home Saturday if the weather is good.  It would give me great pleasure to have you here but the company of ladies is very much broke off.  There are however some still here & others coming.  Mrs. Sullivan came yesterdayMrs. Allston the day before.  Col. Carn says Mrs. Allston elected the Col. on the first ballot.  If she had not been here there would have been another ballot, that she got him more than seven votes.

	I am glad to hear Arthur has another tooth.  How I should like to see the little fellows tooth & kiss him.

	I must now quit & go to bed as I slept very little last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & thank you for it.  I was sorry your mother did not write me also.

	Tell Willie I bought him, today, & paid for it $14 a nice Mahogany set of drawers with a glass on top.  Bowers from whom I made the purchase is to send it down to College for him when he comes down.

	I have seen a good many persons here who enquired after you.  Mr. Evans did bring his bride with him.  Mr. Sparks & his bride were to have been here tonight.

	Jane Adams is not with her Father in Columbia nor none of his family.  He quits Columbia tomorrow & says he is most happy so to do.  Governor Allston is just as happy to begin his administration as Governor Adams is to end his.  I am invited to a champaign party tomorrow after the Inauguration to meet Mrs. Allston & was requested to bring with me any ladies I might have under my charge.  I wish your mother & you were here for the inauguration.  

	The ladies seem to gather about the state House more now than they did last week.

	Waddy Williams has just come into my room to borrow $20 to pay his expences & get home.  He says he does not suit the man in whose employment he is staying, & I expect he tells the truth.  I told him I would let him have enough money to pay his expences home in the morning.

	I am writing in great haste & must conclude.  Tell Fannie I will write her a letter tomorrow & tell her all about the Inauguration of the Governor.

	Give my love to your mother & tell her Mr. Yeadon has written to his wife what she wrote me.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I promised to write you this evening but really I have not time.  Enclosed I send you a letter to the Patriot which will give you an account of the Governors Inauguration.  There were a great many young ladies present & some very pretty ones.  The Governors daughter is quite pretty & about as old as Anna.

	Tell your mother that I rece[ive]d her letter this morning, but as I expect to be at home Saturday night I will reserve what I have to write her till I return.  I look forward with great pleasure to seeing you all again.  It seems to have been an age since I left home.  I will stay with you Sunday & go to church & return Monday.  The Legislature sits now at night so I will get back to sit Monday.  Saturday nothing is done.

	I am glad to hear you & Hext are going to school & doing well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip with Mary Cleveland into the country.

	Next May I will carry all of you to Columbia as we can go down for nothing & return for nothing to attend the Rail Road convention.  That will be pleasant to take you & Anna & your mother & Hext & Hayne & Frank & stay two or three days. 

	I saw Paul Hayne this evening.  He says he will be in Greenville in January.  He enquired particularly after Anna.

	Mr. Elford writes he will be here tomorrow.  Your affectionate Father, give my love to your mother, & Anna & the children.  How happy I shall be to see them all Saturday night & I will bring you oranges & candy & a silver knife.  B.F. Perry

	I went to see Willies room today & ordered it to be cleaned & the furniture moved into it.  I also looked at the furniture he bought & think he paid enough for it.  Mrs. Simons & the Speaker [James Simons] went down to the College yesterday to see their sons room opposite & are fitting it up very handsomely.  I saw President McCay & he went with me to the room & carried me over [to] his House.  I called at Mrs. Greenes & paid the fifty dollars towards Willies board. 

	I have no time to commit on your estimate of moneys to be received in January.  We shall adjourn Saturday & I will reach home Sunday night.

	The Bundle of& the shoes for Anna have been sent me by Mrs. Taylor.  I have them in my trunk.

My dear Sir

	The Bond old old Major McKinney to make Titles to his sons Preston, Wilson & Jesse gave them no interest in the land which could be levied on & sold by the Sheriff.  It only conveyed to the purchaser the interest which the Son had in the land as an heir to the old Major.  

	The Bond of the Sons to their Father is only to let the old man & woman have the use of the House during their lives & pay them the interest annually on nine hundred dollars.  This is all that would be recovered   if suit were brought & the sons were able to pay it.  Each one of the sons is only liable for his three hundred dollars.

	I think the better course to pursue is to file a Bill in Equity for a partition & sale of the Land, as the Real Estate of the old major McKinney & divide out the proceeds amongst his heirs.  The old Lady would be intitled to one third which would support her.  The children to an equal share, each, of the other two thirds, or if any of the children have sold their interest or it has been sold by the sheriff the purchaser of such interest would take the childs part thus sold.  

	But before a decision & payment is made each child would have to account for advancements received from the old major during his life time so as to make them all equal.

	If the personal estate has not been settled in the ordinarys office, Mr. Robinson should have a final settlement then & a decree by the ordinary as to the amount each one has received & what is still due each child.  All advancements in the life time of Major McKinney to each child to be accounted for in this settlement.  The Bonds should be treated as aas they have never been complied with & now cannot be on the part of the sons.  For I presume they are all insolvent.

	If Mr. Robinson is disposed to pursue this course & will furnish me with the names of the children or heirs of old Major McKinney & the name of his widow I will file the Bill for him.  If any of them live out of the state the Bill must be filed three months before Equity court.  He had better therefore act at once.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I have written you two letters & desired information from you on both of them.  Your neglect in answering my letters is not only wrong, but wanting in this respect you owe your Father.  I hope you will not do so again.  Your letters to your mother, Frank & Anna is not a sufficient excuse for you.  They contain very little information as to the College, Professors, your studies & associates.

       I am very much pained to hear of the distrust once in College.  All who are concerned in these riots & disorderly conduct ought to be expelled at once.  They should be cut of from the College in order to prevent their cr[u]el example from influencing others.

	Honor & duty, the highest sense of honor, should make every student conform to all the rules & regulation of the College when he enters it.  He who violates them willfully does not possess an honorable heart.

	I charge you as my son & as you regard my love & your own honor & happiness & prosperity & success in life to keep aloof from all such conduct & from all who are guilty of such conduct.  Do not go out of your room at night.  Pursue your studies diligently.  Be obedient to the Professors, kind & civil to all of your fellow students and strictly keep & obey all the College laws.

	I gave you a letter to President McCay.  Did you deliver the letter?  Has he said anything to you in reference to it?  How often have you been examined by the Professors.  How did you stand your examination?  How do you like the College & Professors & Students?  Who are your most interesting associates?  Do you keep a regular account of all your expences?  When you are in want of money, let me know & what you want it for.  But do not go in debt for a single day.  This has ruined many a young man in college.	

	You ought to have written who were suspended.  Their names will be reported to me as one of the Board of Trustees in May next.  It cannot therefore be kept a secret from me.  

	Let me know how Buist, Hayne, Wardlaw, Cain, & Memminger are doing.  I hope none of them are engaged in the disturbances of the College, for I know them & their Parents & feel an interest in them, & also in Simons & Pinckney.

	I am glad to hear you have a good roommate & I shall always feel an interest in him on your account.  I think you did well to get off the first story wherefrequent & Thiery break through & steal.

	The College here is doing well.  The have one hundred & fifty students and a prospect of three hundred.  The Female college has seventy five.  Anna & Fannie & Frank & Hext are doing well and studying hard.

	I am sorry to say your mother has been unwell.  She had a high fever Saturday night Sunday & Sunday night.  Was confined to her bed till Monday morning.  She then came down stairs & lay on the sofa.  This morning she is better & no return of fever.  I hope it has passed over but I was yesterday very much afraid she would have a severe spell of typhoid fever which I dread as much as the smallpox.  It has been so fatal to the families of both of my brothers.

	Your letter last Monday has already been answered by Frank or your mother.  I have nothing in the way of news to communicate.

	Poinsett Wells tells me he sees you very often.  I hope you do not neglect your studies, or frequent the Public Houses.  Keep away from them as idle places.

	I am truly sorry to learn that the students are misbehaving in any way.  They ought to consider it a point of honor to conform to all the rules & regulations of the College.  Be careful never to violate any College rule, & I warn you to keep aloof from all idle & bad associates.  As sure as you come in contact with them you are corrupted.  

	Your ought to read History when you have leisure from your regular studies.  Now is the time to improve yourself & acquire information.

You speak of wishing to return to Greenville in April.  The expence is considerable & the time you will loose important.  Are the Professors willing to grant leave of absence to you?  For you must not think of coming without their permission granted.

	When I was of your age, how much would I have given to have had your present opportunities of acquiring information.  I remember at Asheville when I was sixteen years old. I studied twelve or fifteen hours every day.

	I desire you to take exercise, but always be in your room at night.  Never leave it after dark.  The mantle of the night is the defence of the wicked for then they escape detection.

	We are all well.  Your Robert Foster died the other day, a drunkards death.  How mortifying to his old Father!

	You must write me often.  I liked your letter on Monday very much.  It was sensible &, Yours &c., B.F. Perry

	Your letter was rece[ive]d Saturday evening & enclosed I send you twenty dollars more which you must take care to keep & spend judiciously.  Your expences in college are amounting to a good deal more than I expected.  

	In return for these expences I hope you will endeavour to improve your time & opportunities to the very best advantage.  Strive by hard study and good conduct to reward your Parents for all their care, troubles & expence in your education.

	Guard against the first step in vice & immorality.  The second step is easier than the first & so on to ruin.  The same too in regard to your studies.  I hope you will distinguish yourself in your class.  You must have studied a good deal in the course you are now going over.  This ought to make it easy for you to keep ahead of your fellows.

	Sam McClanahan is the person who told me that he saw you in Columbia.  The name of the young lady is Mary McLain of Spartanburgh.  The suit was brought by me against John Baldwin of this district.  

	Why is it that I have rece[ive]d no report from the Faculty as to your progress in college.  More than there months have elapsed since you entered college?  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. You say you have a bad cold.  Be careful to wear your winter clothing throughout the spring.  There is more danger from colds, at this season of the year than any other, & more danger of catching them.  Never change your dress too soon in the spring.  Remember this through life.

There has been a great crowd of ladies here, but they have all gone.

	President McCay and his wife came to see us yesterday & invited us to take tea with them tomorrow evening.  Your mother however declines going.  Susan Hayne came to see your mother & took her to Col. Taylors.  Mrs. Taylor is in delicate healthdines with them Friday.

	Willie is looking very well & stands thirteen in a class of sixty five.  Considering he is the youngest boy in his class I think he has done well.  But he is not on& does nothimself in studying.

	Anna Ware & two of her companionshere Friday.  Col. Ware was here.  Anna looks well & seems pleased with her school.  

	I am sorry to hear of the decision in your May day celebration.  You ought to have written to us.  I hope your oranges were rece[ive]d in time for supper.  Your mother will return home Wednesday evening & you must direct Wiley to be there with the Barouche to take her from the depot. I shall have to remain a day or two longer.

	The Society all seemed kind & enquired kindly about you.  Frank & Fannie & Hext & all enjoying themselves very much.  Arthur does well & has given very little trouble.

	Col. OHanlon came to see us & invited Hext to go & stay with him.  He seems as kind as ever. 

	We had greeted a number of girls here from Greenville, Abbeville & Newberry.  Col. Fairs daughter is about as tall as her mother.

	Willie says he saw Augustus Townes Bride as she passed this wayand was pleased with her.  

	Tell your aunt Susan that your mother rece[ive]d her letter & thanks her kindly for it.

	I feel very lonesome since you & the children have left me.  I met Miss Mary Jones after dinner & said I was lonely & she said I looked so.

	After you started I walked up with Willie to the Court House.  He went on to the College to study his lessons.  Whilst at the Court House I met General Thompson & Col. Preston.  Thompson looks pale but otherwise very well.  He says Mrs. Thompson is quite well, & he speaks in high terms of her surgeon Dr. Sims who went from the upper part of South Carolina & then was a man of no reputation.  He now makes by his profession $40,000 annually!  General Thompson & family will go up with me Saturday.

	When I returned from Court I wrote a letter to the Patriot.  Then I walked in the piazza & Dr. LeConte came & invited me into his parlor where Mrs. LeConte was.  She invited me to join her party & take a seat at her table.  I did so.  Col. Johnson was with me & we spent a pleasant time at the table.  Mrs. LeConte says there was an awful destruction of hoops & dresses last night at the May day celebration.  She said the hoops were pressed out of all shape & the strawberries & ice creams were handed over the heads of the ladies.  Every now & then she could hear the expression from some lady Oh me look how they have ruined my dress.   The Professor says two nights in succession have used him up.

	I met Governor Allston who carried me into his Parlor & regretted not seeing you.  He said two Miss Harlans   came up with him & enquired who they were.  He said they were in company with a fine looking woman who was a suspicious character & the conductor refused to tell him her name.  They must have been on board the cars with you.

	Professor Barnwell & his sister Miss E. Barnwell called to see you about one oclock & expressed great regret at your absence.  They left their cards, but I did not see them.

	Col. Preston expressed his regret at not knowing you were here.  General Thompson regretted that you were gone.  

	The Board of Trustees meet in the Court House instead of the College Library tonight for the accommodation of Judge ONeall & Judge Glover who are in bad health.  I am glad of it, as it will save me a long walk in the night.

	President McCay called to see me this morning & sat with me an hour talking about the college.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening & hear that you reached home safely & found all well Minerva better.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College Exhibition & it is now half past ten oclock (you like to know the hour & time I am writing to you).  I have lighted a segar & will write you a few lines whilst I smoke it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear that you arrived safely at home.  I was anxious about you.  I am glad to hear that you found all well except Minerva & Marys baby & that they are better.  I hope poor Minerva may be restored to her mind.  It is a sad thing to be without reason.    I hope too Marys baby is better.  Nurse it & take care of it & let Minerva have every attention that she may require.  My feelings are alwayson the side of pitty & suffering.  If I were endowed with omnipotent power, I would make every human being happy in this life & relieve anywant of mankind.

	The speaking in College was tolerable.  Willie came to see me this morning & introduced his chum [Fredertick Gustavus] Behre to me.  I invited them to take tea with me tomorrow evening.  Behre is genteel modest looking young man.  He blushes like a woman.  I saw his face suff with blushes as he came up to be introduced.  I told him you were anxious to see him & he blushed again.  I have taken a fancy to him.

	Mr. Barnwell came up to me on the rostrum this evening & expressed his regret at not seeing you.

	I delivered your compliments to Mrs. LeConte at the supper table & she said she was charmed with you.  She said she had seldom seen a lady in whom she felt so much interest.  I told her that you reciprocated her feelings.  She had spoken to me in the morning about sending you the patterns.

	I have been engaged all day in College business.  I was appointed Chairman of a committee by the Governor at our meeting last night for this purpose with Senator DeSaussure & Col. Townsend which I regard as a compliment.

	When I went to the chapel this evening amidst a crowded house President McCay rose & came forward to greet me.  He seemed extremely kind & obliging.  I could not see Willie, but I suppose he saw me.  As we returned from the College there was a bonfire on the campus said to be the chairs & tables taken out of the room of Professor Pelham.  He was standing by me when someone told him what it was!  He said nothing.

	Goodlett & Donaldson came down this evening & told me about the Kansas meeting.  Col. Johnson of Charlotte walked with me to the College this evening & insists very much on my going to the Mecklinburgh celebration on the 20th.  It is to be a great occasion.  I am half inclined to go if I can spare the time.  I shall see Governor Swain, & all the great men of North Carolina & can reach there in one day from Greenville.

	The clock has now struck eleven & my segar is most outmy paper most filled & I must bid you good night.  I wish you & Arthur were here again.  Willie sends his love to you all.  Give my love to all the children & believe me your most affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Send my letter to the Patriot which is enclosed to you.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night which has helped me much to hear of the difficulties in college again.  
I shall come down to the meeting of the Board [page torn of Trustees].

	I am terribly sorry that you went with your class in refusing to recite to President McCay.  College Boys have no right to take [text obscured by torn page] but they must obey the college laws whilst there.  They are {page torn] the authority of the Trustees & the College will never do any good whilst such conduct is tolerated by the Faculty.

Dear Mamma

	Papa told me to write to you tonight, as he is too busy, being obliged to meet the trustees tonight at half past 7.  I am in a hurry myself, so will make this letter very short. It is not necessary to write a long one, inasmuch as Pa and myself will both be at home Friday evening, that is day after tomorrow evening.

	Papa is going to take me to Harvard University when he goes on with Anna & Frank this summer.  You may accordingly expect us Friday evening, so send Wiley with the carriage, to the depot for us.
The trustees met this morning and heard the statement of McCay, and the rest of the Faculty, from them Pa says he does not think that McCay has lied.  Some of the Trustees, and Pa amongst the number, are in favor of disbanding the College, electing new Professors &c.

	I havent time to write more as I want to carry this letter up street tonight and mail it.

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to write you a line before breakfast.  Last night I was at the College till midnight.  We had a very full Board of Trustees & they are unanimous in the belief that President McCay has been slandered & wronged.  There is a decided disposition to make all the Professors resign.  Nothing yet has been done although we had two meetings yesterday.

	Willie will return with me.  I am done with sending my sons to this College.  The Students will all be dismissed this evening I expect by the Board of Trustees.  I shall send Willie to Harvard college.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning.  I enquired at the Post office & was told nothing for me.

	Old Mr. & Mrs. Pinckney are here & enquired about you & their daughter M.  Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly about you & expressed great admiration for you.  She repeated that of all the ladies she had met in Columbia you were her favorite.  She is very much excited about the College difficulties & takes a warm part for McCay.  She gave me a talk of two hours the night I arrived here in explanation & vindication of McCay.  I never saw a lady more excited.  She says that when she is a friend is in distress she then shares her friends strife.

	Mr. Arthur went to Abbeville with me.  My case was not reached.  I shall not go back to Abbeville if I can avoid it.  The Hotel is shocking.  I have never seen hotter weather.

	I have a great deal to write you but really not time to say more at present.  I told Willie to write you last evening.  I reached here Tuesday evening.

	Have the Barouche for me & Willie At the depot Friday evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Dear Sir

	Your letter was received last night dated June 4th, and I can assure you has given me great concern & anxiety.

	You say that my remarks, in a letter from Columbia about a Bride have been republished in the Georgia newspapers and applied to your wife.  They are without name, place or date of occurrence, and it was not supposed they could identify or illustrate any one.  Much less were they intended to implicate the virtue or honor of a Bride.  Such was not the belief of my informant.

Flirtations are very common in fashionable lifer, & some times very provoking to husbands, but they do not necessarily imply guilt of a damning nature to a Ladys, nor is such implication due the term flirtation.

	I can assure you both my informants & myself did feel a deep sympathy & interest in the history of a Bride, and if I had supposed that my remarks would ever have been seen by her or by any of her acquaintances and by them recognized they never would have been published.

	I am ready to make the explanation of facts, as you desire, but really, it seems to me, that this would only attract public attention & cause enquiries to be made as to the person alluded to, which otherwise would not be.  If I could recall the indiscretion of my remarks, which we really made in deep interest & concern for a Bride, most gladly would I do so.  If there was any way, by which I could make correction, without giving renewed injury, it would afford me pleasure to do so.

	We all arrived here yesterday evening & found Willie & Col. Memminger quite well.  They went out to Harvard College this morning & commenced their studies.  Willie caught a cold last night by going to the Theatre.

	I went to the Post office last evening soon after I reached here to get a letter from you, but found none.  We will return to New York in a day or two & write you to meet us in Baltimore as we may not be able to get down to Annapolis.  You can come up to Baltimore & stay all night with us & go back the next day as we go on to Washington.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies & making yourself a good boy at Mr. Greens.  You must behave yourself well, study hard & be obedient to Mrs. Green.  Keep out of all bad company.  We shall be glad to see you in Baltimore if you do not go to Annapolis.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  Give [page torn] our love to Mrs. Green & tell her to make you recite your lessons every day to someone.  If she can employ someone to instruct you & hear your lessons I would be glad.

I hope he is well by this time & that you are all getting on well.  

	I have just seen Mrs. LeConte & she says she said a good word to Professor Pirce for you & has since written him to pay attention to you as the son of her intimate friend.  She says Pirce showed her my letter to him about you, when she was in Cambridge.  I wish you to go & see Professor Pirce &T make yourself known to him.  He will be kind to you, & it will be to your advantage in entering Harvard.

	We were all very much disappointed in Burlington & Bishop Davis school.  Your mother was so much shocked at the idea of Annas staying in a room with fourteen other girls that she determined to take her back to Greenville & leave her at some other school.  Today, after seeing Mrs. LeConte she is better reconciled, & I expect Anna will stay there.  Doctor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte will go there with us tomorrow & determine about the matter.  They wish their daughter to go to school there.  We saw their daughter this morning & were pleased with her.

	Anna received several letters from home at Burlington, one from Fannie, Annie, Mary Mauldin, , Tinny Carson & others.  They seem all well.  

	I have heard nothing of Frank yet.  We go to Baltimore Monday & on to Annapolis.  We bought carpeting today $450.00 worth.

	You must write me & direct your letters to Greenville.  Be sure & enter Harvard College.  Study hard whilst in College & before you enter.  Keep out of all bad company & be correct in all things.  Above all things be honorable, & scorn everything mean & less honorable.

	I write you n great haste.  Give my love to Col. Memminger & his son.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We arrived at home Saturday evening & were glad to receive your letter.  But out return was otherwise a bad one.  We found your aunt Susans Sdead.  She died about the time we reached the depot of scarlet fever.  Last Sunday she was in church & this Sunday she was covered there a corpse.  

	We found Arthur too quite unwell with the prevailing pandemic, but is getting better.   His mother is nursing him again.  He knew us both & seems fond of us.  I hope he will soon be well.  But I am afraid of the scarlet fever spreading in our families.

	We are thankful to be at home once more.  Hext & Hayne are quite well & so is Fannie.  Vardry came up today to see Susan buried.  He looks fat & heavy.  We are qute lonelyyou & Willie & Anna.

	I was glad tohad soloved inagain, & your watchYou will now study hard & be a good boy.  Tell Mr. Miller I am very thankful to him for his kindness to you.

	Your mother says you are the best of all the children in writing to us.  We have heard nothing from Anna or Willie since we left them.  Your acquaintances & friends all enquire about you.  In Columbia we met Frank Cox & Tench Cox.  As we came up the Greenville Rail Road, the freight train had run over a cow which delayed us an hour.  Last Saturday the passenger train ran over a cow just at the depot & turned over the whole train.  The passengers were buried considerably, but no lives were lost.

	Your mother is now writing to Willie.  She wrote to Anna today through Fannie.  You must write to us every day or two & tell us about your studies &

Dear Anna,

	I received your letter yesterday evening.  I had been expecting a letter from you, and was glad to hear from you at last.  But I was sorry to see from the beginning of your letter that you have not yet become reconciled to Burlington.  Of course Home is the dearest place in the world, but still we must make up our minds to be away from home some times during our lives.

	You must know from experience that the first two or three weeks that we are away from home go harder than any other.  So if you can bear the first week or two you will get through the rest very well.

	I got through my examination last Saturday, and am glad to say that I was admitted into the Junior Class, which was more than I expected.  The examination [is] a very tough one indeed, and I consider myself fortunate in having passed it as well as I did.  	

	When I last saw you in Boston I was pretty sure I wouldnt be able to pass any examination.  I feel a great deal better now, after having got through with it.  The two Memmingers also passed.  We have changed our rooms, and have got better ones than those you saw us in.  But have had to buy our own furniture, which costs a good deal.

	We havent good under weigh yet, but will in a few days; then we will have to study pretty hard.

	I have only received four letters since I have been here; one from Frank, two from Pa, and one from you.  I havent received any from Greenville, so dont know how things are going on there.  One of Pas letters was written from Burlington, the other from Annapolis.  I suppose Pa & Ma are at home by this time, and that Hayne is well.  

	I am glad to hear that you like some of the girls and hope you will like them all.  You must be rather crowded having so many girls in one room.

	My first vacation will begin the first part of January & end the last part of February.  Pa said that I might go home then and I expect I will do so; if I do I will go by Burlington to see you, certain.

	You made a mistake in your letter in saying that I must have received letters [of] certain young ladies.  You meant that you had heard from them.  I wish I could say I had heard from them too.  You must give my love to them when you write.  My paper is giving out, so I will close.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

Dear Mamma

	I received the letter partly from you, and partly from Pa, yesterday.  Today is Tuesday, and I write now to make up for not writing last Saturday.

       I was very much shocked to hear of poor little Susys death, but hope Aunt Susy will be able to bear it.
       
       You must be glad to be safe at home again, after all the fatigues and annoyances of travelling.  I would like to be with you, though I like this place and College, a great deal better than I expected.  I have got regularly under way now, and have to study pretty hard for we are called up to recite very often, nearly every recitation.  In Columbia we wouldnt be called on for weeks at a time.
       
       In my last letter I told you that we were going to change our rooms.  We are now in our new rooms, which Col. Memminger chose.  We have a room a piece.  Col. Memminger also chose the furniture for them which cost about a hundred dollars a piece.  We had to furnish them ourselves as we did in Columbia.  Our boarding is $4.50 cts a week.
       
       I got a letter from Frank, the other day, and one from Anna.  Frank seems satisfied, and I hope Anna is also by this time.  I hope Arthur is well. And that everything is going on well.  If Sue Hoke comes to Boston, I will call to see her.
       
       The way Col. Memminger does about his sons clothing is this.  He knows a tailor here, and he makes him send his accounts for his sons clothes directly to him.  The tailor offers to do the same thing for me, that is send the bill for any clothes to Pa, and let him pay for them.  I would like to know if Pa is willing to the arrangement which Col. Memminger thinks is best.
       
       I am writing in a great hurry as it is between recitations, so I will have to close.  I heard from Bill Beattie.  You must write often for you dont know how much good it does me to get a letter from home, when it is so far off.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Anny & Aunt Susy and all the children, and to Pa.

Dear Papa
	I received your letter yesterday and will now write you a few lines to let you know how I am getting on.  I have written two letters home, and one to Anna and one to Frank since Ive been here.  I will try to write every Saturday.

	Today is Sunday and I will have to go to the Chapel to church directly.  It is worse than in Columbia, for here we have to go to Chapel twice a day, morning and evening.  In Columbia we only had to go once a day.

        The preacher in the Chapel belongs to the Unitarian denomination.  I am glad to hear that you are going to send me some books, but am sorry they are all text-books, for the majority of them will be of no use to me.  I would like to have had some miscel[l]aneous books such as Historys &c., along with them.  But I am glad of any sort.  I suppose you have settled something about the So. Ca. College by this time; what it is I will hear by the Patriot.
       
       I have received three Patriots since Ive been here.  They all came at once.
       
       I am sorry to hear that you have been unwell, but I hope that you and Arthur are both well by this time.  I was rather unwell myself the othe day but I am perfectly well now.
       
       We changed our boarding because the place we were at when you left, was so bad the rooms, fare, and everything.  The place we are now at is a great deal more convenient to the College.  We have only to cross the street to be in the College yard.  Do you recollect a new building they were erecting in the College yard!  Where [we] are now is nearly opposite, and is[on] the main street that you came into Cambridge.  There are twelve rooms in the house, and all [are] occupied by students.  Mr. Perdicaris son is in the same house with us.  I like him very much.  He has gone home at present on account of ill health.  Each of our rooms has a dormitory attached for our beds, and is lighted with gas.  My room joins the oldest Memminger.  The youngest rooms a story above us.  We eat at a house called the Brattle House which is kept especially for students, and is just like a fine Hotel.  Some who eat there pay for whatever they call for at each meal.  But I think it cheaper to board by the week as we do. [William Hayne Perry]

	You must write me all about your examination & the students & Professors.

	You may tell Mrs. Blake that I know her sister Mrs. Pendergrast.  I travelled with her from Portsmouth to Washington in the spring of 1853 with General Thompson.

	I have just written a letter to Willie.  He has written but one letter to us since he has been at Harvard.  I told him to write to you & Anna.  

	You must give my thanks to Mr. Miller for his attentions to you & to Mrs. Green.  

	We are all well except Arthur.   He is getting better I hope.

	Willie Long has come back from the Asylum perfectly restored.  Mr. Westfield lost his little son yesterday.  There has been a great deal of sickness with children.

	We restored all the old Professors in the College except President McCay who did not desire to go back.  No President was elected.

	Your last letter to your mother I have not seen.  But was glad to hear you were better satisfied with the school.  I have written to Bishop Doone to let you go & spend some days with the Pedicaris during vacation.

	I saw Col. Memminger yesterday & he told me all about Willie & his sons.  They are all doing well at Harvard, but I have rece[ive]d only one letter from Willie.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Yesterday Mr. Westfield lost his little son, & Willie Long has returned from the Asylum quite restored.

	The schools here are doing well.  I suppose you saw Susan Hoke as she went on.  I was in hope Miss Caldwell would stop at Burlington to go to school.  

       The Governor was here yet with is family.  Greenville has been quite gay this summer & we have had a great deal of company here.  

         This morning a letter was sent from the Post office for you directed to Burlington.  It had no post stamp on it & we put one on it & forwarded it to you.  I suppose it was from some little girl who forgot about the stamp.
       
       This is Sunday & I am in great haste.  I will write you a longer letter the next time.    Your grand Mother & Aunt Susan are all well.

	I rece[ive]d yours & Mr. Millers letters this evening, & I have written to Col. Orr & Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury to try & get the Secretary of the Navy to have you reconsidered by a Board of Physicians in Washington.  I hope we may be successful.  But if not you can come home & prepare yourself for some other Profession.  It may all be for the best & so you must not grieve at your misfortune.  It is owing to no fault of yours.  But in the meantime you must study & remain with Mrs. Green till our application to the Secretary of the navy is known.  If you cannot get in the Navy, I suppose you can come home by yourself.  It is impossible now for me to leave here as my courts are coming.  We shall all be glad to see you at home again.  I will forward you a check to defray your expenses.  If you are not admitted I think you had better think of medicine as a Profession & perhaps you will do as well in that line as any other.  Your trip to Annapolis will have improved you & it has been pleasant.

	But I still have hopes for you.  Could you not speak to Captain Blake or get Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller to speak to him to intercede with the Secretary of the Navy & have you reexamined.

	We are all well but Arthur.  He is getting better.  You must give our love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & thank them for all of their kindness to you.

	I will write also myself to the Secretary of the navy & get Col. Pickens to write to the President with whom he is intimate.

And now nearly dinner time so I will have to stop writing directly, and finish this letter tomorrow or this evening.  You see a picture of the College at the head of this letter, which you may not recognize at first view.

	Ill write my first letters to my friends on this paper, so that [they] may have an idea of what sort of place I am at.  My letters must travel very slow, for I have written three home, & to Anna & Frank, yet you dont seem to have got but one of them.  I will write once a week, but you must tell Fannie to write, and write yourself, so that I may hear oftener than that.  Home is so far off, that I value the letters from there on account of the distance they have come.  It is now dinner time so I will close for a while.

	I have just returned from dinner, and will add a little to this letter now, and finish tomorrow (Sunday).  In my last letter, I gave all the particulars about my room, the College &c., so that I havent much to tell you.  I didnt mention in my last, anything about Pringle.  I like him very much indeed.  His father was on here a short time after you left.  He has a sister living in New-Haven.  He is in the sophomore class.

	I got the trunk of book day-before yesterday, but they came by express, and I havent heard anything of Mr. Long or Sue Hoke.  I have not been to Boston to see whether they have been at the hotel or not.  For a great many of the books I have no use, but some I am glad to have; Im glad you sent the shirts and desk.  I borrowed a key to open the latter.  Chancellor Dunkin called to see myself and the Memmingers the other day.  He was very kind, and said that I must mention he had called, and remember him to Pa, and particularly to you.  He graduated here.

	From Pas letter I see that they have re-elected the old Professors, so I suppose the students will return.  They have the students under very good government here.  I dont think there is any danger of their rebelling.

	From Annas letter she seems to be better satisfied that when she first wrote to me.  I got a letter from Jim Moore, the same day I received your first mentioning, also, the marriage of Miss Hamilton and Lamb, which must have created quite a sensation in Greenville.  The Memmingers received letters a day or two afterwards, mentioning the same thing.  [William Hayne Perry]

My dear Son

	I was in hopes to have heard from you again last night.  This is Sunday.  I shall hear from Col. Orr tomorrow & will then write you again.  I have written to the Secretary of the Navy & to Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury whom I know personally.  I have also written to Captain Blake.

	You had better see Captain Blake & consult with him about your application to the Secretary of the Navy for reexamination by the Board of Physicians in Washington.  Get him to give you a letter to the Secretary, & go up to Washington & present yourself to the Secretary & tell him you wish to be reexamined & that you think you are able to perform all the duties required of you.  By the time you reach Washington the Secretary will have recei[ve]d my letter & Col. Orrs & perhaps Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury will have seen him.  If your chest is fit for service you will be admitted & if it is not you had better not enter the Navy.  You can then return home & pursue your studies till you are educated.  When you have been thoroughly educated you can study medicine, & I will send you to Philadelphia to attend the medical Lectures.  You will make yourself a useful & great Doctor I hope.  If you prefer any other Profession when educated you shall be allowed to pursue it.

	I do not wish you to be grieved at all at what has occurred.  It is no fault of yours & we shall all be glad to see you at home.  

	As soon as I hear from Col. Orr I will write you again.  I suppose you are soon enough to go to Washington by yourself.  My circuit is about commencing & I cannot possibly leave home or I would go immediately to Annapolis for you.

	Perhaps you can fall in company with someone going to Washington, who will carry you to the Secretary of the Navy.  In Washington, if you will call on Mr. Bradl[e]y or Mr. Carlyle, & tell them whose son you are either of them will assist you or if you will go to Mr. Howell Cobb Secretary of the Treasury & make yourself known he will be kind to you.  Thomas Thurston is in one of the offices in Washington.

	I will send you in my next letter a check to defray your expences home in case you have to come home.  I suppose you can come by yourself.  Bring your ticket in Washington to Weldon and at Weldon purchase one to Columbia.  Come home by Charlotte, the same rout[e] that you went.

	Consult with Mr. Miller & get him to assist you and advise you as to your action in all things.  Perhaps you might get Mr. Miller to go with you to Washington.

	Since writing this letter Col. Pickens who will be elected to the United States Senate in the place of Judge Butler has been in my office and given me a letter of introduction for you to the Secretary of the Navy.  You take it & give it to Mr. Yancey &perhaps he will admit you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I received your welcome letter yesterday morning.  Today is Sunday.  I have just returned from breakfast, and have an hour or two to spare before going to church, so I will drop you a few lines to let you know that I am still flourishing in this land of yankees.  There is no danger of my getting bad for want of preaching, for I have to go to the Chapel twice every Sunday.  In Columbia I had only to go once a day.  I am getting on very well, and am glad to heart that you are better satisfied than at first.  There is nothing like getting used to a thing.  My friends are getting to be more punctual than they were.  I got a letter from Bill Beattie, and am expecting another every day.  He was at Glenns Springs for some time, which was the reason he didnt write sooner.  Jim Moore has also written to me.

	Tell Miss Jennie Carson that there is no danger of my forgetting Greenville while she stays there.  Give her my love.  I would like to have a correspondent like her.  

	I suppose you have heard the great event in Greenville :viz: Miss Hamiltons run-away match with Lamb, who they say is a complete drunkard.  I expect they both brought their pigs to a bad market, as the saying is.  I get most of my Greenville news from Frank, who I hope has passed his examination by this time, and is strutting about with his midshipmans clothes and gold watch.

	I have heard nothing of Mr. Long, and Sue Hoke.  I have received a trunk of books, which Ma said she was going to send by them; but it came to me by Express.  They must have left Boston out of their route.  I have to study pretty hard.  Whenever I want any amusement I can go to Boston to the Theatre, which is next to the largest in the United States.  I have been there several times, and saw some very fine acting.  I and the Memmingers always go together.  There is a Pringle, also here, from Charleston Aunt Brewtons nephew, who I like very much, and am very intimate with.  He is in soph Class.

	Do you recognize the picture at the head of this letter.  I write you on this paper so as to send you the picture, but the paper is so small that I dont think I will write on it again.  I have not room to say half what I want.  I shall have to stop for want of room.  You must write to me soon.  You wont have much else to do, in your vacation.  I will call to see you on my way home, and will see about taking you with me.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

P.S. I have sent you another letter to Miss Branch.

My dear Daughter

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you last night, and you complain of my not writing you.  Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much in her letters that I did not think it worthwhile for me to write you.

	I suppose she has told you about Franks rejection which grieves her very much, but I care very little about it.  We are making an effort to have him examined by a Board of Medical men in Washington.  If he is not admitted, he will return home & commence his studies at the Furman university with a view of making himself a doctor.  I think this will suit him as well as the navy.

	I hope you will stand& enter a high class.  Consult with your teachers & study those branches in which you are deficient.

	I am glad you are becoming better satisfied with your school, teachers, & students.   You must not be spending all your money in dressing.  You had better keep your money to buy dresses when you quit school.  I see no necessity for your dressing fine at school.  It is all folly & extravagance.  Your moth is imprudent in this particular & our kind.  I hope your good sense will stop your shopping at once.  Wear the clothes you have & buy no more.

       I wrote to the Bishop to let you go & spend a few days at Mr. Pedicaris if he called for you.  But you must not stay there long.  Return to your school & study hard.  Your return home depends on it.  You have gone to Burlington to study & not to visit or receive visits.  I am opposed to your being visited by young men or boys whilst at school.  It is contrary to the value of the school, & I do wish to make you an exception.  

	I know that Sue Hoke was very anxious to stop & see you.  I suppose she will as she returns.  But then she will be with Crayton & his wife who will not be willing to stop.  It may be you will not see her.

	We shall be glad to hear from you as often as possible, but you must not let your correspondence interfere with your studies.  My great ambition is to have my children well educated, & they ought to improve the opportunities I give them.  You have mind & capacity for study, & I have confidence in your inclination & ambition to study.  I think you have more of these qualities than my sons.

	We are all pretty well except poor little Arthur, & he is improving.  I was very much afraid when we returned home that we should loose the dear child.  He was very puny & looked badly.  I was shocked when I saw him.  His death would have been a bitter sting to me through life, as I should have attributed it to our going off & leaving him.

	We rece[ive]d a letter from Willie the other day.  He is doing well & quite well but has been unwell.  He is pleased with Harvard.  Mr. Perdicariss son is in bad health & has had to return home.  Col. Memmingers sons are well.

	I have sent you the Patriot & you must enquire for it at the Post office.  It will give you the news of the village.  Give my respects to your teachers & believe me your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Enclosed I send you a letter from Col Orr to the Secretary of the Navy.  General Thompson writes the Secretary today in your behalf.  I also write to Judge Evans our Senator in the United States Senate, to write to the Secretary of the Navy.

	Col. Orr says you had better take his letter & go on & see the Secretary if you do not hear from him in a few days.  I think you had better go at once & see the Secretary.

	I am sorry I did not hear from you tonight.  Col. Orr writes me he wrote a very strong letter for you to the Secretary.

	Enclosed I send you a check to defray your expences home in case you are not admitted into the navy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from the Secretary of the Navy ordering you to go on to Washington and to be reexamined by a Board of Physicians there.

	If you have not already gone on to Washington you will do so immediately & report yourself to the Secretary of the Navy.  I hope now you will be admitted.

	It may be that after the Secretary rece[ive]d Col. Orrs letter he wrote to you to go on to Washington.  I did not tell him where you were & consequently he wrote to me directing me to send you to Washington.  Col. Orr wrote him where you were.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Cobb Secretary of the Treasury also tonight informing [me] that he had been to see the Secretary of the Navy & had got a favorable decision.

	When the Secretary receives Col. Orrs letter & General Thompsons, Judge Evans & Col. Pickens he will certainly be favorable so far as lies in his power.  When he wrote me he had rece[ive]d none of them.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & was truly glad to hear from you & to hear you were well.

	I hope now my dear son that you will enter the naval school.  Your mother is delighted at the idea of your reexamination.  She was greatly distressed before.  

 
	When I hear from you again I hope to hear good news.  You must use as much of the check as you wish which I sent you & the remainder keep for future use.  We will go on & see you next summer.  

	You must tender my sincere thanks to Mr. Miller, but for his letter I should not have know what to do.

	We rece[ive]d a letter from Anna & one from Willie yesterday & tonight.  They are both well.  Anna is distressed at your rejection & Willie will be when he hears it.  

	We are all well except Arthur.  He is better.  In haste yours &c., B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I received your letter yesterday morning, and have just time now to begin to answer it, as today is Sunday, and I will have to go to the Chapel soon to attend service.  Our Chaplain is of the Unitarian denomination and most of the Faculty are of the same denomination, that is they dont believe that the son is equal to the Father.  But I dont think they will convert me, as I generally get about half asleep during the service, particularly in the evening.  I would go regularly to sleep, but they are so strict here, they would have me up before the Faculty if I did.  You certainly have enough of Church, if you have to go once a day, but then you dont have to go to recitation, which is worst than Church.

	You must be having a dull vacation.  I have heard of Franks fate.  It is a great disappointment indeed, but no doubt is all for the best.  He would have had a hard life in the navy, from what I hear of it.  Besides, as you say, it is no disgrace, as it was none of his fault.  It would have been worse if the Academical board had rejected him.  

	I received a letter from him yesterday and one from Ma, who Takes it very hard.  I have just written to her, and given her as much comfort as possible.  I received a letter from Pa, who thinks he will let Frank graduate at Furman University, and then study medicine, which I think is a great deal better for Frank.  

	I will now stop until after Church, when I will finish, if I have anything more to write you.

	I went to church, and have just returned from dinner.  You must get crowds of letters.  I got three yesterday and thought that I had got a great many for one mail.  Give my love to Miss Helen Harrington. And Particularly to Miss Jennie.  You must not think that I make a regular habit of going to the theatre.  The Memmingers and myself only go now and then for variety.  You know we ought to have some recreation after studying hard all the week.

	When we want exercise, we walk over to Boston, which is three miles and a half, which is a pretty good walk.  We walked over yesterday.  And I feel pretty good from the effects of it.  I hear that Frank Coxe has gone to Philadelphia to College.  Bill Beattie has gone back to the V[irgini]a University.  Wes Cary has gone home.  So I expect Greenville is dull; I would like to be there a while though, at any rate.

	It is about time for me to close.  I will stop in New-York, on my way home, and buy you some of the best candy that I can find.  

	Keep to your promise, and write to me quickly.   Your affectionate brother, B.F. Perry.

P.S. Give me all the Greenville news, of which you ought to have a good deal, as you correspond with so many girls.

My dear Son

	Your letter last night filled our hearts with gladness.  Your mother was afraid to open the letter fearing that you were rejected again.  I opened it & read it to her that you had been rejected by the Academic Board.  But there was something in myonce which contradicted the reading.  You dont know how much gratified your mother is.  If you had been rejected I think she would not have cared to see you in Greenville.  You must return our thanks a hundred times to Mr. Miller who has been a true friend of yours.  You ought to be proud to have such a friend & value him through life.

	We are all anxious to receive the long letter you promised giving an account of your visit to Washington & examinations.  I hope the letter may come tonight.

	You must now choose a clever, good boy for your roommate & study hard & distinguish yourself in your class.  Be kind to every one of your associates but keep out of bad company.  Be careful to observe all the laws & regulations of the school.  Obey your teachers in everything.

	You must write us as often as you can & tell us all about the school, the students, the teachers, your studies, the fare &c. &c.

	Settle up with Mrs. Green & purchase the things you need & put the rest of your money in bank to be kept for you.

	I have told Col. Hoke, Dr.  Croft, Mr. Elford, Dr. Hoke and a great many others that you were a Midshipman.  I am sorry for poor little Lane who was rejected.  I thought he looked like a good Boy & was pleased with him.  Did you become acquainted with him?

	Fannie says that she told the little girls at school you were admitted & they said they were sorry, for they wanted to see you back in Greenville.  Matilda almost cried when she heard you were rejected.

	You must write to us all [that] the Secretary of the navy said to you, & what Mr. May said, & did for you.

	We are all well.  Arthur is pretty near well.  He walked about over the room yesterday for the first time in two months.  Hayne is as fat as a pig.  Hext is going to school & learns well.  Your mother spends a good deal of her time in writing to Anna, Willie & you.  I am very busy in my office preparing for Court as this is return week.  My Clients have come in now & I must conclude.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I received your letter of Oct. 1st the other day, in which you complain of my not writing you, & say you began to think I had forgotten about leaving you at St. Marys Hall.  Now, my dear daughter I have written you twice & only received one letter from you.  I might have supposed that you had forgotten that you had a father as well as a mother at home.  All your correspondence has been with her.  I knew that she wrote you almost every day, & told you everything that occurred in & out of the Village.  I had therefore nothing to write you.     

	 I am glad to hear you are better pleased with your school than you were at first.  I hope you will study hard & make good progress in your studies.  I wish you to learn Latin if you have time.  I am willing for you to come home in April if convenient, but you must commit to return & graduate.

	I recd a letter from Frank last night stating that he was now an acting midshipman, had passed the Academic Board, with flying colors, missed not a question, had been kindly rece[ive]d by the Secretary of the Navy, & pronounced by a Board of Physicians in Washington without defect or disease.  He writes me in high spirits & says I must tell everybody he is admitted.  He likes the school but not the life of a naval officer.  He has made a great many warm friends in Annapolis.  Mr. Miller went with him to Washington.  There he met Mr. May a former member pf Congress from Baltimore whom I knew very well as a distinguished lawyer in the Gardner case.  He took interest in Frank on my account & went with them to the Secretary of the Navy.  Frank will not be able to return home for two years now.  What do you think of that?

	The Perrys are not going to school.  Emma is thinking of getting married to a Mr. C a student.  Susan & Anna say they will go to the Lexington Springs in February.  Anna is now at school in Pickens at.  

	The Poney is fat & hearty.  Fannie rides him occasionally.  Arthur is getting well I hope.  Hayne is quite fat & as hardy as a little pig.  Hext goes to school & does well.    Fannie is making fine progress with her music.  Your mother spends a great portion of her time in writing to you & Willie & Frank.  She is one of the best correspondents I ever saw.

	The servants are all well & Wiley has got married to a woman of Mrs. Nances in Newberry.  He says he is willing to see her once a year only rather than not marry her!  They will have very little time to quarrel during their married life.

	I am interrupted by my clients & must close my letter.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I received several letters from you during the past week.  The first thing I do is to congratulate you on Franks admission into the Naval Academy.  I am as pleased at his good fortune As you are, though I tried to console you by saying that it was all for the best.  I received three letters from Frank almost in succession, the first telling me of his rejection, the second of his being reexamined, by the medical board, and the last of his being admitted by the Academical board, and consequently being a midshipman.  He says the first thing we hear of him, he will be Commodore Perry.  The first medical board must have been very unjust.  I knew of his success before I received Pas letter, which was post-marked Columbia, from which I thought that Pa must be in Columbia, until I opened it.

	The oldest Memminger, Parker, from Charleston who is in the Scientific school here, and myself all dined with Mr. Winthrop in Boston yesterday.  He is one of the distinguished men of Boston, and was speaker of the House in Congress.  He said he had read Pas speech before the Institute in Charleston.  He was very kind, and said we must call to see him frequently.  Col. Memminger introduced his sons and me to him when he was in Boston, and he showed us the Library and curiosities of the Massachusetts Historical Society.

	Our catalogue is out, and I will send one by the same mail with this letter, and you can have the pleasure of seeing my name in print, and at full length.  I went last night to hear the celebrated Lola Montes deliver a lecture.  I saw your friend Mr. Davis there, but only at a distance, this is the first time that I have ever had a glimpse of him.  

	Today is Sunday.  I will have to write to Frank, and Anna also.  I saw Franks name in a paper, as one of those admitted to the naval Academy and I must tell him of it.  I have nothing to tell about myself.

       I got Mr. Earle, the tailor that I wrote you about, to make me a pair of dress pants and a vest to wear to Mr. Winthrops yesterday.  They cost $16.  My washing will cost about $15 a term, or twenty weeks.  Besides I have to pay 50 cts a week to a man who blacks my boots, makes fires, and tends on my room.  The tuition fees are $37 a term.  At the end of the term a bill of the tuition fees, book-bill and coal, is made out, and we are allowed until the beginning of the second term to pay.  I think this would be the best way to do. As I would have more money then.  But if he wishes. I will pay the bill now.  I have nothing more to write.

	I hope you feel better now, since Frank has been admitted.

	Give my love to Fannie, Hext, and Hayne.  I am glad that Arthur is better.  I hope he is well by this time.  I was very much surprised to hear of Wileys marriage, but hope that he will continue to do well.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I returned from Anderson Court last night & received your letter of the 9th Inst.  I have to go back to court in the morning and will write you a letter whilst I am at home.

	Your letters give us great satisfaction, & I hope you will study hard & behave well, so as to get no demerit at all.  Strive for this my son.

	I saw Mr. Suber at Anderson who told me all about Lanes rejection.  He thinks of preparing himself for West Point & trying to get in there when he is old enough.

	You must write me what you are studyinghow often you recite your lessons how long & how often you drillhow you like the different Professors & students.

	Col. Orr was very much pleased to hear you had entered the naval Academy.  He saw all the news in the Washington union newspaper before I saw him.  The Colonel says he knows Mr. Bradford of California, who was a Presidential Elector & he supposes him to be the father of your roommate, & that he is a very clever gentleman. 

	I know a Mr. Grimball who was Senator from one of the Parishes, & perhaps some kin or may be the father of your fellow student & drill master.

	The check I sent you you ought to get the money for if you have not done so, Mr. Hammond will give you the money for it.  You are quite rich in the way of money now & must take care of it & not spend it foolishly.  Youi ought to try & lay up a part of your pay till you come home or graduate.

	I do not know how you had so much money left after paying Mrs. Green.  What was her Bill for board &c.?

	When you are allowed to get out, you must go & see Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller, & keep out of all bad company & away from all bad places.  Give our love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller, Mr. May, Mr. Cobb. The Secretary of the Navy, & Captain Blake thanking them for all their kindness to you.

	Do you get the Patriot regularly?  Does your watch keep good time?  What have you to eat?

	I was sorry for poor little lane.  He said he did care so much about staying after you had been rejected.  He seemed a good boy.

	We are all well.  Arthur is running about once more.  We heard from Willie & Anna lately.  They are well except Anna still has a cough.

There is nothing new in the village.  The Baptist have a fair tonight.  The Episcopalians had one last week & made three or four hundred dollars.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Papa

	I received your letter the other day and as I have written several times lately, I will now write you a few lines to let you know how I am getting on.

	I have nothing of importance to write.  The weather seems to be turning to regular winter weather, but I see by the Patriot that you have also had frost.

	I am glad that Mas distress about Frank has been relieved.  I got a letter from him the other day, and he seems well satisfied.  I have just received a letter from Anna, and she seems to be getting on very well.  I want you to tell me how you went from New-York to Burlington.  I want to stop & see Anna before I go home, but I dont know exactly how to go, as I did not pass through Burlington.  

       I sent you a catalogue from which you will see that the vacation commences on the 20th of January.  I am much obliged to you for your permission to stop in Washington.  It is just what I would like, as I want to see the distinguished men of the country.  
       
       Mom said that I ought to study Mathematics.  The reason I have dropped it, is this.  According to the rules, if a student takes a modern language (as French) and Mathematics, he must drop either Latin or Greek, and I knew that you wanted me to study the ancient languages in preference to Mathematics.  Mem[m]inger and myself have both taken French.  I saw Mr. Joe Long Wednesday.  I was very much surprised to see him, as I thought he had gone home.  He said that Sue Hoke did not come by Boston, but had gone home.  He sent my trunk on by the express from Columbia and paid for it himself, so you had better pay him for it.  He has a cousin in the Law school here, who he introduced me to, and who seems to be a clever young man.  He left the next day, and I suppose has reached home by this time.
       
       Today is Saturday.  Some of you must write to me on Monday always, as it is the letters written on Monday, and not those written on Sunday that reach me on Saturday.  I would like to hear as often as possible from home.
       
       I suppose you know more about the great money crisis than I do.  A great many of the richest men in Boston have failed.  The Boston Banks have suspended for the present, but will soon resume payments again I suppose.
       I hope the children are well, and servants and horses.  Fanny says that you are going to get another horse, and a mule for a fee; what are you going to do with them
       
       I will now close.  Your affectionate Son, [William Hayne Perry]

Dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning, after I returned from one of my exercise walks to Boston.  Your letter reminded me of Judge ONealls.  I also received a letter from Ma and it made two letters in one day which was a crowd for me to get at one time.  Ma doesnt write as often as she did.  I also got a letter from Frank the other day, who seems to be still flourishing.  You must write some very homesick letters home, from Mas account.  You ought to be getting used to the place, and to being away from home by this time.  It must be getting so many letters from home that makes you homesick.  I dont think you have any harder time than I have.  I will have to walk through the snow this winter to Church and to recitation every day; and I expect this place will be a great deal colder than where you are.  So just compare your condition with mine, and you will begin to think that you are far better situated than I am.  You must be better off than Frank, for he says he has to be his own tailor, chambermaid, and boot-black.  Did you get a Catalogue that I sent you; I dont think you have mentioned receiving it.

	I will start for home on or about the 20th of January.  Our vacation lasts six weeks, but it takes up so much time going and returning, that I wont have so much time at home.  I will stop and see you and Frank also.  Pa says that I may stop in Washington, as the Congress will be in Session, and I will have a chance to see all the big men.  Frank says he became acquainted with the big men when he went to Washington.  But I suppose he couldnt enjoy the acquaintance as he must have been worried about his examination.

	Why didnt you send Miss Anna Trezevants letter.  I would have given the world to read it, and of course wouldnt think her forward.  Is she coming back to school again.  I have written to Bill Beattie to find out if she is any relation to him.  I hope she is.  

	Today is Saturday.  I will finish this letter tomorrow (*Sunday).  Sunday morningIt is nearly church time and I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

My dear Daughter

	I have staid at home today, instead of going to church to write you & Willie & Frank.  

	I returned from Pickens Court Friday & rece[ive]d your letter which gave me great pleasure & satisfaction.  I shall be very busy this week as court opens here in the morning.  I had a fine business at Pickens & made a good deal of money which I stand much in need of at present to pay for my House &c.  I have also had to advance seven hundred dollars to your grandmother to help pay for her furniture &c.

	You must not fret at everything which happens.  You know I sent you to Burlington to learn obedience & patience as well as your studies in school.  Take everything quietly & patiently & do not complain of anything.  We cannot have everything as we wish it in this life.  And it is best to make a virtue of necessity & take everything calmly.

       If I do not have it in my power to go for you in April, it will suit very well for you to return with some of the Southern girls & I may meet you on the road.
       
       Your school will commence shortly & then you will be better satisfied & have regular employment.  Idleness or want of regular employment is a horrible life.  We were all made to be actively engaged in this world & no one is happy unless he is actively in pursuit of some object.  
       
       We are all well except colds.  Arthur is quite well again except a cold.  The poor little fellow was very low when we returned & had we staid a week longer he would have died.  Hayne is fat & hardy.  Hext went with me to Pickens court & behaved well.  He went with his uncle F home & staid two nights.  He wished to go with William to the Tugaloo farm & stay there.  His uncle gave him a knife which he is proud of as Frank is of his watch.  Fannie is going to school & occasionally rides your Ponyevening.  I wish you could have him to ride through the streets of Burlington.  Your mother is well & much gratified at the success of her children at school.  The servants are well except Clara may had a cold & was laid up a day or two.  Clara is still in her room with a cold.  The Horses are all doing well & looking fat & sleek.  Your Pony would no doubt be glad for you to take him out of the stable & ride him.  He finds it doubtless dull standing in his stall all day.
       
       Poor Mrs. Prince, daughter of Jordan Pool died very suddenly of cold & her husband & family are in great distress & anguish of heart at her early loss.  A good many students are sick.  You must take care & not catch cold.  Never mind the musquitoesthey only deplete you a little by their biting.  You will soon get used to them & their music.
       
       I hope your cough is betteravoid coughing if you can.  If your teeth need plugging have it done.  Good teeth is a very desirable matter with a young lady & you must take care of yours.
       
       Franks letters are more hopeful in tone & spirit than yours & Willies.  he is a fellow who always looks on the bright side of the picture & sees its beauties.  This is a great strength in life.  Two persons may have the same fortune in life in every respect & one be happy 7 the other miserable by looking at different sides of the picture of their lives.  one looking at his good fortune & the other seeing nothing but his troubles.  Life is a mixture of good & evil.  We had better dwell on the good & forget the evil as soon as possible.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
You must request them to ask for the Patriot & Mountaineer direct to you.  It will be better than a letter every week.

My dear Son

	I received your letter of the 14th Inst. On my return last evening from Pickens Court, and was gratified to hear you were still pleased with the Naval Academy & had no demerits.  You must study hard & behave well, be obedient to your officers & teachers in all things, & kind to your fellow students.  I know it is hard to pass through the school without demerits.  But you must have as few as possible.  I hope you will pass your February Examination with flying colors.

	Col. Orr inquired about you at Pickens, & all of your friends ask after you very frequently.  You are a great favorite in Greenville amongst all the Boys & girls too I believe.  You must prove yourself worthy of their love & esteem.  

	Hext went with me to Pickens Court & behaved well.  He went down to his uncle Foster Perrys & staid two days.  His uncle gave him a knife which he is very proud of & thinks as much of as you do of your watch.  Does your watch keep good time?  You have said nothing about it lately.

	You ought to git you an overcoat when the weather turns cold.  I believe you have none.  Take care of yourself & avoid catching cold.  

	Mrs. Prince the daughter of Jordan Pool died whilst I was At Pickens.  She caught cold at the Fair one night & died the next day or two.

	A great many persons are now sick in Greenville with colds.  Several of the students in the Furman University are quite unwell.

	The House is now finished and painted & looks pretty.  It has cost me upwards of two thousand dollars.

	I had a great deal of business at Pickens & made some money.  I defended a man who was indicted for having two wives.  He was convicted & has been sentenced to fine & imprisonment.

	This is Sunday & tomorrow is court at this place.  Instead of going to church I have staid in my office to write you & Willie & Anna.  I am glad you all keep up a correspondence.  I need not therefore write you about them as you hear from them sooner than I do.

	You must write me all about your school, your officers, teachers, students, studies amusements, boarding &c. &c.  Who are you most intimate with amongst the students?

       You wrote to your mother on the 18th enquiring about Wileys getting married.  He married a girl of Mrs. Nance at Newberry.  I told him it was so far he could not see his wife often & he said he was willing to marry her oftener than once a year.  I will let him go oftener than that.  He does very well now & keeps sober since joining the Baptist church.  Clara is sick with coldMary has been ill the rest of the servants are well.
       
       Arthur is pretty well but has a cold.  Hayne is fat & hardy.  Hext is quite well.  Fannie is going to school & well.  Hext is also going to school.  Your mother is quite well & delighted at your success in the Naval Academy.  We will try & go on & see you next summer.
       
       The Horses are all fat & sleek.  The Pony wants someone to ride him.  He stands in the stable all day & no doubt would like to prance about a little.  Fannie rides him some times.
       
	Your grandmother & Susan & the children are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	Your welcome letter was received at the right time yesterday morning.  Today is Sunday my usual writing day, but owing to the old Chapel I will only have time to begin this letter now.  I will finish it this evening.

	I see that you still get as many letters as usual.  I get fewer that I used to.  Because I told Ma that I wanted to hear from home Saturday anyhow, she seems to think that I dont want to hear any other time.  I heard from Pa yesterday.  I went to a musical party Wednesday night at Prof. Pierces, where I had the extreme pleasure of seeing & becoming acquainted with some of the young ladies of yankeedom.  I dont think them any prettier through, but you can tell the young ladies in Greenville that if they wont have me I stand some chance of getting a yankee girl who will be useful if not ornamental, for no doubt they know how to act as chambermaids, as they havent any niggers to wait on them.

	I also went to see some young ladys in Boston the other night.  I went with Joe Longs cousin, who is in the Law school here.  The bell is ringing for church, so I will close till after dinner.

	I have just returned from Chapel, and will conclude this letter before dinner.  Give my respects to Miss Jennie & Miss Helen.  I dont know whether I will go into that flirtation that you were speaking of, or not.  Im afraid it will be tiresome.  If you see Frank Coxe again, tell [page torn] I leave about the 21st of January, and [page torn] be in Philadelphia a few days after [page torn] so he must call at the Girard House, about that time, and inquire for me.

	Every time I write to you I forget to send the lock of hair, and Im afraid that I will forget it again before I finish this letter.  Bill Beattie says his father came from Washington County Va &c., but as Mrs. Tresevant is gone it is no use going into particulars.  He said he would claim the relationship if he came up North next summer, so that he might visit the school.

	I like the paper your letter was written on, because it was of a good size.  This is the best paper that I can get about here, and it is no account.  I want to hear of Miss Paulines marriage, just so as to know, who she is going to marry.

	I just have to cross the street to be in the College yard, but have a pretty long walk {page torn] meals.  [page torn] Ive cut the lock of hair.  I didnt have a[ny] scissors, so had to cut it with my knife, and it liked to have pulled all the hair out of my head, and didnt get much after all.  I havent any ribbon to tie it up with.

	I have got me a new suit of clothes and if I dont wear them out before I get home, I may break some ladys heart.  I will certainly have a fine time, being the only beau.  I will fly around like a cart with one wheel on.  But all the Fairs will be over.  However, I dont care about going home to see the girls.  I dont know whether I will speak to one all the time Im at home.

	I hope you will keep on writing long letters.  I have a Theme to write every two weeks, which is a good deal harder than a composition.  Ive come to the end of my paper a must close.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

My dear Son

	I recei[ve]d your letter of the 29th October Friday evening & was glad to hear you stood so well in tour class as to be placed in the second section.  This is well indeed for you, for all the boys must be older than you.  I hope you will study hard, behave well & graduate with high distinction.

	You must be very particular in your conduct & studies, & observe all the rules & regulations of the school.

	I am glad you were invited to Dr. Sharpes & went.  You must go & see captain Blake & his good Lady whenever they invite you.

	We will try & send you all our likenesses when we have an opportunity.  And you must have yours taken well & send to your mother & myself.

	You say that Anna writes you she is homesick & you do not see the propriety of sending girls off to school like boys.  Anna will be much better satisfied when her school opens again & she has to study hard.  She will then have no time to indulge in thinking of home.  It is of great service to girls to send them from home to go to school at Annas age.  It keeps them out of company & gives them a better opportunity of studying.  At home they become young ladies too soon & think more of company than they do of their studies.
,
	You say I must write you how all the horses are doing.  They are all fat & sleek & look remarkably well.  Wiley hauls wood with Bill & Tim & Monarch.  Tom Thumb is very tired of standing all day in the stable & would like very much for you to be here & ride him every evening.  When I go into the stable he begs me as well as he can to take him out.  Fannie sometimes rides him.  He is very fat & stout.  Monarch would be unmanageable if I did not make Wiley put him in the lead & haul wood with him occasionally.

	I am now engaged in the Courts.  Last week was Greenville Court & this week is Spartanburgh  Court.  Tomorrow is sales day & I shall not go to Spartanburgh till Tuesday.

	You may remember Simon Turner was in Jail for killing Reed.  He was tried last week.  I & Goodlett defended him.  His trial took three days & the verdict of the jury was.  He has been sentenced to twelve months imprisonment & fined one thousand dollars.  The Solicitor Reed & Henry Thurston made speeches against him.

	This is Sunday & I shall not go to church, as I have so many letters to write and so much business to do before starting to Spartanburgh.  You must write me every Sunday as you promise I will answer all your letters.

	We hear from Anna every other day, & from Willie once a week.  He is doing well & well satisfied.

	I have done a good business this court & am paying for my House which will cost me for the rooms put up twenty five hundred dollars.

	The times are hard & money scarce.  The Banks here are suspended & there will be a great deal of suing next court.  This will make a fine harvest for the lawyers.

	We are all well except colds which are general.  You must write me all about the Boys in school & how you like them, your studies &c.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Greenville

My dear Son

	Your mother rece[ive]d a letter from you night before last, but Mrs. Doctor Butler has it, & two other letters of yours to read.  The letter you sent your grandmother last week was sent to Mr. McBees & the old gentleman was very much pleased with it.  He said you wrote like a man instead of a Boy.  He made Vardry come down & read it.

	  I am glad you went to see Captain Blake & hope you will go & see Mrs. Blake.  You must also not forget Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You should have your likeness taken for Mrs. Greens daughter as she has asked for italso send one for Miss McR & give Miss Bartow one.  

	You will see in the last Patriot that I have acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Bartows sermon & will publish it as soon as possible.  I admire it very much.

	You ought to tell young Rodgers that you know his aunt Mrs. Doctor Butler very well & hear from through me.  He & you too may be some kin.  Mrs. Butler says that three Brothers, our ancestors, came over from England about two hundred years agotwo of them settled in Massachusetts, & one in Rhode Island.  We are descended from the Massachusetts branch & your grandfather Perry was born near Boston.  Commodore Perry is descended from the Rhode Island Brother.

	Your mother will fix you up a box of books &c. when I go to Columbia next week & I will forward them by Adams Express.

	Your grandmother has been sick, but is now better.  All the rest of us are well.  The servants are well & the horses fat & sleek.

	Poor Mrs. Gridley died yesterday.  She had been bedridden for twelve months.  There have been a good many deaths in Greenville since you left her.

	I am very much pleased to hear you are going to sea next summer & will coast around by Boston & see Willie.

	You must send us your likeness, & I am glad to hear you are fat & hearty, & doing well in your school.  I hope you will try hard & avoid demerits, & study well.  You must study your lessons most attentively.

	Write me all about the Boys in the Naval Academy.  How many have you become acquainted with? & whom do you like best?  I hope your roommate is a clever steady & studious boy.

	I will try & go on to see you next May.  The Legislature meets tomorrow two weeks & you must then direct your letters to me in Columbia.  I will write occasionally, if I have time, while I am in Columbia.

       The students in Furman University are now preparing to leave here.  They all behave themselves well.  There has been no difficulties in the school.
       
       We hear from Willie once a once a week & from Anna every other day.  Willie says he has been out visiting in Boston & was invited to dine with Mr. Winthrop & to a party at Professor Pierces.
       
       I am very busy now with my law matters & arranging to attend the appeal court & Legislature.
       
       Give my love to your school & roommate Bradford & tell him to take good care of you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday & I have been to church with your mother.  And was well as I go to Columbia on Saturday.  I will write letters this evening to you, Willie & Frank.  You have not written to me lately.  You promised to do so when your school opened again.  Your mother rece[ive]d a letter from you Friday evening.  I am glad to hear you have entered a high class, & I hope you will graduate in it with a high honor.  You will now be kept so busy in studying that you will not have time to think so much of Home, your dresses & your cough.  Now will you have so much time to write letters.  I think you write too many to your schoolmates, once a month would be often enough to write to them.  You must not neglect your studies for your correspondents.  Always endeavor to write well.  When you write so much you cannot take pains with your letters.  You must direct your next letter to me in Columbia where I shall be for four or five weeks.  If I have time I will write you occasionally & tell you the Columbia news.

	Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much that I have nothing to write about.  She will write you tomorrow & send you a pretty broach with a lock of Susans hair.  She wrote you the other day & sent you Fannies likeness.  She also sent one to Frank.

	Has she also told you that Emma Perry & Hawthorn are to be married on the 11th of December.  I have never seen him & know nothing about him.  Long & Susan Perry will probably make a match also.    They allought to be well switched.

	I hope you will remain single for many years, & learn something about housekeeping before you think of marrying.  I hope too you will not do as they are going to do, marry boysno young man should be allowed to get married till he is in a condition, by his profession or business, to support a wife & family.  Whilst a girl is so young too she is incapable of judging of the character of a young woman. She may marry some, she will be ashamed of as a companion after her mind is matured.  I wish you my dear daughter to improve & cultivate your mind & talents & think nothing of company or society for years to come.

	You have written so much about your cough that your mother is distressed & is afraid you are consumptive.  I tell her that you have a pair of lungs almost equal to a blacksmiths bellows & that she need be in no apprehension.  There is some excin your throat which tickles & gives you the cough.  It will go off after awhile.  But do not expose yourself to the cold & avoid if possible catching cold.  Take exercise in the open air.

	How does Miss LeConte come on.  I shall see her mother on Saturday.  Write to me about her & All the other girls with whom you are intimate.  I wrote Frank he must send his likeness to Misswhom you mentioned desired it.  He says so many young ladies have asked him for his likeness that it will break him.  Surely, Frank is a great favorite about Annapolis.

	We are all well.  Your Poney is well.  John rides him occasionally on errandsotherwise the poor horse would die of eating.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Your letter of the 8th Inst. Was received Friday evening.  This is Sunday, and I will write to you, Willie & Anna, instead of going to church with your mother & Fannie.  Next Sunday I shall be in Columbia.  I go down on Saturday.

	Your letters, my dear Son, are a great comfort to me & your mother.  You are satisfied with your school & take everything like a little man, instead of complaining & trying to find something to be dissatisfied with.  But you must try and avoid demerits.  You ought ever to be on your guard against them.  You might have avoided those you have.  It was very thoughtless in you to prompt.

	In writing your letters you must not blot or blur them.  This makes them look as if they were written carelessly & not as a particular military young gentleman should write.  Your mother sent one or two of your letter to Mr. McBee & Mrs. Butler to read.  They were very much pleased with them & praised you a great deal.  You must therefore be particular in writing.

	I hope you will become acquainted with young Rodgers & tell him you are some akin to him & know his aunt Mrs. Butler very well.  I know his mother who was a daughter of CommodorePerrys.  I know his aunt Mrs. Commodore Rodgers & his cousin Mrs. Lizzie Smith very well.

	You must write & tell me when you receive any demerits & what they are for.  Remember if you receive a certain number of demerits you are dismissed from the Academy.  This would be a great shame & disgrace on you.

	You must be sure & study your lessons well & not be idle.  Let me know if you still keep in section no. 2 or whether you have risen higher.  Do not fall into a lower section.

	I am glad to hear you are growing fat & fatter.  This shows hot only that you are in good health, but that a naval school & all its hardship & trouble & study agree with you.

	Mrs. Butler is very anxious to send Tom to the naval school & says she will try & get Lanes place for him of General Bonham.  Henry Thompson told me the other day that he would very much [try] to get his son in the school in a year or two.  Mrs. Williams is trying to get a situation for Campbell in the military school in Columbia.  George Wells & Mr. Dyers son are both applicants for situations in the military school in Columbia.  And Mrs. Speers wishes to put her son there.

	We are all well.  Your mother has just sent me word that I must go with her to church this morning.  I will do so.  The children & servants & your grandmothers family are all well.  Hext is going to school to Miss Powell.  Hayne is sitting by me now in my office & says tell you he loves you & wants to see you very much.  Arthur is doing well.  Fannie has holiday now & practices a good deal  on the Piano.  The carpets have come & are put down & look very pretty.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Direct your next letter to me in Columbia.

My dear Son

	I arrived here last night at twelve oclock.  The cars ran off & the Engine was broken to pieces about twenty miles above Columbia.  But none of the passengers were injured.  We had to remain on the road two till ten oclock in the night without anything to eat or drink.  The Conductor had to send down to Columbia & get a car to come & take us.

	I left your mother & the children all well.  We received a letter from you the evening before I left home & one also came to Annie McBee from you.    I hope my dear son that you will study hard & be obedient to all the rules & regulations of the school & navy.  You are much younger than your classmates & will therefore have to study harder.  

       Mrs. Doctor Butler is very anxious to get her son Thomas in Lanes place.  She has written to General Bonham & requested me to speak to him on the subject.  Dr, Randall Croft wishes to get his son ibn the naval school as soon as he is old enough.  You see therefore what a desirable position you have & how many would be glad to have it.  You ought consequently to consider yourself very fortunate & try hard to improve & keep up with your class.  
       
       Mrs. Doctor Williams is trying to get Campbell in at the military school here.  Mrs. Speers & Mr. Dyer & George Wells are also contending for the situation.  The selection is made this week.  Two go this year from Greenville.  A young man by the name of Wilson who lives with H Cleveland and Doctor Bell have also spoken to me about the situation.  Doyley & Garmany from Greenville graduate this Fall.  Doyley has taken an honor & graduates with distinction.  I hope you will do so when you graduate.
       
       I suppose your mother has written you that someone attempted to break open your Grandmothers house one night last week.
       
       When I left home Spartan Goodlett was very ill with typhoid fever.  He was hardly expected to live.  There have been a great many deaths in Greenville this summer & Fall with typhoid fever bowell complaint.  
       
       I sent you before leaving home four of my printed likeness which you may give to Mrs. Green, Mr. Miller & some of your young friends.  If you want any more of them I can send them to you.  I have not had time to have my daguer[re]otype taken for you.
       
       You must write me as often as you can whilst I stay in Columbia which will be for four or five weeks.  Your letters are very interesting to me, as you take everything good naturedly & joyously.  That sort of disposition will carry you through the world & make you have a happy life.  How much better it is than to be complaining & grumbling at everything that happens.
       
       I hope Anna will now be better satisfied since her school has open[ed] again.  Willie seems to be doing well & studying hard.
       
       I will write you whenever I have time, but I shall be very busy here in the court of appeals & the Legislature.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

 My dear Lizzie

	We all reached here last night about twelve oclock in safety after a break down on the Greenville road below Allston.  The Engine ran off & broke its axle tree & wheels.  We were detained in the swamp from two oclock till ten oclock in the night without anything to eat or drink.  There being no water, I did not even take a drink of brandy.  No one was hurt.  There was a great crowd on board the Cars.  Amongst them a large number of Methodist Clergymen on their way to the Conference at Charlotte.  Mr. Wightman, Doctor Smith &c.  They had their families with them.  We had a dreary time of it.  But on reaching Janneys Hotel we had a good supper & I went to bed at one oclock, slept till eight, took breakfast at nine, & feel perfectly well & restored.

       On the Cars Mr. Reed mentioned a singular circumstance in regard to Col. Brockmans daughter who is boarding with him & may throw some light on the cause of Anna cough.  Miss Brockman took a ride one cold day on the Blue Ridge Rail Road & commenced coughing.  It continued at intervals very bad.  Finally threw her into a fever & she had to go to bed.  The doctors visited her for two weeks & thought she had either consumption or bronchitis.  Her Father & Mother came to see her.  Whilst in bed one day, recently, her cough was very violent & she coughed up a lump of charcoal as large as a pea which she had somehow swallowed whilst cleaning her teeth & which had lodged in her throat.  She was immediately relieved of her cough, her consumption & her bronchitis.  It may be that Annas cough is owing to some such cause.  Some charcoal. Bone, or crumb of break lodged in her throat.  Write to her about it.
       
       I am writing to you about half past twelve oclock & have already written to Elford & Frank & am going to write to Anna & Willie.  I got here so late last night that I saw no one.  And went down to breakfast so late that I saw very few persons this morning.  I have not yet seen Mr. or Mrs. LeConte.  I saw their sons & told them to tell their mother that I had heard from their sister &c.  I suppose I shall see them at the dinner table.
       
       I have not been out of the House.  The weather is pleasant but rather cold.  I saw Hamlin Beattie & C Butler last night.  They had just been undergoing an examination by one of the Committee.  There are twenty five applicants for admission.
       
       Governor Allston & his family are expected tomorrow.  The Charleston members have not yet arrived.  Neither Dr. [William Adolphus] Mooney nor [Nathaniel] Morgan or [John Latimer] Westmoreland are here.  I suppose they will come down tomorrow.  I wish very much I had staid till Monday.  It was a horrible time after we ran off the track till we reached Columbia.  I thought of a shipwreck at sea where the passenger were without food or drink & waiting death.  How much safer to be on land where we can send for help.
       
       I was told at the Greenville depot that Spartan Goodlett was very low with typhoid fever, not expected to live.  Write me how he is.  It is strange I did not hear of it whilst at home.  It is a dreadful disease.
       
       Write me every day & I will write you whenever I can.  Kiss the children for me, & give my love to your mother Susan & Anne.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I arrived here last night about twelve oclock.  We had a run off & break down on the Greenville cars as I came down.  The Engine was broken all to pieces, but the passengers rece[ive]d no injury, nor were the cars injured.  But we were detained in the swamp twenty miles above Columbia from two till ten at night without anything to eat or drink not even water.  The conductor had to send to Columbia for an Engine & cars.  We arrived in town at midnight hungry and cold.  I ate a hearty supper went to bed & slept till eight.  I feel quite well.

	At dinner I sat with Dr. & Mrs. LeConte.  The Dr. tells me [William Henry] White took first honors, [Elias Lynch] Rivers second & [William Calhoun] Keith third.  This has surprised my lady & Mrs. LeConte thinks Keith was degraded for having attended McCays recitation.  Born well &gave him a low stand in the recent examinations.  Dr. LeConte gave him the highest mark.  The College is all quiet.  There are one hundred & sixty students in College.  They are now on their good behavior.  How long they will remain so is doubtful.

	Hamlin Beattie and C Butler are both here applying for admission to the Bar.  There are
 twenty five applicants.  They are examined tomorrow.

	When I left home Spartan Goodlett was very ill with typhoid fever & hardly expected to live.  There have been a great many deaths in Greenville this fall with this disease & bowel complaint.  

	The Charleston members have not yet arrived.  They come up in the morning.  I have not seen or heard from Col. Memminger since he was at Greenville.

       I tell everyone that you are pleased with Harvard.  I told LeConte how often you were examined.  He seemed surprised at it.
       
       You must write to me here for the next four or five weeks.  I have no news to write you.
       
       The election for United States Senator is exciting a good deal of interest.  I think the contest will be between Pickens, Manning & Chesnut.
         	 
	The College & the banks will excite a good deal of interest in the Legislature.  I have drawn up a Bill to submit, converting the college into a university, diminishing the number of Trustees & making the Professors dependent in some manner on the tuition fund for their salaries.

	We have had extreme cold weather in Greenville.  The thermometer fell to eighteen which is unusually cold winter weather.  The mountains have been covered with snow.  I suppose you find it cold at Cambridge.  You must guard against taking cold.  Never sit or be chilled in a current of air.  When you find yourself becoming chilly guard against it.  There is a great danger in walking or heating yourself & then colling down to[o] soon.  Avoid night air & the cold winds of night & day.

	I shall be so busy in the court of appeals & the Legislature that I shall not have much time to write you.

	There has been a great Fair in Columbia & one in Charleston.  Col Ware took a premium with his fine horses in Columbia.

	I suppose your mother wrote you about your grandmother having her house broken open.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, which you must read before you read this.

	I have just come up from dinner where I saw Dr. & Mrs. LeConte.  They invited me to their table & I had a great deal of talk about Burlington, Anna & Tulula.  Mrs. LeConte says that her daughter & Anna are bosom friends & that Tulula writes her she loves Anna Perry, that she & Anna & a girl from Florida & one from Virginia are always together.  She says during Christmas holidays her sister is going to have Tulula, Anna & one or two others to spend a few days with her in Philadelphia & that she can ensure Anna a pleasant time.  It will be necessary to write Mrs. LeConte to give her permission.  She says Tulula writes her, she never saw a girl get so many letters as Anna Perry does, that she rece[ive]d twenty five in one week. Whilst she (Telula, poor girl) rece[ive]d only one.  It seems that the girls are delighted to receive letters.

	In relation to Annas cough Mrs. LeConte says Dr. Gantt told her it was not consumption but only an affectation of the throat.  Mrs. LeConte says however it is very bad & that Anna did not look so well as she did in Philadelphia.  I told her about Miss Brockmans cough.  Dr. LeConte said he knew a man who was affected in the same way with a cough for forty years.  There was a lodgement of ain the wind pipe & the flesh grew over it.  Finally it broke loose & he coughed it up.  Mr. Farrow who was sitting at the table said Mr. Bail[e]y had a similar cough three years & finally coughed up a bone or something & his cough ceased.  You had better write these things to Anna and let her tell Dr. Gantt.  But it seems nothing can be done.  Nature works out her own cure.  But the cough is not dangerous though troublesome.

	Mrs. LeConte is not so fat as she was & therefore looks better.  She & Dr. LeConte invited me to go to church with them this evening, but I said I had letters to write & could not go.

	I have nothing more to write you except I have a nice room in the new wing of the Hotel with two beds all to myself.  I have a good fire place & plenty of good dry wood & therefore quite comfortable.  

	Hamlin Beattie came up to get my certificate of his moral character & course of study just before dinner.

	I will now write to Anna & Willie.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Anna

	I arrived here last night about twelve oclock.  The Engine on the Greenville Road ran off twenty miles about Columbia & we had to remain there in a swamp from two till ten oclock in the night, without anything to eat or drink, not even water.  There was a crowd of members & Methodist preachers aboard of the cars, & some of them had their wives & daughters with them.  But no one was injured.  We had to send to Columbia for a train to carry us down.  The passengers bore their misfortune with great patience.  Some of the girls went to sleep and none murmured.  When the freight trainup behind there was a general shout & yell under the belief that they would be run over.  But the Engineer stopped in time.

	After getting supper I went to bed at one oclock and slept soundly till eight in the morning.  I feel perfectly well, and left all well at home.

	Just before leaving home I rece[ive]d your letter and was much pleased with it.  I am glad you have entered so high a class & are doing so well in your studies.  In regard to Latin I expect you had better not commence it, as you will have no time to make any progress in it, & pursue your other studies.  Do just as you please in regard to all of your studies so you have the sanction of your teachers.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte at dinner & had much interesting talk with her & the doctor about you & Tulula & Burlington.  She had just heard from her daughter, who said she & Anna Perry were bosom friends.  There was also one from Florida & Virginia who were much [pleased] with you & Tulula.  

       Mr. LeConte says your cough is very bad & annoys you very much.  Mr. Reed told me as we came down that Col. Brockmans daughter had a dreadful cough which continued for weeks & finally she coughed up a piece of charcoal which she had swallowed in cleaning her teeth.  Her cough then ceased.  The doctor thought she had consumption or bronchitis.  She was thrown into a fever ^ had to go to bed.  Dr. LeConte says he knew an instance of a man who had a cough for forty years & finally threw up a fish bone which had lodged in his throat.  Mr. Farrow who was present told me Mr. Bail[e]y at Laurens was affected with a cough for three years owing to something in his windpipe.  He finally coughed it up & was relieved.  You had better tell Dr. Gantt these things.  Mayby you have swallowed a fishbone or piece of charcoal or something else which is lodged in your throat or windpipe.  Tell Dr. Gantt to write us about your cough.
       
       You must write me as often as you can, & I will do the same whilst I am in Columbia & tell you all about the balls & parties, the girls & gentlemen.  But I am afraid your letters take up too much of your time.  Now [that] your school has commenced you will not have the same time to write.  Mrs. LeConte says Tulula regrets very much that she does not receive as many letters as Anna Perry doesthat you rece[ive]d onetwenty five.
       
       You must write me your next letter about your cough & tell me whether it is better or not & how it affects youwhen you first had it remember all about it.  I hope it has left you.  If it is owing to an ulcer in your throat it will get better soon.  The ulcer may be made by a fishbone or something of that kind.  
       
       I am writing in great haste as I go down to see Dr. & Mrs. LeConte immediately.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I send you enclosed a letter to the Patriot.  Do so as soon as you have read it.

	Col. Memminger has handed me three large bundles for you, which I will send by Wells, Thursday.  I suppose you know what they contain.

	We did nothing in the House today.  My bill about the College was read & referred.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & could get no room.  I have taken him into mine which has two beds in it.

	I saw Col. Frank Kayne today who enquired after you all.  I have seen none of the T except on the Bench.

	I hope to receive a letter from you, but the mail closes at six oclock, & I must put this letter in the office without hearing from home.

	I have not seen Mrs. LeConte today & I do not know whether she has heard from her daughter & Anna.

	I have no news to write you more than my letter to the Patriot contains.

	I was dining today at my usual table all alone & invited Col. Memminger to take a seat with me.  Directly afterwards Yeadon came & took his usual seat by me.  I think these two gentlemen were very much embarrassed as I suppose they have not spoken since last session.  We all three conversed very pleasantly after the ice was broken.

My dear Daughter

	I wrote you the other day & gave you all the news I could.  Since writing you Mrs. LeConte has read me portions of her daughters letters in which she speaks most affectionately of you.  Miss Tulula writes a sweet letter.  Her description of the school, going to church, & the running off of the schoolgirl from Syracuse, was very amusing.  I was charmed with her letters, so sprightly, lively and affectionate.  I hope you will cultivate the intimacy which exists between you.

	I sit at the same table with Professor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte whilst taking my meals & we have a great deal  of talk about you & Tulula.  I enquire every mail of Mrs. LeConte if she has heard from her daughter.  I like Dr. LeConte & Mrs. LeConte very much.  Col. Memminger & Mr. Yeadon sit with us & we have a great deal of pleasant conversation.  I wish you & Tulula could be with us to enjoy it.

	At present we have no ladies here, but they are coming in next week, & we shall then have crowds of them.  Mrs. Allston & her daughter will be here in a few days, & Mrs. Chesnut will come tomorrow or the next day.  When the ladies come here I shall have something to write you.

	I saw Buist this evening who is in college.  He has grown fat & looks much better.  I suppose he fares better than he did at his uncles in Greenville.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie last night.  He says he has not heard from you for two or three weeks.  You ought to write to him & Frank occasionally & not so often to Ginny & Mary Mauldin & the girls at Greenville.  Willie says he went to Boston the other day & had his likeness taken for ten cents.  He says if Frank was there he could have his likeness taken so cheap that he might afford to furnish all the girls who have requested his likeness.  I wrote to Willie that Frank said so many girls had asked for his likeness that it would break him.

	Mr. Elford is now in my room & talking to me.  He came here from Charleston & had no room.  I have two beds in my room, & I have given one to him.  This makes it more pleasant for me.  Dr. LeConte has just sent me his Essay or Lecture on solar heat which I will read after I finish this letter.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Fannie this evening.  She said she had just written you a long letter.  I am afraid we all write you such long letters that you hardly have time to read them.  But I shall be so busy after this week, that I shall not have time to write you long letters.

	Give my love to Tulula & tell her I have been very much impressed in her favor from her letters, & that I will give her choice of Frank or Willie.  You must also present my respects to your Virginia & Florida friends whose moms I do not remember.  I wrote to Frank to be sure & send his likeness to your Florida friend.  Has he done so?

	I hope your cough is better.  Write me about it & what Dr. Gantt thinks of it.  

	Your affectionate Father.  Give my respects to the Bishop and all your teachers.  B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night but did not have time to write you.  I sent your bundles by Wells.  I rece[ive]d also last night a letter from Anna & one from Frank which I enclose to you.  I am glad you have determined to play Editor for me in noticeing  Bradfords articles.  I enclose you my letter to the Patriot which will give you all the news I have.

	I am now writing to you after breakfast. & shall not have time to write this evening as I am invited to dine with Governor Allston at five oclock.  Last night after returning from the college the Governor invited Mrs. LeConte & the Professor & Petigru, Memminger & myself to supper & to take a glass of champaign.  We spent a very pleasant time till twelve oclock.  Mrs. LeConte had rece[ive]d a letter from Lula yesterday.  I read Annas Letter to Elford who is rooming with me.  He said President Duncan said Anna & Mary Mauldin were as thoroughly educated as any girls in America so far as they had gone.  

	I now have to go & meet a committee for Col. Memminger who has had to go down to the College.  I must also go & see Col. Pickens.  Col. Simpkins has just been to see me.  I saw all thelast night.  They seemed very cordial notwithstanding my Bill in the Legislature to cut off all their heads
as Judge ONeall remarked in his speech last night.  I replied to him & made a good speech & carried the Board with me in the election of President with the help of Petigtu & Dawkins.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & thank you for it.  I have to go down to meet the Board of Trustees in a few minutes & shall probably not return before midnight.  I is now six oclock & I have just had dinner & read my paper & lettersone from your uncle Arthur about the Senatorial election.  He will serve if elected but is no candidate.   I see my last letter to the Patriot was crowded out.  It will do very well for next week.

	I argued the case of Hoke & McCallister today in court.  The argument will be finished on Monday.  We had one ballot for U, States Senator.  Hammond rece[ive]d 61Pickens 40Chesnut 23Preston 18Rhett 6 & Chancellor Dargan 1.  The run of Hammond is extraordinary.  But he cannot be elected.  The contest will be between Pickens & Chesnut & perhaps Chesnut may be elected.

	I saw General Martin this evening & Willie Martin who is a stout good looking boy.  The General said he would send me Susans bundle.  I will send it to you.

	I have nothing to write you.  I enclosed a long letter to you this morning for the Patriot & will write you one tomorrow.

	In regard to the abuse of me in South Carolina it has never come from the gentlemen of the state.  I do not believe there is at this time a distinguished man in the state who does not more cordially respect & esteem me.  Such is their deportment towards me.  I shall leave a reputation for my children which they may be proud of & which shall not injure theirat all.  My reputation will grow brighter after my decease.  It is my purpose to make a publication of my writings with a view of doing justice to my memory hereafter.

	I have not heard from Anna, Frank or Willie since I wrote you.

	I rece[ive]d a letter today from Col. W.C. Preston on the subject of the college & communicating important information & argument for me when the question comes up.

	I send you enclosed a very imperfect & brief sketch of the debate on that subject the other day.

	I wish to see you all very much & next Saturday I shall return home if possible as Monday evening will be commencement.  I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now almost eight oclock in the night& I have to meet a caucus in Col. Memmingers room on the bank question in a few minutes.  I have just quit the Governors dinner table where I spent a very pleasant evening with a party of gentlemen.  Col. Frank Pickens, Col. Isaac Hayne & Captain Cunningham were present with others.  I saw Captain Cunningham this morning.  He says Mrs. Cunningham & Pamela are in Charleston & very well.  Pamela is preparing to go on to Richmond about the Mount Vernon Association.  He says she would be perfectly well but for her excitement.  I said that was what kept her up.  The Captain has become quite garrulous & I thought simple in his conversation.  He is a bore.  He said he was a great Rhett manthat I and Rhett were the only consistent politicians in the state.  He had often said so.

	Hamlin Beattie has just been to my room & offered to carry a letter or anything else.  Consequently I write this letter.  Col. Hayne sat next to me at the table & was very cordial.  General Martin is living here with his family, but Hayne said he had not found out where he was.  I will enquire of Martin about having [a] bundle tomorrow & send it by Wells.

	I made a speech today in the House on the College.  But the question came up most unexpectedly & the debate will be resumed when my Bill comes up.  Col. Memminger spoke in reply & Col. Boylston & General McGowan also.

	I send your letter this evening & have just read it.  The story you mention about Gibson is very singular.

	Mrs. Chesnut & Judge Withers daughter are now at this Hotel, but I have not seen them.  After leaving the Governors dinner table I went to the supper room, but they had all gone but Mrs. LeConte.

	We had several elections today.  You can cut out the Editorials & send Anna as she desires to see them, or such of those as you think will interest her.  I will write to her in the morning.

	I must now bid you good night.  Kiss the children.  Tell Fannie I will write to her soon.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. In regard to my legal opinion nothing could be done with Perry as he did not break into the House.

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you the other day & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother with one I had recei[ve]d from Anna.

	I am delighted to hear you continue pleased with your school & have recei]ve]d no more demerits.  I hope you will be particular in that respect.  Also you must study hard & learn your lessons well & take a high stand in your class.  Your last report was pretty good, but I hope the next will be better.

	You must tell Bradford that I thank him for the paper sent me & when I return home I will notice it.  In my absence your mother wrote a paragraph acknowledging the receipt of it.  This is her first editorial.    

.

		We have elected Judge Longstreet of Georgia President of the South Carolina College.  He has been President of the Mississippi University.  The College is doing very well now.  There are 170 students.  Mr. [Charles] Venable of Virginia has been elected to the chair of Mathematics.

	Your mother concluded it was not worthwhile to send you a box of books & bed quilts, as you could purchase blankets and books for what the box would cost by Adams Express.  If you study hard after mustering with your musket & drawing theyou will not have much time to read miscellaneous books.  But when Willie comes on we may send you something.

	I shall certainly go & see you next summer before you start on your cruise, & perhaps your mother & some of the children may go with me.  

	As you receive the Patriot, you will see in my published letters all the news of the Legislature & Columbia.

	I shall be glad to see your likeness.  Willie says he had his taken the other day in Boston for ten cents, & that if you were there you might supply all your pretty girls who asked you for it, without breaking you.  Have you given your likeness to any of them yet?

	I am glad your mother sent you Fannies & I think the students in saying it is much prettier than you.  Fannie is one of the prettiest little girls I ever saw &is very smart.  She is improving very fast.

	I saw General Martin the other day & his son Willie who has grown very much, and he is a fine looking boy.

	You must write to me as often as you can & remember to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You must also present my respects to Captain Blake when you call to see him.  Give my love to your roommate & friend Bradford.

	This is Sunday & I have been all the morning writing letters.  It is the only leisure day I have.   Between the Courts & the Legislature & the College I am worked hard & kept very busy.  I write to your mother every day & also to the Patriot every day.

	I read a letter from your mother last night.  They are all well.  I wrote to Anna last week & have just written a letter to her today.  She is very much pleased with Lula LeConte who is at school with her & who is the daughter of Professor LeConte of the South Carolina College.  I told her to tell Lula that I would give her choice of you or Willie.  But as she is about your age I expect she will prefer Willie to waiting for you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday & therefore a leisure day with me.  Dr. LeConte gave me an invitation to go with him & Mrs. LeConte to church, but I declined on the ground that I had to write to you, your mother, Willie & Frank.  I also have to write for the Patriot & letters to others.

	I rece[ive]d your letter the other day addressed to me in Columbia & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother.  You do not know how much satisfaction it gives me to hear you are pleased with your school, that you have entered a high class and are diligently pursuing your studies.  I knew you would be satisfied as soon as your school commenced & you had something else to think about than home sweet home & the dear friends at home.

	The only thing that mars my happiness now is your cough.  I hope it is better.  It must be owing to some exin your throat, or may be to some piece of fishbone lodged in it.  I am sure it cannot be any defect in your lungs.  By no means have your pallate cut.  Dr. Geddings says this is altogether barbarous &.  He says that allum pounded very fine & taken on your finger & placed on the palate is much better.  You can try this remedy & watch its effect.  You must write me about your cough in your next letter.

	I have not rece[ive]d any letters from Willie addressed to me in Columbia, but one forwarded from Greenville in which he says he has not heard from you for a long time.  You had better write him again.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Frank three days since.  Her is well & doing well.  So is Willie.

       There are no ladies in Columbia yet.  The commencement is one week later this year than usual.  Mrs. Chesnut & Miss Withers were here last week & went on the Charleston I expect & will return this week.  Col. Chesnut is a prominent candidate for United States Senator in place of Judge Butler.  We have had two ballotings & no election.  Governor Hammond is ahead & Col. Pickens next.  I am for Pickens & hope he may be elected.  
       
       Last night at the supper table Col. Carn of Walterborough told Mrs. LeConte & myself that his wife made you acquaintance here some years ago & fell in love with you that you were such a charming sweet little girl.  He said too that Mrs. Carn admired me so much that it excited his jealousy a little.  
       
       Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much of the Greenville news that I have nothing to tell.  I suppose she has told you of the marriage of Miss Bolling, and the death of young Lattimore a student in the Furman University.
       
       It is rumored here that Col. Wade Hampton Jr. is to be married to Miss McDuffie during the month of December.  His first wife was a sister of Col. Prestons & a most beautiful lady.  The colonel is young & handsome & rich, amiable & gentlemanly & is a good match for Miss McDuffie smart, pretty & rich.  I hope they may get married whilst I am here & invite me to the wedding or.
       
       I dined with Governor Allston the other day & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mrs. Allston & his daughter will be here next week.    His son is here who was an officer in the army & a graduate of West Point.  He is a clever young man.  
       
       We have just had a meeting of the Board of Trustees & elected Judge Longstreet President of the College.  He was once President of the Mississippi University.  He is the author of Georgia Scenes& a man of great humour & considerable literary attainments.  Mrs. LeConte is very much pleased at his election.  The other Professors were all reelected except Pelham.

	I have just come up from dinner & the clock has just struck two.  Whilst at dinner with Dr. & Mrs. LeConte, Col. Memminger Yeadon & myself, John Cunningham came & took a seat at out table.  In speaking of the Senatorial election he said he would go honestly against any man who was my candidate.  I replied I thought there was very little honesty in abandoning a mans principles or friends because anyone expressed them.  Some other conversation ensured & I told him that he himself was once a union man & his father alsothat I was still where they had left me & gone over to the enemy.  He is the personification of an evil spirit.  I got through with dinner as soon as possible & left the table to get rid of his vile presence.

	At the table, Mrs. LeConte said to Yeadon, sitting by my side, that he was not himself today.  He replied, pointing to me, I am then madam beside myself.  That said Cunningham is the most perfect truth you ever uttered.  I hope Cunningham will not give us the pleasure of his company any day.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & enclosed I send you a ten dollar Bill to send Miss Hill.  General Martin has sent a large bundle for Susan which I will send Tuesday by Wells,

	I have no news to write you except what is contained in the two letters sent you for the Patriot.  Mr. Elford returned home Saturday morning, & will return to Columbia Tuesday.  If you have any letters from the children which would interest me you can send them by him.

	Instead of going to church today with Mr. & Mrs. LeConte as they requested me, I have been writing all day.

	Major Wright came to my room last night & left with me a brief in the case of Bonys& delivered a message from Mr. Robert Maxwell that he wanted me to argue the case in the court of appeals & he would be responsible for my fees in the case.  This is good news, for I thought it doubtful, whether I should get anything out [of]  Bonys & Mather.

	I thank you  for your Editorial about the paper rece[ive]d from Bradford.  It was your first, & you have done so well that I believe I shall take you as a partner. 	

	I made a good speech last night before the committee on my Bill for reorganizing the college, and I think I carried the committee in favor of it.

	I am sorry your mother is so much worried about her apprehension of her house being broken open again.  I do not think there is any danger.  It would have been as well for them not to have proceeded at all against Perry.

	I am very much afraid Hammond will be elected to the Senate.  All the prominent men in the Legislature are against him.  Col. Hampton, Col. Preston, the speaker & President, Col. Memminger, Yeadon, Col. Means, Col. Irby, General McGowan, Col. Marshall, McCready, Col. Dudl[e]y & in fact all the gentlemen.  But the hoi pelloi are for him.  Petigru was very severe on some of them the other day.

	I a very wiling that Wiley & Charles should cut & have your mother wood as long as she desires.  Wiley must see about getting corn & fodder from Turner or someone else when it gives out.

	I shall endeavour to run home Saturday & return Tuesday.  Nothing will be done in the Legislature [on] Monday which is college commencement.  But the courts may detain me.

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Dear Anna

	I was disappointed in not receiving a letter from you on Saturday, the day on which I usually hear from you.  But I will write you a few lines, as you say you want me to write you once a week whether I hear from you once a week or not.

	My letter will have to be short for a very obvious reason, which is, I havent anything to write about.
	I have been enjoying the luxury of a holiday for a few days past, in consequence of this last week being Thanksgiving week.  Thanksgiving day is a great day in this part of the country, and is as much thought of as Christmas is among us.

	I received a letter from Pa the other day.  He is now in Columbia.  He had a run off as he went down but no one was injured.  But I expect he has written to you since he has been in Columbia.  This will be the first Commencement that I have not attended in Columbia for a good many years.  No doubt there will be as large a crowd as usual at it.

	I went yesterday to church three times in Boston, which shows how religious one will be when he is not compelled to attend Church.  In the morning I went to hear an Abolition preacher, but he didnt touch much on politics.  After dinner I went to hear a man who pretended to be in a trance, and to preach while in that state.  He merely shut his eyes, and preached away.  He was a spiritualist, and preached on spiritualism.  He also delivered a poem, pretending to be influenced by the spirit of an Italian poet.  It was all humbug, but no doubt would have delighted Gen. Thompson as he believes so strongly in Spiritualism.

	I went to see Mr. Winthrop the other night, which I think will be the last of my visiting.

	I will close this letter for want of room and words.  You must write to me as regularly as possible.  If I were you I would drop some of my correspondents.  Your affectionate brother, W.H. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter enclosing two of Franks.  This has been a day of great excitement here in the election of United States Senator.  Governor Hammond was elected by twenty five votes over Col. Pickens.  There was Great exullation on the part of his friends.  I do not feel mortified very much.  I feel sure that he will be a supporter of the administration & will do very well in the Senate.

	Governor Manning & myself went to call on Pickens & were the first to tell him the news.  He bore his defeat very well & said to me he never would forget my friendship & support.  I think Manning might have been elected.  But it is all over now & you know I always make the best of misfortunes.  I do all I can to prevent them & then submit quietly.

	My idea is to elevate & not lower the standard of education in the South Carolina College.  This I will do by mak[ing] it a university.  They who wish can take a full course.  After graduating at Charleston, Spartanburg, Greenville & Abbeville the students can then go & finish at Columbia.

	In regard to my opinion	about Perry it is correct & the court who tried him were wrong.  But it is my will to make him quit the state.

	I am truly sorry to hear of Spartan Goodletts illness.  Wells tells me he cannot live.  Poor fellowcut off in the prime of life, after all his trials & struggles against poverty & obscurity.

	Col. Memminger has just been in my room to talk about Hammonds election.  He regrets it very much.  I told him it was owing to the fanaticism of slavery.  Hammond had written ably on that subject, & every fool in the state thought his negro peoplein danger & Hammond the Man to defend it.

	I saw old Mr. McBee this evening as I & Governor Manning were going to see Col. Pickens.  The old man says nothing new has occur[r]ed in Greenville.  I saw Wells just now & he promised to take Susans bundle.

	George Wells & Ds son are both admitted into the military school here.  I see that E.D. Earle & B.T. Earle are admitted as well as pay scholars from Greenville.  Who are they.  Perhaps Elias D. Earles sons.  Westmorelands son is also admitted as a pay scholar.

	I have just come up from the supper table where I met Mrs. Herndon the old colonel.  Mrs. Herndon says she is going to send her daughter to Bishop Davis school next summer.  She & the colonel enquired about you & all the children.  

	Col. Carn told me & Mrs. LeConte the other evening, that his wife had fallen in love with Anna. Two years agothat she was a devoted reader of my paper & so much an admirer of me that it had excited a little his jealousy. Col. Carn is from Walterborough you remember.

	The ladies are beginning to come in.  Mrs. Garlington is hereMrs. Chesnut &c.  But Mrs. Chesnut does not come to the table.  I have seen nothing of her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Report of the Committee on Bursary

	The Committee to whom was referred the letter of Professor Williams & the Memorial of the Students of the College on the subject of the Bursary have considered the same and beg leave to

Report

In the opinion of a majority of the Committee it would be impoliti  at this time, to break up the Commons, as suggested by the Memorial of the Students.  In order to satisfy themselves as to the fare in the Stewards Hall, the undersigned members of the Committee, without giving notice of their intention, went to the Commons last Saturday & dined there with the students.  They found the Hall, the tables & everything appertaining to them neat & cleanly.  The food was good & well cooked consisting of boiled mutton, roast beef, good bread & butter, sweet potatoes & rice, pickles &c.  The rice was better cooked, & the mutton sweeter & better prepared than any your Committee have tasted in the Hotels of Columbia.

	There was not the same variety on the table which one will meet at the Hotels but the food was better prepared.  In order to give a greater variety the Committee recommended that the board be increased to three dollars per week.  Everything is higher now, than it was some years since, when the rates were reduced to two dollars & fifty cents per week.

	In a conversation which the undersigned members of the Committee had with Colonel Gladden the Bursar, they were assured that he never purchased any meats in the market except the best.  He may have been occasionally mistaken in his selections. 

	Your Committee have no idea that the proposed increase in the rates of boarding will enable the Bursar to give entire satisfaction.  And perhaps ten dollars per week would not.  Your Committee are apprehensive that the Students have a prejudice against the system of boarding in Commons and that they entertain a hope of breaking it up by their continued opposition to it.  Whether this hope is encouraged, by the approval of the Professors, & any action of the Board of Trustees, there never will be anything but discontent on the part of the Students with the Commons.

	A majority of the Committee think it would not be in good faith to Colonel Gladden to break up the Commons without giving him due notice of the same.  If permitted to board in town, it is greatly to be feared that the Students would be under less restraint & more liable to go astray.  As to any improvement or deportment in their manners or deportment by boarding at private houses or hotels. Your Committee would state, that they never saw young gentlemen act with more propriety at any table whilst taking their meals.

	All of which is necessarily submitted.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter and one from Anna which I will send you.  I have to meet the Board of Trustees tonight & will write you a line before I go down.

	I have nothing special to write you except that I have just seen Alston Kayne who is on his way to Charleston with Mrs. Hayne & children.  He tells me Mrs. Hayne will increase his family, with good luck, in ten weeks.  He seems well pleased with Pendleton--says his mother spent the summer with him & her health is much improved.  He tried to get in at this Hotel, but could not.  He went to the American.  He looks rather rusticated , but is joyous & happy.  He enquired after all of you kindly & said he never heard of your mothers illness till recently.  He says he had made a fine crop.  Mr. Sharpes family have been sick.  He seemed glad that your uncle Arthur was not put in nomination for the Senate.  He expressed himself very much gratified too of the election of Hammond.  He has formed a very high estimate of Hammonds talent.

	Mrs. LeConte told me just now that she had just rece[ive]d a letter from her daughter in which she speaks of Annas saying a great deal about me & expressing her wish to be with me.  

	I see Tench Carson is here going up in the morning.  Wells tells me Spartan Goodlett is beyond all hopes of recovering.  Campbell is down here & says he will stay till after commencement.

	I was in court today pretty much all day waiting for my cases in Law, but they were not reached.  I shall be there tomorrow too.  The Bank question is being discussed in the House.  Gregg, Whaley, [James M.] Gadberry & [James J.] McCarter made speeches.  McCrady has the floor for tomorrow, but sent word by Memminger that he would yield it to me.  I do not care to speak.  Nothing can be done with the Banks.  They are more powerful than the Legislature.

	Governor Manning had a long talk with [me] today about establishing a new Paper in Charleston to advocate our principles.  It has been determined on, & will be in opposition to the Charleston Mercury.

	I and John Cunningham get on very well together now.  He seems quite friendly and I supposed intended nothing but a little playful humor in his remarks to me on Sunday.  

	I was in conversation with a parcel of Hammond men today & told them that theirwas not so great as Hammond was with me in giving the election of Electors to the people with me in opposing the opening of the slave trade, indifferent about a national convention, and I had no doubt would be an administration man & act with the Democratic party.

	I wish to see you & the children very much, & it will be a great pleasure to be with you a day.  I shall go home on Saturday as a great many of the members will do, & return Monday.  So I shall not be at the college commencement.  My visit home too will be an event in the routine of business here.  We will then talk over matters & things in general.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have been in court all day arguing the case of Bonys & Sloan from Anderson & am very tired.  I have to conclude my argument tomorrow, & then all of my cases in the law court of appeals will be over.  Next week same term my equity cases will come on.  I think I shall get a new trial in Bonys & Mather & then a good fee,

	I shall go home Saturday & return Monday.  This therefore is the last letter I will write you till I see you.  I have just rece[ive]d Fannies letter & was glad to hear from you.  

	Mrs. LeConte proposed today at dinner that I should let Anna go with her sister Miss Graham to Philadelphia & consult some eminent Physician who makes the throat & lungs his peculiar study & see what is the matter with her.  I have just written to Bishop Doane to let her go.  Mis Graham will go over next Friday & take Anna & Lula to Philadelphia.  Mrs. LeConte is now writing to her sister & to the Bishop.  They will stay till Monday & return to Burlington.  This will be some satisfaction to us to know what does cause her cough.

	Governor Means told me a most horrible thing on John Cunningham last night.  He was indicted last court, the other day in Charleston for a rape on an Irish girl whom Mrs. Cunningham had sewing for her.  He went to settle with the woman & abused her.  She took out a warrant & the attorney general handed out an Indictment.  Eleven of the Jury were for finding a true Bill, but it required a twelve jurors, & so he was discharged.  She was a great big fat girl & it was said ought to have been strong enough to have defended herself.  But one more Juror would have put the gentleman on his trial for his life & death!   I suppose he does not deny having intercourse with her, & that he used some force, but she did not tell of it soon enough or it might have taken his neck.  What a villain he is.  What a derangement he seems to have on that subject.  He looks as imprudent as if nothing had ever happened. I will tell you more about it when I see you & in the meantime burn this letter for fear it may fall into the hands of the children or someone years after this.  And I would not like it known that I had written such a thing to you.

	I must now conclude my letter.  How happy I am at the idea of seeing you & the children Saturday evening.  What a joyous meeting it will be.  Kiss the children for me.  Oh how I long to kiss you all myself & how the little fellowsaround me once more.  Col. Irby goes up with me as far as Laurens & a great many of the members will go home to avoid the College Commencement.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Daughter

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & I have become alarmed about your cough.  Mrs. LeConte will write this evening to her sister Miss Graham to go over to Burlington & take you & Lula home with her to get some eminent Physician in Philadelphia. Who make[s] the throat & the lungs his exclusive study  to examine your throat & see what is the matter with you.  Mrs. LeConte says her sister will go after you on Friday & let you return Monday.  Saturday Major LeConte will send for a Physician to see you & have a full & perfect examination of the cause of your cough.  I shall then be better satisfied.  So you & Lula may prepare for a pleasant excursion to Philadelphia.

	I will write a letter & enclose it for the Bishop to let you go.  He must not refuse.  I sent your letter to your mother last night & I know it will distress her very much.

	They are all well at home & doing well.  I am going home day after tomorrow & return Monday.  I shall therefore not be at the commencement in College.  Already a good many ladies have come down to attend the commencement--Mrs. Herndon, Mrs. Garlington, Mrs. Chesnut, Miss Withers & others.

	I have just been arguing a case in court all day & have not been in the Legislature at al today.  They are discussing the Bank question.  I shall take no part in the debate.

	White of Abbeville took first, Rivers second and Keith of Pickens third honor.  But Keith felt that injustice had been done him & refused to accept the third honor.  He was suspended.  I saw young Buist who is teaching school in Barnwell.  He has grown a good deal.

	I heard from Frank last night & he is well.  He Gave his likeness to Alice Green & is going to have another taken to send his mother.

	I will now conclude my dear daughter & write a letter to the Bishop.  Give my love to Lula LeConte.  Tell her that her Father delivered a beautiful, able & most learned & scientific Inaugural last Tuesday night in the House of Representatives before a brilliant audience which drew further admiration from all who were present.  Her uncle will deliver his Inaugural next Tuesday night.

	I am happy my dear daughter to know you are satisfied & I hope your cough will soon be better.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I enclose you a letter of Annas, but have not time to write you.  I am very much distressed about Anna & shall write to her tomorrow to quit her studies.  It is likely that I will go on for her as soon as I hear from her Physician in Philadelphia.  

	I did not reach here the day I left home till eleven oclock in the night.  The up train ran off & left the cars on the road.  Today I was busy incase & they have decided not to do anything till the Alabama case is decided.  I will write to him tomorrow.  

	I have just returned from dinner with Mr. Speaker Simons & a pleasant company of gentlemen.  

	It is now twelve oclock.  I have just seen Mrs. LeConte &the Dr. who read me a portion of their daughters letter about Anna which is pretty much as Anna writes.  

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte leave in the morning for Savannah.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & the Bundle by Wells.

	It is expected that I will make a speech on the Bank question & perhaps I may tonight.

	The House is now full of ladies.  But I have not had time to make their acquaintance or even enquire who they are.  Mrs. Fair is here & Mr. Dr. Fair has returned.  Wallace Thompsons daughters are here.

	General Gadberry told me a good joke & a compliment paid me & Mrs. LeConte the other day.  Sitting together at the supper table this gentleman supposed we were husband & wife & remarked that we were the handsomest & finest looking couple he had ever seen in his life.  General Gadberry said he concurred & responded to the sentiment.  I told him if he had seen Mrs. Perry he would have thought we were still a finer looking couple.

	Mrs. LeConte went off today.  She remarked last night she had never seen me so much distressed as I was on hearing from Anna.  I could not sleep well & have been distressed all day.  I wrote to Anna this morning to quit her studies.  I hope the next letter may contain better news.  But I presume she had better return home.

	I hope your mother & Anne may like Center & take her.  It was a great bargain.  She is worth two or three hundred dollars.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was greatly distressed to hear of your feeble health.  You must suspend your studies till your health improves.  If you do not get better in the course of a week or two I will go for you & bring you home.

	I am anxious to hear what the doctor in Philadelphia says about your cough.  Write me all about what he says.  I should be glad if he would write me himself.

	I went home last Saturday & was actually on the road whilst you were writing to me.  I came back Tuesday & did not reach Columbia till near eleven oclock in the night.  We were delayed by the up train breaking down.

	They were all well at home.  But your mother has no doubt written to you all the news & I will not repeat it.

	Mrs. LeConte leave[s] here today for Georgia.  Mrs. LeConte read me portions of Lulas letter last night.  Give my love to Lula.

	The House has been crowded with young ladies.  But I was absent & have seen very little of them.  The Ball passed off very well says Mrs. LeConte.  The most pleasant & agreeable one they have had for years.  

	The Governors daughter is not here.  She is not very pretty but a sweet looking girl.  His son is not remarkable for his appearance.  Mrs. Chesnut is handsome.  I saw Miss Eliza Irby (that was) & her fat husband.  Yesterday we had quite a display of Ladies in the gallery.

	I dined last evening with the Speaker Col. Simons & met Governor Manning.  I also met a gentleman from Virginia who married Miss Manning Sm who was a great beauty but I suppose you never heard of her.  She went to school at Greenville and was born in Spartanburgh.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Dr. Gannts [Gantt] which made me moreabout Anna.  I have nothing to write you except what I have written to the Patriot.  I enclose you two sheets which you must take as a letter.

	I see Mrs. Brooks here on her way to Greenville.  She has been to see her daughter below.

	General Thompson & wife are here on their way to Greenville.  Charles Hammond is here on his return from Dr. Allens marriage.  Easl[e]y, Gantt & Jones went up Saturday.

	I cannot say when we will adjourn.  I am overrun with business in court & the Legislature.

	You need not trouble yourself about Willie & Lula.  Thomas said {word obscured] joke.  Nor need you think anything about what Lula says.  The girls are mischief making between her & Anna.  Tattlers are abominable.

	We are very quiet here now & all the ladies have gone.  Did you see or hear anything of Governor Swain.  

	I suppose your remark about Mrs. Thompson is a hint to me in not pressing you to come to Columbia with me.  Nothing would have given me more pleasure than to have had you here.  But you know you declined coming on account of Arthur.  Next Fall I will visit & bring you.

Dear Mama

	I received a letter from you yesterday; I also received the one containing Fannies Christmas present, for which I am very much obliged to her.  They came just in time, as I had lost one of mine.

	I wrote to Pa last Sunday, and directed to Columbia, but Im afraid he had left Columbia, before my letter reached there.  I received a letter from Anna the other day, written in Philadelphia.  She says that the Physician says she must go home, and she is going with Dr. John LeConte.  She says that she is going on the 31st of this month, so she will be at home not long after this letter reaches there.  I was very much surprised.  I had no idea that Anna was so unwell.  I am sorry of it, but will be glad to see her at home when I get there, and I hope that she will be well by that time.  I will write to her today, but I expect she will have left Philadelphia, the letter gets there.  I thought it was all humbug sending her off to school so far, from the first.

	In my last letter I told you that we were invited to Mr. Winthrops to dinner yesterday (Saturday).  Though I didnt at first intend to go, I had concluded to go, but it snowed so hard all day yesterday, that neither the Memmingers not myself could go.  I didnt care about going at first, and was glad that the snow made a good excuse for not going.

	We went last Tuesday night to hear an oration by Mr. Everett, and liked it very much.

	Today is Sunday.  The ground is covered with snow, and it is as cold as anything.  Day before yesterday was Christmas.  I hope that you have had a merry one.  I cant say that I have.  We had holiday that day, which was very acceptable.

	The time for going home is now approaching and you dont know [how] glad I am of it.  Being so far from home makes one value a visit home more.

	I will be all the way with the Memmingers now, on the way home, as I wont have to go by Annapolis.  I forgot, I wont be with them, as I will certainly go by Annapolis to see Frank; but I will be with them that far.  There are two students in our class from Baltimore, who will be with us that far.

	It is near dinner time, so I will close, as I will have to go to chapel this evening, and write to Anna too.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I received your last letter in due time.  I was rather surprised to see that you were in Philadelphia though Ma had told me that you were, perhaps going there.  But I was still more surprised, and sorry to learn that you were so unwell as to have to go home.  Though you have been telling me about your cough, I had no idea that it was as bad a one as it is.

	I will be glad to see you at home a good deal more so than at Burlington.  Of course I will ride with you.  

	I am not certain whether you will get this letter, for today is the 27th and you are going to leave Philadelphia on the 31st.   I wouldnt like to write a long letter to be sent to the dead-letter office.

	You will like Dr. John LeConte I expect, for he is a very clever man.  It is well that you have so good an opportunity to go home, for no doubt Pa would be busy.  I will reach home sooner as I wont have to go by Burlington.  I hope that when I get home I will find you perfectly well.

	It is only about three weeks now before the time for me to start home.  You may believe that I am glad of it.  

	As I dont know whether you will get this letter, I had better bring it to a close.

	Remember me to the girls & young ladies I should have said, when you get home.  Your affectionate brother, Willie

Dear Papa

	I have just received your letter this morning, in which you say that you have sent the money to Col. Memminger.  He will send it in shape of a draft or check, I suppose, for he has already sent his sons their money.  I suppose I will get it in a few days.  I will have to get it all in gold when I start home and as the banks have resumed specie-payment, I presume there will be no difficulty in that.  I will start from here next Wednesday or Thursday two weeks.  I dont know exactly which day yet.  I can sympathize with you, and Ma about Anna.  I havent heard from her this week, but I hope that she is well enough to be by this time on her way home.  She said that she was to start on the 30th, which was last Wednesday I believe.

	I will call on Judge Evans, and Col. Orr, if I can find them in Washington.  The Memmingers are going to stop a very short time in Washington.  They will be gone before I get back from Annapolis.  I havent heard from Frank in some time.  He owes me a letter.  I mentioned in my last that the reason We didnt go to Mr. Winthrops was that it snowed so hard.    The weather is very cold at present, at least cold enough for skating.

	I received a letter from Ma yesterday and one on Tuesday.  I will twice move before going starting home.  

	Christmas has come and gone, and so has New-years day.  We had holiday only on Christmas day.  Today is Saturday.  I generally write on Sunday, so I expect that you will get this letter a day sooner than usual.  

	I hope that you have got better from your cold by this time.  I am much obliged to Fannie for the book-mark that she sent me.  

	I will now close.  Give my love to Ma and all.  I hope soon to have the pleasure of being with you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I met Anna here last night, & we go up to Greenville in the morning.  She came from Philadelphia with Miss Graham to Washington & from there with Dr. John LeConte to this place.  He health is better & I hope she may soon recover.  She stood the journey very well & regrets very much not seeing you.  She says she wrote you to meet her at the Annapolis Junction, and is afraid there was some mistake.  But I suppose you could not get permission to leave your school.

	I left them all well at home.  It is not late in the night & I have been writing letters to various persons.

	If you can get permission go on with Willie to Washington & stay a day or two.  But I suppose you cannot & perhaps ought not leave your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received Captain Blakes Report of your studies & conduct last night which mortified your mother & myself very much.

	You have sixteen demerits in December!  What are they for?  Let me know.  The first month you had only two & the second month six.  Now you have sixteen!  This is advancing most rapidly in bad conduct.  I thought the longer you staid, the less your demerits would be.  Young Daly only had ten in one whole year at the military school in Charleston.  

	But in your studies too, you have gradually fallen off.  In Arithmetic you have fallen from 68 to 89, in Geography from 26 to 57, & in Grammar from 26 to 39!  This is too bad.  You must study harder.  If you love your father & mother who love you so much, be a good boy & study hard.  Do not spend your time idly.  Keep to your books constantly & be sure you have got every lesson well.  Get Mr. Bradford to instruct you in your lessons.

	You must remember my son, that your happiness & success in life depends on your good behavior, industry & hard study.  If you are dismissed from the school you are a disgraced & ruined boy.  I have no property to give you & you have to make your fortune.  By great exertions & good luck I have placed you at a school where you may do well & succeed in life.  Turn over a new leaf & resolve to do better.  What would the people of Greenville say to you coming home in disgrace, dismissed from school.

	I was pleased with your letter to Anna & made an extract from it for the Patriot.  The people of Greenville have a high opinion of you as a good & clever boy & you must not disap[p]oint them.

	I hope you will write back to me, how it is you have got so many demerits, & have fallen off in your studies.  I hope too that you will write that you intend to do better this month & every month.  You do not know with how much interest er look forward to your Reports every month.  

	I suppose Willie will be with you about the time you receive this letter.  If he keeps you from your studies he had better not stay more than one day,

	We will come on & see you in June.  And it will be such a pleasure to find you doing well.  Anna thinks she is improving.  But she looks pale & has a bad cough.  All the rest are well.

	Write soon to your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Dear Mama

	I am not at Mrs. Greens in the great city of Annapolis.  I arrived here last night.  I started from Cambridge last Wednesday evening and ought to have got here Thursday evening, but when I got to New-York I found that I could only get my trunks checked to Washington or Baltimore.  So I concluded to stay all night in Baltimore, and came on here yesterday morning by the 10 oclock train.  But when I got to the depot with my trunks, I found that the train didnt connect with thew Annapolis train, and that I would have to wait for the 5 oclock train.  So I just checked my trunks on to Washington, and came down here without any baggage.

	I went to see Frank last night after I got here.  He looked better than I ever saw him, and seems very well pleased with the School.  He took dinner with me today, and I will go to see him again after supper.  Tomorrow evening he will come to see me and go to Church with me.  I will leave here day after tomorrow morning (Monday) for Washington.  I am sorry and ashamed to say I forgot and left those letters of introduction, that Pa gave me, in my room at Cambridge.  I will call on Col. Orr at any rate.  I shall in all probability leave Washington Tuesday evening, and get home Thursday night

	No train leaves this place tomorrow, so this letter will not start before I do.

	I hope you are all well and that I shall soon see you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & were glad you were well & expecting to see Willie.  I suppose he is with you today & will go to Washington tomorrow, Monday.

	We are sorry to learn that you have already got six demerits for this month.  You can avoid getting demerits if you will try.  And you should always be on your guard against doing anything that will bring them.  I hope you will now resolve to avoid all for the future. & study hard.  You cannot succeed unless you resolve to study hard & be a good boy.

	Edward B wrote me a letter the other day to get Col. Orr to obtain for him an appointment at West Point.  I have written to Col. Orr for him.  

	Anna is about the same & looks badly.  She rode on horseback once last week & will ride again when the weather is good.

	All the rest of the family are well.  Hext is going to school & Hayne is going with him, but not to study.  Arthur looks very well & is a fine little fellow.  Fanny is growing very tall.  Your grandmother & family are all well.  Susans children are going to school.

	It is said Col. Orr will not be a candidate again for Congress.  Col. [John Durant] Ashmore of Anderson is here electioneering for his place.  Col. Farrow of Spartanburgh & Col. Jones are also candidates.  I expect Col. Dawkins will not be a candidate.

	Give my respects to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & tell your chum Mr. Bradford that he must see that you study your lessons well.

	We look forward to your letters with great interest & would be glad to see you with Willie & have you all at home once more.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We have not heard from you except through Willie for eight or ten days.  Last week we received a letter from Willie in Annapolis stating that you were looking better than he ever saw you, that you had dined with him that day & were to go to church with him the next day.  He stated too that you were well pleased with your school.

	Willie wrote that he would leave the Monday following for Washington & be at home the same week.  But we have not heard from him since.  I went to the depot to meet him Friday & Saturday.  I suppose he will be here tomorrow evening, Monday.  I thought he would stay in Washington longer than he expected.  I hope he went to see Col. Orr, Judge Evans, and Governor Hammond.

	We are very anxious to hear from you & hope to receive a letter tomorrow.  You must write once a week & oftener if you have time.  But do not let your writing or anything else interfere with your studies & duties in the Academy.  Think of nothing but your studies & duties.  You ought to try & learn fast & keep as high up in your Class as you possibly can.  Try & get higher & higher every month.  Your success in life & your happiness in life depend on your good conduct & hard study at this time.  Remember howgraduate & what a disgrace it would be for you to be dismissed.  

	We are all well except Anna.  She still looks badly & has a bad cough.  We are very much distressed about her, but have hopes of her recovery.  She is taking medicines which Dr. Jackson sent her from Philadelphia.  She rides out when the weather is good.  But she has only rode once on horseback.  She has been nowhere except to your grandmothers since her return.  A great many of the girls have been to see her.

	Fannie is growing very tall & will commence her school studies next week.  Hext & Hayne are going to Miss Powell.  But Hayne only goes for company.  He does not learn anything.  Arthur has grown fat & rosy & looks very well.  He is still nursing & very passionate like all of my children.

	The servants are all well.  Old Charles got married last night to his old wife with whom he had been living for the last twenty years.  They were never married before, & Baylis persuaded him that he ought to be married.  He had a large party & all the servants went out to Dea.

	The Horses are all looking very well.  Tom Thumb is suffering for exercise.  How he would like to have you ride him.

	The schools commence here next Wednesday & the Boys are beginning to come in.  They expect a large number in the Furman College.

	The weather has been very mild all this winter.  We have had no ice or snow but a great deal of rain.

	Write us soon & all about your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & were glad to hear you were now going to study hard.  But we were very much mortified to hear you would be lower this last month than you had been.  This is too bad & you must study.  You say you do not wish to leave the navy.  Why do you not study hard.  I do not know what will become of you if you are dismissed.  My dear son I entreat you by the love you have for your mother & myself to turn over a new leaf & make it a point of honor to learn well your lessons & perform every duty in your school.  

	If you will only make progress in your studies I will send you money or anything else.  But not till you do so.  Let your report for February be good.

	Willie came last Monday.  He will go back the last of this month & stop & see you again.  We will send some things by him to you.

	We are all well but Anna.  She is about the same.

	I am going to ride out & must stop.  Your mother will write you in a few days.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	Thus is Sunday & Valentines Day.  The whole face of the earth is covered with snow & the trees with ice.  We never before had so destructive a sleet.  The shade trees are all broken down.  The large oaks in thew yard are stripped of their limbs.  The house tops are covered with broken branches of trees.  The cedars are ruined.  Now the ice is falling off the trees & there is a constant noise.  

	Did you receive any Valentines?  Anna got two very pretty ones last night & threw one into the fire without letting us see it!

	We have all been bound for the last two days in consequence of the snow & sleet.  No one went to church today.  The streets are impassable.    But the weather is not so cold as one would suppose.

	I write to you today by request of your mother, but have nothing to tell you.  Your letter was rece[ive]d last night & you must write all about your examination.  I hope you will do better hereafter.

	Willie will return the last of this month.  You mother will send you some shirts, your Indian cap, & slippers.

	Tim, whom I once owned, was here just now & asked to see your likeness.  He says it does not look as well as you do.  He thought too that Willie did not look well.

	Anna seems better, but looks badly.  All the rest of the children are well.  Mary & Charlotte are sick.  Monarch threw Willie into the river yesterday, but did not hurt him, except a good ducking.  The horses all look well.

	You ought to go & see the Legislature in Sessiongo up some day.  It is something to remember.

	You must keep all your letters to read years hence when your mother & I have passed away.  

	We would like to see you very much.  But dont want to see you dismissed.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I recd your letter last night &was glad to hear you did well at your examination, & that you were now going to study hard.  This you must do, for you have been falling off, in numbers ever since your first Report.  The last is the worst of all.  Let your next Report be better & every other still better.  How much pleased we shall be at it.  I know you love your Father & Mother, & we had a hard struggle to get your situation for you.  Do remember this.  Hold on to it as you would your life, & rise with your class.  How dreadful it would be for you to be sent home or turned back.  Keep out of idle company & when at your book study do not idle away your time with your book before you.

	We had all like to have been burnt up just now.  Marys room caught fire.  One of her children caused it.  Her bed is burnt up.

	Anna is not so well & gets weaker.  I am very uneasy, and much distressed about her.  She looks very pale & is very weak.  A good deal of her time she has to be in bed.  The rest are all well.

	Willie will start back next Friday & be in Annapolis Monday or Tuesday evening.  He will carry you some clothes.

	Today the Baptist church is dedicated.  Tomorrow the military companies parade & have a ball.

	I had seen an account of your fire & was very sorry to hear of the old church being burnt.

	You must give my love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & my respects to Captain Blake.

	Hamlin Beatty [Beattie] & Sally Cleveland are to be married in April.  I have no other news to tell you.  MissMcBee was very much pleased with your letter in the Patriot.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We received no letters from you last week.  This we regret very much.  You ought to write once every week.  I hope however to receive a letter from you Monday night.  This is Sunday & I write you every Sunday.  But hereafter I shall be on the circuit & may not write you for two or three weeks.

	I suppose you have seen Willie & received your trunk of clothes & cake.  He left here yesterday & expected to visit Annapolis Monday or Tuesday.  He will tell you all the news from home.  But he is not, however, much of a news monger.  

	Your mother says you must not let your cake get you any demerits.  She is afraid that you will have visitors at unreasonable hours.

	We received your drawings last week & all thought them very good indeed.  You have a talent for drawing but you must not let it occupy too much of your time.  Do not neglect your other studies.

	I am very anxious to go on & see you immediately after my circuits are over the last of April.  If I can I will do so & return to the court of appeals in May.

	Anna is about the same.  She does not seem to improve any.  Some times better & then worse.  I have great fears about her health.  All the rest are well.  Hext & Hayne are going to school to Miss Powell.  Fannie goes to the Academy or Female College.

	Your mother will write you in a day or two and tell you all the news.  I have none.

	Another month has now passed by & we shall soon receive another report as to your progress & deportment.  I hope it will be gratifying.  You do not [know] how much we all love you, & desire to see you successful in your studies.  You have a fine situation, & thousands of boys would be glad to be placed as you are.  Think of that & improve your time.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & your mother says I must write you.

	We are all well except Anna.  I do not think she is improving & have great fears about her.  I hope, however the warm weather will produce a change for the better.  

	The day Willie left here he fell in company with Judge ONeall & the same day the Judge met with a terrible accident on the Spartanburgh Rail Road.  He was thrown off the track & badly injured.  He has lost the use of his legs & will never be able to hold court again.

	Col. Orr has declined being a candidate for Congress.  Col. Ashmore, Col. Irvine Jones and Mr. Vernon of Spartanburgh are candidates.  Col. Ashmore will probably be elected.

	I hope you are studying hard & behaving well.  In the report of the Secretary of the navy I see a list of the cadets who were dismissed last year.  I hope you will not have your name amongst them next year.

	Write us how you are getting on in everything.  Tell us all that happens to you. 

	Fannie had some little girls here last night, & amongst them Mary Cleveland, who is a sweet little girl and I believe one of your belles.  She is certainly prettier thanCroft.

	But you must not think of the girls till you are a lieutenant in the navy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We received a letter from Captain Blake stating you had been found deficient in your studies!  You do not know how unhappy this made your mother.  I have no words to express my grief and sorrow.

	I hope you will now begin to study & learn your lessons.  What disgrace will it be to see you returning home!  How can you look your friends here in the face after your dismissal!.  They will all laugh at you .  And you will be ruined.

	My dear Son only think how hard I struggled to get you in the naval school and what a terrible misfortune it will be to be dismissed.  If you have any love for your mother, any regard for me, or only consideration for your own happiness do study & redeem your character.  Dont let one moment pass in idleness.  Study all day & all night.  Do not sit on your book thinking of something else.  Say your lessons over & over again.

	I will come on next month if I can & see you & I hope by that time you will stand well in your class.

	When I have done so much for you, it is too bad to see you throwing away your golden opportunities.

	Think of nothing but study & good behaviour.  Remember next June you are to go on that cruise & see the world.  But if you do not study you will not go, but come home to be ridiculed & laughed at.

	I believe now, my dear Son, you will begin to study.  You said so, in one of your last letters, and if you only knew my heart I am sure you would.  Your affectionate Farther, B.F. Perry

	I was glad to hear you were pleased with you roommate.  Capt. Blake writes well of him.

	Anna is getting better & we think now that she may recover.  The doctors say so.  But she has been ibn great danger & is still confined to her bed.  But her breathing is much improved.  We have been in great distress about her, & you ought not to increase our distress by your idleness or bad conduct.  I hope you will not.  

       Captain Blake writes you are doing better.  I am trying to arrange my affairs so that I may go on & see you in two or three weeks, but it is doubtful whether I can.

	The Students in the South Carolina College have had a great rebellion & ninety seven have been suspended till October & five more till May. They wanted holiday & tarred the benches.

	Willie Beattie has returned from Virginia & says the university is broken up on account of sickness.

	We are all well except Anna.  Becky is up & about again.

	Court was here last week.  We did not get half through.  Judge Wardlaw comes back to hold court in August.

Do not idle over your books one moment.  Get your lesson over & over again.  We shall soon receive your Report for march.  I hope it will be better.  Let every Report, sent me, show that you are rising, & standing better in your studies.  Each one should be a little better than the previous one.

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to go & see you in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be able to do so & get back to the court of appeals the first Monday in May.  

	Anna is better, but still in bed & very weak.  She takes a great deal of medicine &requires a great   
Deal of nursing.  Her mother has not been out even to church for several weeks.  All the rest are well.

	I have no news to tell you except that the students in the South Carolina College, in the military schools in Columbia & Charleston, at Yorkville & in Newberry Academy have had rebellions.  The schools here are going on very well.  The Village is quiet.  There is a revival in the Methodist church.  Wileys wife came to see him yesterday & she is almost white.

	Let us hear from you about your new roommate.  Do you continue to like him so well as you did.  How do you two get on together.  Waddy Williams has returned like a bad penny to his mother.  You mother says you must not be like a bad penny & return [to] us.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

 	Minerva is very bad off with soar throat.  All the rest are well.

	Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Hext is learning very fast.  Hext & Hayne are very affectionate towards each other.  They are always together.  Fannie is going to school & growing very fast.  She will be a young lady in size very soon.  Arthur looks very well & grows finely.  He will not talk yet. 

I hope, my dear son, that you are now studying hard & ambitious of keeping up with your class.  I have not rece[ive]d your Report for march yet.  I hope it will be better.

	We did not receive a letter from you last week, but I hope we shall tomorrow.  Franks last letter was missent & delayed three or four days on the route.  It went to Greenville N.C. & was forwarded to this place.  Yours may have taken the same direction.

Franks last letter was well written & gave us great encouragement.  But his Report came yesterday for March, & I see he got 26 demerits that month.  This is more than he received before all together.  I am anxious to know what he did.

	I find it impossible to leave home in time to visit you & return to the Court of Appeals.  If I go I shall start Thursday morning & will not be able to go beyond Annapolis.  I should like to see you, but I am more anxious to see Frank, as it has been so much longer since I saw him, & he needs more looking after than you do.

	I hope my dear son that you are studying hard & behaving well.  You are now of an age to appreciate your opportunities.  Be thoroughly educated, & you will see in after life how much it will be to your advantage.  I have felt all my life the misfortune of wanting a thorough education.  It never can be entirely overcome.

	Anna is doing very well & recovering, but still in bed.  Dr. Earle thinks she will entirely recover & be as well as she ever was.  The rest all well.  Fannie, Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Arthur is growing finely & your mother is well.

	Hamlin Beattie & Sallie Cleveland are to be married Tuesday evening at the Episcopal church.  Choice & Beattie are to give large parties.  We are all invited to Beatties.  Anna only to the wedding.

	Mrs. Nance has written me she wishes to purchase Wiley on account of his wife.  But it is impossible for me at present to part with him.  I may hereafter when I can supply his place.  

	There is a great revival here in the Methodist church.  All the little girls in the college are joining
& many of the boys.

	I understand Col Wares eldest daughter is very anxious to marry Arnold, & her parents object & they had quite a scene there the other day.  Arnold was present.

	I received your letter last week, which was delayed several days, by the carelessness of some Post Master.  It was sent to Greenville N.C. & forwarded to Greenville &c.

	I was pleased, my dear Son, with your letter.  It was well written & beautifully written, giving a favorable account of yourself & studies.  But since that I have received your Report for March in which you have 26 demerits!  What were they for?  How did you get so many demerits in one month?  Tell me all about it?  What have you done?

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to visit you next Saturday night, but I may not be able to get off.  I have to leave here on Thursday in order to get back in time for the Court of appeals the second day of May.  If I get off, I shall not be able to go further than Annapolis.  I will not be able to visit Willie.  But my getting off at all is very uncertain.  I wish to see you very much.

	Anna is still improving, but still in bed & very weak with a bad cough.  Dr. Earle thinks she will recover, & be as well as she ever was.  I hope so & think so.    But it will be a long time before she recovers her strength.

	The rest are all well.  Your grandmother & aunt Susan & families are all well.  Fannie, Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Arthur is growing finely & looks well.  He will not talk yet, but understands all that is said to him.  

	Willie Beattie and Sallie Cleveland are to be married Tuesday evening at the Episcopal church.    They are to have grant parties at Choices & Beatties.

	You must my son for your own sake & for the love you have for your mother & myself be studious & good.  Do not let them dismiss you for want of hard study or good conduct.  Remember you must be a gallant officer of our noble navy.  What a situation you have & how much you will loose if dismissed.  How disgraceful too to be dismissed.

	I hope to hear from you Monday.  I did not hear from Willie last week.  He was doing well when we last heard from him.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We recei[ve]d your letter this week & were glad to hear you were doing well & had recei[ve]d no demerits this month.  I hope you will now begin to see the necessity of studying hard & being on your best behaviour.

	I have been disappointed in visiting you.  Perhaps I may go on from Columbia to see you the first of May after getting through the Court of appeals.  I go down to Columbia the last of this week.

	We here had a great wedding in the village--Hamlin Beattie to Sallie Cleveland.  I was at the party at Beatties.  It was a very handsome affair.  There was a large collection of the young people & some old ones.

	Pauline Ware was also married to Mr. Arnold last week & they go off to Mississippi immediately.  Col. Ware & his wife were very much opposed to the match.

	Anna is better & rides out every day.  Dr. Earle says she will get well.  She is gaining her strength.

	Arthur is sick todayhas an eruption all over his face & high fever & bad cold.  He is taking medicine & I hope will get better.  The little negro children were affected in the same way & get well in a day or two.  

	We have had a great religious revival.  Twenty or thirty are to be baptized today.  Mary Mauldin Betty & Oscar are amongst them.  Georgia Sperman about twelve years old is to be baptized.

	I received a letter from you Friday which stated that the youngest Memminger & Blake were supposed to have the measles.  I hope it may be nothing worse.  You have had the measles & therefore in no danger of that disease.

	Arthur is quite sick this morning with an eruption something like the measles; but it is confined to his face & he has a little fever.  Some of the little negro children have been affected in the same this& recovered in two or three days.

	Anna is improving & rides out a short distance every day.  Dr. Earle thinks she is with prudence out of danger.  This is a great mercy to us, for your mother & myself have been greatly distressed about her.

	The morning of Hamlin Beatties fair, his father came to me office & insisted on my going.  I did so.  They had quite a magnificent wedding party.  I have seldom seen a handsomer supper.  The company was large.  The Bride & Bride Groom looked very happy, & I hope their happiness will continue through life.  The mother of the Bride refused to attend the wedding & parties.  Her father was present.

	Pauline Ware was married last week to Mr. Arnold a grandson of old Joe McCullough.  He was not the man I spoke of in my last letter.  His father is a clever worthy man & the Arnolds are mostly respectable.  They go off to Mississippi.  Pauline said she would rather marry Arnold than share the throne of any monarch on earth.  This was great devotion in [word obscured].

	I have been disappointed in the trip north.  My professional duties are such that I cannot leave home at all without loss, and inconvenience.  You must make haste & be admitted to the Bar in order to relieve me.

	I go to Columbia this week to attend the court of appeals & will be there eight or ten days.  The Board of Trustees of the South Carolina College meet the first week in May, and we shall then have a report as to the Rebellion.

	Twenty or thirty persons are to be baptized today in threw Baptist churchsome of them only twelve years old.  Mary, Betty & Oscar Mauldin all join today.  The Methodist too had a great revival & numbers have joined.  The Presbyterians also but the poor Episcopalians haveyet from the religious excitement.  Mr. Arthur said to me at Beatties the other night that religious revivals always followed money [page torn].  I suppose on the principle that trouble always begets reflection & disappointment in this world induced a hope of success in the next.  Men are apt too to repent when misfortune overtakes them.

	I was glad to hear all about your messmates.  I hope they are all clever young men.  Cultivate friendship, kindness and affection , my son, with all your associates.  There is more pleasure & happiness 
In being kind than spiteful & cold.  Never make an enemy if you can possibly avoid it.  I have suffered much in life by not obeying this maxim.

	We heard from Frank yesterday.  He says he is doing well & complains that you do not write to him very often.  

	Mr. Everett has been winning golden opinions in Charleston & Columbia by his eloquent orations on Washington and Charity.  I hope his visit will do good.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I came down here yesterday evening to attend the Court of Appeals & may have to remain here eight or ten days.

	General Thompson came down with me to deliver a Lecture on Mexico.  He asked a good deal about you and how you were getting on at the Naval Academy.

	I saw George Wells here yesterday.  He is very much pleased with the Citadel and is doing wellwas dressed up in his uniform.  Perry was with him who used to go to school at Greenville.  I have not seen Dyer yet or Westmoreland who are both from Greenville.  

 	Edward Buist called to see me this morning.  He did not join in the late rebellion and says he has learnt wisdom by experience.  The college is doing very well now.  I saw the President Judge Longstreet this morning.  The Board of Trustees meet on Wednesday.

	If I have time I may come on & see you before I return to Greenville.  I hope you will study hard & get no demerits this month.  We did not receive a letter from you the day before I left home.  But I suppose it was rece[ive]d Saturday.

	They were all getting better at home.  Anna is thought to be out of danger.  Arthur & Hext had had something like scarlet fever & were getting well.

	I Have just taken dinner & smoked a cigar, & will now write you a letter.

	I did no go to church this morning, but spent the day very pleasantly in conversation with Mr. Woodward, formerly a member of Congress, General Thompson, Col. Summer, Col. Owens & Col. W.C. Preston & Judge Longstreet for a short time.  I may not have spent the day piously as if I had gone to church, but certainly more agreeably.

	I saw Mr. Janney & his daughter last night & they and all the, & my friends made a great [many] inquiries about Annas health.  Tell her she ought to feel kind[ly] toward everybody when all manifest so much interest in her.  Mr. Janney promised to send out to get some strawberries for her  today.  If he succeeds, I will send them up in the morning by the conductor Mr. Isaacs.  Mr. Janney offered some preserved peaches, & I see oranges & bananas & will send some in the morning.

	

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are both in Baltimore.  I suppose they will be at home before I leave here.  General Thompson & Miss Jones came down with me.  We met on the cars Mr. B on his way to the Governors.  We had a pleasant time & reached here half after two oclock.

	Young Buist came to see me this morning & said he had learnt wisdom by experience.  He had nothing to do in the rebellion.  Young Moore and Knotts & Whitner are here applying for admission to the Bar.

	In conversation this morning Woodward & Summer said I looked & my appearance & face & person reminded them of Col. Benton, and Woodward then added that he did not wish to flatter me, but that Col. Benton was the finest& most imposing man in his appearance he had ever met.  I relate their compliments for your gratification, knowing how much you value such thinks.

	I was leased with Judge Longstreet.  But he is extremely ugly.  He said he was always, when a boy, said to be the ugliest fellow in the world, and General Thompson replied he had held his own remarkably well.  He & Thompson were old acquaintances.
	
	As we came down we met the longest train I ever saw on the Greenville Road going up filled with theholders & their wives & daughters.  There are no ladies here now except one or two.

	Col Pickens was disappointed in sailing for Europe and has returned home, but will go back to New York shortly.  Governor Allston will be here in the morning.  General Quitman Keitt & Bonham tomorrow evening.  Col. Watts enquired kindly after you & Anna.  The Judges did not come down yesterday & I suppose we shall have no court tomorrow.  If I had known this I might have staid at home till Monday morning.

	I hope you & the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  I hope Anna is still improving & that Arthur & Hext are well.  The weather is very hot today.  

	I will write to Willie & Frank this evening.  I will send you the Greyson Letters a pretty book which I purchased yesterday full of humor & wisdom.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few minutes, to write you a reply.

	I have bought two dozen oranges & a dozen bananas to send by Wells in the morning.  Janney is to get me the strawberries this evening.

	There is a great crowd here now.  They have come to see & hear General Quitman tomorrow.  Robinson & his wife from Fairfield are here.

	I shall be detained longer in court than I expected.  Nothing was done today in my cases.  I hope to try one tomorrow.

	I was glad to hear Anna was getting better, that Hext was well & Arthur better.

	I will get the caps as you requested.  I have bought for myself a frock coat $18, pants $6.00, hat $5 & gloves &$2.00.  The coat is a very nice one indeed & fits well.

	I am sorry for poor Dr. Stone & will attend to his business.  I am glad to hear he has sent a prospect ahead of him.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are expected to return Friday evening with Miss Graham & Tulula.

	General Thompson delivers his lecture this evening & I suppose I shall have to go & hear him.

	Col. Preston called with his carriage yesterday evening to take Miss Jones & General Thompson to ride & wished me to go with him, but I declined.  Maybe Col. Preston & Miss Jones may make a match.  The old man looks pretty well.

	Col. John Preston has gone to Europe & old Mrs. Hampton went with him to remain several years, & she is over eighty years old.

	I think you have scolded Frank enough.  Write him encouraging letters.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Martin which I have to answer this evening.

	In the next room there seems to be any number of children squalling & they annoy me.  I changed my room yesterday on account of the sun.  But the children are worse than the sun.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your very short letter, but you say you will write longer ones after hearing from me.  I wrote you a long letter Sunday & another yesterday. 

	I have done nothing today.  The Courts did not sit, but the Judges went to hear General Quitmans speech.  Having nothing else to do I went too, and was much interested in it.  There was an immense convocation of personsseveral thousand.  The College Hall which is an immense building  was very crowded with ladies.  Being a Trustee of the College a seat was provided for me.  I took General Thompson with me.  Miss Jones went early with Col. Preston.

	Yesterday evening at the supper table I was surprised by your uncle Col. Hayne coming up & speaking to me.  I did not know of his arrival.  He took a seat with me & had a great deal of chat.  This morning he informed me that he too was to make a speech at the Quitman exhibition as the only surviving aid of General Jackson.  He did speak for some time after Quitman had got through about Jackson & the Battle of New Orleans.  The old gentleman is looking very well & is as full of fire &as ever.  I thought whilst speaking that he would shake himself to pieces.

	General Thompson goes up in the morning & Jann[e]y has got me some strawberries which I will send up by him.

       This morning at the breakfast table a lady spoke to me holding out her hand & said she was Mrs. Anderson.  It was some time before I could tell who Mrs. Anderson was.  But in the course of the conversation I found out she was a Miss Kincade.  We sat together at dinner today & had a great deal of talk.  She has a little son with her who had been in the military Academy.  She enquired about Frank & how he liked the school.  She wishes to send her little son there.
       
       I am not writing to you amidst great confusion on one side of me the babies are squalling & on the other General McGowan & Col. Owens & others are mostover their wine.  
       
       I shall be here till next week some time
       
       I saw Col. Keitt & general Bonham this morning.  They enquired kindly after you & Anna.  Keitt is looking very well.  I did not ask him about Miss Sparks.  I was afraid it was a sore subject.
       
       Your uncle Arthur returns tomorrow.  Col. Memminger & Mr. Petigru will be here tomorrow.
       
       It is now so dark that I must quit.  I hope you & the children are all getting on well.  I am anxious to see you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & will write you a few lines before going down to the Board of Trustees.

	I was invited to dine with General Quitman today at Dr. Greens where he is staying, but declined the invitation.  I could not get back in time to attend the meeting of the Board of Trustees & I do not like General Quitmans political character & have written freely about him.  It will be a great dinner.  The Ball last night was a grand affair.  But I did not attend that & therefore thought it better not to accept Dr. Greens invitation.  The Governor insisted on my going & offered me a seat in his carriage.

	General Thompson went up this morning & I sent a jar of strawberries.  Miss Jones did not go to the Ball.  I saw her this morning as she was starting home.  She showed me my Jar of strawberries & asked me to look what a nice present she was carrying home to her sister.  I told [her] they were mine & I was sending them by the General to Anna.  She then promised to see that they went safely.  General Thompson had also purchased some & she supposed mine was his.

	This evening Elford & Town[e]s came down & Willie Beattie.  Elford tells me they have located the Baptist Theological Seminary at Greenville & seems much delighted at it.

	I have done nothing today.  The students were examined & all were admitted.  Moore & Knotts amongst them & Whitner &c.

	I will send up in the morning some apples & jelly if I can get them for Anna.  

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Hold this evening about his Anderson business & wishes me to write a letter to Sam[ue]l Earle forbidding him to pay out the money.

	I am tired of waiting for my law cases & it may be the last of next week before I can return home.  But some good luck may hasten the hearing of the cases.

  	The babies & their young mothers & nurses have all gone & there is now no noise or crying to disturb me.

	I am glad to hear Anna is improving & that Hext & Arthur are so much better.  I am sorry Anna does not like the Book.  It is said to be a very fine one.

	I will enquire about the books you mention.  I have bought several books.  The Bench & Bar of Georgiathe autobiography of Goethe & his Sorrows of Wert[h]erH life by his son.

	I hope McCullough paid the money to Col. Hoke & that Ware paid him also.

	I told Col. Owens General McGowan what I Had written to you yesterday & they told me I must write today that they were still & silent.

	Col. Carn is here & is killing himself drinking I am afraid.  His young wife has not made him as happy as his brandy.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have done well today.  The Court of Errors sat & the case of Tate & McCallister was argued.  After dinner I went to the college & the Board dispatched all their business.

	Memminger & Petigru came up last night.  As I came from the college this evening Tom Long came up & spoke to me very cordially.  He & Hawthorn & their wives are here.  I bowed to them at the supper table as they passed by me & I promisedto call up & see them.

	I did not go down to the college tonight to hear the boys speak as I am very sleepy & will go to bed.  There are no bow at this time in Columbia.  I hope you have rece[ive]d the strawberries &jelly & apples.

	I am glad to hear that Col. Ware has paid some money.  This will help.  I wish McCullough had paid that would have helped more.

	I have worked hard today all day & dined with Governor Allston, & now I am really tired & will go to bed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	After writing you a short letter last night I felt so bad that I went to bed.  I felt sleepy, & thought I could sleep off my unpleasant feelings, but I soon found that there was an increased commotion which would defy sleep.  The ice water, green peas & fruits which I have been eating have affected my bowels & I spent a very unpleasant night.  I am somewhat better today, but was unable to examine the Equity students.  This morning I am unable to go down to the college exhibition tonight.  Mr. Petigru says Judge Longstreet regretted very much my absence last night.

	We heard this morning the melancholy intelligence of Judge Evans death.  He was perfectly well & in the Senate yesterday, & died at ten oclock in the night.  This is a sad death.  I had great regard for the Judge & most sincerely mourn his loss.  He was one the best, wisest & most exemplary men I ever knew.  He died of a disease of the heart.  You will perhaps see his death notice in the mornings papers.  The Bar have a meeting in the morning.

       I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  Tell Hext I have bought him a nice drum which he can beat loud & long.  I enquired for your Books but they were not to be had.  The Book seller said he would& get some of them.  I have got the promise of some remarkable strawberries next Tuesday.  I hope to return home Wednesday.  If so I can carry the strawberries up.  You must save all your cream & we will have a nice supper.
       
       Col. Herndon, Fair, Dawkins & Thompson are all here now & they enquired after you & Anna.  Herndon said he had intended sending his daughter to Burlington till he heard of Annas sickness.
       
       I bought a check today for $414.00 & sent Southworth which is all that I owe him for the Heirs of Dbarn. 
       
       I have bought a most beautiful & interesting work of humor & fun & pictures the  Cyclopedia of humor in three volumes which I will send up for the enjoyment of you Anna & Fannie, but take special care of it.  It contains five or six hundred pictures.  The children & servants will view it if they are allowed to look at it.
       
       Dr. LeConte did not return this evening.  They are expected tomorrow evening.  I will give your letter to Miss Graham & invite her the last of the month if you wish.
       
       I have not yet purchased any groceries.  But will do so before leaving.
       
       Long & Hawthorn & their wives left here this morning without my seeing them.
       
       I am very anxious to return home.  Nothing was done today with my cases.  Tomorrow one of them is to be argued.  Two will remain for next week.
       
       I must now conclude.  Col. Dawkins came to me this evening & suggested that I should accept the temporary appointment of U[nited] States Senator till the meeting of the Legislature.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	When I wrote you last letter Friday night, I thought my attack of diar[r]hea was over, when in fact it had just commenced.  I did not sleep one moment that night.  Mr. Janney gave mebrandy &but they had no effect in stopping the disease.  I was up & down every twenty minutes all night & finally concluded I Had an attack of cholera.  Just before day I sent for Dr. Fair.  He came & administered the pills composed of laudanum&calomel &c.  After taking four at intervals of twenty minutes, the disease was checked.  But I was left prostratenot able to attend the Bar meeting or to my case before Chancellor Dargan.  I remained in bed all yesterday till night.  Mr. Janney was very kind and attentive to me.  So was Col. Memminger, Mr. Elford & Col. Herndon.  I have been down to breakfast & feel well but rather weak.  I shall endeavour to return home as soon as possible.  I hope to get through my business on Tuesday.

	Dr. LeConte returned with his wife & Tulula Saturday morning but Miss Graham did not come with them.  I saw Talula at the breakfast at table this morning.  She looks pale & I think her health is not good.  She seems dull spirited, but enquired kindly after Anna.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte yet.  She is very much affected by her journey.

	This morning Nat Heyward came up & spoke to me & enquired after you & your mother & family.  I did not know him till he told me his name.  He is becoming gray.

	Dr. LeConte came to me room to see me soon after he returned hearing that I was sick.  

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday evening & the one you sent from Willie.  I suppose I had better send him a check for one hundred dollars.  I intended sending you some money in my last letter but forgot it.  I will enclose ten dollars in this letter.  	

	This is Sunday but I shall not venture out to church.  I hope to be able to go into court tomorrow & go on with my business.  I have been eating green peas & drinking ice water.

	Dr. Fair has just been to see me again & says I am well, but may have to take magnesium tomorrow to gently open my bowels.  He seems very skilful[l] & I like him very much.

	My friend Janney is most devoted, & I must tell you of his extreme appreciation of me.  As soon as he heard of the death of Judge Evans he went to Petigru, to get him to use his influence with Governor Allston to have me appointed to fill the vacancy.  He says Petigru approved heartily but said he could not approach Allston on the subject.  He then spoke to Chancellor Johnston, who also favored his.  But the Governor left here determined not to make any appointment.  He is an aspirant himself to the position.

	Mr. Janney has just been up to see me again.  His daughters have something to seen Anna when I go up.

	It is now after ten oclock.  I wrote you this morning a long letter.  Before going to bed I will add a line or two.  

	First let me tell you what I have heard in reference to your uncle Arthur.  He is to receive the appointment of U[nited] States Senator to fill out the present term till the meeting of the Legislature.  Governor Allston said if he had the appointment at all he should appoint Col. A.P. Hayne. This will be very grateful to your uncles vanity & ambition but I do not think he will be acceptable to the people at large.

	  I saw Mrs. LeConte at the dinner table & also at the supper table.  I gave your letter to Miss Graham to her to send on.

	Whilst at the dinner table I saw a fine looking naval officer in undress military uniform come up & take his seat with a lady near to me.  I looked at the lady & thought her face was familiar.  The officer was a stout fine looking red faced man with quite a military air.  They got through dinner before Dr. LeConte & Col. Memminger & myself, with Mrs. LeConte & children all seated at the same table.  When they had gone Mrs. LeConte said I will tell you a piece of history about that lady.  She married when very young, an old man for his money & who was very jealous of her.  He died & left her sixty thousand dollars as long as she remained a widow.  But on her second marriage it all went to his children.  She has now married that captain in the navy & given up her fortune.  He looks like he drank.  Her first husband was Seager of Mobile.  She is granddaughter of Dr. Fair.  This explained my remembrance of the Ladys face.  On looking at the Register I see his name is Dur & a Lieutenant in the navy.  I rather think Mrs. Seager has made a bad bargain.  I would not give sixty thousand dollars for Lieutenant Dur....  But he is fine looking, about thirty years old & Mrs. Seager may think she has made a good trade.  Perhaps she has if he is as good as he looks.    She has got a husband to take care of her & & is no longer troubled with the money.

	I have told you all the news & will conclude & go to bed.

	I feel quite well & will be able to go into court tomorrow.    I enclosed ten dollars in my letter to you this morning.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Sunday & was distressed to hear of your accident in riding out.  It is really fortunate that you & Anna were not seriously injured.  I cannot imagine how such a thing should occur.

	I was grieved too that you had not rece[ive]d my letters.  I have been very sick, but am pretty well now.  But I am afraid to remain here much longer lest the disease returns.

	I will endeavour to send you something by Wells in the morning.  I hope you get my letter enclosing ten dollars.

	I hope to get through with my cases tomorrow.  I have gained the great case in the court of Errors.

	I sent Willie a check for one hundred dollars this evening.

	Nothing was done in Court today in consequence of the death of Judge Evans.

	I suppose your uncle Arthur will be appointed by the Governor but the appointment will give great disappointment.

	I must now stop write letters in answer to those you sent me.

	I will write you a few lines by Susan who said last evening that she would go this morning in the carriage with Peter.

	We are all pretty well.  I have been very much affected with headache & cold.  Willie has a terrible rising on his face, which he broke & has disappeared.  Hayne has bites & sores on his feet which prevent his going to school.  Hext is quite well & Arthur is very well except he frets at night.

	The Servants are all well & doing well.  I have had no trouble with them.  Clara seems a good housekeeper, & performs her part well.  John attends to the horses finely & at dinner waits on the table.

	Your mother has bought a fine large horse of Prince, which I she will feed well & take good care of will be as good a horse as Fernprice $172.00.  The Pony is getting mischievous.  He ran off from Willie yesterday evening & kicked him with both feet but did not hurt him.

       Judge Magrath, Col. Orr, Col. Keitt, Mr. Conner, Dr. Hamilton are here now, & Judge Wardlaw, Mr. Porter, Mr. Mitchell & other lawyers will be here this evening.  The Federal Court opened & adjourned yesterday.
       
       I want to see you at home again.  Home is rather a lonesome place without a wife & I dont wonder at all of the gentlemen getting married again who loose their wives.
       
       I hope Anna has improved & enjoys the climate & fare at Thomas.  I am sure Fanny & Annie & Vardry have enjoyed the visit.  I hope you have.
       
       There are no peaches, & the watermellons are so trifling that I do not think they are worth sending to you.  Clara is making some things to send to you in the way of

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letter Friday evening, & were glad to hear you arrived safely at Cambridge.  Your mother has requested me to write you today, which is Sunday & say that she will write you again next week.

	I am sorry Edward Stokes did not enter college but am glad he is to remain, & tell him he is pursuing the proper course.  Let him prepare himself for one of the classes & then enter college.

	We heard of you in New York through Mary Mauldins letter.  Elford returned last Thursday, but I have not seen him.  Mary Mauldin came to see Anna yesterday morning but she & her mother hadout.

	General Thompson enquired about you last week & asked me if you were not promising.  I told him I was afraid you were wanting in ambition.  He told me to say to you that you owed it as a sacred duty to your father, who had done so much for you, to be ambitious, have energy & distinguish yourself in life.  I said likewise that I must appeal to your sense of duty to me & your mother to be studious, energetic & prudent.  I hope my dear son you will consider his good advice & follow it.

	It was my great misfortune not to receive a finished education & I have felt it through life.  You will have such an education & be indebted to the hard labors of your father for it.  You must therefore improve it.  General Thompson said no young man in the State would have a better opportunity of doing well than yourselfThat you would fall heir to my professional business & clients & that you must have energy & perseverance & industry to retain them.

	The General also said to me that it was a waste of time novels & the trashy literature of the timesThat it was injurious to the mind, & gave you a distaste to solid substantial learning.

	You must try to improve yourself in every letter that you write & in every piece of composition you make.  You must learn to speak in your societies & debating clubs.  Study well your subject & tell it as you can.  Anyone who can talk may learn to make speeches.

	I hope to receive soon your standing in your class & college.  Send it to me as soon as you can.

	I have no news to write you.  We are all as usual.  Anna about the same.  Hext has had sores on his feet which has prevented his going to school for a week past.  Fannie had the other night a similiar attack to the one you had here, but is now well.  The little girls had a fair in which she took great interest and they made upwards of one hundred dollars for the Sunday school.

	My circuit will soon commence & I am very busy in my office.  William Jacobs negroes have all been indicted for stealing, breaking open his sons house & I am defending them before Donaldson & five freeholders.  The trial will take several days.  The old mans sons are all turning out badly & worrying him to death.  He has worked hard all his life for his children & made a fortune for them.  His sons are all drunkards & worthless.  What a misfortune?  Two of them have married strumpetsone shot himself & committed suicideanother ran off & has never been heard ofa fourth is worthless & harassing his father.

	My dear son let me conclude by instructing you to be good, keep out of bad company, have energy & determine to make yourself a name in the world.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night which filled the household with joy at your safe return to the U[nited] States after a long absence on the wide ocean.

	You must [write] a full account of your voiage & tell us all you saw &c.

	Your mother wrote you at Cherburgh, but I suppose you did not receive her letter.  I was in hopes you would be at that Port whilst Queen Victoria & the European Louis Napoleon were there.

	We are all pretty well.  Anna is a great deal better.  Fannie has grown very much.  Hext & Hayne are going to Miss Powells school.  Arthur is beginning to talk.  Your mother enjoys good health.  I am quite well.    The servants are all well except Becka & Charles who are complaining.  The Horses are all fat & sleek.  We have two little deer in the yard again & they are great pets.

	All your acquaintances enquire about you & are anxious to see you.  Willie was with us four or five weeks this summer.  We heard from him last night.  He is now in the Senior class & is doing well.

	I hope dear Frank you will now turn over a new leaf & study hard, study all the timegit your lessons so that you will not miss one word.

	I am almost sorry that Bradford has been restored for Col Orr tells me his Report was that he would not study himself or let others study.  He said this accounted for your bad standing in your class.  You must not let idle boys interfere with your studies.

	Col. Orr told one of the visitors of the naval Academy to notice his little pet Frank Perry & report how he stood in his class.  He felt mortified when the Visitor returned to Washington & reported you deficient in your studies.

	I would not have you reported deficient again for any consideration.  I intend to visit you this Fall or Winter certainly & shall expect to find you much improved, grown & studying hard and behaving well.

	Your mother will write you all the news.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	We have not heard from you, except through Mr. Miller, since your arrival at Annapolis.  He wrote very flatteringly of you, said you had improved, was spoken of in high terms by the officers of the Preble and that you were not going to study hard & not be so lowdown as you were last term.  You must have pride & ambition to study hard &study all the time.  Now that you have go over your old studies you ought to stand no. 1 in your class.

	You must write me all about your cruise & sea life, what you saw and what you did on board the vessel.  Also write me all about your classmates & the new cadets.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Col. Alexander Taylor enquired about you very particularly last Sunday.  He & his family are here now.  His two youngest sons whom you saw at Cashiers Valley are fine little boys, manly & well behaved.

	We are all well except Anna.  She has fever & is taking blue pill.  Dr. Earle has put a blister on her which gives her great pain.

	I was employed last week to defend a young man only nineteen years old named John Fowler for killing Felix Rodgers below McBees Factory.  He struck him with his gun.  Rodgers was drunk & rushed on him with a rock.

	We have today an Egree gale & the weather is very bad.  You got back in good time.  It would be terrible weather at sea.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you this week at Annapolis.  It was well written & gave us great pleasure.  But we are sorry to learn that the applicants from South Carolina are rejected.  The rejection of Pearson must have mortified Col. Boyce for the Col. married a Pearson.

	I hope my dear son you will do your post as you promise in your letter towards upholding the character of your state at the naval Academy.  But to do this you must study harder than you did last year & behave better.    Who is your roommate.  A great deal depends on him.  You are such a good natured social fellow that you are easily lead estray by your companions.

	You must write me all about your studies & the school.  I am glad you spoke to Col. Boyce & told him you heard his speech at Greenville.  You must write us good letters & give us an account of your sea voyage as your mother sends your letters to her friends to read.
	  	
	James Moore who graduated here when Willie did, has been admitted to the Bar & is going to make a speech with me in a murder case.  John Fowler killed Felix Rodgers below McBees Mill & paper factory.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is not so well as she was.  Dr. Earle is again visiting her.  Hext has a nice little puppy which amuses him very much.  Hayne goes to school & came the other day for ten cents to buy a copybook.  He is going to learn to write before he spells.

	The Furman University does not seem to do as well as it did last year.  Mr. Furman has quit it.  There are not more than half as many students as they had last year.

	You must remember me to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  We were pleased with your pictures of Cheerburgh & Cadiz which were rece[ive]d the other night.

	There is great electioneering going on in Greenville now.  Pinckney Dill is opposing Bob M for ordinary, McDade & Runnion are for tax collector. Ashmore & Vernon for Congress.  Col. Jones has withdrawn.  The election takes place next Monday tomorrow week.  I suppose Stokes, Campbell, Easly & myself will be elected to the Legislature.  But I have done nothing to secure my election.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

	I see your roommate was turned back & that is a bad sign.  I wish you were with someone who is a hard student & steady.  Do my dear son take an interest in your studies & have pride and ambition enough to behave yourself well & recite your lessons well.

	I shall be glad to see your roommate return with you next June & spend some time with you.  I hope he is a clever fellow, has good principles & studious habits.

	I have been very busy this week & start to Anderson Court in the morning.  My Professional business is increasing & I want Willie at home now to help me write.  You write so good a hand I wish I had you in my office.  But your destiny must be the wide ocean.

	I have no doubt it is a pretty hard life at sea, but then when you get to Port you have great satisfaction in seeing the different cities of the world.

	Anna is better than she was a few days since.  Arthur has a cold & bad cough.  Hext has a swollen cheek & toothache.  Becky & Charles are still invalids.  Alfred too is unwell this morning.  Your grandmother & Susans families are all well.

	The election takes place tomorrow & there is considerable excitement.  The friends of Vernon have got their ticket printed with a tadpole on it.  Ashmore said the bone & sinew of the country would support him but the tadpole aristocracy might vote for Vernon.

	In haste your affectionate father.  Be a good boy & study hard.  B.F. Perry

       I am pleased to hear you have grown so much.  I shall expect to see you almost a man in size and quite a man in manners behaviour & intelligence.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is not so well as she was last week & I am very busy preparing my cases, so I have no time to write you a long letter.

	You must study hard & behave yourself well so as to stand high in your class.  You ought to stand first as you are going over the same studies you pursued last year.  Do my son strive hard to avoid demerits & get a high stand in your class.

	We did not hear from Willie last week.  But rece[ive]d a catalogue from him.  He is doing very well & has a pretty good standing in his class of one hundred & twenty five.

	Everybody enquires after you & ask[s] how you are getting on & how you like the naval school.  I am sorry there are so few South Carolinians in the school.  Why is it?  Can they not enter?  Or do they not apply?

	Anna is still feeble & weak.  She & your mother think of going to Aiken to spend the winter & leave me at home to take care of the children.  But I shall endeavour to go on & see you this winter.

	I saw Col. Orr last week & told him you were going to pay him a visit about Christmas.  He said he would be very glad indeed to see you & enquired a great deal about you.  On his account you must study hard & make rapid progress in your studies.  He enquires about you when he sees anyone in Washington from the naval Academy.

	I shall see your Report in a few days & hope it will be a good one.  Poor George Wells has studied so hard in the Military school in Columbia that he has had to leave on account of his health.  But will return as soon as his health is regained.

As soon as I get through with my appeal cases in court I will go on with them to Aiken, & return.  The Legislature & the Court of Appeals both meet tomorrow.  I have never seen so many candidates before the Legislature.  They annoy me very much.

	We left the children with your Aunt Susan & I hope they will do well.  We received a letter from you the night before leaving home & were glad to hear you were well & doing well.  If you only knew the anxiety your mother & I felt about you & your success in the naval school I am sure you would study hard & behave well on account of the love you have for us.  It is a matter of the greatest importance to you in after life to pursue your studies now with zeal & energy.

	Edward Buist has taken the first honor in the South Carolina College.  This he did by hard study & industry & good behavior.  His talents are inferior to several in the Class.

	You must write to me in Columbia for the next four weeks.  I shall go on & see you the latter part of December.  I am very anxious to see you again.  It semes a great while since I saw you.

They give us very little hope of her recovery.  This causes us great distress.  And you must be a good Boy & give us consolation in our distress.

	I rece[ive]d a letter last week from the Revd Edmund Dawse of Sherborn Massachusetts in reply to one I write the Post Master of Sherborn enquiring about my Fathers family there.  He gave me the history of the Perry family from 1679 almost two hundred years ago.  He says his grandmother & my Father were brother & sister.  He had my grand Fathers family Bible before him in which all the births & deaths were recorded.  My grand Father Moses Perry was twice married & dad sixteen children.  This letter has given me great pleasure.

	George Wells has taken the first honor in his Class again, but is in very feeble health.  Dyers son is doing well & stands high in his Class.  I hope you will be stimulated by their example & keep up the reputation of Greenville.

	I have not heard from Willie since I came to Columbia.  

	We had two ballottings yesterday for U[nited] States Senator, & the contest seems to be between Governor Adams & Col. Memminger.  But Rhett, Chesnut, McQueen & Manning are running.

	Your mother purchased some handkerchiefs for you & will have your shirts made.  I still hope to be able to go on, & see you the latter part of this month.  But it is somewhat doubtful.  Your mother has written to Captain Blake to let you visit Washington Christmas.  If I can I will be there about that time.

	Col. Chesnut has been elected Senator in the place of Judge Evans.  He is a friend of mine & if you go to Washington you must call & see him & General Hammond & Col. Orr & General Bonham.

	We are all well except Ann.  She is very feeble, but coughs less than she did.  She says she feels badly & has a very soar throat.  

	Your grandmother Susan & Ann took their Christmas dinner with us yesterday.  They are all well & talked a great deal about you & Willie.

	I have just written to Willie to call & see you as he comes home.  Your mother says you must send by Willie the things you bought in Europe & your old clothes for the servants.  When Willie returns she will send you some sheets &c.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies.  Be good & studious.  The people of Greenville enquire very often how you are doing.  They feel an interest in you & you must be ambitious & rise in your class.  

	We have a cold wet, dull Christmas & nothing new to write you.  

	I think I mentioned to you that I had recei[ve]d a letter from our kinspeople in Sherborn, Massachusetts.  They say that the whole town is connected there with the Perrys & have invited me to go & see them.    Is there anyone in your Academy from that part of Massachusetts.

This is very gratifying to your mother & me.

	I hope you got the $20 I sent you before you started to Washington.

	I am sorry Col. Orr was not in Washington whilst you were there.  I see from the newspapers that he was in New York at that time.  I hope you called to see the members of Congress from South Carolina.

	The fears expressed in my last letter to you have been realized, as you know by the letter of Mr. Gaillard.

	Poor Anna is dead & I have just returned with a broken heart from the funeral.  [Words obscured] was a beautiful one & I have just written an account of it for the Patriot and Mountaineer which you will see next week.  

	She said she loved all of her brothers & Sister, but you she loved more than any other.  She begged that you would be a good boy & remember & love her memorythat you would prepare to meet her in Heaven.  I hope my dear son that this advice will not be thrown away on you.

	She said you must send the presents intended for her, to her mother & that her mother must look at them & remember her.

	The village generally have manifested the greatest interest in her death.  The stores were all closed today as the funeral procession passed.  The day was very rainy & bad but still there was a great turnout of the villagers for her funeral.

	She manifested a willingness to die & Revd. Mr. Gaillard said she died as a true Christian.

	I have no heart my dear Son to write you a long letter.  I hope you may receive this before Willie passes you.  Tell him that Anna sent her love to him & said he must also prepare to meet her in Heaven.

	We are all well, though in greatest affliction bowed to the Earth.

	Mr. Gaillard wrote a beautiful letter and Mr. Richard Freeman a sweet poem on Annas death which you will see in the Patriot of last week.

	We are expecting Willie home tonight.  I did not write you yesterday in consequence of Annas funeral.  

	We all wish to see you very much & I wish you could have come home with Willie.  But you must study hard & be punctual in your lessons.  Do not fall behind again in your class.

	We are all well.  Willie will return the first of March.  I will send you by him a parcel of Books which you must read & take care of & return to me.  Your mother will send you some clothing &c.  I will send you my likeness in a frame as you desired in your last letter.

	It may be that Willie will have to send your trunk down to Annapolis, without stopping to see you, as he will be in company with Memminger & not have time tis topo to se you. 

	I hope my dear Son you will study hard & be a good boy.  Your sisters death has made a serious impression om all of us & I hope it will on you.  Prepare to meet her in Heaven as she requested.

	We have recei[ve]d a great many pretty letters from her friends which I am going to have printed in a pamphlet with her funeral Sermon & will send you one of them.

	Fannie goes every day to Annas grave & spreads flowers on it as she requested.  Her friends do so likewise.  She has been greatly mourned by the entire community.

	Willie recei[ve]d a beautiful letter from the Chaplain at Harvard on her death.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you last week, & your mother received one last night communicating the refreshing news, as to your splendid examination.  We are all delighted to know that you have done well & hope from henceforth that you will study hard & determine to graduate with honor.

	You have no idea my dear son of the importance now to be attached to your studies.  Your future happiness & honor depend on them.  Their neglect will make you a poor miserable wreck through life & perhaps a drunken blackguard.  On the other hand if you study hard & behave well you make such a man as Commodore Decatur or Lord nelson.

	I wish you also my son, to be good, honorable & religious.  Never do a mean thing or a dishonorable one.  Never tell a falsehood on any account.  Be kind & gentle and pray to your God to make you a good boy.    Never curse or use profane language.  Never touch spirits of any kind.  The great danger of a naval officer is intemperance.

	Col. Jones has got an appointment for his son Thomas at West Point.  I should hardly suppose he could enter the Military Academy, and if he does I am sure he will not stay there long, for it is said he is stupid & bad & will not study.

	Willie will leave here tomorrow week the 28th of February & will probably pass Annapolis 2nd (Wednesday) of march.  He will carry your trunk & send it down from the junction if he does not go by to see you.

	We are all well.  I am going to have all the letters received about Annas death printed with Mr. Arthurs sermon in a book & will send you a copy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Son

	We received your letters last week & your drawings, and if you only knew the pleasure they gave your father & mother I am sure you would try to study hard & be a good boy.  Your examination was a good one & your drawings are fine.  I do think you ought to have been higher in drawing, or your fellow students have great talents in that line.  We were all delighted with your drawings.  Your improvement in your standing will make us more glad to see you in June.

	You must now determine to go on improving & take a high stand in your class.  Do not let other boys outstudy you & take off all the honors of your class.  Be as good as any of them, & show that that you have as much talent.  Keep up the honor of old South Carolina in the naval school and do honor to your family.  There is more pleasure & happiness in being well & good than in being ignorant & vicious.

	Willie left here yesterday morning & I suppose you have seen him or will before this letter reaches you.  He carried a trunk full of presents to you, and I am afraid they may direct your mind from your studies.

	We are all well but still in great affliction.  The death of Anna has been a severe bereavement to us, & to the whole community.  She is never out of my mind, and it seems I can never get over her death.  I would give worlds if I could restore her to life & see her once more.  But I hope my dear child we shall all prepare to meet her in Heaven as she requested.  The tears are now flowing so rapidly from my eyes that I must close my letter.  Your affectionate & loving father, B.F. Perry

	We received two letters from you last night informing us that Willie had arrived in Annapolis.

	We were very sorry to hear that you had got 28 demerits last month.  If you go on in this way  you will soon get your 200 & be reported to the Secretary of the Navy.  Do my son try to get no more.  You say you have had bad luck.  It is bad conduct.  There is no luck about demerits.

	We were glad to hear that your standing in your studies was good.  But you must try & stand higher in your class.  Let your sole aim be to rise & stand at the head of your class.  A boy will never do anything without ambition to excel.

	I am glad to hear you intend writing to Thomas at Fairfield.  Open a correspondence with him & tell about his studies to be admitted.  He will thank you for it & be your friend when he goes on.

	I have no news to write you.  The Furman University & the Female college have opened well & have a large number of pupils.  

	We are all well.  Vardry has been deaf, but is getting better.  Susan & her children all took dinner with us today.  Your grandmother is better.

	I am constantly receiving letters from a cousin I have found out in Massachusetts.  He is a Preacher & a very intelligent & educated gentleman.

	Fannie is now going to school again.  Hext & Hayne are also going to school.  Arthur is grown a great deal & is very pretty & smart.  Fannie is very tall & almost a young lady.  You would hardly know her.

	We all look forward to seeing you in June with a great deal of pleasure.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	There have been several attempts to burn up Cox & Gowers carriage establishment & Hext has just come to tell me that they have caught the IncendiariesKirk Smith & Parker two of the workmen.  Smith is a boy & son of Chesney Smith.  He had been whipped by Cox for forging an order.

My dear Son
	
	I received your letter written after your return to Harvard last night & was glad to learn that you had safely arrived in time to attend your recitations.

	You must have staid one day in New York.  Why did you not mention it.  I enquired of Col. Goodlett who left New York last Thursdaya week & he had not heard of you.  They all stopped at the Astor House & Boyles Crayton had his packet book stolen.  He took the precaution to out it under the head of his bed when he went to sleep & forgot to put it in his packet when hew dressed.  I do not understand how anyone can be so foolish as to do this without putting his packet book in his sack or pantaloons or vest.

	There was another attempt last Thursday night to burn up Cox & Gowers carriage establishment.  The incendiary shot at one of the watchmen Carson & missed him one inch only with anball.  Carson fired twice in return.  He then discovered the mess in the shop in a blaze.  Fire had been put in through a broken pane of glass.  Fortunately it did not spread & the lower part of town was aroused.

	I go in the morning to Anderson Court & will be there al the week I am afraid.

	We recei[ve]d a letter from Frank last night.  He said he was getting high averages in his class, had read the life of Decatur & was more in love with a naval life than before.

	I am pleased to hear my dear son your determination to try & gratify the wishes of your parents.  We have done much for you & love you dearly.  You must be good, honorable, religious, studious & ambitious to make for yourself a name & reputation.  You have had more advantages than most young men and more is expected of you.  

	Hext has just come to tell that there was another attempt to set fire last night to burn up Cox & Gowers shop & that Kirk Smith & Parker two of the workmen were detected & have been lodged in jail.  Smith is a boy & son of Che Smith.  He had been whipped by Gower for forging an order.  I have not heard the cause of Parkers fiendish revenge.

	We have ordered a monument for poor Anna in Philadelphia which is exquisitely beautiful & will cost there $400.00.  The Iron railing for her grave has been forwarded on.

	Return day was yesterday.  We had a small return.

	Be careful of your health.  Do not catch cold.  Dont go out of nights.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I go in the morning to Pickens Court & am not writing to you in the dining or sitting room & your mother at my side.  The children have just gone upstairs to wash & go to bed.  They are making a terrible fuss in their ablutions.  

	I returned from Anderson Court Thursday evening.  We had bad weather & not a great deal of business.  One night after I had gone to bed at Anderson a musical band came & serenaded me & called for a speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  I had to get up & dress & make a short speech.

	We are all well & anxiously expecting the time when we may see you once more.  I am glad to hear you have grown so much.

	We rece[ive]d your letter as usual last week.  We all looking forward with great pleasure to your visit in June.

	Your mother has just rece[ive]d some rings, chains and breast pins made out of the hair of your dear sister & intends a pin for you.  She has likewise had several likenesses of poor Anna taken to give her friends.

	My dear son you must study to be religious & wise [&] never do anything wrong.  

	Cox & Gower have got the Jail full of Incendiaries Oberly & wife, Parker, Smith, & Wisen have been arrested.  Parker confesses that Oberly gave him three ten dollar Bills to burn up the Steam mill!  How horribly bad some men are!

I always knew that if you would only study you could stand high in your class.  I hope you have now broken the ice, & will turn over a new leaf & be ambitious of distinction.

	In the course of two months your June examination will come on, & I shall then expect to see you stand well in your class.  This will make your visit to us more gratifying both to you & your parents.
	   
	I go to Laurens Court in the morning & have just returned from Spartanburg court.  This will end my circuit.  I expect to carry Hext & Hayne with me.

	   Fannie has been sick, but is well again.  Arthur is quite well.  Your mother has been a little unwell but is better.  Your grandmother is poorly.  Vardry is very deaf, & your aunt Susan has great fears about him.

	We are all well.  Hext went with me to Laurens court & was unwell on his return but has recovered.  I was unfortunate at Laurens court & left my horse Tim sick there & do not expect he will ever get well again. 

	In relation to your clothes, you had better purchase a handsome uniform to wear when you go out , & wear your jacket uniform  in the cars & about the house.  You need no citizens clothes at all.  If you want any money to buy clothes I will send you some.  But dress all the time like a Midshipman.  In that way officers always travel.

Letter 515
22 April 1859
Greenville

Dear Sir [Charles Lanman]

	I have looked over portions of your Congressional Dictionary with some interest & ask leave to suggest one or two corrections.  I see you ask for such information.

	There were two William Butlers on Congress from South Carolinaone the Father & the other the brother of Judge Andrew P. Butler our late Senator.  You have jumbled them together.  General William Butler the father was a gallant Revolutionary officer, and served in Congress many years.  He was turned out of Congress by John C. Calhoun in 1811, he was before that turned out by Robert Goodloe Harper.

	Dr. William Butler the son of the General & brother of Senator Butler was in Congress in 1842.  He graduated at the South Carolina College in 1810 & married a sister of Commodore Oliver H. Perry.  For some time he was a surgeon in the U[nited] States Navy.

	In reference to William Smith you have again put two men together, both of whom were men of great ability.  William Smith of Charleston was in Congress immediately after the organization of the federal Government & took a very active part in all the debates.  He continued in Congress for a number of years.  He afterwards changed his name to William Lawton [Loughton] Smith, & was in Congress afterwards for several years.  He was beaten by Langdon Cheves.

	Judge William Smith was in the Senate, but never in the House.  He moved to Alabama, was appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States but declined the office.  There was another William Smith in Congress from the upper part of South Carolina about 1800 whom you do not mention.

	In speaking of Andrew Pickens you have again united Son & Father.  General Andrew Pickens who was in Congress in 1795 was never Governor of South Carolina.  His Son Andrew Pickens, the Father of the present Russian Minister Col. F.W. Pickens was Governor of South Carolina about 1818.

	I am with great respect yours &c., B.F. Perry

	  I am going to Columbia Tuesday & will carry with me Fannie & Annie.  They are delighted with the idea of going.

	We are all well, & all anxious for you to return home.  You will be treated with joy by everyone. And this should make you study hard & behave well.

	We had a frost this morning which I fear has done great injury to fruit, wheat &c.  The loss of peaches in the summer is a great depravation.

	I was so much fatigued last night after trotting over the town, trying to find some clothes to make myself appear decent that I was not able to write you. 

	Fannie has just finished a long letter to you & I suppose has told you all the news.  I may be telling you the same things over again.  There was a considerable crowd yesterday on the Rail Road; but today seven cars came laden with stockholders & their wives & children.  The Greenville folks yesterday  all went on to Charleston.  Mrs. Beattie, Hamlin, Willie, Mrs. Choice, Mrs. Cleveland, B & others.  Choice stopped to represent his stock.

	Col. OHanlon came to see us today & made a great many enquiries about you & the children.  Fannie & Annie had gone out of their room & he did not see them.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seemed glad to see us & have been very kind.  Miss Graham is about starting to Europe.  Lula is very much pleased with her school.

	Fannie & Anne are delighted with their trip & are enjoying themselves very much.  They went up to see Mrs. Taylor this morning & were invited to stay with her.  But they prefer staying at the Hotel.  Mr. L &daughters are very kind.  The Governors drawing room willwas given to them yesterday, but I preferred their being near me & they have rooms near where we staid last winter.

	I have seen very few persons to converse with.  My purchases are two coats, four waistcoats, a dozen socks & a pair of pants, boots & a hat.

	There is great dissatisfaction with the management of the Rail Road & an effort will be made to reform the management by turning out some of the officers.  The weather is warm & we have had rain.  I hope you & the children are doing well in our absence.  I would tell you all who were at the Hotel if I knew them or you would know them when their names are mentioned.  Mrs. McPheters & her daughters you know.  Tow[n]es of Abbeville & daughters are here.  His daughters are going to school at Barumville [Barhamville].  

	I think it likely I shall remain here till Monday & then return with the girls & remain at home instead of coming back again.  Though I ought to be at home Salesday.  

	The acquittal of Sickles was mentioned last night & Mrs. LeConte & the Dr. both agreed with me thatdeserved his fate, but that Sickles is an unmittigated scoundrel.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	You must never again sign any more papers, or enter into any combination with the students to restate the laws of your school.  Be obedient in all things.

	The tarring & feathering was a disgrace to all concerned.  If a student misbehaves let the teacher correct him.

	Enclosed I send you $20.00 which you wrote for in your last letter.  You did not say what you wanted it for.  I suppose to buy clothes.

	You must write me in your next letter when you will start home & how much money you will want to bring you home.

	We are all well.  Fannie & Annie are still in Charleston & will return with Mr. Arthur next Saturday.  They have been enjoying themselves very much in Charleston.

I would have written you before, but have had but little time & that little leisure I have spent in writing for the Patriot, which letters you will see.

	Edward Stokes went with us to Mount Auburn & has been unwell since.  He wrote me a note yesterday saying that he was sick & desired me to come & see him before leaving.  He stated he was getting better.

	Your mother, Frank & Fannie have engaged themselves very much.  Frank has met several of his fellow students & they seem clever boys.  I have found about twenty dozen of my kinspeople whom I like very much.  Two of them are members of the Legislature.  You will see my letter about Sherborn in the Patriot.

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & will be absent all the week. Your mother & Fannie have been very busy for several days past in planting rose bushes and other flowers around the enclosure of dear Anna and they will make it a lovely spot as it should be.--the resting place of one so sweet & lovelysnatched from life early.

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night and we were very glad to hear from you.  Two weeks had elapsed since your previous letter.

	You say you have received only four demerits.  You ought to try & receive none.  You know all the rules of the Academy & obey them.  Then you will get no demerits. 

	I am glad that Harper said what he did to you.  Your grandfather and his grandfather lived more than thirty years, within a half mile of each other & were great friends.  His father addressed your aunt Mrs. Hunt.  I always liked him very much but he was a grown young man whilst I was a boy.

	I returned from Pickens court last week but did not see any of Fosters family.  Hawthorn & Long are doing pretty well.  Next week is court here & I shall be very busy.

	The Revd. Mr. Buist waslast summer and he was the one who enquired after you.  He is Doctor of Divinity.

	I brought from Anderson Court a beautiful English Terrier for Arthur & he is delighted with the dog.  He sleeps with him.

	We are all well & the children are going to school.  

	Do you receive the Patriot regularly.  Let me know.

	Dr. Irvine says Pinckney will return about Christmas & wish to call & see you as he comes back.  Col. Ashmore tells me that he will go & see you before Congress meets.

	Spartan Goodlett is to be married shortly to Miss Lyles of Fairfield a daughter of William Lyles.  I had heard that he was courting Sally Crook.  But he is positively engaged to Miss Lyles.

	Donaldson & Miss Sue Hoke are to be married 15th of November.

	Write us once a week & study hard.  Let me have a good report from you in November.  Col. Orr enquires about you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Your letter to Willie was rece[ive]d last night & enclosed I send you five dollars which you wrote for.

	I am very busy in court & have not time to write a long letter.  We have just got through with the trial of Oneale for setting fire to Cox & Gowers carriage shop.  He was convicted, but will be imprisoned & not hung as he ought to be.  Willie took the testimony for us in court & did it very well.  So he is becoming useful to me in my practice already.  He is studying very well and will make himself a lawyer by next Fall.

My dear Son

	I returned yesterday from the court of ordinary at Spartanburgh.  There was a trial of a Will case
In which I was concerned and succeeded in establishing the Will.

	This morning I have written a letter to Col. Ashmore, who was here during my absence & who will visit you tomorrow week as your mother has already written you.

	I shall start to Columbia on Saturday & hereafter address your letters to me there till the 21st of December.

	We are all well. & I have no news to write you except what you mother has written you.

	Hexts dog poor Watch was found dead the other evening & no doubt poisoned by some vial person.  Hext is very much grieved at the loss.

	I am sorry you sold your overcoat.  It was a pretty one & a remarkable one.  No doubt you are cheated in the clothes you got in exchange.  I am very much pleased with my overcoat & it is the admiration of all who see it.

	I hope you are now studying hard, as you say you will, in your last letter.   My constant & never ceasing command to you is to study hard & behave well.  In after life you will reap the reward.  Be ambitious to excel your fellow students in good conduct & in your studies.  Try & take a higher stand in your class.  Be high up, instead if low down.

	I am very busy & have not time to write you further.  In your next letter let me hear how the South Carolina students stand in their classes.

	Hext & Hayne went with me to Laurens Court week before last, & behaved very well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I go down to Columbia in the morning & will be in the Legislature till towards Christmas.  You must write to me there.  This is a very wet day & gloomy weather.  I have been packing up my clothes although it is Sunday & we have a Methodist minister staying with us.  His name is Stacy, & [a] very clever intelligent gentleman he is.  We are to have another tomorrow.  Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p] the President of the Female College at Spartanburgh.  I shall not see him as I go off in the morning.

	There is a great Methodist Conference here.  Akins came here & about 2:30 Pres.  They are quartered on the Village {last few words obscured by stain].

	Anna Green was married last week & Willie was one of the groomsmen for Mr. Davis her husband.  He also waited on Donalson & Sue Hoke.

	I am glad my dear Son that you are going to study hard & be transferred to a higher section.  I hope you will succeed.

	Col. Ashmore will be with you tomorrow.  I hope you will be allowed to see him & converse with him a long time for he has promised to give you a great deal of advice.  

	If you wish to go to Washington in Christmas time, & get permission to do so I will send you money to defray your expenses.  Write to me whether you will be allowed to go.  Col. Ashmore will invite you if it is necessary to receive an invitation & you wrote him to that effect.

	Willie is studying law very hard, & makes good progress in his studies.  Hext is going to school & doing well.  Fannie is also going to school & doing well.  She is one of the smartest & best little girls I have ever seen.  Hayne & Arthur are doing well & looking well.  Your mother is well [and] so are all the servants.

	Col. Ashmore writes me that you are a noble looking boy & he knows you could do well. I hope when he sees you & knows of you he will not change his opinion.

	Now my dear son be a good boy & study & make a man of yourself of whom your family and country will be proud.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely as our friend Stacey prayed that I might do.  My room was retained for me, & I took into it my old friend H[enry] C[linton] Young who was without a room.  There was a great crowd on the cars & no less than five.

	I went to the court this morning & saw twenty-six students admitted Rice amongst them.  I then went with Chancellor to his room to get a decree for the sale Mayor Smiths land.  He spoke to me of the letter he had written you.  I told him it was very gratifying to you.  He said, a parent might think it was a back breaking affair to loose a child & it was bad enough for he had experienced it, but it was nothing to loosing a wife.  No human misery & affliction was like that which he too had drunk to the dregs.  He then spoke of his first wife, & I thought strange of it as he married another wife soon after the death of his first.  

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly & affectionately after you & all the children.  Mrs. LeConte is not so stout as she was.  Lula will graduate next July & return home in the fall.  Dr. LeConte has a niece with him who reminded me of Lula.  

	There was nothing done of interest in the Legislature yesterday or today.  I presented Mrs. Rowlands petition, Dr. Crooks petition about sheep & dogs, and Peter Caubles about his son Willia[ms].

	McKay, Thomas & Jeter are here electioneering very hard.  I think McKay will be elected.

	Mr. McBee has just arrived & brings the news of Joab Mauldins death.  I met Dr. Goodwyn going up to see him at the instance of Mrs. Mauldin, but turned back on receiving a message that Mauldin would be dead before he could reach Greenville.  He told me that there were one hundred & fifty Methodist Preachers on the cars going up Monday & they had been furnished with a paper where they were to stay.

	  The Governors message is pretty fierce & firery.  Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts enquired after you.  Col. Hayne also.  Young DeTreville who once was at our house came up & spoke to me yesterday.  He is very much improved.  I have onlyto  Rhett at a distance & have not yet spoken to him. 

	I hope you are getting on very well with our Methodist friends, the children & the servants.

	The Governor has one of Dr. Fairs houses & Col. Allen has another.  But Janney has a greater crowd than I ever saw here.  Yeadon has gone to Roaches old House.  I am sorry for that.  Pope is here & is as lively as ever.  Memminger came today & Judge Frost.  I sit at Dr. LeContes table with Pope & others by invitation of Mrs. LeConte.  She sits at the head of the table & assigned me a seat on her left & the Dr. on her right.  Pope said to her she was the presiding Empress of our table.

	I have bought a new hat & waistcoat.  The weather is very warm & I cannot wear my overcoat.  

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  God bless you & the children.  Give my respects to Stacey & Ship[]p].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday, just after the House adjourned and as I was going to dine with Col. [Joseph Duncan] Allen.  I was glad to hear you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist clergy.  I was afraid they would give you trouble.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  In the evening I dined with Col. Allen & then went to the Board of Trustees.  The Col. gave us a fine dinner.  Edm[und] Rhett, Yeadon, General Edwards, Pope, [Francis Wellman] Fickling, [James H.] Norwood and others were guests.  Yeadon is low spirited.

	I have notice yesterday of my Bill to establish a separate court of appeals.  Rhett got a copy of it & introduced the Bill in the Senate.  [William Sidney] Mullins from the Pee Dee introduced a Resolution yesterday to dissolve the Union.	  But I do not think it merits any serious consideration.  The Harpers Ferry affair has excited everybody very much against the north & very.  If I thought the northern people generally entertained the sentiments of Wendel[l] Phillips,  Smith &c. I too should be in favor of a dissolution.  But I do not believe such sentiments are entertained by the statesmen of the north or the masses of the north.

	Bryant sent me a Bill of your Books yesterday--$28.35 which I will pay this morning.

	I saw Dr. Laborde yesterday & he enquired after you kindly.  I got the Board of Trustees to subscribe for twenty volumes of his Book. 

	I was invited yesterday to dine with Gov. Gist, but was previously engaged to Col. Allen

	I will write a letter for the Patriot the last of this week.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from W.H. Cooper of Spartanburg yesterday saying he was coming down to Columbia to get me to file a Bill of Injunction to restrain the administration of his Fathers Estate from carrying slaves out of the State.  So I have law business as well as Legislation to attend to.

	Mr. Petigru & Governor Allston came up last night & were at the Board.  This morning I breakfasted with Mr. Petigru & gave him a Brief in Stokes & Sullivans case.

	I must conclude & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  I have to go into court at ten oclock to finish the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  I was all day yesterday engaged in the argument of the case & did not get to vote for Mc.  Thomas beat him badly.  Mr. Petigru argues the case of Stokes this morning & I was with him last night till a late hour preparing for the argument.

	I have drawn up a set of Resolutions to submit in the House today on Harpers Ferry.  There is no excitement here on the subject.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist ministers, children & servants.  Mr. Young knows Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p]s father & says he was a Lawyer of considerable distinction, but a very rough, uncouth profane man.  He saw him once  sitting in the piazza of the Hotel at Court in the summer  in his shirt sleeves & barefooted!

	In conversation yesterday with a number of gentlemen Col. Isaac Hayne remarked that I was regarded as the extreme of non resistance in South Carolina & yet no other Southern State had ever yet come up to mu platform as laid down in our State Convention.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I had a long political chat with Edmund Rhett.  By the by he tells me that Mrs. Rhett has not been able to leave Charleston yet & he wishes she had remained at Greenville.

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & will write you a few lines enclosing Col. Ashmores letter which I know will gratify you.

	Today after writing you I went to the Court House with Mr. Petigru & concluded the argument in the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  Chancellor Wardlaw expressed himself in my favor & Chancellor Johnston expressed doubts.  Chancellor Dunkin said nothing.  Mr. Petigru made a pretty good speech, but nothing remarkable.  There is not so much in great men as their reputation gives them.

	When I got through the Court I went to the Legislature & introduced a set of resolutions which produced quite a sensation in the House.  They took the members so much by surprise that I was applauded.  My Resolutions are very strong & you will probably see them in the papers.    Copies of them were in great demand by the Editors & Reporters.

	I have paid Mr. Bryant $28.85cts your Bill & I suppose it right.  But how come it so much more than the Bill sent you.

	Mr. Stokes goes up in the morning & so does Price.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	This is Sunday & a very bad day.  I have just had my breakfast & will write you a few lines.  I wrote you two letters by Saturdays mail which makes up for my omission the day before.  I have just written a long letter & an interesting one for the patriot, two sheets of foolscap, to which I refer you for much news.

	At the breakfast table I met Col. Thomas of N.C. & got to talking with him on rail roads.  I did not get up from the table till ten oclock.  It is now too late to go to church & the weather is bad.  I recei[ve]d your letter last night & was glad to hear you were all well & doing well.

	The Hotel is filling up with Ladies for commencement.  Col. Henderson came with sixone a Miss Scott he says is related to you.  I told her I was happy to meet a kinswoman of my wife.  She is not pretty.  Hendersons daughters are not very pretty either.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte for several days.  The other night she spoke of you as being the neatest & best housekeeper she had ever seen.  She said after living as I did at home, she did not know how I could put up with such a Hotel as the Congaree.  The Board of Trustees have ordered a House to be built for Dr. LeConte & Mrs. LeConte says it shall be a picture of a House.  I told her I would move in the Board to have her put on the building committee with the Dr. & Mr. DeSaussure.  Tell Willie Mrs. LeConte enquires very particularly after him & wishes to know how he is studying.  She may be thinking of themade Lula.

	I have heard nothing from Frank except through Col. Ashmore & yourself.  He ought to write me.

	The excitement is becoming very strong against the north & in favor of disunion.  But I have no serious apprehensions myself of any such thing.

	Bishop Elliott delivered an address in College last night, but I could not venture out to hear him.  I was anxious to hear him too.

	Tell Fannie Mr. Janneys little daughter enquired kindly about her & was anxious I should have brought her down with me.

	Say to Hext, Hayne & Arthur I will bring them some presentHext a knife.  Mr.  Clark whom we met of the Rail Road last summer between New York & Philadelphia says he never saw a little girl like Fannie.  She was so quick tothe boot to& get her seat, so disposed to take care of herself &c.

My dear Liz

	I have just recei[ve]d your letter & write you immediately to relieve you of all unpleasant feeling  as to my consistency.  My resolutions were offered in strong language to rebuke the fanatical spirit of the north & express what would be the consequence of its going on.  I further wish for South Carolina to do nothing & let the other Southern States act & I am sure their course with be wise.  There is a dispensation here to act.  My object is to keep the State from acting & leading off.  I say again I have no apprehensions of disunion. But we are getting into a terrible excitement & I am afraid South Carolina will again act foolishly.

	Judge Longstreet made a most bitter & fiery speech today at the college to the graduates on disunion & slavery.  It was out of place & will not add much to the Judges reputation as a literary President.

	Mrs. LeConte told me at dinner that she heard a lady in the college pay me a very high compliment.  The Lady said I was the finest looking & most dignified of all the Board of Trustees & looked like Washington.   Mrs. LeConte sends her love to you.

	I was glad to receive Col. Ashmores letter.  I will send Frank the money when he writes me.

	I will send you Bryants Bill.  But I expect it is all right.

	The weather is bad, & Mr. Stokes did not return today.

	I am glad you are getting on so well with the Methodist Preachers.  But you must have too many of them.  They will all be gone tomorrow or next day & I suppose you will feel relieved.

	I write you in a great hurry.  The Commencement was not a very fine onenot as many ladies as usual.  The Fair has broken up the commencement.  The ladies all come down then & dont care to come again.

	In regard to Fannies going I dont approve of it.  But will be at home or write you again before the 20th.  You dont know that Mr. Wallace wishes her company & he is unknown to me.  

	It is now growing dark & I must conclude.  Dr. Crook wrote a long letter about an abolitionist  taken up in Greenville named Willis.  The excitement has reached Greenville & will run over the State like wildfire.  Much foolery will be committed I have no doubt.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I rece[ive]d your letter at four oclock and will write you a line before going to meet the Board of Trustees.  I have just eaten dinner and rece[ive]d three notes to collect in Greenville for the Johnson Female University.

	Stokes returned today & told me he saw William.  He says he did not know his house when he got home.  It was so filled with Methodist Preachers.

	The death of Cook was very sad.  There was a sad death herethat of Col. Ballenger.  Governor Adams too is not expected to live.

	I saw Barnwell Rhett here today.  He congratulated me on my Resolutions and I told him extremes sometimes met.  He said yes & interlocked.  fell on different sides of a river & met, formed an island & were fruitful.  My Resolutions are perfectly harmless, & just right.  They contemplate no action unless the whole South will act and they give a severe rebuke to the north.  If such sentiments become general at the north we must separate.  

	Nothing was done in the legislature today, except to pass a Bill to elect an additional Judge.  There was a Bill to protect sheep from dogs which passed.  I am still receiving petitions from Dr. Colcock on that subject.

	Col. Orr came today & could not get a room at this Hotel.  He came up into my room & dressed & then went to the Assembly House.  If I had been here I would have left in my room as Young has gone.  I have a room to myself.  The Hotel is very much crowded.  Seven ladies in one room & only one had for them.  I heard Whaley say, who came up with them, I have two large double beds in my room & ought to propose to exchange with them.

	My law cases will not come up before next week & then I am ready to go home.  I am really tired & disgusted with legislating.

	I will send you what the mercury says of my resolutions.  We took a vote today which shows that the disunionists are not so strong as I expected.

	In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now dark & I have just got up from dinner.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & was reading it till my regular seat at the dinner table was taken.  Mrs. LeConte said, as she got up from the table, that I ought to come to the table always in time to secure my seat as it destroyed the pleasure of dinner not to have me to talk to.  She had with her at the table today two young ladies.

	Whilst Col. Menninger was speaking today on the Blue Ridge Rail Road, Judge frost came & took me into the Library to give me some instructions, & there I met Miss [Dorothea] Dix.  I spoke to her & told her who I was.  She said she ought to have recognized me.  She was talking to Col. Hampton about the Lunatic Asylum.  She has grown fat & stout, & has [a] new set of teeth.  She seems a great favorite with the members.  I had very little conversation with her as I had to return into the Representation Hall.  She enquired about you.

	Yesterday I did not have time to write you as I had to meet Judge Frost & Trenholm on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.

	The Chancellors have ordered the case of Stokes & Sullivan to be reargued in May.  This is a good sign for my clients.  

	Stokes went down to the Rail Riad depot today to see the Methodist preachers.  He said there were five cars full.  I saw major Warren of Camden who told me Greenville hadhospitality & he was delighted with our village.  

	You will see in the Carolinian some fellow hashis hats Perry Hats.  The fire eaters are beginning to find out the depth of my Resolutions & do not like them so much as they did at first.  My object in offering them was to prevent action on the part of the state, for I believe that the northern people will yet come right & we shall have no disunion.  But the State ought to express herself strongly in regard to her course.

	I shall perhaps tomorrow, speak on the Rail Road.

	A man came to me today & gave me five dollars for counsel & advice.  I wasnt spared in purchasing books for you.  I asked forbut Bout did not have it.  I see it advertised in Charleston & will have it ordered.

	I met today Col.  of Charlotte who enquired after you very kindly.  The ladies are all gone from this Hotel.

	I hope you will not have rest after the Preachers have left you.  

	The weather is very cold & I wore my overcoat to the House.  You cannot imagine how much attention it attracted.  They all said I looked like a Russian Emperor & everybody wants one like it.  Dozens of members enquired where they could get one.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Tell Major Bolling his case is ordered to be reargued next Spring.  This is a great victory & I have hopes of a success.

	The Blue Ridge was killed today in the House suddenly & before I made my speech.  I do not care.  South Carolina will never do anything & is fit for nothing but to quarrel with the Union.  I am disgusted with the Legislature& with politics.  Hereafter the State may pursue her own course & I will pursue my profession & live at home in the bosom of my family, caring nothing about public matters.  I hope Willie will never engage in political life, but devote himself to his profession.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  I rece[ive]d a letter this evening from General Thompson saying my Resolutions had given him great satisfaction.  Hammond son of the Senator came to me today & said his uncle requested him to tell me that my resolutions filled his heart with patriotism.

	The weather is very cold & my overcoat is most comfortable.  I tried to get sa dressing gown but could not.  You must have me one made out of& nice material.  Can you not do this before I return  home.  Have it well padded & lined.  Make it after my old one.  Clara can do it.  Have it thick & warm.  I suppose you can get the padding in Greenville such as ladies use for their pretty coats, or cotton preferred.  

	I have heard nothing from Frank.  I will write him in time to send the money for his visit to Washington.  

	Governor Adams has an internal, ulcers in the entrails, which are very painful & killing him.  I want to see you all very much & when I get through with my law cases I shall return never to come back as a member of the House.

	I have just received your letter & Franks, also one from Mr. Arthur.  Col. Orr dined with me today & I left the Legislature before it adjourned.  We had a pleasant dinner & just as we left the room we met Mrs. LeConte going in to dinner.  Dr. LeConte has gone to Georgia & left her here.  I like Col. Orr very much & we agree very well in our political views.  I met John Cunningham as Col. Orr & myself were leaving Governor Gist today & he told me that his mother was delighted with my resolutions & took me again to her heart.

	Col. Orr, Sullivan & myself called to get a pardon from the Governor for young Sullivan & he granted it.  Nothing occurred in the Legislature today worth mentioning.  My Bill for a separate Court of appeals comes up on Monday.  I have hopes of its passage, although it was killed in the Senate yesterday.

	I am glad to hear Frank is doing well & will write him tomorrow & send him $20.00.  Though I may wait till he writes to me.

	I sent you this morning by Wells two Books & have the other two to read.  So your letter came too late to make the present in money.  I hope the Books willas well.

	I am sorry to learn the sow had such bad luck with her pigs.  She had better be fattened & [word obscured].  Tell Alfred so.

	Col. Orr invited me to dine with him Monday at the Assembly House.  I will do so.  I will write to Major Bolling tomorrow.  I will also write to the Patriot tomorrow..

	My cases in law come up Tuesday & when I get through them I will be ready to return home.  I would give a great deal if I could be at home today & return Monday.

	Mr. Arthur wrote me about a Bill which he says the Episcopal church will present.  I saw old Mr. Bryce this evening who told me he was at my House.  I saw Dr. Smith also his nephew.

Letter 542
Saturday night
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I did not go down to the Legislature this evening as the weather is bad, & nothing of interest before the House.

	I received your letters & one from Col. Ashmore this evening.  The Colonel says my Resolutions are extremely all in Washington as the very thing, & that others submitted are all stuff.  He writes gloomily, & thinks disunion fast approaching.

	It is probable that our Legislature will adjourn to meet the first Monday in May.  It is to be voted on tonight.  I am very willing as I shall have to come down anyhow.  We did nothing in the Legislature today.  Last night we had a warm discussion on the Spartanburgh & Asheville Rail Road [Greenville & French Broad].  Col. [Allen] McFarlan[d] & myself spoke against it.  [James] Farrow and [Oliver Evans] Edwards for it.  There is no danger of the Bill passing.

	Col. McFarland told me the other day that his mother enquired about you & cried, & said you had shown her more civility at Greenville than anyone else.

	This morning Governor Manning came to me and told me that the people were preparing to tar & feather a Massachusetts stone cutter who had declared himself an abolitionist.  Shortly afterwards I heard the mob shouting.  They made two negro men take him and whip him!  This is horrible & so regarded by thinking men, but the people are run mad & I fear will commit outrages all over the State.  This poor fellow had simply told that he was an abolitionist.  I did not hear that he had in any way interfered with slaves.

	I have just heard that Mr. Everett & Mrs. Carson are to be married.  You know she was in Boston when we were there.  Everett must be seventy & she cannot be more [than] thirty five.  This will be a union between Massachusetts & South Carolina.

	John Cunningham tells me that Pamela is better than she has been for ten years.  She may get well in her old age.  Mr. Everett ought to have married her.  But he has got a much more buxom wife in Mrs. Carson.

	I told Mrs. LeConte that you said it was a pitty that Frank was too young for Lula, but that I was going to write you, I could substitute Willie who was about the right age.  She says Lula will make a good wife.  I hope not so gay, & fond of admiration as she is.  She goes to the State House every day & stays up in the gallery till we adjourn.  She says she oversees herself in looking at the members & watching their movements whilst no discussion is going on.  Mrs. Spratt is with her every day, & she is a very pleasant & smart lady.

	I will now go down & get supper & will write you again tomorrow.  I rece[ive]d a note today from Miss Dix suggesting me to aid in the passage of a law about the Asylum.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	The clock has just struck seven, & I will write you a few lines before breakfast, as I take dinner today with Col. Orr at the Assembly House & will have no opportunity of writing you in the evening.  At ten oclock l I go to the court of appeals to hear decisions read.  At two my Bill for a separate court of appeals comes up & I shall have to speak on it.  My cases in the lower court of appeals will be taken up tomorrow I hope.

	Last night after I had gone to bed  & after ten oclock someone knocked at my door & I asked who was there.  No reply was given & without getting out of bed I unlocked the door.  A gentleman came in, shook me most cordially by the hand whilst I was still in bed & asked if I did not know him.  There was a glimmering light in the room & his voice [&] manner & laugh reminded me very much of Captain Cunningham.  But I remembered he was dead & did not think it likely the old gentleman had taken the trouble to pay me a friendly visit from the spirit world at that unreasonable hour.  The question was proposed to me again, dont you recognize my voice.  I had to confess I did not know him as my spectacles were off & the room dimly lighted by a few coals from the hearth.  But still I thought of no one but Captain Cunningham.  The size too suited very well.  Had the Captain been in this world I should have promptly said Captain Cunningham.  He replied you say, Ben.  I then got up & lighted a candle & he sat & talk[ed] with [me] an hour.  He was just on his return from South America & had stopped in Columbia to see his daughter who is at the Barhamville Academy.  His wife & family returned last Summer to Alabama & his eldest daughter was then placed here at school.  He is stout & fat & looks old.  He enquired of you, & how many children I had.  He has three only & has lost one.  He had returned by way of Paris & London & is now a union man.  He says it will never do to break up the union & that slavery will be gone if we do.  England will leave against us & crush us.  Heretofore he has been a disunionist.  He said it seemed strange to think I had a son reading law & he a daughter grown.  She is as large as you are he says & will remain two years at school yet. 

	Mrs. LeConte asked me last night if I knew the gentleman in Greenville who married Mary Hardin of SavannahIsrail Charles.  She says he is terribly taken in & has got a devil.  The brother of her last husband, Hardin, married Doctor LeContes sister.  It was his daughter that was here with Mrs. LeConte last week.  She says the father of Mrs. Charles was a perfect devil.  She was in love with Hardin her second husband & he made her marry a preacher.  For a short time the Preacher sued for a divorce.  She then married Hardin but had a son by her first husband who killed his stepfather & was to be tried for murder.   One week before he died in Greenville.  Mrs. LeConte enquired if he did die, for she thought the report was not true.  I told her that a young man who passed as her son really died in Greenville.  She says Mrs. Charles is highly connected in Georgia.  

	I wrote letters yesterday to Col. Ashmore, General Thompson & the Patriot.  I thought I would wait a day or two [to] receive a letter from Frank before writing him.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & that you are all are getting on well since the Methodists have left you.  

	I must now close my letter & go to breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Ben Yancey has turned union man & says England will crush the Slave States if they dissolve the union.  Tell your mother there is no danger of War or disunion.  The northern people are getting right again.  Their meetings in Boston & New York were glorious.  I am now very busy with my law cases& will get through in a day or two.  Yesterday my separate court of appeals was defeated in the House.  But Rhetts Bill passed the Senate & we will try & pass it in the House.  The House is now discussing the Slavery question.  I shall not be able to be there today.

       General Easl[e]y & Goodlett came down yesterday.  Easl[e]y told me a great deal of news about Greenville and the abolitionist extremist there.  Mrs. Spratt came up the other day & I told her she ought to have heard her husbands speech & I told her she ought to have come sooner to have heard her husbands speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  She asked me in Spratts presence if he made a good speech.  I told her the Blue Ridge was between us whilst he was speaking & I could not see his performance well.
       
       I sent you two books by Poinsett Wells which I hope you rece[ive]d.  I know you will be pleased with the Gregson Letters.  I will speak to Stokes about sending the books.

	Dr. Fair invited me to dine with him tomorrow which invitation I have accepted.  Col. Allen invited me to dine with him this evening but I declined as I had promised Mrs. LeConte to take an oyster supper with her & her brother Joseph & his wife & others in her parlor.

	 Today we had an interesting discussion in the House on selling free negroes for crime.  I gave Col. Memminger a little.  He told me at dinner he had never seen me look so savage as I did.  Mrs. LeConte said I was greatly exited.  I did not think so.

	I argued the case of Dickey & Barrett today in the Court of appeals.  Tomorrow my other case will go on & then I shall be ready to go home if the Blue Ridge & separate court are not passed.  Both Bills are coming up again.

	I will now close & go to supper.  You tell all your friends there is no danger of abolitionists, or war or disunion.  I fear the people will make fools of themselves in Greenville.

	I gave theto Stokes today & he will bind them very reasonably for $1.29 per copy in black Morrocco with gilt &c.  They will be finished next week.

	I wrote you a long letter last night & enclosed Col. Ashmores to you as he mentions Frank.

	In regard to Fannys visit tell her I want to see her when I get home & I think she will improve more at home than with Miss Wallace.  There would be trouble in her returning.  The weather will be cold & unpleasant & she may take cold running about in the country.  I should be uneasy, & I know nothing of the family she is going to visit nor has she received an invitation from any of the family except the little girl.  I do not think Fanny is so bad off for a visit.  After poor dear Annas fate, I am unwilling for her to be abroad from us.  Tell Fanny I will buy Simms History of S.C. for her, & she may read that during Christmas.  I have bought a beautiful little knife for her to clean her nails with &c.  I bought a knife apiece for Hext, Hayne, Arthur & Luther & a whip apiece.

	I mentioned to you in a letter, last week, that I had sent Frank $20.00.  I saw Mr. F today, & he enquired about you.  I have not yet given him the poetry,  I gave Miss Janney hers & Mrs. LeConte hers & Miss Grahams & Lulas.  She says it is beautiful & has poeticin it.  She said she liked Franks letter very much & that she was more anxious to see him than ever & that Lula was anxious to have seen him last summer.

	In one of your letters last week you asked me if I thought Mrs. LeConte loved her husband.  I dont think any wife who is so fond of the admiration of gentlemen as she is can love her husband or anyone else.  But I do not think she is bad hearted.  I have never thought polite people & people kind to everybody very affectionate.  Politeness & fashion assume the place of affection.  No one has a heart for all the world.  But I think Mrs. LeConte has kindness & goodness of heart.  Someone was talking about the poor fellow whipped here yesterday and she begged him to stop, that it made her sick.

	I see in the Carolinian this morning a communication nominating me for Governor.  Who could have written it I have no idea.  But it is well written as you will think.  But I do not desire any such empty honor & if I did there is no possibility of its being given to me at this time.

	Mrs. Spratt, this morning at the breakfast table, said I must bring you down with me in May, if the Legislature met.  I said I was going to come down in May anyhow to the Court of appeals & you were to come with me.  I like Mrs. Spratt.  She seems good & smart.  She told me that she did not see me in my seat in the House last night.  I told her I was more agreeably employed in writing a long letter to you.  She said that was a good excuse for a husband to make.  I have a standing invitation to take tea with her & Mrs. LeConte in Mrs. Ls parlor every evening, but I have only been once.

	I arrived here safely as our dear friend Stacey prayed that I might do.  My room was retained for me, & I took into it my old friend H[enry] C[linton] Young who was without a room.  There was a great crowd on the cars as I came down & no less than five.

	I went to the court this morning & saw twenty six students admitted Rice amongst them.  I then went with Chancellor Johnston to his room to get a decree for the sale of Mayor Smiths land.  He spoke to me of the letter he had written you.  I told him it was very gratifying to you.  He said, a parent might think it was a back breaking affair to loose a child & it was bad enough for he had experienced it, but it was nothing to loosing a wife.  No human misery & affliction was like that which he too had drunk to the dregs.  He then spoke of his first wife, & I thought strange of it as he married another wife soon after the death of his first.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly & affectionately after you & all the children.  Mrs. LeConte is not so stout as she was.  Lula will graduate next July & return home in the fall.  Dr. LeConte has a niece with him who reminded me of Lula.

	There was nothing done in the Legislature yesterday or today.  I presented Mrs. Rowlands petition, Dr. Crooks petition about sheep & dogs and Peter Caubles about his son Will[page torn] .

	Mr. Kay, Thomas & Jeter are here electioneering very hard.  I think Mr. Kay will be elected.

	Mr. McBee has just arrived & brings the news of Joab Mauldins death.  I met Dr. Goodwyn going up to see him at the instance of Mrs. Mauldin, but turned back on receiving a message that Mauldin would be dead before he could reach Greenville.  He told me that there were one hundred & fifty Methodist Preachers on the cars going up on Monday & they had been furnished with a paper stating where they were to stay.

	The Governors Message is pretty fierce & firery.  Col. Watts enquired after you.  Col. Hayne also.  Young DeTreville who once was at our house came up & spoke to me yesterday.  He is very much improved.  I have onlyto Rhett at a distance & not yet spoken to him.  

	I hope you are getting on well with our Methodist friends, the children & the servants.   

	The Governor has one of Dr. Fairs houses and Col. Allen has another.  But Janney has a greater crowd than I ever saw.  Yeadon has gone to Roaches old House.  I am sorry for that.  [Joseph Daniel] Pope is here & is as lively as ever.  Memminger came today & Judge Frost.  I sit at Dr. LeContes table with Pope & others by invitation of Mrs. LeConte.  She sits at the head of the table & assigned me a seat on her left & the Dr. on her right.  Pope said to him she was the presiding Empress of our table.

	I have bought a new hat & waistcoat.  The weather is very warm& I cannot wear my overcoat.

Your last letter too was grattifying, informing us that you [had] risen to a higher section.  I now feel as if you had commenced improving & was disposed to study harder than you do.  Your pride ought to stimulate you to study.  You have talent enough to make yourself a great man & you have fine looks & a good disposition and good principles.  Nothing wanting but hard study to make you the pride of your family, & the ornament of your country.  How good a boy must feel, to excel his associates, & how mean he must feel, to see others surpassing him in his studies.   

	When I was at school I would not for my life let any boy get ahead of me in my studies.  If a boy turned me down in spelling even I would cry heartily.  I now enjoy the advantages of such a spirit.  But for it I should have been nothing but an humble laborer & cultivator of the Earth.

My dear Son

	Your letter telling us about your demerits gave us great mortification.  That you should be so regardless of the rules of the academy is very surprising.  Your demerits were owing to your idleness & carelessness.  Why do you have visitors, when you know it is against the rules?  Your idleness is the cause of your low standing in your class.  How much better would it be to study hard & stand as you say Walker & Bacot will.  Have you no friends, no ambition, no love of distinction?  You ought to try & stand at the head of your class.  You can behave well, that is certain, if you will try.

	I hope my dear son you will make up the next month for your deficiency during the past.  Let your next Report be a good one.  Remember the interest we all feel in you.  Remember how all of your acquaintances here enquire after you.  Remember how much interest Col. Orr & Col. Ashmore have taken in you.  You were improving & dont fall back again.  

	Willie returned last Monday & succeeded in getting the negroes he went after.  He is pleased with his trip.

	I start on the circuit next week & will be constantly employed till summer.

	We are all well.  There was the cry of fire last night.  A shop of Lynn Watsons was burnt.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	I have time to write you only a few lines.  I have just finished a long article for the Columbia Carolinian nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency.  In the morning I start to Anderson court & will be gone most of the week.

	We are all well.  I bought a Poney for Fannie this week.  He paces finely& when you return he will do for you to ride.

	Your letter was rece[ive]d last week.  Your Report has not been rece[ive]d.  My dear son study hard & be a good boy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

       I went to Pickens court last Sunday & got Willie to write you.
       
       Your Report came some days since & I was sorry to see that you had rece[ive]d so many demerits during the past month.  You know all the rules & regulations of the School & ought to try & observe them all.  Do my son behave well & study hard.  I wish to see an improvement in your standing every month.  Let your standing be higher & higher till you get to the head of your class.  It gives your mother & myself so much pleasure to learn you are doing well and so much pain to hear the reverse.
       
	I have heard that Tom Jones has rece[ive]d an appointment at Annapolis.  He is not a steady boy & I am afraid he may lead you estray.  Be on your guard when he enters your school.  Be kind to him & assist in keeping him right.    But do not let him have any influence over your conduct for evil.

	I saw Col. Elliott Keith at Pickens court who has been living in Georgia & he told me that he saw Hooper last Summer, & asked about you.  He speaks well of Hooper & his Father.  In your letters write about all your acquaintances & friends.

	Our court commences tomorrow.  We shall be very busy.  I go to the State Convention in two weeks.  Col. Orr is spoken of for President in this state & elsewhere.

	We are all well.  Lindy had two babies whilst I was at Pickens court & is doing well.  The twins are fine looking, boy & girl.  So my servants are increasing rapidly.

	Hext is at General Thompsons.  He went up on the Pony by himself.

	Nothing more but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Pinckney Irvine & W S called to see us yesterday & asked about you.

& Myself for Cooley, & Sullivan & Henderson for Chapman.  The costs of the case had amounted to $3,000.  There was a mistrial last Summer.  I gained it this time.  Oberly was convicted of an assault & Battery & sentenced to six months imprisonment.  He has now been in jail one year &has two more to stay.  

	I am so busy here that I shall not go to Spartanburgh court.  Next week I go to Laurens court & the week after to Columbia & then to Charleston.

	I arrived here safely yesterday evening & sent right away your bundle to Mrs. Taylor.  The boy told me Mrs. Taylor had something to send me to carry home &c.

	My trip down was pleasant.  Elford, Gaillard & Stewart were on the cars.  At Newberry Dr.  & Col. Fair got on the cars.  I saw Wiley.  He seemed very well.  Dr. Mooney came aboard at Alston.    Col. Orr was detained at Laurens court.  There are only two delegates here yet from Charleston.  There is however a crowd of persons at this Hotel from all parts of the country, New York &c.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seem very kind & enquired much about you & Fannie, Willie & Frank.  Today she showed me a letter from Lulas teacher as I had shown her Franks letter.  The letter gives Lula a lovely character, highest intellect, & fairest loveliness.  Mrs. LeConte said she would very much [like] to see Frank.  

	Mrs. LeConte gave me a most interesting account of Mrs. Charles character & history.  She would make a fine story for anovel.  I will tell it to you when I see you.  It is most extraordinary.  Best say nothing.

	Dr. Talley dined with us today.  His brother is building a fine House for Miss Thompson.  I was mistaken, she never was married but has tried often.

	I met Dr. Laborde & Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts who enquired after you kindly.  

	I did not go to church today, but read life of Jackson.  Your uncle Arthur is frequently mentioned in the account of the battle of New Orleans and favorably.

	I saw Mrs. Lipscomb on the cars.  Col. Pickens daughter.  She has grown stout & looks well.

  	I bought Lord Elgins mission to China.

       Dr. LeConte says Judge Longstreet is not going to resign.  The college is doing well.
       
       Mrs. LeConte asked me what sort of fellow Willie said Memmingers son was.  Shew had heard he was curious.  She had heard about him in Paris.
       
       I wish you & Fannie were with me.  You she ever saw.  Old Dr. LeContes son is to be married.  The old Dr. is very ill & can[not] live long.

	I have just returned from the Convention & it is 11 oclock in the night.  Col. Orr was elected President.  I made the motion to call the Convention to order & have Col. Wilson Chairman & Col. Buist Secretary.  We had some speaking & I joined in.  It is understood that I am to be one of the State delegates but I may be mistaken.

	I got my boots &c. & your letter by Duncan.  I submitted Resolutions this evening as to Platform &c.  I saw Col OHanlon who enquired after you & children.  Governor Adams is getting well!  I was truly sorry to hear of Baylis [Earles] death.  He is safe in heaven if anyone ever went there.  He was as good a man as I ever knew & tell Becky so.  I have seen a great many friends today.  Col. Johnson, Hampton, Wilson &c. &c.  Greenville is fully represented by.

	I was unanimously elected a delegate to the Convention by Union, Spartanburgh, Anderson, Pickens & Greenville.  Reed my colleague got the vote only of the four last named districts.

       By some inferior management Col. Preston & myself were defeated for the State at large by Boyleston & McGowan.  However we are both elected by two Congressional districts which does as well.  There is no difference in the convention.

	I felt so much fatigued with the Convention that I concluded last night to stay here today & go to Charleston in the morning.  Mr. Janney urges me too to stay & take a family dinner with him & his daughters which I have just done.  He treated [me] to champaign & had rather a better dinner than usual.  Most of the members have gone & the House is lonesome.  We have had a fine rain & I hope most sincerely it has extended to Greenville.  I have spent the day in reading Life of Jackson & writing a letter for the Patriot.

	This morning whilst I was talking to Col. Watts & Simpkins a gentleman came up behind me & slapped me on the shoulder.  I looked round & who should it be but Governor Adams!  I felt very much like meeting a dead man & my eyes filled with tears.  He looks very well!  He seems full of life & spirit & says I must go down from the Court of Appeals & stay a while with him.  Dr. Geddings told him last winter to go home & prepare to diethat he could not live six weeks.  Dr. Fair told him he might live two or three months & perhaps not so many weeks!  He attributes his recovery to pills given him by Northrop of Charleston.  Dr. Fair thinks however that he is not cured & cannot be cured.

	  I rece[ived another invitation to stay at a private house in Charleston.  Mr. Pope said B of     Virginia was to stay with him & some others.  He had still one room left & invited me very kindly to come & occupy it.  I told him I was engaged to Dr. Porcher.

	I sent you a bundle from Mrs. Taylor by Duncan who went up this morning.  Duncan returns Saturday morning.  I suppose I shall not hear from you this evening as you expect I am in Charleston.  The rain will make it more pleasant travelling tomorrow & more pleasant after I get to Charleston.

	I will write to Frank this evening or when I go to Charleston.  Being all day by myself I wish I had gone home & returned Saturday.  But by going down I shall see more of the members.  

	I hope you and the children are all well.  I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  I have just thought of a fix McMeekin of Greenville was in the other day in the Cars.  He & his wife who was a Charleston woman separated some years ago.  He went to Texas & got a divorce.  Then he went to New York & got married again.  He & his last wife got on the cars at Spartanburgh to go to Charleston & who should be aboard but his first wife!  They had to travel all the way to Charleston together.  Was he not in a bad fix travelling in the same car with two wives? and seated close together I understand!  His wives had an opportunity of seeing each other.  He must have thought the journey a very long one!

	I arrived here yesterday evening to look for lodgings at the Mills House till tomorrow evening.  Dr. Porcher called to see me yesterday evening and he will call to take me to his House.  He seemed very kind.  I am glad I stopped here first as it enabled me to see & become acquainted with Many of the delegates as they came in.

	  Last evening Col. Mordecai took Col. Orr & myself to the Catholic Fair, where there was a great crowd of Ladies, but not one pretty one amongst them.  He then carried us to his House where we drank a bottle of champaign smoked some good segars and looked [at] a beautiful collection of paintings curiosities collected by him in Italy last summer twelve month.  He also introduced us to his daughters four or five pretty little.

	I have rece[ive]d another invitation by Mr. Al to stay with him.  Hayne passed by the Mills House yesterday &to me without stopping to speak.  General Butler of Kentucky a brother of General William O[rlando] Butler who ran for Vice President with General [Lewis] Cass, requested me yesterday to go with him to see your uncle Arthur this morning.  He says his brother who was in the battle of New Orleans with your uncle made him promise to go & see Col. Hayne before he left the city.

	Tonight I am going to see T Hayne act her farewell to Charleston.  The crowd of delegates coming in is immense.  In my room there are three cots besides the bed.  But before they are occupied I shall be at Dr. Porchers & will be glad to get out of the crowd.

	No one can conjecture with any certainty as to who will be the nominee of the Convention.  I rather think Douglas may be.

	In the Mercury is a very full account of all that was done in the convention at Columbia.  My speeches are fully reported.  In the Courier they are not.

	I have nothing more to write you.  I enquired at the Post office for letters, but got none.  You & Willie must both write me as often as you can.

	Dr. Porcher has just called & handed me your letter.  I will therefore write you a line.  Mr. Butler did not call to go to your uncle Arthurs as we [word blotted] last night.  I was therefore at leisure.  Your cousin E has just sent a little servant boy  to say to me..I have time I will.  I have just seen Col. Memminger & Mrs. Yeadon & Mr. Spratt said Mrs. Spratt wished to see me & invited me very kindly to come & see him.

       You say my name does not appear in the Carolinian.  The Editor is my friend.  The Mercury gives very full accounts of my speeches, motions &c.  If you will send to the Enterprise office you can see the papers.  There are three of them.
       
       Mr. Spratt said this morning that I ought to have some prominent position in the convention as I would be the finest looking man in it.  I saw this morning Collin Ingersoll & his father in law.  Mr. Spratt & Ingersoll enquired very much about you & your mother & family.  He seems kind.  I told him you looked as young as you did [page toen] you were going to school in New Haven.
       
       .  I am glad the deer has come back & hope you will get her home.  In regard to living in Charleston I prefer Greenville.  There is more ease & pleasure there.  I saw Rice here yesterday from Greenville.  I saw  & Wickenburgh yesterday & they showed me your letter.  I told them it was the latest news I had from home.
       
       The Hotel is filling up rapidly.  The mercury & Courier contain announcements of my arrival in the city at the Mills House.  I write you these little matters as you areto all notoriety respecting myself.
       
       I will now close.  Tell Fannie I am glad she is making progress in French & Music.  She is smart & pretty & will make a great B[word smudged].

	After writing you my second letter yesterday, Mr. Butler came to me & we went to see your uncle Arthur.  The House seemed uninhabited. The outerwe aroused his little grandson.  Then cam a servant & finally Col. Hayne who rece[ive]d us very kindly & talked over his battles in which he & Gen. Butler had fought.  The old gentleman is looking remarkably well.  Butler is a fine gentleman.

	In the evening Dr. Porcher came to pay me a visit & wished I should bring with me some friend & he wished a northern man.  I suggested Col. Hagood of Connecticut who is a noble fellow.  But the Col. declined as he had engaged rooms at this Hotel for which he was paying twenty five dollars a day.  He said he wished to be comfortable & it was a matter of very little consequence when he died & whether his heirs had four or five hundred dollars more or less of his Estate!  Col. Hagood is a yankey.  But how have wealthy Southern men taken the same view of the matter.

	In the evening I went to the Theatre to see your cousin T Hayne.  She is very pretty & fine looking.  But when I saw aactor making love to her & kissing her hand I could but feel scorn & contempt for her husband.  I staid only one hour & returned to the Hotel.  Dr. Porcher says she has three children & that such a life for a woman having children is dreadfully hard.  

	The Hotel is now a perfect hog pen & I am delighted to quit it as I will do in a few hours. 

	Today I have met a great many all pleasantlyGouverneur Kemble, b, Rhett, Col. Preston, &c.  I have not yet seen [William L.] Yancey.  John Cunningham told me last night that he would have me at his House next week to meet Yancey.  I saw Judge [Alexander Beaufort] Meek of Alabama, who is a very fine looking gentleman two inches taller than myself!  Mr. Witherspoon one of the South Carolina delegates said today he had proposed to make me & Preston chairman & Vice President for South Carolina as specimens of South Carolina gentlemen.

	I am now at Dr. Porchers & have just returned from dinner.  Judge Jackson of Georgia formerly minister to Austria took dinner with us.  I am very much pleased with Dr. Porcher & Mrs. Porcher.  They are as fine a couple as I have ever seen.  I went to Dr. Philips church today with Gadsden King who married Mrs. Porchers sister & there was introduced to Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  The latter is a most lovely woman.  I saw & spoke to Isaac Hayne and his daughter.  She looks very pretty.  I saw & shook hands with Miss G B who looks as well as she did twenty years ago.  Yesterday evening I went with Dr. Porcher to see the first arrival of the cars from Savannah & there was a very handsome entertainment.  I returned took tea with the Dr. & went to meet the South Carolina delegation.  I returned near twelve oclock & found Dr. & Mrs. Porcher still sitting up awaiting my return.  I have rarely seen three finer looking ladies than Mrs. Porcher & her sisters Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  I have been very fortunate in spending money since I left home.  Janney would not charge me anything.  I staid three days at the Mills House & instead of paying five dollars a day.   only charged me two dollars a day.  I saw general Martin & his son at the rail road celebration & a great many friends.  Mr. Webb enquired after you & said his mother had just rece[ive]d a letter from your mother.  Today I rece[ive]d three letters handed me in [the] presence of Mrs. Porcher & her two sisters & I told them you write me every day & I did the same which seemed to increase theirfor both us.  General Thompson& enclosed a letter for Dudley his wifes cousin from Baltimore.  

	Tell Willie if Mahaffey takes the insolventact he will have to remain till court.  But if he takes theact he can go in ten days if his schedule is not contested.  I will try & come home this week some time.

	I am very busy in the Convention &till midnight every night.  Last night I staid on committee about the New York elections till twelve oclock & then left them.  I have been placed on that committee for South Carolina.  Today we elected General [Caleb] Cushing President of the Convention.  It is the most noisy & disgusting assemblage I ever was in & will leave it to be home Friday night I think.  I am very well pleased with Dr. Porcher & his wife.  They are the kindest people I ever saw.  I am very much pleased with the northern members & have made a great many acquaintances.

The Convention goes on very harmoniously.  I like the northern delegates very much.  They are all in favor of the South & the Constitution.  I have become acquainted with many of them.  Who will be nominated for the Presidency is uncertain.  I do not think Douglass will though the north are united over him.

	I saw Mr. Walker the father of your friend the cadet & he enquired after you.  Your friends here all enquired about you & hope you are doing well.

	There is a chance of nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency or Vice Presidency.  At present the contest is between Douglass & Hunter of Virginia.  But neither will get the nomination.

	You must write me whether you go to sea this summer or not.  I will send you some money when I go home.  How much do you want.

	The Convention has just adjourned till four oclock & I will write you a line or two.  I have had so little time that I have not been able to write you.  

	Yesterday I dined with Mr. Reynolds & had a large company of northern members & we spent a very pleasant time.  I have formed a great many acquaintances & am much pleased with them.  We are all getting on harmoniously.  I met Col. Ingersoll again this morning& delivered your message.  He seems very kind & amiable.

	The Convention is the most disorderly body I ever saw & there is such a scramble that I have not endeavored to get the floor.  Yesterday I made a few remarks, but they are briefly reported.  I went yesterday to see your aunt Eliza & spent a few moments with her.  She seemed kind & good.  I then went at her request to your aunt Tu, but she was not at home.  On my way I met Dr. Hayne who stopped and made himself known to me.  He invited me to see him & his mother.  He looked shab[b]iley & thin.  had not improved him in appearance.  I see your uncle Arthur every day in the convention.

	The committee on platform will report at four oclock & we shall then have discussion.  Yancey
Told me that I would then have myforth.  He looks very well & says his family are all well.  He is a grandfather.  

	Dr. Porcher & wife are as kind as they can be & I am really under great obligations to them.  Mrs. Porcher knows Mrs. LeConte very well as she was raised in Savannah.  She says Mrs. LeContes mother was old Major Porchers housekeeper & the daughters were educated by himbut no kin to him.

	I took a walk on the Battery yesterday & it is a delightful place.  In the evening I met there a great many of my acquaintances.

	I have a great deal to tell you when I see you.  In my letter to Willie I said I would be at home Friday night but I fear this will be impossible.  I will try to be at home Saturday perhaps not till Monday.  It isa all uncertain about the Convention adjourning.

	I have packed up to go home this evening but the South Carolina delegation said I must not.  Col. Orr and General McGowan have urged the matter in such a way that I suppose I must stay. 
 
       The committee have done nothing yet.  The vote is taken Monday morning, & perhaps good faith & honor require me to remain.  I am very much disgusted with the convention, but having a trust confided to me I ought to carry it out.  It is thought I may do something by staying.  But I dont agree with the South Carolina delegation in theirnor with the majority of the Convention.  If we stay we may defeat Douglass nomination & secure that of Dickinson or Breckinridge.
       
	You & Willie & Fanny must come down to Columbia Tuesday or Wednesday & I will meet you there.  I wish you to be sure to come.  You can all come free.  Say I am in Charleston & will be in the rail road convention.  If youany money, borrow of Mrs. Beattie & I will return it.  If I went home I should have to start back the next morning.  So it will be as well for me to remain till the convention adjourns & then meet you in Columbia.  I think you had better come down Tuesday.  I will not be able to go up till Wednesday.  The Convention will not adjourn before Wednesday.  

	You can get Susan to take charge of the children & you bring Susan with you.  Hext may go to General Thompsons & stay.  I am in great perplexity about staying here & going home.  I never before hesitated so much about my course.  But you wrote me to stay, & everyone here says I would not be discharging my duty if I went off.  It will only postpone my seeing you a day or two which I desire above all things and you must meet me in Columbia.

	Tell Willie to come with you & bring Fannie & Susan.  I have not time to write you any more.  I was invited today to dine with Col. Drayton but I do not think I shall.  It is a very bad day.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

We were delayed in Annapolis Saturday & Sunday byrain. But I hope we will now have good weather the rest of the way. 

	I dont like to say much about Franks health for fear that I may either raise your hopes too high, or make you unnecessarily uneasy.

	Willie has got his commission as a Lawyer & has gone to purchase a shotgun.  He speaks of going home in the morning.  He stood a very good examination.  Twenty four admitted & none rejected.

	Edmund Rhett said Willie & Albert Rhetts son who was admitted ought to become acquainted.

	I have been engaged all day & seen very few persons.  Last evening I had a very long talk with Governor Means & Mrs. LeConte.  The Governor complimented me very much & so did General McGowan this morning.  The latter says my ceasing my opposition to the State is spoken of in high terms by all.

	We are a good deal alarmed here by the smallpox.  But I presume there is no danger at present.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d both your letters written yesterday.  I do not think there is any danger of smallpox.  I shall appear before the committee tonight on Barretts case & may return home tomorrow.  But I write for fear I shall not.

	I went down to the House today & all met me with great cordiality.  General McGowan says no man in the States stands higher in the estimation of all gentlemen than I do now.  Simpson told me that he had heard several say that if [I] was a secessionist I would be their candidate for governor.  Senator McCain [McKewn?] told me he heard five senators express the same idea   & that he was willing to vote for me anyhow. 

	I saw General Martin & Col. Isaac Hayne.  They came up & spoke to me most cordially.

	I was invited by Col. Allen to dine with him today but declined.

       I have nothing more to write as I hope to get off in the morning.  But if I do not come you need not be uneasy about the smallpox.
       
       I sent up your packet from Cook by Willie.  Yeadon is gloomy & fears secession will do mischief.
       
       There is great division about Governorten or fifteen candidates.  I suggested Robert Barnwell & also that they should have a caucus & nominate him.  It took well & I believe they will do it.
       
       Col. OHanlon has just left me z& desired to be remembered to you and children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear that Hext was better & Mary had a son.

	I shall try & be at home Saturday evening.  I went before the House committee last night.  But Hodges is going to lead for the Road & I must wait till his papers come.

	I had quite a cordial meeting last night with Mr. Petigru.  He enquired for me as soon as he arrived.  John Cunningham was lavish of his praise of me last in the presence of several gentlemen.  Said he would rather have me as ally in difficulty than any man in the State.  Said he always had the highest regard for my wisdom firmness &honor.  that he had been brought up at my feet & admired & respected me. 

	Mr. Petigru concurs with me entirely.  I saw Governor Allston & Mr. Barnwell.  They seemed very cordial & I have written an article nominating Barnwell for Governor.

	I have not been to the House today & have not seen many persons.  I met Governor Adams who was very kind & not so firery as he was.  He looks old.  His daughters were afraid to come to Columbia on account of smallpox but I believe it is all a mistake.  There is no smallpox here.  Dr. Goodwin says a man who has seen a great deal of says it is a mistake.

	I have only time to write you a few lines.  I have been very busy since I arrived here in reference to the Saluda Road & my cases in court.

	We had a great concourse of persons on the Rail Road todayMethodist preachers going to Conference.  Alston Haynes family were on the cars but I did not know it & did not speak to Mrs. Haynes.

[ca. 1860]

A Trinute of Respect
       The Acting Midshipmen of the United States Military Academy at Annapolis, hearing last summer of the heath of their Friend & Classmate, Benjamin F. Perry, Jr., immediately wrote his Parents & obtained permission to erect over his grave a Monument in testimony of their love and friendship.  This rare & exquisitely piece of monumental sculpture reached our village the other day & now covers the remains of the pure, gallant, generous youth.  It is indeed a noble tribute of youthful friendship.  There is nothing more beautiful & classic in design, or execution, in any cemetery I have ever seen.  It does equal honor to those who designed and the artist, John Baird of Philadelphia, who executed.  The Pedestal is four feet high, the Shaft six, all of thewhite marble.  On the front of the Pillar are inscribed in raised letters, Benjamin Franklin Perry, acting midshipman in the United States Nacy.  Born July 19th 1843, died July 3d 1860.  Aged 17 years.  On the reverse side are the words Erected by the Acting Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy, in testimony of their love & esteem fir their deceased friend and classmate.  On one side of the Pillar, enclosed in a wreath of Laurel oak leaves branch partly covered, are the words, Pure, generous, gallant,  On the other side the familiar name of the decreased, Frank, surrounded with a wreath of Ivy leaves & flowers skillfully intertwined.  The shaft is exquisitely fluted, & ending in a bundle of spears.  Around the Shaft is gracefully folded the United States Flad with the stars & stripes.  At the lower end of the marble column, where it rests on the Pillar is a shield covered with stars & stripes & on the shield in raised lettering are the words, Given to his country, Taken to his Gods.  A large Anchor, with a coil of rope, and a cannon ball, the emblem of the Navy are resting by the side of the shield.  The American Eagleto life & nature is perched on the top 
of the shaft holding in his beak a wreath of Laurels, onea cannon ball and the other resting on the flag of the United States.

	Such a tribute of respect to the memory of their deceased son, by the gallant, generous & noble hearted classmates, has deeply touched the grieving hearts of his parents.  If the enduring qualities of one so young, could have drawn from his associates, such a beautiful & costly tribute of friendship to his memory, what a bright future may they not have hoped for in his manhood.

His Excellency Governor Pickens
My dear Sir

	I take the liberty of enclosing to you the letter of Dexter W. Wells.  He was a young man of good character & killed a man by the name of Head[d]en for seducing his sister.  He was convicted of murder & pardoned by Governor Aiken on the condition of leaving the State & never returning.  He is now in Kentucky and wishes to return and enlist under the Palmetto banner.  I have no doubt he will make a gallant soldier.  He is a young man of sober & good moral character.  If you will pardon him on the condition he enlists in your army, you will receive the services of a gallant fellow.

	He shot Head[d]en in broad daylight in the presence of witnesses & went immediately & gave himself up to the sheriff.

	I received your letter last evening & herewith enclose the paper you were so kind as to send me from St. Petersburgh.

	It would have given me great pleasure to have answered your letter but really I had nothing to write & did not know exactly how too forward my letters.  Had anything transpired in the Legislature relative to anointing the new State House with busts of Revolutionary characters I should have attended to your wishes & the interests & honor of the upper country.

	I wrote on the eve of your Inauguration suggesting the name of my son William H. Perry as one of your aids in the upper country but I see others were appointed and it is perhaps very well.  He is a volunteer in a troop of cavalry which may be called on for service.

	It is known to you that I have always been opposed to breaking yup our Federal Union.  But after the State had seceded I felt bound to sustain her action, & will do so.

	I am with great respect, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I received your letter last night & Fanny also rece[ive]d a letter from you.  We were all glad to hear you had arrived & were well & well pleased with your visit.  You must have had a bad ride from the Rail Road for the roads are really very bad at this season of the year.  We are all well & as quiet as a mouse & very lonely.  All wish you & the children back again.  The servants enquired if any letters had come from mistress, & ever Laura enquired when you were coming back, & expressed a wish for your return.  Alice Roberts staid all night with Fannie Friday night.  Last night no one was here.  Willie & myself have been pretty busy issuing writes.  In the morning I go to Anderson Court& shall expect to meet you at Belton Wednesday evening.  

	Nothing has occur[r]ed.  Bill is well again.  John is spading the garden & Mary has been cleaning the walks.  The weather is fine. & the seeds are coming up beautifully.    We had a rain Friday night.  

	Fannie seems very well pleased with her teacher& is going to school regularly.  Her cold is almost gone.  I have not seen any of your mothers family since you left nor Susans.

	Captain Adams is to be married Thursday evening to Miss Holloway & Willie is one of his groomsmen.  

	No war news yet.  Fort Moultrie fired a gun accidentally at Fort Sumter & Captain Anderson threw out his canon to return the fire when an apology was sent him

	I suppose you & Mrs. Cunningham do not talk politics much.  As you cannot.  Tell her she will live to see the folly of disunion.  I have always admired Mrs. Cunningham very much.  I think she is one of the finest ladies I ever met and I likewise have a very high opinion of Miss Pamela & would be delighted to see them once more.  I hope they will come to Greenville next summer.  Rosemont must look very pretty.  But it is almost like Glencoe, out of the world.

	Judge Magrath wrote me the other day apologizing for not having answered my letter & says Governor Pickens will pardon McMahon.

	Mrs. Levy & Mrs. Barnett came to my office last week & we had quite a quarrel.  They are most audacious women.  Tell Ben I want to see him very muchalso Hext & Hayne.  I miss you all very much. If I was a widower I should have to get married again.  I cannot do without a wife although she scolds me & teases me.  All pleasures have their evils.  But you cannot imagine how quiet we all are.  Servants quiet & doing well.  But they are like me.  They want you at home again to scold & fret & to keep life up & the children to cry & make a fuss.  Life needs society.

	I have written you a long letter, but I am afraid you will not see it before leaving Mrs. Cunninghams.

	Kiss the children for me & give my love to Mrs. Cunningham & Miss Pamela & tell them to come to Greenville.  Your affectionate husband, B.T. Perry

	There is nothing new here that I have learned.  The Butler Guards leave here tomorrow afternoon.  The 4th Regiment will probably be stationed at Aiken very soon, & perhaps Williams Regiment also.  Av good many of the volunteers are sick.  

	I hope you will come down on Tuesday in order to examine me.  I have not met with any applicants for Equity yet, though I have heard of two who are going to apply.

	I returned yesterday from Spartanburgh court by way of Glencoe.

	I saw Mr. Le, Friday evening at Spartanburgh who told me you all arrived safely in Columbia.  He went down with you & returned to Spartanburgh the next day.  He said you were all doing well.

	On my return home yesterday, I rece[ive]d your letter which would indicate you were not doing so well in the way of food for horse & man.  I hope however this will soon be remedied.  You must allow for Hamptons indisposition & the confusion of assembling troops.

	Your mother sent by Col. Randal a large box of provisions which I hope you will receive in due time.

	Larkin says he will have your bowie knife done this evening & I will send it down to the care of Janney.  The bridle bits he sent down by Col. Randal.  

	Col. Hoke tells me that the Butler Guards write they do not expect any fighting for the present in Virginia unless the Southern troops attack Alexandria.  Lincolns army will not attack them.  They are well& doing well.

	You must write me very often & let me know when it is likely you will leave Columbia.  I will try & go down before you leave.

	The Village is desolatenot a loafer or idler to be seen in the streets.  The village every day looks like Sunday.  There is no business doing of any kind.

	Write me when you are in your Mess? How your horses are doing &c.

	I do not think Willie Beattie will hurry down from the accounts recei[ve]d.

Dear Mamma

	You have no doubt been surprised at not hearing from me oftener than I have been writing.  But the truth is that the difficulty of writing is so great that I can hardly bring myself to do it.  The box you sent down was duly received yesterday.  I have not opened it yet as John Hughson came from home yesterday where he had been on furlough and brought some eatables.  The mess arrangements and the tent arrangements of the Captain were broken up.  We now mess together, the whole company at one table.  As to tenting we tent as we choose and not according to size as the Captain wanted.  There are six of us in a tent.  In my tent there is Tom Adams, Bill Thompson, Ferguson & his brother, Hughson & myself making six, and I think a very good mess.  The feeding both of men & horses has improved to what it was formerly but it is still very poor.  Coffee, bread & bacon are the principal things we have.  Sometimes we have Irish potatoes.  I will send one of the boxes I have here tomorrow or next day.  And by the time you are ready to send it back we will have eat up what you sent yesterday.  Perhaps you had better add to the direction to the care of J.N. Feaster, as he has a good deal of sending to the company from Columbia.  If it is directed to me in the Brooks Troop, Hamptons Legion it will come right, and there would be no use in directing it to Janney.  There is no telling what time we will leave here, some say in a few days, some say not before a month.  We get on pretty well.  We have to drill three or four hours a day.  It is very warm here, and we have no dressing or undressing to do, as we go to bed in our clothes, and all we have to do towards dressing is to wash our faces, not even brushing our hair.  But I like it pretty well as it is no trouble.  They make each sargent or corporal  officer of the guard to take charge of it for 24 hours, and last Sunday I was officer of the guard, and had to attend to relieving the sentinels every two hours.  Consequently though our Captain preached I didnt hear him.  I had to be awake all night Sunday night.

	Butlers Company came in the other day, and the Williamston Company came in yesterday.  The Artillery was expected very soon.  So the Legion is being made up pretty rapidly.  I hear that Bozemans Company has been received.

	My health so far has beenis sick.  He was quite sick yesterday, but is better today.  It was an attack of dysentery he had.  Bill Beattie wrote me yesterday saying he would be down about the middle of the week.  Give my love to all, and to Grandma, Aunt Ann & to Aunt Susan for the provisions she sent.  They are very acceptable.

	I will now close.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

	 This is humiliation & fast day.  Your mother & the children have all gone to church.  The servants are out.  The stores all shut & the streets desolate.  Nothing doing & nothing to be done.  I will therefore write you a letter.  

	I sent you by Willie Butler this morning your bundle& bowie knife.   Your mother wrote you last night.  We recd your letter yesterday evening which gives a better account of your fare & livingexcept your mother & aunts are horrified at the idea of your sleeping in your pantaloons & boots!  In your letter you stated someone was sick but left out the name.  I fear it is Wiley 

	I understand Jim Moore came up last evening sick.  I will go over & see him this evening & hear all the news from your Camp.  IMr. Moseley last evening who told me he spent a night at your camp
 & saw you all, but could give no particular information in regard to you.  He says you are all doing well & have plenty for horse & man.

	I will try & go down & see you next week, perhaps Tuesday.  General Easley speaks of going with me.

	Some of the disbanded Volunteers speak of being hissed & insulted as they came up yesterday.  Dickey told me their families were much better off without them than with them.  So they better have staid.   

	In your letters let us know how your horse & Wiley come on & all the news of the camp.  W.M. Thomas told me that on Sunday there was some difficulty between Cline & Smith & you as sergeant & officer of the day was called on to settle it.  Like a prudent officer you called in your Captain.  But Cline was not satisfied in his decision.

	I had quite an incident to happen to me last night.  Whilst reading the papers a large black bug got into my right ear, & I could not get it out.  It was horrible & very painful.  I sent for Dr. Croft & he filled my ear piece full of water & out came theinsect!  I never had anything to happen which frightened me more or gave me greater pain.

	There was a meeting of the various members of the different committees to raise funds in favor of the Volunteers yesterday  & they reported most favorably.  Large sums have been subscribed.  They will make you all rich I expect.  I hope however your money will be judiciously spent.

	In regard to the war we have all sorts of rumors.  But I have been deceived so often that I now believe nothing I see in the newspapers, until it is confirmed by a weeks repetition..

	Nine was in my office the other day and said he was going down to join you.  Turner one of the disbanded Volunteers told me he intended doing so.

	I hope your officers are now all with you & that {Wade] Hampton is well.

	I will send you a Patriot with my speech to the Davis Guards.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

	Today is Sunday, and I will write you a few lines, which I will probably send up by Tom Adams who goes up in the morning, on a short visit.  We are getting on pretty well, as far as we have boxes from home.  Our horses are very much stunted in their feed, so much so that I thought of asking you to send down a bushel or two of corn, to help along with.  I wish you would see if you could send me down some corn.  I dont expect they will charge you anything on the Rail-Road, & so it would not cost much.  I look for you down on Tuesday, you and Hext.  I cant give you much accommodation.  Our tents are so hot during the middle of the day that it is impossible for us to stay in them.  I dont know when we will leave here for Virginia.  The impression is that we will leave here the latter part of this week.

	[page torn] Griffin who commands the Cavalry portion of the Legion is here now and says that the Cavalry will be sent on before the infantry.  If so we will leave here soon.  Another company of Cavalry is expected here soon.

	Tell Ma she can send down anything she wants to by Tom Adams who came down again on Wednesday.  Mr. Stairley, Col. Randal and several others have gone or are going up on furlough.  What do you think of my trying to get a furlough.

	In my letter a few days ago, I left out that Wiley was sick.  He is quite well now except a cold.  The health of the company is very good.  

	There is nothing of interest to write about.  I will close.  Give my love to Ma, and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

	We received your letter last night & I have just seen Alexander McBee .  I saw Gibbs & Dr. Ferguson yesterday.  So I am pretty well posted to all your doings at Hampton.  I am glad to hear you are all getting on so well & pleased to hear of your promotion but would have been much more gratified to hear you were a commissioned officer.  This you will be after a time no doubt.  In the meantime get books & study hard your profession.  Devote yourself to it & make yourself proficient in the science of War.  Do not depend simply on theof your officers but study & read military books.

	Next to this & before it take care of your health.  Avoid fruits & drinking too much water.  Change your clothes when wet.  Do not eat anything but wholesome food & not too much of that.

	I wish to go down & see you this week.  If you are to stay long I would prefer going next week.  We should all be glad to see you at home before you leave for Virginia if you can conveniently do so.  McBee thinks you will be there a month before you start.  Jim Moore thinks so too.  I went to see himself. He came to see me yesterday.  He is pretty well except his face.

	 Tell Dr. Long that I have written a strong letter to Col. Hampton  for his appointment as Steward of the Hospital.

	Dr. Ferguspn thinks your horses well.  What about Wiley &.Will you have to pay their expenses or do you need Manorah?  All thesewe will arrange when I come down.  If you can get the naval pistol buy one.  I wish you well.

	McBee & Ferguson say your horses look well.  Give my best respects to all your messmates & friends, S, Ferguson, Thompson, Houstonand others.  In haste, yours affectionately, my dear Son, B.F. Perry

Dear Mamma

	Your box of Butter came safely to hand yesterday, and we all think that the Butter is as fine as any we ever saw.  In fact butter was a thing I missed as much as anything.  I think it would be as well to direct simply to me without saying to the care of anyone, as it might delay and not hasten the arrival of the box.  Dont send me any Coffee-pot as we have one already.  

	As to Papas coming down to see me I would prefer his coming later as there is great probability of our staying here some time longer.  Austins company has received arms but they are not very well pleased with them.  They are the old-fashioned muskets rifled out.  Smiths company at first refused to receive them but finally consented.  Mr. Westfield was no doubt joking when he said we would probably be ordered to the Va. Springs.

	Mr. Thomas account was rather flattering, but still we do pretty well having as we do our boxes from home.  I was up all last night again being sargent of the Guard and consequently feel pretty tired & sleepy, and dont feel like writing, so you must excuse the shortness of this letter.  This day is fast day and the Company has gone into town to attend church and drill, but I am here, as I was up last night, and so am excused.

	I wrote the above yesterday since which time Bill Beattie has arrived bringing my bit. and bowie knife.  The bit was not made according to my directions but it will do.  We were mustered into the Confederate service this morning by Captain Calhoun, and our horses will be valued this evening.  The bundle of ham & biscuits also came down yesterday.  If possible I want to go up home myself, before leaving for Virginia, but it is very doubtful whether I can get off.  Mr. McBee has resigned, and been excused from the company.  The rest of the non-commissioned officers rose by promotion, so Moore is 3rd Lieutenant Williams 1st Sargent & myself 2nd Sargent.

	I think Grandma sold her place cheap, but no doubt it was better than to keep it on her hands.  Give my love to her and Aunt Susan & Aunt Annie.  I have been to Columbia twice since I have been here.  Our Captain is very strict about granting leave.  I will write you about what time we leave so that Pa can come down just before leaving.  The impression is that we will leave soon.  Hampton says that he is under orders now to go to Virginia.  He is getting better, and was out to our parade.  Mr. Gibbs also has been excused, his brother taking his place.

	I have nothing to write of interest to you, and so will close.  Your Affectionate Son. W.H. Perry

	I write you today merely to let you know that I arrived here safely yesterday.  The talk now is that we will certainly leave here this week.  Col. Johnson said there would not be a man here by Sunday.  The four companies will leave here tomorrow I expect, and we will leave here by Saturday next.

	There is nothing new to write you.  They had a little fuss in Camp during my absence about going to Church on Sunday in Columbia which the Captain wanted done.  A good many would not go, and did not go, and the captain had finally to apologise and back down.  The horses are doing tolerably well.   The feed is still scanty.  We are now formed into messes of ten.  I will write you again before leaving.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	This is the last letter which I expect to write you from this place.  We leave here in the morning for Richmond tomorrow at 12 oclock.  We will go to Petersburg by Rail-Road and then we will go by horseback the rest of the way to Richmond.  We will make a stop of 4 or 5 hours in Charlotte to rest our horses before putting them on the other train, and we will stop at least a night, perhaps longer in Petersburg.  So I will have a chance to deliver the letter to Miss Orr.  I sent up Monarch by todays train.  I found out that I would not only have to pay transportation for him, but would have to find food for him outside of the company corn, which would put me to a good deal of trouble and sometimes be impossible.  So I concluded to send him home.  Some of the other men who have servants have any horses for them except the Captain, who can draw three rations, and in that way can get on very well.

	If there is any actual necessity, I might buy a cheap horse in Va., though I think we can do very well without horses for the servants.  You ought to pay only half price to the R. Road for carrying Monarch up, as I am a soldier, and the transportation of their horses is only half price.  I expect we will be in Richmond some time to drill.  The whole legion will be there together.  We will be camped about 3 miles from Richmond.

	I am writing in great haste, and so must close.  I will send home some clothes.  I like the pistol very well.  The shirts were received.

       Give my love to Ma, the children, Grandma and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	You have no doubt heard before this how Ed Stokes and myself got left by the Company in Columbia.  They started three quarters of an hour at least before the time they had appointed for starting and the consequence was that although we got back to the Depot long before the right time, we found that we were left.  The Captain did not call the roll before starting, as he should have done: had he done so he would have discovered our absence.  Finding that we were left, we determined to get ahead of the company, so we saw Col. Hampton who gave us a passport, and we took the 2 oclock train on the S.C. R. Road and came by Wilmington to this place which we reached at 4 oclock this morning and found ourselves ahead of the Company, which has not yet come on.  It is expected some time during the course of today.  In the meantime we are doing very well; and are willing to wait.  Wiley went on with the train and will take care of my horse.  Stokes had intended waiting for the Company at Weldon and did wait there several, but it was such an unpleasant place that we concluded to come on to this placePetersburg.  We are to take it by horseback from here to Richmond.  Dick Jacobs overtook us at Weldon on his way to Richmond.  He was at Charlotte on Friday night, and was delayed by some engine running off the track, all night.  The Company were also delayed and were not ready for starting when he left Charlotte Saturday morning.  Ed Stokes and myself called on Miss Nellie Orr this morning to deliver Mas letter.  We found her a very pretty and interesting young lady.

	It is raining here now very hard, and has been since morning.  It is now 3 oclock and the Company has not yet arrived.  If it comes this evening, I dont think it will start for Richmond until tomorrow morning.

	There is no news of much consequence that I have heard.  There is some report of fighting near Alexandria, but not reliable as usual.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Ed Stokes desires to you all.  Give my love to all.

Dear Papa

	You will see by the heading of this letter that we have changed our quarters from Richmond to this place which is 18 miles from Richmond on the Rail-Road to Acquia Creek. You may probably recollect the place.  It is a breakfast house going North; you have eat[en] here several times.  We came here yesterday on horseback from Richmond.  The Cavalry portion came, the Infantry are still in Richmond.  This place was chosen because it is a good place for Cavalry to drill.  We quartered at what used to be a Racetrack.  We are all in one large room.  I would prefer tenting to rooming altogether, and perhaps we will be allowed to do so.  Besides the three companies of Hamptons Legion there are four Virginia Cavalry Companies.  There are no other troops besides those.  This is a sort of school of instruction for Cavalry.  I dont know how long we will be here, probably some time.

	Tom Adams has been elected and appointed First Lieutenant in Bozemans Company.  Each of the Lieutenants retrog[r]added one step in order to make the vacancy for him.  Tom Adams was drilling the Company for Bozeman, and Bozeman wanted to have him as Lieutenant, and made the arrangement to have him appointed.  I have had some legal business to do since I have been in Camp.  Capt. Bozeman got me to write his Will, which I did.  Bozeman has been rather sick since he has been in Camp.  

	I dont know yet whether to say that I like our present encampment or not.  They have just concluded to let us pitch our tents and stay in them, which I think will be better than staying altogether in one room.  I like our present Campground better than I did the one at Richmond, which was in a very low and hot place.  It is very warm here, a great deal warmer than I expected to find it in Virginia.  My horse is coming on very well.  Considering the feed which has been and still is very scanty, I have been obliged to buy a little horse feed, all along ever since we left Columbia.  I would not give my horse for any in the Legion, not excepting the Cols or Lieut Cols.  Wiley I am sorry to say was taken sick yesterday and is not able to do anything at present, but I hope he will soon be well.  He has a pain in his back, and a headache.  Mr. McKay arrived here yesterday evening and brought Mas letter, and I got your letter this morning.  You all must write very seldom, for I did not get a letter from you during the whole week that we were in Richmond.

	Mr. Westfield asked me to tell you to tell Mrs. Westfield to direct her letters to this place now instead of Richmond.  Ed Stokes was very sick for a few days but is now quite well.  All the rest of the Company are in great health at present.    I saw Greggs Regiment in Richmond on their way home.  

	I have no news to write you of any interest.  You hear more reliable news than we do here, for we hear so many verbal reports that we dont know what to believe.  I will close.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Susan, Aunt Annie, Ma and all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	I write to [you] a few days since, and sit down now to write you at the request of Dr. Ferguson.  He wants you to bring on with you, when you come, a negro boy for him.  Write to me to let me know if you will do it.  I dont know whether the Rail-Roads will charge anything for transporting the boy or not.  He wants him brought at any rate.  Blythe wants a boy brought on for his mess, not his own but one belonging to Dr. Harrison.  He said he would let me know certainly whether he wants him and then I will write you again.  When do you expect to come on.  Court, I sup[p]ose begins in Greenville tomorrow, and will last 2 or 3 weeks I suppose.  So you will not be able to come on before the end of 3 weeks at least.

	A report reached here this evening that there had been a fight in Western Va. between one thousand of Wises Command & 8 thousand federals in which the Virginians were surrounded and all of them either killed or taken prisoners.  This report is believed to be reliable.  I suppose you will have heard of this engagement before this letter reaches you.  We are getting on pretty well here.  Wiley has got well.  All the men in the company are well, except Westmoreland who is sick in the Hospital but will be out in a day or two.  

	I like this camp better than the Camp at Richmond.  The Bugle is sounding now for Roll Call so I must close.  Your Son, William H. Perry

P.S. I forgot to mention in my last that we were furnished with one horse-pistol apiece before we left Richmond.

Dear Mamma

	I now sit down or rather lie down to write you a letter in reply to your last one.  I received one from Pa since yours came.  I dont know but what it would be as well to continue directing your letters to Richmond, for in that case when we move from here they would be more likely to be forwarded on to us than if they were in this place which is quite a small place.  All the letters from you have been forwarded on here without delay from Richmond.  As to when we leave this place I cannot say definitely.  The report is that we are to leave for Manassas Junction in a day or two.  It is said that Butlers Company will leave tomorrow, but I dont think they will leave that soon.  I think we will leave in a few days.  You have no doubt heard of the big fight which occurred yesterday at Manassas Junction.  The account of it in this mornings paper was very meagre; we look for fuller accounts tomorrow.

	We are getting on very well here.  It is the place that we have been camped at.  The water is as good as any I ever tasted, and very convenient.  Butter is 25 & 30 cts a pound, not 9 cts as McClain wrote.  There is not much of it for sale at any price, nor much Butter-milk.  We buy both whenever we get a chance.  Butter-milk sells for 5 cts a quart.  We have very good fare.  Beef, Bacon, rice, Coffee, meal, sugar, are about all we have.  They do very well.  My Mess is now composed of Thompson, Hughson, 2 Stairlings, Bolling, Westmoreland, 2 Fergusons, Davenport, & Mr. Westfield is also in it.  Thompson, Hughson, the 2 Fergusons and myself sleep in the same tent.  We drill twice a day, at 7 in the morning and at 4 in the evening, for 2 hours at each time.  While we are not on drill we can spend our time as we please.    We can go out into the town or anywhere not over a mile from Camp.  We get up and attend roll call at half-past 4 in the morning: from then until 7 we have to get breakfast, feed, water, and curry our horses though Wiley has done all the currying of my horse.  At 7, as I said before, we go on drill for two hours.    Yesterday we began taking lessons in the sword exercise instead of drilling on horseback, which lessons I suppose will continue for some time.  Mr. Johnson the Chaplain of the Legion teaches us the sword exercise; he is a graduate of West Point.  We have to attend roll-call at 7 in the evening, and also at 9.  At a quarter past lights have to be put out and we have to go to sleep.  Such is our daily life in Camp.  I found my cap just before we were leaving Columbia, and as the Company had by that time adopted black hats instead of caps, I gave it to Wiley and have since been wearing my hat.  The Company a day or two since determined to have a new uniform made, to be paid for out of our wages, and arrangements are being made to have it done.  I have clothes enough.  Wiley works for my Mess and curries my house, which is still doing very well.  Several of the horses were foundered by the trip from Richmond here, and one of them belonging to Austin died.  Austin has gone to Richmond to see Hampton about getting another horse.  Wiley is getting on very well, and says he wants you to write to his wife for him.  I find him a great convenience.  Captain Lanneau is not at all popular in the company.  I cant say he is unkind to his men, for he does not seem to care much how his men get on, so that he gets on well himself.  Willie Beatties hand is improving slowly.  He can manage his horse with his right hand, but when we get to using sabres on horseback, I dont know how he will do.  I cant say that I am very anxious for a fight, though I would just as soon go to fighting at once as I will have it to do sooner or later.

	It will not be at all dangerous for Pa to be in Richmond.  There is no danger of that place being attacked until they whip us everywhere else.  He will have to get a passport to go from Richmond to where we are or where we will be at, or to any portion of the army, but I dont suppose he will find any difficulty in procuring one.  Ferguson wants him to bring on his boy and I hope he will do it.  Carson & Pearson spoke of getting him to bring on some money for them & John Hughson wants him to get a Bowie Knife for him & bring it on to him.  Mr. McKay has not yet been here on his way home from Manassas Junction.  He said he would be here by last Wednesday.  Mr. Gaillard & Moore I am happy to say have & are in excellent health.  It is time for me to close.  Give my love to Grandma, & my Aunts & all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Tom Adams is now Captain of Bozemans Company, Bozeman having resigned on account of his  health.

Dear Mamma

	I write now merely to acknowledge the receipt of your letter yesterday containing the Four Dollars, and also to say that we will leave this place some time today or soon tomorrow morning.  We will go to Manassas Junction.  It is something over a hundred miles from here, and we will have to go it on horseback, so we have a long ride before us.  The Infantry Companies belonging to the Legion left Richmond yesterday evening for Manassas.  We will be under charge of Major Griffin.  There is nothing to write you that would be news by the time this letter reaches you.  The fight at Manassas seems to have been a pretty considerable one.  Give my thanks to Grandma and Aunt Annie for their portion of the 4 dollars.  All the letters you all have written I think have come safe to hand.  I dont know but what it would be better for you to continue directing to Richmond from which place they will be forwarded.  I got a letter from Pa also yesterday evening.  I would like to see him on here very much.

	I wrote you a long letter yesterday answering all your questions, so I have nothing left to write about.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Letter 602

Camp Pickens

Dear Papa

	It has been some time I wrote to you.  I have not written since I left Ashland.  Since that a great battle has been fought, and we have moved from Ashland to this place (Manassas).  The fight was on Sunday and we started on Monday from Ashland and reached this place on Thursday, too late for the fight by several days.  The rest of the Legion, that is the Infantry came just in time to get into the thickest of the fight, and fought well too, for it is generally said that they had an activce part in gaining the battle.  The Fourth Regiment also (Sloans) covered themselves with glory havingsustained the brunt for two hours unaided, and fought through the thickest of the fight all day.  Hawthorn says that his company had the honor of opening the battle doing the very first firing that was done.  Something seems to be brewing now for yesterday 12 Regiments were set in motion to go somewhere.  I dont know where, and this morning a messenger came in hot haste for Col. Hampton but what was the purport of the message I dont know.  We are all expecting marching orders.  The next fight that comes off, you may rest assured, the Cavalry will have a showing in.  I saw Col. Hampton Thursday evening.  His wound is not at all serious, but came very near being so.  It struck him on the left temple and has given him a black.  He does not know yet whether the bullet came out or is still in his face.  Col. Johnson and poor Yeargin were both killed.  Yeargin was the first man killed in the Legion.  He was cut in two by a cannon as he was rallying his men to lead them on.  The killed of the Legion amount to about 25, the wounded to about a hundred.  They became very much scattered.  In fact the whole fight on our side seems to have been fought on the guerilla principle every man for himself, and every man to his tree or his gulley when he could get one.  The men got very much mixed up.  South Carolinians, Georgians, Alabamians and all others fought together without regard to company or Regiment.  Lieut. William Fuller of Pools company has died from his wound.  Capt. Pool is expected to recover but will lose one leg.  Lieut. Hawkins of the same Company will lose a leg, & old Col. Fuller will lose a foot by a wound received from an accidental discharge of a bomb after the battle.  Dr. Hillhouses brother was killed by the same explosion.  Adjutant Wilkes was killed when the fight was nearly over, having gone to get water from a spring.  I went to visit the battlefield Saturday and saw the Fourth Regiment which was camped near the battleground.  Hawthorn carried us over the battleground, and described the battle to us.  He had a narrow escape a cannon ball striking him under the feet, & knocking him over.  I think the 4th Regiment & the Legion did the hardest fighting of any of the troops.  Wiley went to the battleground yesterday and picked up a musket barrel, which he says he is going to send to Hext.  I got several bullets & buttons as relics.  Major Griffin says that any of us who have double-barrel shot-guns may arm themselves with them, so I want you to send me my gun by the first opportunity.  Are you coming on.  Several Greenville men are here, Col. Ware, Dr. Hillhouse, Alex McBee, Mr. Moore, Col. Townes,Major Hampton.  I got a letter from Miss Orr inquiring if Stokes Beattie or myself orwere safe, and asking us if we were wounded to come to Petersburg.  I received Mas bundle of clothes by Mr. McBee.  I dont need them.  Dr. Gantt is also here.  

	The Infantry of the Legion are camped about 3 miles from this place, where we the Cavalry are camped.  I have nothing much to write you.  I could write a good deal about the battle, but you no doubt heard the principle facts already.  Kershaws Regiment did not have much share in the fight until the retreat began.  Gus Hoke was wounded in the arm.  He is at Culpepper (where the hospital is).  He is doing well.  Give my love to Ma, Grandma, Aunts Susan & Annie, and all the children.  I will need a pair of boots after awhile such as Burt made for me before leaving.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Camp Griffin Near Manassas

Dear Papa

	I wrote you a letter yesterday by Mr. Burgess, but as some of the Greenville men are going home tomorrow I concluded to write again, as it dont cost anything to send them by Hand.

	I received your letter this morning.  I mentioned to Dr. Austin about Day.  He had already seen him, and will provide for his coming on.  He said he could get any amount of men from Greenville, and he is going to send for ten men to supply vacancies in his company, occasioned by some of his men being wounded and some broken down.  Charles Hill is broken down, and will have to go home.

	I write to you today more particularly to describe the boots I want Burt to make for me.  I want them with very thick upper leathers, as well as heavy tacked soles, and I want the legs made very stiff, and in Cavalry style, coming above the knees.  If you come on, I wish you would, in Richmond, buy an India Rubber or oil-cloth over-coat., or something to throw over the body.  I find the need of it in wet weather.  The first day we started from Ashland it rained hard all day through and through not withstanding an over-coat and shawl.  I saw William Martin from Charleston who came on to see about the wounded of the Washington Light Infantry.  It seems that he belongs to the detachment of the Washington Light Infantry which staid at home.  He has gone home again.  I think so hot a secessionist as Gen. [William Edward] Martin might give a son to fight for the cause he advocated so strongly.

	We are getting on pretty well here, with the exception of water.  Our well is not yet dug deep enough to get water, and I doubt whether it ever will be.  Col. Ware is here & speaks of going home in the morning.  You will find some difficulty in getting a passport in Richmond.  There are a great many there who cannot obtain them.  Good is going home in the morning.  Young Austin of our Company is sick.  Bill Beattie is sick but not dangerously.  Dr. Ferguson is also sick.  I think he is taking the measles.  We left four men down with the measles at AshlandCooley, Cothran, Arnold and Ashmore.  They are still there.  Bolling is a little sick.    Most of the rest of the Company are in pretty good health.

	I now understand that neither Col. Pool. nor Hawkins, nor old Fuller are dead3rd Lieut. Fuller is dead though.  

	I have not much to write [you] in the way of news.  Yesterday a report came that 50,000 yankees had crossed the Potomac.  Today it is contradicted.  I have received two letters from Fannie, and will write to her as soon as possible and would be glad to hear from her frequently.  Give my love to Grandma and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Bring or send on my shotgun as soon as possible.

Dear Mamma

	We are about leaving our present Camp Ground, and I will write you a few lines before leaving.  
We will leave tomorrow morning.  I dont know exactly where we go, but it is somewhere nearer to the Potomac, near a place called Ocaquan.  We have been changing our encampments about every week or two.  There are a great many of the Legion still sick who will be left where we now are until they get well, and are able to join us.  Waverly Stairly and Ligon are two more who have broken out with the measles.  They have gone over to the Hospital in Brentsville a small town about a mile from Camp.  All the sick are doing very well.  Ed Stokes is better, and will go along with us tomorrow when we move.  Tom Adams is pretty sick, but with attention will recover.  His wife I suppose will be here in a day or two, as he has telegraphed to her.  John Ferguson is nearly well, as are all the rest of those who have had measles.  I received Pas letter last night dated 6th.  He will find a good deal of difficulty I am afraid if he comes on, in getting to where the Legion will be encamped, as it will be some 10 or 15 miles from the Rail-Road the nearest point, I expect, being Manassas junction.  There is hardly any way for a civillian to travel about this country amongst the army except by taking it afoot.  I dont know how far our Camp, which we go to tomorrow, and where I expect we will be at some time, is from Manassas junction.  I suppose about ten miles.  I will write when we reach there.  I have got me an oil-cloth over-coat, so you need not trouble yourself any more about it.  I got it from Richmond by Lieut. Gaillard.  He went down there to see about getting our new uniforms and at the same time he purchased whatever things the Company needed, and I got him to get me an overcoat, and I think I am very near water-proof now.  The uniforms will be done in a week or two.  It is being made by the Ladies of Petersburg.  We have had some very cold weather for the season lately, and we have had some hard rains.  By the time the winter comes on I will need some thick undershirts.  I hear that Col. Hampton is providing winter under-clothes for the Legion but I dont know that it is so.  My drawers hold out pretty well.  I want some thick red flannel ones for winter, but I dont need them yet awhile, nor the undershirts.

	I got a letter from Bill Beattie.  He expects to come back from Charlottesville in about a week.  He has had jaundice and has been confined to his room since he has been at Charlottesville.  Bill Thompson is getting on very well.  Jim McDaniel has reached here.  He says he is going to join the Davis Guards.  I suspected that he had run away as soon as I saw him & asked him if he had not, but he denied it.  I have not seen Smith.  I dont think he came this far.

	Wiley has got well.  Mr. McDaniel did not carry the gun barrel for Hext, as I expected he would.  Perhaps we can send it by some other opportunity.  Thomas & Dr. Gantt are here, staying at the house.  Bill Thompson is sick at.  Dr. Jesse Westmoreland is at Orange.  He has been here, and will be back here again before he goes home.  I hope to get my shotgun soon.  I believe Mr. Elford & Alex McBee are to attend to sending the guns on to us.  Give it to them, and maybe you can send my boots on by the same op[p]ortunity.  My trunk is rather in the way as I expected it would be, and I think I will send it home if I can.  You mentioned once about sending some things to Miss Sally Thompson to put up some things she was sending to us.  Well it seems they were in Mr. McClanahans charge, and he got them checked to Richmond but brought them no further.  We have tried to get them by means of the Express Co. but have not succeeded yet.  What was there in them for me.  I am glad that Pa has had straps put to my gun for carrying it.  I forgot to tell him to have it done.

	I must close.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunt Susan, Aunt Annie, Cousins Annie, Vardry and all.  I should be glad to hear from all of them.  I hope we will soon receive the proceeds of the young ladies Concert.  We will probably be paid our wages before long as they are now due.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Letter 605

Near Manassas

Dear Mamma

	Since I wrote you my last letter we have moved our camping ground  as I told you we expected to do.  We are now about eight miles or more from Manassas Junction and about 12 or 15 from our last Camp.  We are about 3 miles from a Creek called Ocquoquan or something like that.  I dont know how far it is from the Potomac.  I believe it is only some 15 miles from here to Mount Vernon.  I dont know much about the locality, but it is pretty certain we are a good deal nearer the enemy than we have been. We send out 4 men to stand as Picket guard about 3 or 4 miles from Camp.  Some say that the enemys pickets are just on the other side but I dont think they are that close.  

	I expect we will stay here some time.  Col. Hampton says we may move from here at any time or we may be here six months. And he also says he thinks we will until we have a fight which will probably be some time I think.  There are so many reports out that it is hard for us in camp, who never see the papers, to tell what is going on or where the enemy are.  They have been at Mount Vernon lately, and committed some depredations.  They have been in possession of this section of the country.  We are camped near Bacon Run Church from which point our troops have been driven several times by the enemy, before the Battle.  We started from our last Camp Monday during a rain, and it has been raining  ever since we got here and is cloudy yet.  I suppose it will clear off some time sooner or later.  We have a tolerably pleasant location, as far as we can judge considering the weather.  The water is pretty good, but not too abundant.  It is a very poor country for horse food.  Corn has to be hauled 15 miles.  We still get our mail from Manassas junction so you can either direct there as you have been doing to Richmond.

	Wiley washes very well and cooks very well, and does very well though he has been sick several times.  I dont need any new shirts now.  I enjoy myself tolerably well only.  Camp life is so monotonous that there cant be much enjoyment in it.  

	I have never seen Beauregard. I passed him once but did not know it was him until afterwards, so did not see him.  I have not spoken to Col. Hampton.  Capt. Lanman does only tolerably well.  I wish he would get some higher office, so we could get rid of him.  

	Our sick men were left at Brentsville.  They are getting on very well.  Both the Fergusons are there.  We have not heard from them since [we] got here.  Tom Adams was the sickest one we left of my acquaintance.  I think he will get over it.  He is in a private House in Brentsville.  The Fergusons and Waverly Stairly are at the same House.  Several of the Company were detailed to stay and wait on them.  Old Mr. Stairly, Bramlett, Bates were the ones.

	I hope you will have sent on that India Rubber blanket, and the boots by Mr. Burgess.  The oil-cloth coat that Mr. Gaillard bought for me is not a very good one.  It is not as water-proof as it ought to be.  A Tailor from Richmond the other day took the measures of the whole Legion for a new uniform to be made for us by the ladies of South Carolina.  I suppose it is to be made by the Society, or whatever it is.  Miss Hampton was writing to you about our new uniforms [that] will be made in a few days.  We will have more uniforms than we will be able to carry.  These latter as I wrote you before are to be made by the Ladies of Petersburg, so Miss Nellie Orr can have a chance at them.

	Ed Stokes is about well and desires to be remembered to you.  Bill Thompson is still at the house he has been at.  I saw a letter from Bill Beattie yesterday.  He is getting on very well, and will be back at Camp in about ten days he says.  Bolling staidsick at Brentsville, but not much sick.  He is probably taking measles.  

	I have not much more to write you, so I will close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	I had the pleasure of traveling to Belton this morning with Governor Pickens, Mrs. Pickens & his daughters.  And although I had a good deal of chat with the with the Governor & ate breakfast at Belton with him it did notto be introduced to his wife.  I think her very pretty & she seemed pleasant & affectionate towards her husband, reclining on his breast & sleeping in his arms in the car.  

	At Belton I fell in company with Judge Whitner & his lady going on to Virginia to see their sick son Major Whitner of Sloans Regiment.  They made the ride here quite pleasant.  Mrs. Whitner is a very fine lady plain & affectionate.  We were acquainted in our younger days & waited on Dr. Robinson when he was married.  She is now very much distressed at the sickness of her son.  We spoke of the dreadful consequences of the war.  She said she did not believe, when she was for secession that we would have war.  I told her I knew it & gave her a long talk.

	Poor Joab Mauldins corpse is now here.  His mother went on to see him [page torn] his corpse although both were in Richmond last Sunday night.  She went on to Manassas it is supposed & [brought] the corpse to this place the next morning.  Thos Crayton is here in search of her.  Mrs. Whitner remarked that Mrs. Mauldin was one of the best women she ever knew & her fate in this life had been a very hard one.

	I heard nothing of Augustus Hoke & Dr. Crook.  Fifteen Volunteers got in the cars at Williamston for Manassasfour at Greenville.

	I have been asleep this evening & have seen no one.  It is now raining at six oclock.  We stay here till eight in the morning.  I have Ed Stokes boy &under my charge &.  I have not been able to see Miss Hampton or Mrs. LeConte or hear of them.

	My friend Janney complains of the rudeness of the Volunteers.  All along the road today they were gathered in crowds to ss a troop of Cavalry pass down from Abbeville to camp near this place.  

	I have no news to write you.  Jennings Goodlett &c. are here on their way back to Manassas.  The papers state it was a mistake about General Evans capturing the 1700 yankees.

	I hope to have something of more interest to write you from Petersburg Thursday evening.  Take care of yourself, children & household.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Since writing you at six oclock this evening I have seen Major Cely, Blassingame & Peadon & young Cely all just from the army.  Peden saw Willie Thursday morning & he was quite well.  William Thompson is getting well.  John Jones is almost well.  Robert Pool is doing well & in no danger.  Scruggs is not much sick.

	I saw poor Cely at Hunts Hotel on his way to Greenville with a ball in his forehead.  He will recover.  The wound is healing up & looks curious.  Dr. Goodwin heard my voice in Celys room & stopped in.  He told me he has six sons in the army.  One was wounded & his wife went on to nurse him.  She is still there waiting for another battle & to attend the sick.

	Blassingame says the sick are very much neglected in the army.  He came back with the corpse of Joab Mauldin.  Mrs. Mauldin telegraphed this evening from Culpepper to keep the corpse at Anderson till her return.  She missed it in Richmond.  Blassingame says they live very well in the armygood provisions but badly cooked.  He gives some amusing accounts of the soldiers running.  He says Henry Cauble.  Judge Whitner told me two of the Holl from Tugaloo threw down their muskets & said they would not fight.  They were expelled [from] the company.  Peden of Boz[e]mans Guards is here wounded.  He looks well & will recover.  He says Captain Adams is getting better, but his wife had not arrived when he left.  He says the captain very sick with measles but in no danger & is now well & getting well.

	I have heard nothing of Hoke or Crook.  They are in North Carolina.

	I sawLegare at the supper table.  Judge Whitner introduced us & I told that I had known him years ago.  Yes he said in 1830, he spent a summer at Greenville.  We spoke of your aunt his wifes stepmother & he enquired after your Mother.

	The weather is excessively hot & I must stop writing.   I think you must admit I have complied with your request in writing for I have now written ten long letters.

	I will send this letter by Blassingame.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just been to see Miss Nelly Orr & spent an hour very pleasantly with her & her mother.  They seem good & affectionate & I like them very much.  Miss Nelly is good looking but not a beauty.  She is very intelligent & pleasant in her manners & expressed great interest in you & Fannie & Willie.  She was spared of another battle where some of her Greenville friends might be killed or wounded.  She & her mother both requested me to say to Willie and his friends that they must come to Petersburgh in case any casualty happened to them whilst in the army.  She says that a merchant here promised to procure an India Rubber coat & would send it to me this evening.

	We reached here last night about nine oclock.  We were detained at Charlotte five or six hours.  I saw Dr. Gibbon and he was very kind.  Judge Whitner rece[ive]d a telegram that his son was much better & not to come on.  But he & Mrs. Whitner left this morning for Culpepper.  I was sorry to part with them.  Mrs. Izard was in company all the way from Columbia & Co, McFarland & young Haskell.

	At Raleigh I saw Vardry McBee & Col. Burton who told me Captain Hoke was sick at Greensboro & Dr. Crook was sick at Chapel Hill.  But I presume they are at home by this time.

	This morning a number of soldiers in Sloans Regiment passed through Petersburgh before I got up.  Judge Whitner saw them.  Young Sloan brother of Mrs. Easly shot through thewas one of them.

       The cars were filled with troops from Georgia & Alabama.  And all along the road the ladies wouldnose gays &c.
       
       I shall go to Richmond this evening, stay there tomorrow & go to Manassas next day.
       
	So for the conductors have all passed me for half fare.  I have met a great many acquaintances going on to the army & also young Knotts who went to school at Greenville came up & introduced himself  & said he was going on to join the Brooks Cavalry.

	I told Miss Nelly when I took leave of her that I hoped some of the Greenville troops would capture her & bring her to Greenville as a trophy of the war.  She smiled as if it would not be an impossible thing.   Like some of the yankees, she might prefer being captured by a good looking cavalier.  She says Willie does not look at all like me & supposes he looks like you.  Her father lives in very handsome style.  

	My love to all.  I hope I hear from you in Richmond.  I gave your letter to Nelly.  B.F. Perry

	I arrived here last night about nine oclock & there was the greatest difficulty in getting lodging.  I walked from the depot to the Spotswood Hotel& succeeded in securing a room.  This morning I met Barnwell Rhett who kindly went with me to the Secretary of War.  His subordinate refused a passport notwithstanding Governor Pickens certificate on my saying that my son was not sick.  Rhett then presented Pickens certificate to Walker & he immediately gave me a passport for myself & two servants.  I then called on Col. Memminger who invited me to his house this evening.  Then I went to thelooked at the Equestrian Statue of Washington superior to Jacksons at Washington.  I then walked into the Representative Hall & had a long chat with Mr. Barnwell.  Rhett came up & said who would have thought twelve months ago that Mr. Perry would be on his way to the army to see his son?  Mr. Barnwell replied who thought then that there would be an army at all!  I had a long talk with Rhett this morning before breakfast.  He & Barnwell differ on almost every subject before Congress. 

        I have just purchased a fine india Rubber overcoat for Willie, ten dollars.  I met Mr. Boyce in the War Department.  On my way back I met Col. Chesnut who asked me to carry a letter & package to General Beauregard.  Dr. [page torn], who is very feeble from typhoid fever tells me Mrs. Hampton has returned to Columbia.  He says the Legion is now at Oc[c]oquan near the Potomac fifteen or twenty miles from Washington & that a forward movement is contemplated, crossing over into Maryland.  It is said Lee will fight a battle shortly in Western Virginia.
       
       I have seen a great many young men from the army & going to the army.  Cox has been discharged from the Butler Guards & tells me he is going to Pennsylvania to look after his property.  He is very much alarmed about it & says that if confiscated he will be pennyless.  He says John Jones, Pu Pool, Scruggs, Carson are well or improving.  Two of Duncans sons, Wiles & T are to be discharged on account of their health.  Duncan & wife are still at FairFax.  He did not know much about the Legion.  I met young Dr.  now engaged in the Hospital.  He told me a great deal about the prisoners.  
       
       Ed Stokes boy John lost four trappings of theat Petersburgh & they could not be found.  
       
       I shall not be able to see the President I expect till my return.  I sent to the Post office but rece[ive]d no letter from you.  Cox tells me Thomas has returned home & he may tell you about the Legion.  Love to all.  I may write again tonight.  B.F. Perry

	It is now five oclock Saturday evening, and I have just seen Mr. Bartell of Anderson who belongs to the Brooks Cavalry.  He left Hamptons camp this morning & saw Willie yesterday.  He says Willie is quite well & stands the camp life better than any of themthat he has not been sick at all.  The Legion is now at O[c]coquan & will remain there till they march over into Maryland about the first of October.  But Bartell knows nothing about their movements.  I shall start in the morning, but will no doubt have some difficulty in getting a conveyance from Manassas to the Legion.  

	I see every hour some of my acquaintances.  A great many come up & make themselves known to me from the middle & lower country.  Heise came up just now & has a long chat.  Barnett of Spartanburg has a son sick in the camp but could not get a passport.  He has gone to see Col. Chesnut.

	There is such a crowd here & such confusion that I am anxious to get off.  Indeed I am anxious to be quietly at home again.  A crowd has no pleasures for me like home.  Bartell says Willie has bought a pair of shoes with soles three inches thick to wear in camp.  When I get there with his boots, india rubber coat & bed covering & woolen socks, he will be well prepared for the winter & bad weather.  Gill was here the other day on his return from Petersburgh with their new company as I was informed by Doctor Austin.

	I have nothing more to write & simply write you again to tell about Willie.  

	The boys John & Prince seem lonely in the crowd & came to enquire when I was going on.

	I have rece[ive]d no letter from you.  But Sharpe told me he left Greenville Wednesday morning & nothing new had occurred.  He is going on to join the legion.  He is from Georgia.

	I hope you & your mother, Annie, Susan & the children are all well & doing well.  I am anxious to be with you again.  When in Petersburg I told Nelly Orr that I would stop & tell her the news from the army, but I do not think now that I shall stop when my face is once turned homeward.

Camp Griffin, Va.

Dear Mamma

	I have received several letters from home lately and will now write you a few lines.

	Since I last wrote you Pa has been here and has by this time returned home and given you some account of how we are getting on here in Camp.  He visited our Camp and saw us under very disadvantageous circumstances.  It was raining all the time he was here and our encampment was very muddy.  Pa bought me a tent in Richmond, but I have not received it yet.  I suppose it is at the junction by this time, and I will probably go up tomorrow and get it.  It will be very acceptable, for the tents we have leak very badly, while wall tents such as he has bought me keep perfectly dry.  Mr. Westfield has one, and he has room a plenty I have been staying in a tent with him and Ed Stokes.  You said in one of your letters that you had two good blankets which you would send to me if I needed them.  I think if you have a good opportunity you had better send them on, as I will no doubt need them when the weather gets cooler.  I hope they are colored ones.  The Blackberry wine and jam that you sent on has not come to hand.  It I suppose was in the box of Mrs. Williams which has not come to hand.

	Since Pa left our Cavalry has had a slight touch of something bordering on war.  Maj. Butler took 25 men from each company making 100 men, in which number I was, and we went to within about 8 miles of Alexandria and surprised two posts where the enemy had pickets.  We took one prisoner at the first post and two at the second.  I was among the first in the charge, and though there was not much danger in reality, we expected some.  The enemys pickets ran into the woods.  I took a gun, an overcoat, and a haversack, but we were obliged to give up the articles we took.  The guns have been retained by the government, the other things were given back to us, but somebody got possession of my overcoat, and I have not succeeded in finding it yet.  The Haversack I still have.  A good many guns, some 8 or 10 were taken by us.  Besides the 3 soldiers we took a free negro and a white man and two ambulances and horses.  The white man was driving the ambulance, and when he saw us coming he jumped out, and took to the woods, but we caught him, and have sen[t] him and the negro, and the 3 pickets to Headquarters at Manassas, and I suppose have now been sent on to Richmond.  The negro was a suspected character, which was the reason of our taking him.  He lived a little this side of the pickets.  The second ambulance was taken at the first picket.  Ive returned and camped all night at Pohick church about 12 miles from Alexandria and 15 miles from our Camp.  The church was built by Washington and was the one he worshiped in.  It is about 6 miles from Mount Vernon.    We slept in it all night and came back to Camp next day.  We took nothing with us on the trip except a blanket, 2 days horse feed, and some provisions for ourselves in our haversacks.  It was raining when we started and rained all day.  We seem always to make our marches in wet weather.  When we galloped down to the camp-fire where the pickets were posted I had my pistol cocked and just as I got there it went of[f].  I thought at the moment that some of the enemy had shot at from the woods on the opposite side of the road, and turned to shoot in return.  Fortunately it did not hurt me, only the powder burnt my finger very slightly.  We will probably have another expedition very soon.  We went within 2 miles of Mt. Vernon and in sight of the Potomac.

	The red flannel drawers and undershirts will be very acceptable.   I think Mr.  has sent on the money raised forby the concert.  And a vote of thanks has been voted to your society and the young ladies Concert by the Troop.

	I have I believe all the papers you sent me, and am very glad to see them.  When I say I see no papers I mean Richmond papers by which we get the latest news.

	I will now close.  I hope Pa has got home safe and in good health.  He was rather unwell when he left me, but he said nothing about it in the letter he wrote me from Richmond, so I suppose he had got over it.  Give my love to Grandma, Aunts Susan & Anne and to Fannie, Annie, Hext, Vardry, Aleck and all.  I was very glad to hear from Vardry.  Tell Hext I am very sorry I could not send him the gun I took the other day.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. Mr. Boggs went up to the 4th Regiment the other day and so I got the paper signed that Pa left here.

Dear Papa

	I wrote a letter home a day or two since by Mr. West but as an opportunity offers to send another letter by hand I avail myself of it.  Jim Moore is going home tomorrow on account of his wifes sickness, and will carry this letter.  He will stay several weeks, and Ma can send those two blankets she spoke of, by him.  I am in need of a hat if you can find a broad rimmed black felt Hatsize 7 ?.  You had better get it for me.

	I went to the junction yesterday and succeeded in finding my tent, and I expect to have it brought down today or tomorrow.  I had sent by several persons to get it, but none of them succeeded.  The Tent came there on Monday, but it was not unloaded until yesterday over a week after its arrival.  I had the misfortune yesterday at the Junction to loose or have my pistol stolen.  I think it was stolen.  I went by myself and had to hitch my horse, and while I was gone someone took one of my pistols from  out of my Holsters.

	We have been expecting to be paid off for some time, and I think we will be paid off in a day or two.

	Bill Thompson forgot to put in his letter to [his] mother that he wants her to send him a hat size 7 ? & a pair of gloves.  I wish Ma to send word to her about this. 

	I have nothing to write about, and merely write this because Moore is going home and you may expect one.  I hope you are safe home by this time though I have not yet heard of your arrival.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I got the paper signed by Fuller that you left, and sent it this morning by Mr. West.

CampVa.

Dear Papa

	I have received several letters from you and Ma since I have last written to you.  My delay in writing has been owing to the absolute impossibility of getting anything to write with.  The greater portion of our company, and the other cavalry Companies together with all the infantry and artillery were ordered to move last Friday.  We came down to this point, about 3 miles from the river, and about ten miles from the Camp, expecting to go immediately into a fight, but it seems that we came down to protect a battery on the river which the Artillery have erected.  The Battery was completed and opened [fire] on several steamers lying in the river.  On Wednesday the Cavalry immediately saddled and went to the scene of action to support the Artillery in case the enemy attempted a landing, but they did not attempt it and after the cannonading between the battery and the vessels had continued off & on for 4 or 5 hours, it stopped and we came back.  One of the enemys steamers was struck 3 times and one was crippled.  No damage was done to our side.  The Battery consisted of two [of] our rifled cannon & the big guns taken at Manassas called Long Tom.  This Battery has been removedin fact it was a feint in order to draw the attention of the enemy from a larger battery which is now nearly completed some few miles lower down the river at Evansport.  This latter battery is almost ready to open.  

	We came down here expecting to stay only a week, and only brought about half our tents, but it seems likely that the whole camp will be moved down here.  My new tent & things are at the old camp & I will not move them until I find out whether we are going back there or not.    There are some 15 or 20 of the company at the old camp & the rest down here.  Wiley is here. I want you to send by Ferguson a pen & some ink.  I find that I need these occasionally.  While Williams is sick I have been acting as orderly Sergeant and it requires some writing.  Our Company is almost without Officers.  Gaillard & Moore at home & Prince sick.  I got a letter from you & ma by Oscar Mauldin who has arrived here safe after being 10 days on the way.    Greenfield came a few days before & brought me the shirts & drawers & Wileys pants.  There were two pairs of drawers.  I would like Ma to send me one more pair of red flannel drawers.  There is no news of any consequence to write you.  I will now close.  Give my love to all.  Tell Grandma I am much obliged to her for the buggy she is going to give me and hope it wont be long before I get to ride in it.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I dont expect you to get the bill I sent by Ferguson changed into Silver.  All I want is smaller bills if you cant do better.  Since writing the above Mr. Stairley expects to go home, having received news of his wifes sickness, so I will send this letter by him.  Bill Beattie says tell his family that he is well.  Ed Stokes is well.  So is everybody except Westmoreland who has been pretty sick, but doing very well now.

Dear Papa

	It has been some time since I wrote to you but I dont think wefor not writing, as I have received very few letters from home lately.  I have not received one for some time nowthat is in several days.

	  There is very little news to write you, though there are any quantity of rumors afloat as to what has been and is going to be done by the army.  We are going to move our camp tomorrow or next day.  We are going to a place called Blands Ford on Cedar Run about 5 miles from Manassas.  They say that our army is falling back to Centreville or Manassas, and it is said that McClellan is advancing and a big battle is expected in a few days, at about the same place the last one was fought.  Such is the camp belief.  But there is no telling when the fight will come off.  Though there is no doubt our army is falling backwhether McClellan is advancing I am not so certain of.   The Evansport battery opened last Tuesday, and has been firing off and on ever since, with what result, I am not able to say.  We were ordered to hold ourselves in readiness with one days rations to go and support it, but were not ordered down as the enemy made no attempt to land.  They fired on our battery from their vessels, but did no damage.  I am sorry to write that one of our company died this morning, his name was Knotts.  He had only come on about two weeks ago to join our Company, and was taken sick with Dysentary a few days after he got here.  He is a cousin of Elvin Knotts.  He has another brother still in the Company, the one who came on when you did.  His father got here a short time before his death.  Cooley is sick with Typhoid Fever, but not seriously.  His brother Dr. Cooley came on to see him the other day.  He moved him into the country to a house.  Bill Thompson is a little sick, but I dont expect he wants his mother to know it, as he says she is very easily frightened and might come on to see him which is unnecessary.  Bill Beattie, Ed Stokes and all the rest of the company are well

	Jno Ferguson has not yet got here though his Furlough is out.  I suppose he will be here in a day or two.  I understand he was to leave Greenville last Monday.  I got the box Moore brought on with all the things in it.  I will now close.  Give my love to all, and to Annie for the Palmetto.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Camp Butler, Va.

Dear Mamma

	I started to write you a letter several days ago, but was interrupted and did not finish it.  It has been some time since I last wrote you all, and it has also been some time since I received a letter from you all.  The last time I heard was by John Ferguson.  It was dated the 13th, and I have not received a letter since up to this date.  Ferguson reached here safe with all the baggage in his charge, including my box, and the change you sent me.  He seems to be pretty well but not quite as strong as before.  He is now at a Mr. Jones about 8 miles from our present Camp, waiting on Bill Thompson who is sick there.  Bill has the Typhoid Fever and is pretty sick but not very dangerously.  I dont know whether he has written to his mother about it or not.  He spoke of telegraphing to his mother to come on, but I dont believe he has done it.  Perhaps you had better not mention his sickness if his family dont know it yet.    Cooley is also sick at the same place, and with the same disease, but not at all dangerously.  Jim Mays and Tully Bolling are sick.  With these exceptions I believe all the rest of the Company are well.
	
	We are now encamped about 6 miles from the place where we were camped when Pa was on here.  We moved up from our camp near Freestone Point last Friday week to our old Camp near Bacon Race Church.  We staid there only a few days and then moved to this place.  How long we will stay here, or where we will go to next I cant tell.  There is a Report that a big battle is expected at Centreville and that we will be moved up there soon, but there is no telling what is the truth in Camp.  I dont think there are any more indications of a big battle than there has been for the last two months.  Our troops are beyond Fairfax and the enemy are not outside of their entrenchments so there does not seem to be any sign of a fight.  Or at least it seems so to me.  The weather we are having now is the coldest we have had yet, and I think we will soon have to go into winter or settle the war by a big fight or a peace, for I dont think either side can do much in the way of fighting after winter sets in.  The roads will be too bad for transportation, and the weather too cold for troops to be exposed.

	Wiley is a little sick at present.  He is in a house near here and is getting better.  Pain in the head and stomach is what he has been complaining of.  I believe there is nothing that I stand in need of from home.  Everything that you sent by Moore and by Ferguson I have received and am now pretty well loaded.  There is some talk of their reducing our baggage to what the army regulations require.  That is just what we can carry on horse-back, which will curtail our baggage a great deal.  When we get into winter quarters, if we do get into them, we will be permanently settled and can have as much as we want.  There are various reports about winter-quartering.  Some are that we wont go into winter quarters at allothers that we will quarter at Manassas Junction, some at Fredericksburg or Richmond.

	Since writing the above I have received your letter by Mr. Stairley.  He himself has not yet come to Camp.  He is at the Junction.  If you could make me a pair of pantaloons out [of] strong Country blue jeans, of some sort of coarse negro cloth, I would like it veryhave them plenty large enough.  I dont like to be asking for so many things now, for I know they cost a good deal, but you can take pay for them out of the 20 dollar bill I sent by Ferguson, for you know you did not send me back all of the bill, only some silver.  Since writing the first part of my letter we have received orders to prepare 3 days rations and be ready to march at a moments warning.  It is thought we may be ordered to support the right wing of the army under Johnson in case the enemy advances, but I dont think there is much danger of a fight yet, or perhaps I ought to say hopes of it.  It is time for me to close.  Give my love to all.  I gave a letter to Dr. Reed several days ago to carry home thinking he would leave next day but he has not gone yet.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	I wrote to you a few days ago, but as I have an opportunity of sending a letter by hand I will write you a few lines to let you know that I am well.  Jeff Arnold is going home in the morning having received a Discharge on account of his health and I will send this letter by him.  I wrote you that he had a fit and succeeded in getting a discharge in consequence.  Tully Bolling, son of Major Bolling has also received a discharge and is going in a few days.  He has had dysentery for a long time.  Bill Thompson has also got a discharge and will start home next Thursday.  I went down to see him and his mother yesterday.  He is getting well, but looks very badly.  Mr. Stairley has not received his discharge yet, his having to go to Richmond to be signed.  Mr. Bramlett has also applied for a discharge on account of his age and infirmities, but has not got it yet.

	I wrote Ma word to make me a pair of pants but she need not make them now, as I have bought a pair here.

	Last night news came that the yankees had succeeded in landing at Port Royal.  I hope it is not true.  Col. Hampton has gone up to see Gen. Beauregardsome say to get him to send the whole Legion back to South Carolina in consequence of this newsothers say it is only to get permission to send the Beaufort Troop of cavalry back, as they are more directly concerned.  I hope they will send us all back.  I am sorry the yankees have attacked us at home, but as they have done so, I would rather fight there than here.  There is no news here.  There still seems to be no prospect of a fight.  Our Headquarters are at Centreville and the yankees are inside their entrenchments.

	I see there must have been considerable excitement about the election of officers for the Greenville Regiment.  Who were the anonymous writers for the papers signing themselves I Volunteer and Probono Miloner.  The Regiment seems now to stand some chance of getting into a fight, no doubt contrary to the expectations of a great many of those who compose it.

	There is nothing new in Camp.  I am getting on very well.  My health is good.  Wiley is well.  Give my love to all.  Jeff Arnold is a son of Preacher Arnold who married Mrs. Briggs.  Your Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Mamma

	As Mr. Stairley is going home in the morning, I will write you a few lines by him.  He has succeeded at last in getting his Discharge.  A great many or rather several have got discharges, while Jim Mays, Stroud, Maj. Borstell have got Furloughs.  Mr. Bramlett has also got a discharge and gone home.  I have been rather unwell for a few days past, but am getting well now.

	South Carolina seems to be in a very bad situation at present, on account of the yankee invasion.  We look with anxiety for news from Port-Royal.  The yankees according to last accounts do not seem to have begun any active measures against Charleston or the interior of the country, though I suppose it will not be long before they do.  I heard this morning that Pa had written a letter to Col. Hampton urging him to bring his Legion to So. Ca.  I wish he would carry us back, but I dont think there is [any prospect] of our returning for the Beaufort which has made application to Beauregard and has tried very hard to get off, has not been able to do so.  I think they had better send us (the cavalry) to South Carolina, for I dont think our horses can stand the winter here, particularly with the short allowance of corn we frequently get.  Every now and then we have to go a day without any corn, and we have not had a particle of Hay in several weeks.  We have eat out this whole country around and all our supplies have to be hauled from Manassas.  We are to move our present camp in a few days.  It is not much of a move as it will be only about a mile.  We will be a good deal nearer the old Bacon Race church than we are now so you can guess about where it will be.

	Dr. Jones arrived in our camp yesterday evening.  He intends staying in Va. until all prospect of a fight is over.  As to where a fight will come off there is no telling.  The Report has been for I dont know how long, that a fight would come off in a day or two, but it has not come off yet.  Yesterday it was reported that Gen. Beauregard had said there would be a fight in two days.

	Mr. Stairley is about to leave so I will have to close.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Papa

	I wrote you last by Mr. Stairley.  At that time I was not well, and I am sorry to say that I am not quite well yet.  Dr. Long says my Liver is out of order.  I concluded that I would not stay in Camp, so the other day I came out to a house in the country, about 6 miles from Camp where I am now.  It is a very good place.  Dr. Long has given me 3 Blue pill[s] to take one every night for 3 nights which he says will bring me right again.  He says I will be well in 3 or 4 days.  There is nothing particular new in camp.  The report is that the enemy are advancing or are going to advance in 3 columns upon the Evansport Battery.  If this were true you might look out for a fight, but this same report has fooled us so often before that I wont believe in it till I see it.  Though Gen. [William H.C.] Whiting who commands the forces which protect the Battery says he has no doubt at all but that we will have a fight soon.  He seems to expect the enemy to advance on the Battery at any moment.  Whenever the fight does come off the Hampton Legion will be certain to be in it.  I only hope it wont come on for a few days until I get well.  As it is probably the only fight we will get into I would not miss it on any account.  I am very glad to hear about that vessels bringing a load of arms into Savannah.  I heard it several days ago but did not hardly believe it, as I had seen nothing of it in the newspapers.  The arms certainly came just in the nick of time.  Col. Elford I suppose will have a chance of doing some service after all.  I have not heard yet who Elford has appointed on his staff.  Dr. Jones I believe says he was offered the position of Surgeon.  I have heard that Dr. Crook was to be surgeon, and that Charley ONeal was to be Adjutant.

	 The scare in Charleston must be a great thing for the Hotels in Greenville, as so many persons are coming up.  It will be the same as if the summer travel and custom was kept up the whole year round.  I received the pants you sent by Dr. Austin.  Iva Williams has taken the measures of the company for a new uniform, and he is going home in a few days to cut them out.  The cloth I believe is to be made by Mr. Grady and is just like what he made for the Butler Guards.  Mr. Williams will cut it out and have the uniforms, and Ma can either get Mr. Dyer to make it or make it herself.  I must close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Dear Mamma

	I received a letter from Pa day before yesterday inquiring about young Day, and asking me to telegraph him immediately as to how he was if I could possibly do so.  I immediately went to the telegraph office which they have recently established at Bacon Race Church, and they told me I could telegraph which I did, and which I hope has been received long ere this letter reaches you.  Day is recovering rapidly and I telegraphed to that effect.  I directed the Dispatch to Mr. Janney in Columbia, and if Pa was not in Columbia at the time I suppose Mr. Janney sent it up next day.  If Pa went to Columbia on Tuesday as he said he might do, he no doubt got it there himself.  Day was very sick at one time but is getting well now.  I had to pay $2 for the Dispatch.  I am doing very well myself, am almost as well as ever.  My appetite has not quite come to me yet.

	I wrote you in my last that Col. Hampton had taken all his Legion except the Cavalry down to Occoquan, some 8 or 10 miles from here, expecting an advance of the enemy on the Evansport Battery.  Yesterday he sent up orders for the Cavalry also to come down today, and orders were given us to be ready to march, but for some reason or other we have not gone, and I think it likely we will not go.  Major Butler came back to Camp yesterday, and has taken command of the Cavalry, which Capt. Lanneau had during his absence.  I believe it is owing to him that we have not gone down to Occoquan.  I am glad of it, for we can hardly manage to get horse-feed enough where we are, and if we were to go there I dont think we could get any at all.  I still dont think there is much chance of any fight, though Pas last letter seemed to be so certain of it that he even thought we might have had a fight before I got his letter.  I have burnt up all your letters.  When you first wrote me to burn your letters I burnt up all that I had received, and have burnt up all of [them] after reading them, which I think is much the best plan, for besides the danger of the yankees reading them there is danger of their being lost about camp, so all things considered I believe I shall continue to destroy them as soon as received.  I want you all to write me as often as possible.  It does me a great deal of good to receive a letter from home.

	I am glad to hear from Pas letter that you were pleased with your trip to Glencoe.  You must give me a description of your trip.  My horse is still sick, but I hope is getting better.  No one in Camp is dangerously sick.  John Ligon is the sickest one.  He has fever or pneumonia.  

	I must close.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

	Hext & myself arrived here this evening safely & had a very pleasant journey down.  Mrs. Perry Duncan & Mrs. Sloan Duncan came with un on their way to the army.  The former to see her sick son Robert, & the latter to see her loving husband.  At the Abbeville road we fell in company with Judge Wardlaw & Mrs. Golding who asked about you very kindly.  Mrs. Cunningham is very dis says Mrs. Golding.  Pamela is quite well.  John is broke and dependent on his mother & Pamela.

	At Newberry Judge ONeall joined us.  The Board of Trustees met tonight but did not form a corum & made no election of President.

	The people of Charleston are in great apprehension of the capture of their City.  They are fleeing with their plate & valuables.

	I met this evening Mr. Petigru, Col. Preston, Judge Glover, Col. Dawkins and many other friends.

	Captain Hawthorn goes up in the morning & is just from the army.

	Everyone says the Legislature is very weak and they all regret my absence.

	I will go down in the morning to see the Legislature, the Greenville Regiment, Col. Hayne & Mrs. LeConte who has enquired of all my friends about me.

	Hext wishes to see the yankee Prisoners.  He sat up till I returned from the Board of Trustees & is now sleeping soundly.

	I saw Col. Ware, Col. Hoke, Dr. Hall& Dr. Sullivan who are all quite well with Mr. Stokes.  I saw Alston Hayne who enquired kindly after al of you.

	There is no war news.  I shall be at home Friday evening.  The weather is very warm.

	I hope John & Harry will go on hauling wood so that when I return we may carry the wagon to Glencoe.

	Columbia is looking dull.  I have not yet seen Yeadon.

	It is now about eleven oclock and I will close.

	I hope your aunts are better & that all the rest of you are well.

	Judge Wardlaw said he knew Hext was a Perry.  He says when a Boy he the Judge & other school boys used to speak or extract from an oration of Hext McCall whilst they were at school.  Your affectionate [husband], B.F. Perry

Camp Wigfall

Dear Mamma

	I will write you a few lines today as I have not much to do, and as you complain of my not writing enough.  Mr. Day came on the other day and gave me the latest news from home.  He said that Pa went down to Columbia the day he came on.  He will probably get a furlough for his son and will go home with him as soon as he succeeds in getting it.  It has been signed by the surgeon, and has gone up to head-quarters to be signed there.  He will probably get it in a few days.  Lieut[enant] Prince will also get a furlough at the same time and go home with him.  He is still pretty sick, but I believe it is as much home-sickness as any other sort of sickness.  Mr. Westfield and Richardson have been sent to the Hospital at Charlottesville.  Mr. Westfield has Rheumatism, and I think ought to have a furlough or discharge as he is unfit for service.  Charley Ketchum and Good are also at the Charlottesville Hospital.

	The Cavalry yesterday returned from a scouting expedition.  They had a little sort of skirmish with the yankees.  I was not in the party, being kept in camp on guard, because I was just getting well from sickness.  They came up with a party of yankee Cavalry, who fired on our men and then retreated.  One of our men (Griffin of the Edgefield Company) was wounded on the chin, which was all of our loss.  Our men pursued them some distance, but did not come up with them, and were afraid to follow for fear of an ambuscade.

	Ten men from each company of Cavalry have been armed with Enfield Rifles to act as mounted Riflemen.  This party the night previous came up on a party of two yankee pickets, and fired on them but missed.  The most of our Company were not in the engagement with the yankee Cavalry, having been taken around another way to intercept their retreat; but they arrived too late to do so, owing to Col. Hamptons delaying them on the way.  As I was not on the scout I am rather glad that our company was not in it, for I would hate for them to get into a fight of any size and me not to be there.  As I wrote in my last letter I am now entirely well.  

	Pa wrote to ask me if I wanted a horse cover.  I have made one already out of a blanket and oil-cloth, so I think my horse can get along without a regular cover.  Mr. Gaillard will be here in a day or two.  I understand he has 27 b[page torn] along with him.  We will probably be paid off in a few days.  I am extremely sorry to hear of the burning of Charleston.  It must be a terrible loss to a great many.  I dont know whether my old over-coat will last me during the war, so if you want to you can have a new Military over-coat made for me, if you can get the cloth.  Bill Beattie has the right sort of one.  But you need not put yourself to much trouble as I may be able to make out.

	I have nothing more to write.  There dont seem to be much prospect of a general fight.  

        Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Camp Wigfall

Dear Pa

	I think if all my letters reach you that I will redeem my reputation for writing, for I have written several letters to you lately.  I write now as Mr. Iva Williams is going home and I will send it by him.  He is going to attend to the cutting out of the new uniforms for our Troop.  I have instructed him to leave my uniform at home when cut out and Ma can either have it made at home or by Mr. Dyer as best suits her.  We dont stand much in need of a uniform at present, but we may do so before the contemplated one is finished.

	I am very well.  I wrote you some time ago that my horse had a Distemper.  I am glad to say that he is getting a good deal better and I think will soon be well.  A great many of our horses have the same complaint which a great many call Lung Fever.

	Mr. Gower is about to get a Furlough and will probably start for home in a few days.  He goes to attend to his business there. Lieut[enant] Prince has got a Furlough but I believe is too sick at present to go home.  Day has not yet got his Furlough.  It has gone to headquarters and I expect he will get it in a few days.  

	We were paid off yesterday.  I received $81.60 cts.  I have a notion of sending $20 home to get me an overcoat.  If I do I will send it by Gower, Prince or Day.  The sort of overcoat I want is a military one, that is, it ought to be plenty large, and made out of thick cloth and as warm as possible.

	There is not much, if any news in Camp.  The talk is that our application to be sent home has not been granted and that we will go into winter quarters in a few days, where I dont know.  

	Next Wednesday is Christmas, and a pretty dull one it probably will be from present appearances.  We have had a fine spell of weather for the last two or three weeks.  Today though is cloudy and looks as if [we] might have snow before Christmas.  Wiley wants someand is unable to get any here to give my horse.  Probably you might get some at home and send it on here by letter.    I am afraid this letter will be some time in reaching you, for Mr. Williams is going by Charleston to buy trimmings for our uniforms, and may be delayed some time.  

	I will close now.  Give my love to all, and write often.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I would like some paper and a few Envelopes, by any opportunity you get to send them.  They have given us what they call Sibley tents (circular ones) instead of the old ones.  We have chimneys to them and are pretty comfortable.  My wall tent is at a house near Bacon Race for safe keeping, until we want it.

My dear Liz

	We reached here safely yesterday & had a pleasant time on the road.  All the members seem to be for me for Speaker.  Dr. Croft was out last night & reported very favorably.  

	I met Greenfield & Stairly from the Brooks Troop & they report favorably &.  I send you Willies letter.  Make Greenfield come & see you.  He has a great deal to tell about the Troop & Willie &c.

	As to the election of Governor not much is said about it.  I requested Dr. Croft not to speak of it till the election of speaker was over.  [Aldred Proctor] Aldrich is a candidate for speaker.  He is the only one I have heard of in opposition.

	The news from the army makes it pretty certain that there will be a battle at Fredericksburg.  I heard last night of some very high eulogizingon me by General Martin.

	The weather is changing & I hope Hext &get home.

	I have a veryin one of Mrs. Mrs. LeContes rooms, opposite her drawing room.  Boyce & Croft are next me & I am much pleased with them.

	I shall go down to see Elfords Regiment today.  Fainny sends me down with Dr. Fair to try & get his son in law Leap off from the service.

	There are no members here yet from Charleston & not many from theCounty. Janneys Hotel is about equal to our table every day & yet we pay five dollars per day.

	Greenfield says Willies Greenville uniform is the admiration of everyone in camp & the nicest in the Troop.  

	There are very few members in favor of the Council.  It will certainly be abolished.  I hope you & the children will get on well in my absence.  If any of you are sick or unwell you must make..  I am very uneasy about the Throat disease in Greenville.

	Give my love to all & write me whenever you can.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have had so much company in my room this evening that I coul;d not write you by mail but have met Mr. Sass who offers to take this letter.

	Col. [Thomas Nuckolls] Dawkins [has] become a candidate for Speaker. & defeated both of us.  Aldrich was elected on the third ballot.  If Dawkins had not been a candidate  I would have been elected the first ballot.  But de divided the upper country & in order to make an election votes went over to Aldrich.  The first ballot I got 31, Aldrich 36 & Dawkins 27.  But thirty members wre absent & mostly from the upper country.  The most prominent of the Charleston delegation voted for me.  Trenholm, Trescot, Yeadon, Campbell, Whaley, Seymour &c.  But R. C electionered as if he had been before the people.

	I am not at all mortified at my defeat.  It is all for the best.  But I will remember Col. Dawkins.

	Mr. Petigru was in my room this evening and says it would not do for any union man to be governor.  He would be charged with Treachery.  Yeadon says he intends to run me for Chancellor & Whaley said the same.  Dr. Croft said Mrs. Pickens expressed great regret at my not being elected.

	I have not been able to get the mail this evening.  I therefore have not heard from you.

	Three hundred came down on the cars this evening.  All Greenville seems to be here.


	I have no news.  I am anxious to hear from you.    Give my love to the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your letter of Sunday this morning & Ianxiously expect one this evening.

	With all the gentlemen I have met they expressed the depest regret at my not being elected Speaker.  Governor Manningat the election.  They speak of running me for Governor or Chancellor.  If the election was held today, since the upper country members have come down,  I should be elected.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte & her daughter & sister today.  They were deeply concerned in the election.  Miss Lula told me so, her mother also.  They made a great many inquiries about you & Fannie & wished you had both come down with me &up in the gallery to see them which seemed to attract the attention of the whole House.

	Mr. Yeadon seems determined to honor me in some way for my defeat & a great many other members have expressed the same determinatioin.

	The Governors message was read today & was very strong against the Council.  The questions came up toon Whaleys Resolutions.

	I have seen no one[James Petigru] Boyce.  He seemsto me & is really one of the sincerest friends I have.  He is a noble gentleman.  Dr. Croft is equallyin his friendship.  Boyce & myself agree on everything & I like Col. [James] McCullough very much.  We all get on finely.  

	There was nothing done in the House today.  Tomorrow there may be some discussion.  It is said the session will continue twice.  But I do not think so.  

	I wrote you last night by Mr. Sass.  Duncan will carry this letter up in the morning.

	I am afraid the weather has turned too warm for your peoople.  It is said we shall have plenty of salt from Alabama.    You see an account of it in the papers.

	I hope Hext & Ben returned safely Monday morning.

	The troops here are turning home from several of the regiments.  But Elfords men are remaining.

	I have nothing to write except what youin the newspapers.  

	I have not seen or heard from your uncle Arthur.  Col. Isaac Hayne seems very friendly & so does Gen. Martin.  He called up his little daughter E to methe other day.  She is very good looking.

	I saw Miss B.  She told me to ask you whether.  That is the price in Columbia.  

	Tell Fannie I will write her as soon as I get anything to write about & for her tome all the news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have nothing special to write you.  You will see all that we have done in the Legislature in the papers.  I have seen a good many of our friends who all enquired after you.  Judge ONeall, Judhe W, Judge Duncan, Col. Isaac Hayne, Col. Aldrich &c.

	Hext is enjoying himself.  Mr. Janney told him he was glad he had come down & should charge him nothing.  I have not see Col. OHanlon or Col. A[rthur] Hayne.

	I have a good room with gas lights & shall not need the candles.  I have been busy all day attending to business for others.  I will go & see Hattie C tomorrow.  I saw Governor Pickens on his return from Richmond who told me he had written for Mrs. Pickens to come down & meet him.  He is staying at Janneys Hotel so I shall have the pleasure of seeing Madame.  I met Dr. LeConte this morning.  They are all well.  Col. Isaac Hayne said he saw a family likeness in Hext.

	I will write to General Easl[e]y to send fodder & shucks & about ex salt.  Tell your Mother Tupper said to me he would send her interest by me.

	I think it likely we shall have a short session & perhaps I may return home before it is over.  My Bill about impressing food & cfor food &for soldiers wives will come up tomorrow.  

	I will enquire about your Mothers Bank Certificate & send Hayne to see Mrs. Taylor.

	The Hotel is very much crowded & Board $12 per day!

	The election for Commissioner is exciting some interest.  The letters of Th to the Post Master General & all the cdictions have been published in& distributed by Ashmore I suppose.  Mistress Moore is electioneering strongly for her husband.

	We had a robbery in this Hotel last night and one man lost $1,000.00 stolen out of his room.

	Take care of yourself & household & I will try & take care of myself & Hext.   I carried the watch to have mended this morning.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 625
29 November 1862, Saturday

My dear Liz

	I received a letter from Fannie this evening & one yesterday.  I will write her tomorrow.  I thought you had gone to Glencoe & therefore did not write you as often as I would have done.  I will be more regular hereafter.  But my time is very much engaged here.

	Yesterday evening I took tea with  & Mrs. LeConte & spent one hour or two with her & Lula & Miss Graham very pleasantly.  Yeadon went with me.  The Dr. is absent.  The ladies are very.  I left them at eight oclock & went to attend my committee where I was detained till late in the night.  On my return to my room I found Wallace Thompson who sat to a very late hour.  

	On yesterday I got thefor a speech today at one oclock.  The galleries were crowded & the House full & was listened to with great attention.  I think I made one of my best speeches.  Your uncle Arthur was present & Col. Campbell was to reply to me but he so fully agreed with me that he declined speaking.  You will probably see some brief sketch of my speech in Sundays Carolinian.  Col. Dawkins & Dr. Croft followed me.

	In the Courier of yesterday you will see a compliment paid me in connection with the office of Governor.

	This evening I dined with Governor Pickens & a large company.  Porter Pres[ident] of the Senate, , , Dawkins, Whaley, , Garlington, , Campbell of Charleston &c., &c.  The dinner was magnificent.  Seldom have I sat down to see it or one anywhere.  Hiswas splendid & is throughout.  After dinner we met in the drawing room.  Mrs. Pickens enquired kindly after you & spoke inof our library.  She was dressed in homespun & it was very pretty.  She & her stepdaughter played & sang for us.  She is very pleasant.  Miss Pickens is not pretty & Miss Cunningham is homely.  I could not help thinking how much prettier Fannie is than either of them.

	Tomorrow I drive out with your uncle Arthur & go home with him from church.  Tell your mother Mrs. Pickens asked of herCol. Ball.

	In my speech today I spoke kindly of the convention & council.  As I left the House Col. Isaac Hayne pulled his hat off & gave me a most gracious salutation as if he was grateful for my remarks.

	Judge Magrath came to my room & took a glass of whiskey with me after my speech.  I think my speech was highly appreciated by all who heard it and yet I had very little time to prepare.

	I am glad you did not go to Glencoe.  I am pleased to hear Hext is hauling wood.  I hope he will make a great deal of money for himself.  He ought to have all he receives.

	It is very late & I must go to bed.  Mr. Boyce is a noble gentleman.  I amof Judiciary the first or highest committee of the House.  I am glad I was not elected Speaker.  If elected I would face no opportunity of speaking.  fact is on the floor.  Croft is very kind so are all the members.

	Goodnight my dear wife.  Give my love to all the household. After I return from your uncles I will write Fannie.  B.F. Perry

P.S. Governor Pickens will have spent $50,000 whilst Governor!  What think you of my being Governor.  Consider such expenditues.  It would utterly grieve me.  One of his Bills in Charleston was $8,000! At the Hotel!

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have stolen off from the State House whilst my friend Yeadon is speaking to write you a letter.  It is now half after three & we dine at four if the House adjourns.

	I received no letter from you or Fannie last evening which was a great disappointment as I saw no one from Greenville.  But I hope you are all well.

	Last night I was told that there was a Lady in the Parlor who wished to see me.  She said she had come to git me to take her son & his estate worth $50,000 & become his Guardian.  She told me by way of inducement that he was a very smart boy of fifteen.  I asked why she did not become his guardian herself.    She said it was as much as she could do to manage her own Estate & she wished me to take her sons.  I told her she could invest her sons estate which was all in money in Bank Stocks & it would not give her much trouble.  She replied she did not like the responsibility.  I thought if she did not like the responsibility for her own child, I did not know [how] she could expect me to like it.  With great kindness I declined the gift of her son & his fortune having four sons of my own to look after & knowing  you were unwilling to increase our family.  The Lady was Mrs. Col. James H. Irby of Laurens.  She wished also to consult about various matters concerning her husbands estate & came down for that purpose & returned this morning.  It has been about twenty five years since I last saw her.  She was then a young girl.  She is now an old woman! In appearance.  Her whole soul seems devoted to money.  She had a son wounded in Virginia five or six months since & has not heard of him since.  She supposes him dead!  But she spoke more calmly of his death than she did about her property!  How avarice dries up the affections of nature!

	I sent my speech twenty pages for publication in the Charleston Courier.

	We are doing very little in the Legislature.  I am chairman of the Judisiary commmittee, the position above all others which I desire & Col. Dawkins is on my committee.  It is a committee of Lawyers & we have a great deal of business to do.

	I recei[ve]d a letter from Col. Spartan D. Goodlett last night.  He says his regiment is near Weldon, N.C.& is doing well & all well clothed.

	The election of Governor comes off next week but it is very uncertain who will be elected.  I shall not desire the office.  If a Chancellor is elected I shall run for the office & with good prospects of success. There are two Judges to be elected but it is doubtful whether they will be elected this session.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to dinner.  I feel pretty well today.  It is raining.

	You will see a list of the boys selected for the military school in the Carolinian.

	Dr. Croft has published his speech in the Carolinian Guardian & Yeadon says it is an emasculated edition of mine.  Boyce says Croft listened to me & imbibed my ideas & reiterated them as his own.  

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter of Monday night & was glad to hear from you & about Hayne.  My views on the Convention & Council are the same as they always were, utterly opposed to them as you will see in my speech.  But I oppose the wild notions of some who desire the powers of the convention to alter the Constitution.  You know I never change & am always just & rightnever lead away by passion or party.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tell Col. Hoke to get from Martin Edwards his receipt for his war tax & send me or give it to you in order to get back Edwards tax improperly paid.

	I have stolen off from the House whilst speeches are being made on the Executive council  to write you a letter & get an early dinner.  We dine at four oclock.  The common dinner is two oclock.

	Col. Chesnut requested me yesterday to write out my speech for publication.  He said he was not here when I made it.  But he had heard it was the speech of the debate.  Yesterday evening I commenced writing & continued till eleven oclock in the night.  This morning I commenced again at five oclock &breakfast.  I wrote twenty pages of foolscap & gave the manuscript to Yeadon to publish in the Courier.  In consequence of my continuing so long in my writing I do not feel so well today.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & Fannies last night & was glad to hear from you.  But you are foolish about my not being elected Speaker.  And do my dear wife never mention to me again about any office.  I would not have foregone the pleasure of making my speech for the Speakers chair.    But do not allude to the subject again.  

	Col. OHanlon paid me a visit yesterday evening & was very complimentary.  He enquired after all of you & Hext especially.  But he did not say anything about coming down.  Gilmore Simms spent Sunday evening with me & almost talked me to death.  He said his wife had just presented him with another child.  He has had fifteen children & has lost nine!  His beard is as white as snow & yet he is about my age!

	Your uncle Arthur comes into the House every day & spends some trime with me.  He complimented my speech the other day very highly.

	I can get rice here at six dollars a hundred.  But Mr. Boyce is going to write to Charleston for me.  He thinks he can get it cheaper.  He bought sugar here at.

	I rece[ive]d Willies letter enclosed in Fannies last night & was glad to hear from him.  You wrote nothing about Hayne.  Is he still at General Thompsons.

	I sawCrittenden today just from.  He says there will be no fighting at& John Cunningham is here &as ever.  Pamela sent an oldto Yeadon  the other day which he presented to the House.

	I will soon go & look at a silver cup for you & finish my letter when I return.

	I have returned from looking at silver cups & will not think of giving such prices.  I was perfectly amazedfor a cup the price of which he told me was $15 formerly he now asked $70.00 & would take nothing less.    He said he was not disposed to sell.  That he would rather have the silver cup than the confederate money.  You may give up all idea of making a present of a silver cup.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The weather has been very cold & I have been able to wear my overcoat in comfort.  It is now turning warm.  

	Give my love to all the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just written & put into the Post offce for you a long letter.  Since doing so I have rece[ive]d Fannies letter of Sunday & saw Mr. Crittenden who goes up in the morning.

	Tell Fannie I will write when I have leisure.  I have just writtenabout Martin Edwards& other matters.

	As to Governor it is all uncertain.  Gov. Manning is spoken of & Pickens friends are very anxious to elect Col. Orr so that he may take his place in the Senate.  My name is spoken of but I am not disposed to run.  If the election of Chancellor comes on I stand a good chance of being elected & will run for that office.

	My friends are very kind to me and I [am] pleased with my position.  

	We shall adjourn before Christmas,  I may not be able to write you for a day or two.    I want to see you all very much & had rather be at home than anywhere else.  

	I saw Capt. Hawthorn again tonight. He goes on to Virginia in the morning.  He is under arrest & has to have his trial for disobedience of orders when he gets back.

My dear Liz

	Col. Ware is going up in the morning & also Dr. Croft.  I am almost induced to go myself.  I will probably go home tomorrow week if the legislature sit till Christmas.  There was a Resolution introduced this morning for the Legislature to adjourn on the 17th & meet again in January.  	But I hardly think such a Resolution will pass.  It will be very inconvenient for us to return here again after Christmas.

	We elect an appeal Judge Tuesday next.  Judge Withers will be elected.  There will be two vacancies to fillone Law Judge & one Chancellor.  My friends will run me for Chancellor if the election comes on this session.  Col Keitt told Col. Lyde the other day that the Legislature ought to elect me or Hon. William Boyce Governor.  But I have no disposition to be Governor.  Trescot of Charleston came to me today & asked if I would run for Chancellor & I told him I would & I think I could be elected.  But there is a disposition to postpone the election till after the war as there is no business doing now in our courts.

	Nothing of importance today in the House.  General Garlington beat General DeSaussure for Adjutant General.

	This has been a very wet & cold day & I have turned my overcoat fur side outwhich has caused the coat to be much admired.  Your taste & theirs seem to be much the same.

.

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Fannie & several others but none from you.  Fannie says no letters came from me for two days.  I have written every day but have generally sent my letters by private conveyance.

	Fannie says you have bad weather & likely to continue so from present appearances.

	The streets are full of soldiers & a very rough set.  There has been less gaiety in Columbia this session than I have ever known.  The country is gloomy & in mourning for the friends lost in the army.		
	This dreadful war will ruin the country.  Already our national debt is over five hundred millions & South Carolinas share is over fifty millions.

	I will write Fannie a long letter Sunday.  I have heard nothing lately from Willie.

	The news came tonight that Burnside had been removed & that the yankee nation was in great commotion.

	I have seen nothing of your uncle Arthur for several days.  The weather is so bad no one can go out.

	My constituents are writing me about salt but I can do nothing.  The Governor has been ordered to distribute all he has on hand which is not much.

	I will now close my letter & hunt up Col. Ware.

	Give my love to all the children & write me how you are getting on.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 629
7 December 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	One of my chief pleasures when absent from you is writing to you & receiving letters from you.  How different from some of the members, who seldom write to their wives or receive letters from them.  How can they love their wives as I do you? Or do their wives love them?  I suppose the truth is that most people being married a long time forget all about love.  They think of each other just as they do of their houses or their horses or cattle or fields.  Most persons too regard their children in the same light.  And sometimes they actually think more of their property than they do of wife or children.  It seemed to me the other night that Mrs. Irby was a great deal more concerned about her money than she was about her son whose life or death was uncertain.  If Willie had been in that situation I should have been distressed to madness.

	I have just written a long letter to Fannie & told her of a visit Boyce & myself paid Mrs. LeConte.  I am very much pleased with Boyce.  He is one of the most sensible men & one of the best men & one of the most pleasant men I have ever known.  We have a great desal of amusement out of our friend Dr. Croft.  I have some good jokes on him.  Boyce has a great deal of humour & a nice sense of the ridiculous.

	We told Mrs. LeConte that she must be sure to come & hear Dr. Crofts speech on the Bill to stop distilling Tuesday at two oclock.  We told her about the Drs speech when he presented theto me.  She was consumed with laughter.  Mrs. LeConte asked me if I knew Mitchell, that she had received a letter from a friend in Savannah requesting her to take him under charge.  I told her about your enquiring very innocently of him if he was related to the Mr. Mitchell who was once engaged to a cousin of yours.  The story amused Lula & Miss Graham very much.

	Mrs. LeConte said she did not know how gentlemen who were so fiendly as Yeadon & myself could be so tart to each other in debate.  She said she saw me shake my finger at him & seemed in a passion.  As soon as the debate was over she saw Yeadon come up to me & I put my hand on him & pulled him to me most affectionately.

	In regard to General Thompsons letter you may rest assured I shall be influenced by my own good sense & Judgement.  If the election of Chancellor comes on I expect to be a candidate & think my chance of election pretty good.  But I have no idea of running for Governor.  If the Legislature were to press it on me I might consent to serve.  But there is no probability of this and it is a position not to be desired at this time.

	Write to me about purchasing sugar & rice.  At present rice is higher in Charleston & perhaps I had as well purchase here.  Salt is so very high that I shall wait till later to purchase.  They are making a great deal on the coast now & it must be cheaper.

	Let me know all about the children & your household.  I think I shall come home next Saturday & return Monday.  But I will write you again.  I have heard nothing from Willie.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just taken dinner & as I expect to send letters by Col. Goodlett I wil write you again.

	I forgot to mention in my letter this morning I have made arrangements with Mr. Boyce to get as much sheeting & drills as I might wish of the Graniteville Factory at very low rates.  I think I will take several hundred yards.  The drills will do for pantaloons &for the negroes & the sheeting for shirts &c.  The price I think is about 33 cents per yard.  This is cheaper than buying the spun yarn & having it woven.  You need not therefore trouble yourself about getting any more spun yarn.

	I saw Col. Connor just now.  He is still on crutches & mending slowly.  He says he heard from B, the adjutant of Hamptons cavalry only four days since.  They were then at Culpepper C[ourt] House & no expectation of moving down to Fredericksburg.  I will write to Willie this evening.  Col. Connor enquired about him.  He says he has noticed that those who were loudest for secession have done less than those who opposed the movement.

	You do not say anything about how you are living.  Have you still a supply of beef? or do you live on pork?  Did the hog killed spoil or have you eaten the meat.  Have you got corn & fodder for the horses.  Have you heard anything from Glencoe since John went back?

Letter 631
Sunday is a very lonesome day in Columbia & I shall not spend another Sunday here if I can get off.  I will try to return home next Saturday.  I think I can do so without any loss of important business.

	I will now go & hunt up Col. Goodlett.  I suppose he is at his son in laws Capt. Patrick.

	This is a beautiful fair & cold day.

	Your affectionate husband.  Give my love to the children.  B.F. Perry

Letter 632
8 December 1862

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & you have forgotten myrequest.

	I bought a tierce of Rice635 pounds for $50.80 cts & a barrel of good brown sugar 250 pounds for $137.50 cts.  It will be sent up by rail road.  Rice & sugar were both on the.  I think this will do us for a long time.  You must take care of it & use it very sparingly.  We must use rye coffee.  It is impossible to purchase coffee in this or the Charleston market.  Everybody now is using barley & cotton seed for coffee.  Mr. Freeman bought up some cotton seed parched & ground.  Yeadon told me they used it several days at his mess & thought it genuine coffee.

	General Thompson came down this evening but went on to Florida.  I did not see him.  He sent me word that all of my boys were at his House.  I hope they are now at home.  If Hayne has no shoes do try [to] buy him a pair.  It will not do for him to go barefoot [in] this weather.  He will catch his death.  Ben can stay in rhe House.  But the two had better have shoes.  These are small expenses compared to the danger of their going barefoot.

	I will not purchase salt at the present prices.  We must do with what we have.  A sack is worth $200!  We can buy a half bushel in Greenville.  That will do us for a long time.  I have only a few hogs to kill & I shall purchase hams & bacon next summer.

	There was some discussion today in the House exempting persons who own tanning stores from going to the war, & I spoke warmly against it & defeated the proposition.  My friend Col. Dawkins advocated it.  The galleries were filled with ladies.  Mrs. LeConte sent me a from the gallery by Yeadon which I ate before speaking.

	Dr. Croft & Ware & McCullough returned this evening.  I told Croft that I had made his whiskey Bill a special order for tomorrow at one oclock & had invited the ladies to come & hear him speak!  I told him he must speak himself & I think he will endeavour to do his best.  Mrs. LeConte was very amused at my description of Croft the other night & disclosed that she would not miss hearing his speech on my account.

	Dr. Reynolds of the college came up to me today & said he hoped he would have the grattification of living under my administration of the State for the nextand that he would rather see me governor than any one else!  But this compliment will set you to writing again about honors &c.

	When my speech is published you must send it.  I have no fears of its being either to me or to one.  Yeadon was sorely mortified at my argument.  But he is still determined he says to make me either governor or chancellor.

	I am very tired of this place & want to be at home.  If I can leave here I will go home Saturday.  There is no place like home although my wife& worries so much.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the State House & taken dinner, after one of the hardest days work of the Session.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee I had reported a Bill on the subject of the Stay Law  & collection of debts.  The Bill was assailed on all sides & hundreds of amendments offered by various members.  I had to fight the Bill through. & I suppoise I was on my feet one hundred times or more & made as many short speeches.  We were at the Bill from eleven in the morning till half after four in the evening.  Finally I succeeded in sending the Bill to the Senate.

My dear Liz 	

	I received one letter from Fannie last week & suppose you have all gone to Glencoe.  I hope you got there safely.  The roads & weather must have been bad Wednesday since we have had fine weather.  Now it looks as if we were going to have a change.  There has been only one wet day since I left Greenville & hope the servants have done a great deal of work.  Tell Alfred I shall expect to see all that old field cleaned up & the oats & rye sowed.

	The Legislature have agreed to adjourn Friday but it is very doubtful whether we can do so.  I shall go home Saturday anyhow.  We are getting on very pleasantly.  I have written three letters for the Enterprise giving an account of what we are doing & I will not repeat in this letter.

	I suppose you will send Hext down this week.  I will go up to Glencoe as soon as I get through with the Federal court which will be only a day or two if I do not have to return to the Legislature.  

	Dr. Croft & Col McCullough are both absent.  Boyce has to return Saturday.  If the Legislature does not adjourn Greenville will be unrepresented in the House unless Crofts son gets better.  He wasdays since when I heard from Dr. Croft.

	I have seen your uncle & Col. OHanlon.  They both enquired after you & the children most kindly.

	I dined with Yeadon the day after I came down & spent a pleasant evening.  He looks badly.  I have not seen Mrs. LeConte.  Very few ladiesin the gallery this session.

	The election of Judges will not come on this session.

	I was introduced to General [Leonidas] Polktoday.  He did not stop in Columbia.  He came down from Greenvilleto Asheville next to see his familyhad seen them only once in two years.  He is a fine looking gentleman & pleasant courteous manners.  

	I have nothing to write you & hardly expect you will receive this letter before I return home.  

	I hope you are enjoying yourselves at Glencoe  & that Fannie is pleased with the mountainsHext & Hayne & Ben amusing themselves & getting their lessons.

	I saw Mr. H who told me that he would assistin purchasingBell for Glencoe.

	I suppose you havethe beef & the hogs & are.  When you want more beef steak you can kill the other beef & salt.  If you can buy pork up there at 25 cts per pound you may purchase.

       Give my love to all the children.  I hope your mother & Anne are doing well & have got supplies on hand to keep them from starving.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	We reached home last evening about half past five all safe, pleasant day, met a great many soldiers returning.  Bill Fisher & two others took dinner with us on the road.  They all abused Elford terribly.

	Just as we were getting out of the carriage at the kitchen Allston Hayne rode up & took supper with us.  He returned ai uncle Allstons & went home today.

	After supper a man from Anderson came to get me to issue a Bail Writ & I made five dollars in cash Sunday night.

	Today my office has been full of loafers & some Clients.  I booked five dollars today.  I got ten bushels of corn last night of Pool & Hext brought it home this morning, so I have somethiong to feed horses on.  I have written to Newberry C.H. for corn today again.  Times are terrible.  Susan paid eight  per bushel for Irish potatoes to plant.  Get all thepotatoes you can and as soon as you can.  Ito plant a great many at Gelncoe.

	Harry has prepared one bed in the garden for potatoes & I will plant tomorrow if the weather is good.

	I bought a parcel of garden seed of Watson today & will send you a part of them.  Sow the lettuce & one paper of radishes.  Get some more cabbage seed if you can but I bought two papers of Watson.  Sow the turnips as soon as you please.  Broadcast on one of your beds after manuring it.

	It is now raining half after six in the evening & Hext may not get off in the morning.  

	They all express great surprise at your staying at Glencoe.  Duncan told me everybody was about to st, says Maj. Mauldin chose to sell negoers to live.

	Tell Carruth I have got his receipt for the five thousand dollars Bond & I paid eighty dollars.

	I am writing in my office & waiting for the mail.  The cars do not come till half after six & leave half after four in the morning.

	I recd a letter from Willie which I will send you.  I feel glad I am at home once more but wish you were here with me.  After fixing your garden you must come back & stay here.  In the summer we will go up there & live.  I have been very busy today & have not read the newspapers at all so I have no news to write you.

	Anne took dinner with us.  Midss Gordon paid me a long visit today.  She wishes tyo go back home & wanted me to asist her in getting a passport.  She says she is spending all of her money & soon will have nothing.

	I must now close & go to the House & see Hext & Fannie about getting everything ready & send after the papers.

	I do not know what time Iwill go to Charleston.  The city is still threatened.  I feel like not stirring from home again for a long time.  I loose so much by being.

	If you see any of Zach Wards people engage five hundred pounds of bacon & lard.  Send Hext to Dr. [W.A.] Mooneys when they can & plow for the cherry trees or let Alfred walk down some Sunday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This has been a busy day and I have only a few moments to write.

	I was surprised to see Alfred, & yet I was glad to hear from you.  I thouight a great deal about you & how Hext got home.  To hear from you all  that you are well is enough to excuse Alfred in my feelings.

	I made twenty dllars today by advice & drawing papers.

	I will not go to Charleston.  In fact I cannot spare the trime.

	You must get all the Irish potatoes you can.  I wish to plant a field of them.

	I spoke to Ward about the Bacon.  I wish five hundred pounds of Bacon & one hundred of Lard or one hundred & fifty.

	The corn you have ought to do us.  I fear we acnnot haul it from Gosnel[l]s.

	I am glad Fisher is going to make the fence.  Let him commence next to Carruths.

	I hope McClure will go on with his clearing.  I dont mind the Smoke House except the hauling.

	I would have sent you more seeds but it is too soon yet to sow them.  

	I cant get sage nor tomatoes but will do so hereafter I hope.

	I have no news to write.  If I had time to study I could write you a long letter but I have no time.

	I will try & come up soon & see how you come on.

	I planted potatoes Saturday & tomorrow will plant a variety of seeds.  I bought onion buttons today.  I have plenty of cabbage seed.  

	I have just got the mail, no news.  Isaac Hayne writes me to sell his negro for him on sale day.

	We all wish you at home very much & I think you may come back with me when I go up in good weather.

	Your mother, Susan & Fannie have all written to you & left me nothing to say.

	Do let the men go on with their oats & clearing & take care of the corn. It ought to do us.  If I could haul from Gosnel[l]sI would take his corn at $1.50 but I do not think that can be done.  

	There is great talk of Bacon rolled with the coast salt spoiing & I shall see Zach Wood tomorrow,

	McClanahan has provided some bacon.

	I have bought fifty bushels of corn from Newberry.

	Take care of yourself & children my dear wife.  Your affec[tionate] husband. B.F. Perry

	Harrison has just brought your letter & homespun.  He says his waggon will call in the morning.  Fannie will send you a jug of molasses & some strawberry plants.  

	I was glad to hear from you but would have been still better pleased if Alfred had got home before you wrote, so that you could have replied to our letters.

	I am glad to learn you are likely to get bacon & lard from Maj. Carruth.  Word is a hard customer.  He thinks of Charleston prices.  I think we can make out with the corn we have at Glencoe.  But I am willing to buy 50 or 100 bushels if near & can be hauled.  Sam McClanahan has promised to let me have bacon at 60 cents.

	I am gardening, have planted all the beds where we had Irish potatoes last year again in potatoes & in addition the whole bed on the right of the gate.  I hope here I shall have plenty.  The potatoes in the old beds were almost enough to replant them.  They were round & very large.  I have planted one bed in English Peas & another partly in cabbage seed, lettuce & radishes.  Today I have Charles, Charlotte & Rose working in the garden.

	I made ten dollars yesterday but nothing today.  I sent by Grady to Charleston to sell for me $2000 of South Carolina Bills.  They are worth 30 cts premium & this will make me $600.  I have $1200 more but did not send it.   I am going to invest my confederate Bills in a note ofHme for $1606.47.  I took a note the other day from Collins on Scott & McCullough for $500.00.  I am trying to get rid of all my money in notes.

	There is no news.  I recd a letter from Col. S.O. Goodlett last night wishing me to come on to Wilmington to defend him but I cannot go.  I went to see his daughter the other day.  Gen. Evans has been acquitted & I fear Goodlett will fare badly.

	We are getting on pretty well.  But wo you at home very much.  I will probably come up & see you next week before I start on the circuit.

	I hope you make the servants clear & plow the oats as fast as possible.  I hope Bill Fisher has commendced the fence & that McClures going on with his clearing.  Dont take the servants from their work for anything.  You & Mary must manage the garden & Hext go on mess.

	Edward is sick with sore throat & Hoke is attending him.  

	Edward Stokes is expected home this evening.  I saw Captain Williams the other day.  

	Old Mr. Pinckney was at the Mansion House last night.  He says Buncombe is very cold.  The coldest winter climate he ever saw except Boston.

	I wish to plant the most of the field around Alfreds House in potatoes.  Get all the seed you can, Irish & Sweet.

	In great haste, your affectionate husband.  Give my love to all the children, B.F. Perry

	Harrison came yesterday with your letters, all of which I read twice & was delighted to hear from you.  I am very anxious to see you all & really it is a great deprevation to be separated from you.  As soon as the weather is good I will go up & stay two or three days with you.  But you muast come down as soon as possible.  

	Fannie went down with Mrs. Barnett Cleveland yesterday just before your letters came & will probably stay till tomorrow.  Annie went also.  Fannie is verey anxious for you to come home.  She wished the other day that I should go & bring you down.  

	The household is getting on pretty well.  I have not seen Anne for two weeks.  Your mother carries to her meals.  Edward is getting better,  He had a rising in his throat which is so prevalent.Harry is spading up the garden.  Charlotte has hauledmanure one or two days.

	I will send you the thread or spun yarn by Moss.  The cost of no. 9 was $3.50 & the cost of no. 10 was $4.00  a bunch.  There are 16 Bunches, 10 of no. 10 & 6 of no. 9.  Sister brought your cotton bats, ten pounds more thatn you sent for.

	I have got 306 pounds of Bacon of Sam McClanahan at 60 cts per lb.  I bought 61  pounds of buttrer of a Buncombe waggon at 65 cts a pound.  It is very fine butter, but a little rancid or strong.  But it is cheaper than lard.  I had to pay 75 cts for lard & bought five dollars worth.  We are now eating turnip salad & hog jowls.  I still have beef.  Mr. Moore bought 100 bushels of corn for me in Abbeville at $2.00 per bushel.  It will be here next week.

	If you can get corn at $2.00 [per] bushel, engage 100 bushels.  Corn is now selling here at $2.85 & 2.50 per bushel.  Engage the corn at once.  If you can buy M Carrolls Bacon at 50 or 60 cts get it.

	The yankees commenced their movements towards Savannah the other day & bombarded Fort McCallister two days & quit.  They did no harm.  [Earl] Van Dorn gained a great victiry over the yankees in Tennessee. Killed & wounded 1000 , took 3000 prisoners &c.  His loss being heavy.  

	I have heard nothing from Willie saince Ed Stokes came.  They are now recruiting & following theirin the valley of Virginia.  Dr.  Williams came back the other day,.  He has an appointment in the Hospital at Atlanta Georgia   

	I have got some more garden seeds which I will  bring up.

	I have had no business lately oif any consequence.  Your aunt Sarah made her will the other day & wrote it herself.  I dont know its contents.  I made $700 by my sale of S.C. Bills.

	Tell Frank Fisher to stay at home till sent for.

       I hope Hext, Hayne & Ben are saying their lessons every day.

	I sold Isaac Haynes man for $1400 & sent him the money.  At Brocks sale cows sold for $90.00, corn 85 cts per bushel, plates $100 a piece, bed quilts & counterpanes $15.00 a piece.

	Fannie has just written you a long letter & told you everything so I have nothing to write about.

	Willie was going up to see you Wednesday but Col. Butler wrote him to meet him in Columbia that day.  He returns tomorrow & will go up Saturday or Sunday.  When he returns I will go up.  Did not go to Pickens court.  There was no court & will be now at Greenville next week. on the circuit.  I have been working five or ten dollars every day since my return.  But we stand in need of a great deal of money to pay for corn at $2.90 & bacon at 75 cts.  I am afraid it will take Alfred a long time to haul the corn.  That is as bad as paying for it.

	I got 100 bushels corn fromthe other day costing me $2.20 a bushel.  I have fifty bushels engaged in Newberry.

	I hope the old field is finished ploughing.  Let them plough as much as they can.

	I cannot get nails.  The smokehouse will have to be built without nails.  But I will try to get them.

	Willie goes back Monday two weeks 6th day of April.  He brought 105 dismounted men with him to get horses.  It will take them 30 days to return on horseback.  Wiley came with him & will go back with him.  They will ride to one of the mens houses to let them go by the.  Wiley looks well & has behaved well.  Willie is in good health.

	The rumor is that Charleston was to be attacked this day but nohave yet come although it is ten oclock in the night.  No news yesterday of any great importance.  The yankees attacked Port Hudson on the Mississippi & were repulsed.

	Spartan Goodlett was here & returns tomorrow.  He has been restored to his command but has not had hisyet.

	We all want you & the children to come home very much.  You must come back with me.  Plant your garden at once.   will finish it.

	Mr. Barton surprised me very much yesterday.  I thought something had happened to some of you.  He staid with me last night & this morning found his money at Holdmans.   A little girl found the Bill whilst sweeping the floor.  I am very glad for it would have been a serious loss to the poor man.

	Willie returned from Columbia Friday night & will go to Glencoe tomorrow or next day if the weather is good.  Perhaps I may go with him.  If so you & the children had betteer come down with us & go back again.  But I dont think you ought to leave the children there by themselves.  But I will write more about this when Willie goes up.

	We are all well & doing well.  But we have had bad weather & cant do much in the garden.

	This is court week but we shall have no Judges & no court. I would like to come up & stay but I am making something here almost evrery day & my little helps these hard times.

	You had better engage the lard of Carruth.  I should like to have a bushel or two more of Irish potatoes.  I will send money by Willie to pay for the corn.   I think I can make out for money although I have bought Ha note.   Williams endorsed the note which makes it beyond dispute and really I do not wish to keep Confederate money or Confederate Bonds if I can get nothing good.

	I tried to get nails & found them one dollar a pound.  I will not puerchase at that price except enough to make the door of the Smioke House.  The roof can be put on very well without nails.  Have the cracks betqween thewall daubed with clay & the smoke kouse will do very well for the present.  You ought to have the floor made of& then dirt asthrown over the.  This will make a very nice floor & the best for a smoke House.  Theyou can pick up around thehouse or take those you have haulked out the garden.  Dont hinder the men from clearing & ploughing.  They must not lose a day.  I am sorry the hauling of the corn will iake so long to haul, but that cannot be helped.  We must have corn.  Tell Alfred to be very careful of the corn & use it sparingly.  

	I have nothing more to write you, & Mr. Barton has just come into my office.   

	I want to see you & the children very much & it is a great deprevation to be without ouy.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. No war news of any great consequence.  A fight on the Rappahannock where Willie has been & 250 of our men killed, wounded & captured.  No attack on Charleston yet.  To the West we have been successful in two or three places.  But the enemy is getting a very large army in Tennessee. There will be bloody battles fought this spring everywhere.  Willie will not get back to the army till the last of April.

	I send you by Willie $250.00 to pay for the corn.  If you come down with Willie leave the money with Barton & send Jackson word that the money is there.

	If you think the children will not run wild in the mountains, or get hurt, or not be taken care of, you had better come down in the Buggy with Willie & stay till he goes then I will go up  with you & stay awhile.  If you think best, you & the children can come down in the carriage & let John come & carry the horses back.  Alfred & Johnny can be employed  in clearing on the branch below Alfreds house.  I am willing to any arrangement you may make.

	If you do not come down with Willie I will go up as soon as Willie comes back & bring you down in the Buggy & then when Willie goes off carry you back & stay awhile & then all come down

	Fannie is very anxious for you to be at home again and I think it best you should be with her.  

	I am doing some business every day.  Yesterday I drew a Bill in Equity for Thomas.  The day before I took a note for an old fee of $250.  But I am getting scarce of money.  I bought a sack of salt of Holdman yesterday for $31.25.

	General Thompson sent me a demijar full of the finest syrup I ever tasted and a parcel of sausages from Florida.  Barret will send me three bags of flour soon, one bag as a present.  McClanahan has promised yam potatoes so I dont want Bartons.

	If Willie comes home Friday or Saturday I will go up on Sunday unless you come with him.  I can stay there Monday and bring you down Tuesday & then you will have five or six days to staY with Willie before he goes off.  Then we can go back Monday afterwards & stay a week & all come down.  But do as you please about it.

	The morning I left you I met McMakin who told me the enemy had all left Charleston.  I stopped
at Dr. Mooneys to see the papers, but he had taken them off with him.  They will no doubt return again.  I stopped at Wearns but there is no chance of getting any yarn for several weeks.  The contrary report was false.

	When I reached home I found Hey waiting to consult me about his distillery.  He is arrested & will pay me handsomely.  Whilst talking to him in my office, . Fannie came running in to tell me Willie had come!  I was very much surprised & gratified to see him & know that he was safe.  This will be gratifying news to you.  He was pleased with his trip to Charleston & told Miss McCord that when the yankees heard his cavalry had come down they all ran off!

	Willie left this morning for Columbia & will stay there till Thursday when he goes on horseback to Virginia.  Edward Stokes came up last night & will go back Monday morning.  Last night they had a big frolic at Col. Goodletts.  Fannie will write you all about that.

	The Buggy broke [word obscured] I came down & had to be [word obscured] the shop.  Hext went today after the flour to Westmore.  He will go to Glencoe in the morning.  I am writing you now about noon as I am at leisure.

	The day after I arrived here I filed Bill for Maj. Clo against Pleasant Jenkins for a negro woman.  I have made five or ten dollars every day since I came back,  Today I have been employed in an Equity casie in Pickens for Dr. Hunter against Hunt.

	I had to give Willie $250 more to carry him  and his men on to Virginia,  

	I have planted two beds in the garden in cabbage plants & one in beans since I came back.  Cnarlotte hoed out the Irish potatoes.  

	Vardry & ten or fifteen boys ran off & went to Charleston.  Vardry has joinedRegiment.  The others came home on furlough last night & say thery have joined Holl artillery.  Susan seems satisfied with Vardrys running off & the McBees are all pleased at it,

	The weather is fine and I hope you have had the negroes well employed  in ploughing corn & breaking the land.  I have bought three pounds of nails.  Let Fisher nail plank over the big cracks in the smoke house & he can daub the small ones without plank.  I stopped at Earles mill & left $10 for flour.  Get your meat from Carroll.  It is selling at $1 per pound down here.  Ste had his house broken open the other night $2500 worth of  tobacco stolen & some meat!  No discovery as to the thief.  Held has sold Andy for $2500 & he goes to Augusta.  

	As soon as your smoke house is finished & the corn planted come down.  You had better drive Charley in the Buggy.  Bill does better in the wagon which goes slowly.  Let them take two days & bring provisions with them for horses & negroes on the road.

	We are all doing very well, but would do better with you.
	
	No war news of any consequence.  I will now close as Hext can tell you what I have omitted to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Brandy Station

Dear Pa

	I have not written you for some time past, because I have had nothing to write about.  I will write you a few lines today to let you know how I am getting on.  Yesterday orders came to cook this days rations and in the evening we took up march for Brandy Station about 5 miles; and we all expected to move across the Rappahannock this morning, but contrary to all expectations we came back about a mile and are striking a camp.  What is in the wind I am unable to tell.  Something is up though Hoods, McLaws moved up this way a day or two ago and are now about Kellys Ford.  I thought yesterday that a forward movement was about being made by Lee and that the Cavalry and several divisions of Infantry had been sent up here to cross but this morning there is a report that fighting is again on down about Fredericksburg.  This report and our delaying seems to show that the move is a feint or has been interupted by an attack from the enemy.  Gen. Lee, I suppose is the only one who knows all about it.  On Friday last we had a grand review of all the Cavalry under Stuarts Command and a big show it was.  Five Brigades of Cavalry were on the Field and we charged about considerably.  Stoneman wont be able to make another raid while we have our present Cavalry force about here.

	My horses are improving a good deal and if we dont have any hard duty to do for awhile, I think Wiley will bring them out to what they were when I was home.  I would like to send my sorrel horse home if I had an opportunity, but I would like to buy another first.  I think he may recover his eyes.  They are looking pretty well at present.  The horse I spoke of getting for Vardry is too small for me. 

        Joe Ferguson joined us yesterday at last, looking very well.  Jno. Ferguson read me a portion of his letter to you.  I hope you will not get him any position which will take him from our Company.  He was grossly insulted by Col. Butler but he can come back into the Company whenever he wishes to, and get out of his present position in the Commissarys Department.  I am sorry that my boots cost so much but I need them as my present ones wont last much longer and when a man gets out of boots here there is no chance of getting any more this side of Richmond.  I dont believe I need any clothes.  Joel Ketchum left my Carpetbag in Richmond, so I have only a change alone which is enough.  I can send for my carpetbag when these I have wear out.

	I was very busy yesterday & shall be more so today.

	We have no particulars of the great battle at Gettysburg in Pen[n]sylvania.  It is likely Wilie was not in it.

	I dont think it will be possible for me to come up to Glencoe.  The Board of Trustees of the College are ordered to meet on Monday night.  But I shall not go.

	Tell Alfred he will have to keep chopping in the corn till it is clear if it takes him to September.  I want all the sproats killed & grass cleared out so that I may sow rye in the field up toward Bil Fishers.

	As soon as the weather is settled & the wheat perfectly dry he must haul it & fence it in so that the horses may have a pasture.

	Let Mary & Lindy & Charlotte all chop sproats in the corn every day till it is cleared out.  Then fix your garden & road & yard.  Keep them in the field first.

Hagerstown, Md.

Dear Pa

	For the first time in nearly a month I have an opportunity of writing you.  For the past four weeks we have been on a constant go.  We crossed the Potomac just two weeks ago tonight and have had a busy time of it ever since, and there is a prospect of its lasting some time yet.  But I am quite well and so is Wiley.  One of my horses is a little lame but not much.

	You have no doubt heard of the battle of Gettysburg which I think was about a drawn one.  We all thought we were going back into Virginia a few days ago, but now I expect we will remain and there will in all probability be another great battle in a day or two, so says Gen. Lee in a General Order published this morning to the Army.  Our loss in the Gettysburg battle was heavy, but the men are in good spirits and ready to meet the enemy again.  Our Regiment has had over a dozen fights and skirmishes in the last four weeks, and for the past 34 days not a day has passed without some portions of the Cavalry having a fight.  In the Gettysburg fight we were on the left and had a big Cavalry fight.  Gen. Hampton was pretty severely wounded, two sabre cuts on the head and a shot in the leg.  Our Regiment did good service in the fight.  Tom Butler was killed and several wounded.  But ours has been a lucky Reg[iment] so far.  We have been shelled over and over and suffered very little.  Gen. Hampton I suppose has gone home by this time.  Col. Baker of the 1st N.C. is now in Command of the brigade, and is a very good officer.

	I am writing in a very great hurry and dont know when I will have an opportunity of sending off this letter.  If I had time I would give you a detailed account of our experience for the past month, how we went within 10 miles of Washington and captured over two hundred sixtrains with the wagons and about a thousand yanks and negroes together.  But time is short, and we are moving nearly all the time.  We fared first rate in Pennsylvania.  The citizens gave us plenty of Bread and milk, and we took all the horses we could lay hands on.  Our Cavalry so far as I saw behaved very well, but the Infantry they say plundered a great deal.  I must close.  Stokes and all our Company are quite well.  Give my love to all.

	The news from Charleston was not so bad last night as we expected.  But the fall of Charleston is pretty certain in the course of ten days.  The fight on Saturday was a very hard one & a great many killed.  It was renewed Sunday night & we have not heard the result.  If the Enemy was driven from Morris Island, Charleston is safeif not the city is gone.

	Your mother spoke to me last night aboutgoing up with Hext.  Shewas unwell  & you promised that she might go up.  Hext can bring her back in the buggy with Bill when you wish her to return.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  Lees army is in a critical situation but I think will succeed in getting out,

	I miss you very much & long for you to return.  But have no doubt you are making the servants do better thao if you were here.  I must try & come up & see you.  But the cxommissioners meet today & will be in session a long time.  I will send the& hope it will reach you safely.

19 July 1863
Martinsburg, Va.

Dear Pa

	I wrote you the foregoing letter a week ago and have had no chance to send it and so will write you a few lines more today.  I was mistaken in my prophesiesbut it was owing to the yanks not wanting to fight for Gen. Lee offered them battle for two days, and on the third night our army crossed the Potomac again and here we are again in old Virginia.  I dont know what we are going to do.  Some think we are going back to the Rappahanock but at present we are picketing around this place.  Day before yesterday the yankees ran in our Pickets and took 11 men from Capt. McFies & Chasnuts  Companies.  I hear this morning that they are fighting at Charleston, and we heard several days ago that Vicksburg was taken, but some dont believe it yet.

	I am quite well  and so is Wiley.  Gen. Stuart with part of the cavalry drove the Yankee Cavalry across the river at Sheperdstown.  There are still some of them in front of us, but I dont think they are across the river in much force.  I have no news to write you.  The men who went home for horses are expected here today.  We have had a great deal of wet weather here lately, but we have got so used to rain that we dont mind it.  I have no time to write hardly.  All the Company are well.

	Give my love to all and write to me often.  I have not got but two letters in the past month; the mails are very irregular.  Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

Culpepper C.H.

Dear Pa

	I wrote you last, I believe from Martinsburg.  We reached this place yesterday, and I hope we will have a few weeks rest, for our horses particularly need it.  They have fared very hard indeed, having scant feed and hard riding.  Whether we will remain here and have the Rappahanock for a time or go near Richmond depends I suppose on the movements of the enemy.  If they try the Pennisula route we will have to go below Richmond to meet them.  At present most of our army is in this neighborhood, and the yankees are across the river.  I have no news to write you.  We found on reaching this place that the horse detachment were here waiting for us, which increases our force a great deal.  Three recruits have come on to our Troop, Thornburg, Cunningham and Earle.  Two men started West, and Good but deserted before they reached us.  Good is certainly a deserter and will be claimed as such by Capt. Williams.  I dont know yet whether [he] can be considered to have enlisted or not.  They heard of our retreat from Pennsylvania and became disheartened no doubt.  McClanahan brought my boots and left them near Charlottesville where I will be able to get them when I need them which will be soon.  I am bad off in the way of clothes and must try and get my carpetbag which Joel Ketchum left in Richmond, which will furnish me for the remainder of the summer.  I received a letter from you dated the 20th.   I hope now we will be able to have regular mail communication, and hear the news daily.  It is a great deprivation to be cut off from the mails as we were in Pennsylvania  and Maryland.  I think our soldiers generally are glad to get back again to Old Virginia.  As for myself I dont care much where I am, only, we have a more quiet time in Virginia than across the river.  I hope there will be no necessity for your Cavalry Company being called into active service.  I feel rather uneasy, though, about Charleston but I hope she will stand the storm.

	I must close.  Give my love to all.  Bill Beattie and others who have just returned from home say they had quite a lively time while there.

	I think you overate the importance of Vicksburg.  I never thought it would [be] so very serious a loss to the Confederacy.  Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I think Bill is to leave for Fannie & Hext to go upday.  They went to a Partie atlast night and are tired thoroughly.

	The news last night was very important & I send you a slip of the Guardian.  No Columbia Papers come.  I saw Hawthorn this morning who told me the news in Columbia was that Lee had whipped the yankees in a great battle at Gettysburgh.  We shall hear tonight the particulars.

	I spent Sunday at General Thompsons with Col. Ware & Bolling.  Col. Martin came up & we met Saturday night and again yesterday & will today & continue till Friday.  Martin says the Commissioners allpay at $8 for every day from our first meeting.

	Court is tomorrow.  I hope to be able to go up next Sunday or Saturday.  We have aof our company.  We had a public meeting yesterday.

	The horses look pretty well.  I hope the corn will be hoed out in time to make some hay.  They were a long time cutting wheat.  But the rain delayed I suppose.

	I shall be very lonely when Fannie goes.  I miss you very much & am like a fish out of water.

	I kept Hext here today to have Bil shoad & haul wood.  Bill was very much fatigued too.

	I have just recd your letter by Moss.  I could not understand your letter by Hext about the colt.  But since have seen it & will take it.  But Moss says he has sold it to OShields.  Pace may decide who shall have the colt, me or OShields.  He is a pretty good horse, but the haze in the face..his looks very much.  I dont think I can sell Bill for anything.  He is worn out.  Let Hext bring Charley down with him.  I will not drive Bill or Monarch again.

	I will go up next Sunday if Hext & Hayne come down on Saturday.

	Judge [Andrew Gordon] Magrath did not come & we have no court.  I recd $260 from J Sitton for fees incases.  I am receiving a little every day from ten to $20.    

	I send you Willies letters.  There is no news.  I saw Col. Butler yesterday.  He looks cheerful & is doing well.

	General Thompson says he spoke in high terms of Willie.  Says he was cool in battle & cares nothing for applaudes.   Said he behave[d] very gallantly in attacking a Regiment with eight men.  Col. Butler came in his carriage this morning to get The Home Guards men by.  I loaned it to him as your. He enquired about you very kindly.

	Mrs. Dr. Parker made me a visit Saturday about selling her lot in Charleston for $20,000 to [George A.] Trenholm.

	I will send you the newspeprs.  Charleston is not yet taken.  But will be I fear in the course of time.

	I received your letter last evening and was glad to hear Wiley had arrived safely with his horses.  Directly after reading your letter I saw Dr. Rutherford who owns Wileys wife and told him that Wiley would be at his house Wednesday & that he must meet me at Newberry Friday.

	I shall go up Friday & be at home Friday night.  There is nothing likely to be done in the Legislature of importance.  I introduced a Bill this morning to impress provisions for Soldiers families which will pass. 

	You have seen an account of the great fight in Georgia.  We are anxiousy waiting for the final battle.  The victory so far is dearly bought.  But of the greatest importance to the Confederacy.  

	I met you uncle Arthur this morning who wishes to send up two of Pinckney Alstons daughters under my charge as far as Belton.  They have been staying with him, & go to pay a visit to Alston Hayne.  He says they are twins & beautiful young ladies.  

	I am to up today & dine with Mr. Johnson at two oclock.  It is now one oclock.

	Yesterday I had Governor Manning, Speaker Aldridge [Aldrich], & Col. Hayne to take a glass of my whiskey & honey brandy which they enjoyed much.

       The House has taken a recess till five oclock this evening.

       You may send Frank McBee word that I recei[ve]d his letter & bought his Surveying Books, four for ten dollars [page torn] [and] will bring them up with me.

	I will go to see Mrs. LeConte this evening. [Page torn] Boyce is to go here this evening.  Your uncle says he is going to bring the Miss Alstons to the State House tomorrow.

	I did not see Tim .  I saw Henry Cauble who brings down Vest as a substitute.

	Dr. Croft is asnxious abpout his son who was in the late Battle but has not heard from him.  The Butler Guards were in the battle but not heard from.

	I will write you tonight if anything occurs.

	Alston Hayne gave me the certificate of the Planters & Mechanics Bank & says the other isin the Bank of SC.  It stands in the name of Hext McColl.  I will enclose you an order for you & Susan & Anne all to sign.  Send it to me & I will send it to your uncle or you enclose it to your uncle & write him a letter.

	I have not yet seen Miss , but sent Fannies letter by Nat Butler.  Nat told Hext that he came down to see his sweetheart.  Hext says Fannie .

	The Battle of Chickamauga has been disastrious & every thing looks very gloomy.

Camp Near Culpepper

Dear Ma

	I will write you a few lines today to let you know how I am getting on.  I have not received a letter from any of you since the 11th which was the date of the last one written by Pa.  My last letter was written just after we had come back from our last expedition when Lee advanced on [George Gordon] Meade.  Since that time we have been quiet, and are now located exactly where we were camped for a long time last winter, and I hope we may be allowed to remain here for some time enjoying quiet.  All we have to do now is to picket along the Rappahanock.  Our Brigade during the absence of Gen. Butler is commanded by Gen. Young who was promoted the other day.  He is a nephew or some relation to E.P. Jones, but notwithstanding is a very good officer and a very gallant one.  I have heard that Jno. Jones is on his staff.  Butler Thompsons son Waddy is one of his orderlies.  It was reported the other day that Gen. Butler had been assigned to the command of a Brigade of Cavalry on the Coast of S.C. and that our Regiment was to be sent there in exchange for Aikens Reg. which would be sent out here.  We were all very much elated at the idea, but it seems to have been only a rumor, for we have heard nothing further of it.  Perhaps it is just as well for us to remain here, for though we have more fighting to do, and are so far from home still we have good health which we might not have there.  Wiley reached me several days ago, with my overcoat & clothes.  I am very much pleased with the coat, which I think will do me good service this winter.

	Another detachment has gone home for horses, among them Blythe, Cooley, Goodlett & Willingham from our company.  If you should have a chance I want you to send me by some of these men or by some one a bushel or so of dried fruit and two or three gallons of homemade molasses.  I would not like to bother any of them with a box, but perhaps they may be bringing on a box for themselves and might put these things along with theirs or two boxes would not be much more bother than one at any rate.  The fruit Wiley brought was a great treat, as was also a canteen of molasses which he brought.

	How are my horses getting along.  Mention them in every letter.

	I will close as I have nothing to write.  Give my love to all. Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I have concluded not to go to Glencoe this morningyou being thereall purposes.  I saw Zach Wood yesterday, and told him I would be at his house Monday morning and I should like to go, but I should loose thirty or forty dollars perhaps by being absent Monday & Tuesday.  I have had profitable business every day since you left.  Absalom Blythe brought me his uncles Will the day you left.  He has left him thirty or forty thousand dollars.  Will Butler was here last night and told me Blythe & Miss Emily Earle were engaged.  She is going to do well.

	Yesterday another Will of McWilliam was brought me.  He had been to see me whilst I was at Spartanburg & then went to Spartanburg to see me.  It was important business.  I made five dollars each day by advice since you have been gone,  So you see I shall have to give up Glencoe to you.

	Last night I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie.  It was directed to you.  He is quite well & wrote Wiley had returned &c.

	There is no news of any importance.  I am glad our sweet potatoes turned out so well.  The lard you got & butter are very acceptable.  It was well to get it at once as Ward might have let it go to someone else.

	I will send you two or three bushels of salt which you can swap off for pork & Beef.  Engage all the port you can.

	Johny had better come down & carry back Charley to haul corn if you can get Bostons waggon & then plough in the wheat with Charley & the colt.  Tell Alfred he had better slip shuck the corn as he pulls it & throws it into the crib without further shucking.  It keeps better & will save time.  There will be enough straw & corn tops to winter the cattle with the shucks as the corn is fed away.  The crib will hold all the corn slip shucked.

	I dined with Mr. Boyce yesterday with Trescot & Wilson.  Fannie dined with Mrs. Dr. Earle.  You must come down Wednesday if a good day.  Charlotte & Sarah went to Williamston this morning.  Louis seems to do well.  We are all well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

I knew there was no motive to run off for the negroes are better than being free & I knew it was impossible for them to make their escape.  I am sure both Alfred & Johny will consider themselves greatly slandered.  

	Polk Mauldin is here sick & goes up in the morning.  He has been in the hospital in Richmond & has a furlough for thirty days.  Mr. Boyce goes up in the morning to bring Mrs. Boyce down on Monday.  I have not yet seen or heard of Col. OHanlon.

	You must feed the cow better & she will give more milk.  Dont write to me about her anymore for I cannot help it.  If we have got a bad bargain it is too late to remedy it.  I acted for the best and that is enough & should satisfy you.

	I have just returned from the committee & it is now near eleven oclock.  I have no news to write you.  Lee, Fair, Trescot & myself made speeches on the death of Col. James Perrin which you will see in the papers.

	This is Sunday, & I have just returned from church, eaten my dinner, lighted my pipe, & seated myself to write you a letternot yet two oclock.  Hext & Charley Janney have gone off somewhere with Duncan Brooks.

	I went with Wallace Thompson to the Catholic church & heard a very learned Sermon on the Bible.  The Priests object seemed to be to place the church above the Bible.  He said it was all uncertain about the Bible out of the church.  It required [page torn] the church history to understand the Bible--portions were specious, left out & alteredportions not to be comprehended &c.  I thought the discourse was altogether a war upon the truth & authenticity & inspiration of the Bible.

	I saw Miss McEl & the nuns.  I suppose I shall see Simms & his wife here this week.I have been out nowhere.  Governor Pickens has gone & Mrs. Pickens did not meet him here.

	I have written a letter to Col. OHanlon for I wish Hext to pay him a visit.  He is learning nothing & seeing nothing here.  He stays all his time with Janneys son  & Duncan Brooks.  I have had my wallet mended & gave Hext yours this morning.  He is very& pleased with it.  Chancellor Dunkin said he did not recognise Hext in his homespun.  He though [page torn] too aristocrtic to clothe him in homespun.  My hat is very much admired.  Tell Edward I have not yet worn my homespun suit.  The weather is rather cold for it.  

	I was in hopes to have heard from you last night.  I wrote to John to send on the corn forthwith.  If Easleys negroes do not send fodder & shucks you will have to send to Perry Duncan.  If you can buy shucks or fodder do soyou wish beef kill the calf when the weather is cold enough.  Feed the cows well on meal &slop.

	I wrote Willie a long letter yesterday.  But I see they have had skirmishes lately.  Sparkes is here & is now Lieutenant in a company in the lower country.  He looks well.  I have heard nothing of your uncle Arthur.  I saw Mr. D Thornwell this morning.    He enquired after your mother & family.

       Col. Ware has been in my room & sat a long time.  But for this I would have written you more.  Tell Fannie I will write her this week.  I have written to Elford to come down this week as our Board will have to revise the prices.  I wish you would go into my office & look in my Paper case to the left of the door as you go in.  The upper part is unlockedsee a box marked Commissions.  In it there are two large packages containing lists of prices in an Envelope.  Get these Envelopes & contents & give them to Elford to bring down with him.  I want the prices to govern us in our revision.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just been down to get my letters but was disap[p]ointednone from you.  It is  now eight oclock in the night.  Hext is asleep.  He will go up in the morning with Duncan Brooks, Nat Butler & Joel Goodlett.  I have bought him a gun which makes him anxious to go home & shoot birds.  He seems so anxious to go that I have concluded it was best for him to return.  He would be lonesome here after Duncan leaves & Col. OHanlon may not come up for some time.  Janney says he would not find much to amuse him at the Cols.  I thought the gun was a good investment of Confederate money & it would give Hext so much pleasure.  Janney says if ever I wish to part with it he will buy it.  But it is a fine gun & will do for all the children as Hext grows too large for it.  It has two barrels & I really thought it worth twice what I gave for it.

	I was invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow & shall do so.  I saw Mrs. LeConte today & she invited me to take tea with her as soon as I could.  She said she would take charge of Fannie when she came down.  Miss Graham expressed  great anxiety to see you & enquired kindly after you.  I went up in the Gallery & sat some time with Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  Miss Lula has not been out.  Mrs. LeConte admired my hat & said it was exactly like one she had made for Dr. LeConte.

	We are doing nothing in the Legislature yet & not much to do.  I think I shall go home on Sunday & stay Monday, Sale day, & return Tuesday.  The Legislature will probably sit till the 15th Inst.

	I have seen nothing of your uncle yet nor heard anything from him!

	The news from Braggs army is rather gloomy.  Col. Beaufort Watts says it is time to begin to think of being subdued.  He said he wished Judge ONeall, Governor Hammond & myself to be sent to Washington to treat for terms.  I told him such a proposition would be treason.  He said he knew it & would not do to talk about or to mention.

	I see they have had another fight in Virginia & are expecting a great Battle there.  Col. Elford will probably come down Thursday.  Tell Fannie I will go & see Hallie C & then write her a letter.

	I was very much disap[p]ointed in not hearing from you tonight.  I heard nothing from Willie since General Butler.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I returned from the Governors dinner, where I had a very pleasant time, & met Col. Elford who handed me your letter.    I also rece[ive]d one from Col. OHanlon, your uncle  enclosing a draft for $3000, & one from General Easl[e]y about shucks & fodder. Tell Hext Col. OHanlon came up for him today in his carriage & felt greatly disappointed.  Frank McBee did not get a place in the military school.  Tell Vardry to learn to spell, cipher, write & readbut principally spelling.  He must have socks & underclothes.  The others are furnished.  Board & tuition & clothes are $300.  Vardry, Tench Pool,  & someone else were selected from GreenvilleDr. Goates son.  I have received $100 rail road dividend, & will draw my pay as Commissioner about $500 or $600.  Tell your mother her dividend in Planters & Mechanics Bank has been paid.  I suppose Taylor has it with that of Peoples Bank.  I will enquire about it.  I will send Col. OHanlons letter & your uncle.  But I cant find your uncle  letter.  It was only three lines.  [page torn] draft I have in my [ page torn] Book.  Tell Fannie I will do as she directs.  You must feed the cow as muchas she will.

	I have no paper in my room but this half sheet.  It is now eleven oclock & I have just returned from Board of Trustees.  Donaldson goes up in ther morning [&] will carry this letter.  I will perhaps come home Sunday & stay Monday.  The legislature will not adjourn till 18th.  The times are gloomy indeed, & subjugation is beginning to be talked of as possible.  I saw General H Brother Keith H at the Governors.  He said the General telegraphed last night that he was living on cornbread & beef once a day!  He wanted something sent him to eat!  Nothing special with legislature.  Give my love to all.  Vardry will be notified when to come down.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just written a long letter to Fanniue & although it is late in the night I will write you one.  Col. Elford goes up in the morning.  He has just heard that his agent in Georgia has sold his last purchasse of a plantation for a profit of $20,000 & is uneasy about it.  I told him he was foolish to think of receiving $40,000 at this time in Confederate Bills & he should reinvest it immediately.  The money is depreciating every day.

	I will go up Sunday morning & stay till Tuesday.  I have drawn your uncle Josephs money $3,000 received your mothers from Taylor & now have a check for $710 for my pay as a Commissioner up today.  I do not know what to do with the money.  Dont like to keep Confederate Bills & dont invest it.

			I wrote Fannie last night about dining with Col. Hayne.  His wife looks old enough for his Mother!  It  looks so unnatural to see so youthful looking a man tied to a woman looking so old.  There ought to be fifteen years difference between a man & his wife.  There is something horrible to see a young man with an old & ugly wife.  Mrs. Hayne is smart & lively.  I spent a very pleasant evening with him, his wife,  daughter, son, Cols. Orr, Dawkins, Garlington,  & Dr. Croft.  Col. Hayne asked me to call & see them again.  Whilst at table Col. Dawkins knocked a dish over & spilt  the contents in my lap.  Mrs. Hayne offered to take all the grease out [word obscured] I would send my best to her.  But I was not hurt much.

	Col. Taylor told me he heard from his son frequently who is a prisoner near Canada on Johnsons Island.  He is well treated.  Your uncle Arthur is sick & confined to his bed.  Mrs. Hayne said there seems to be a prostration of the system.  I will go out & see him if I can tomorrow.  Col. Isaac Hayne brought his little grandson to showfine looking & very smart.  Miss inner is quite pretty & his sons are good looking.
	I have just received a letter from Lake saying he will send corn in a day or two.  That he will be down here to see me Tuesday morning.
       The position Willie occupies is highly respectable & much easier & safer than to be in command.  He will still retain his position in the company, & it is only temporary.
	The news today is a little better.  Meade has retired before Lee and Grant has retreated before Bragg.  The yankees were terribly whipped at Chattanooga.  The Herald says they lost 40,000 men killed & wounded & missing!  Three companies of Col. McCulloughs Regiment were captured it is saidCaptain Perkins, Capt. Mo & Capt. Ben Goodlettsnone of the Regiment killed it is said,
	I want to see you all very much & only wish I could stay when I return.  Tell Hext I miss him very much & am glad  he got safe home.
	Nothing doing in trhe Legislature of any consequence or likely to be done.I must now bid you good night & go to bed.  I think I have done well to write two long letters when I expect to see you next day after you get my letters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Cavalry Camp, James Island

Dear Beattie

	I owe you a letter and I will endeavour  to make you some sort of payment.  I dont pretend to say that it will square us up but you must set it down to my credit and let me hear from you again.  You are the only man in Greenville except Dr. Buist who knows anything that is transpiring there, and your style of detailing it renders a letter from you a very interesting document; your own experience would be a subject for at least four pages.  I am very unfortunate in letter writing as in everything else having very little to say and a very poor way of saying it; but I wont expatiate on my own failings.  I wish it were convenient  for you to pay us a visit now, it being in our power to furnish a certain article that made your trip to Columbia so very expensive.  We are issuing the Oh-be-joyful to the detachment; occasionally one man trades for the shares of one or more of his comrade, and the consequence is that we have had several among us gloriously tight and correspondingly obstreporous.  Our mutual friend the A.A.C.S.C.S.A. not condescending to imbibe with such characters as John. H. White of Co. F and Samuel Youngblood Co. E and having no one with whom to take a social pass seldom visits my tent; which for the time being a sort of improvised grocery.  I think he is rather dissatisfierd with the small number of glasses (for glasses substitute tin cups) taken through the day, and if you were here to bear him company, take his position in sight of, or upon the cask and with Wiley as mixer of drinks pass the hours in greatest glee until both would be laid away to slumber off trhe effect of so great conviviality.  Let me describe this beverage color; that of very muddy rain water.  Enough said to make it very unpalateable when shaken sticks and straws float thick on the surface, with a green, greasy scum.  You are a connvisseur, what do you think of it.

	Our Camp is not very pleasantly situated but it is as good I suppose as can be found upon the Island.  We are anxious to get down to Adams Run to take possession of the quarters vacated by the Cavalry recently sent to Virginia.  I am afraid that the accounts we have of its being such a desirable location for camping are incorrect.  Perry I suppose will answer your letter shortly if he has not done so already.  I did intend to write you a lengthy epistle but am so disturbed by conversation 

29 June 1864
Camp, 2nd S.C. Cav[alry], Chisolmville

Dear Pa

 	Your letters seem to backwards.  Since I last wrote you I have received two letters from you and one from Ma, one from you I received yesterday dated Columbia 12th June. What in the world could have delayed these letters so I cannot imagine.  All that I received from Fannie came safely and promptly to hand though directed just like yours to Charleston.  I also received one yesterday from Stokes.  He does not seem much pleased with the idea of coming from Georgetown to this part of the coast, but I suppose they will have to come down here before long.  This place is as healthy as any in this vicinity, but that is not saying much for it, as none of this country is healthy; we have some sickness since coming here.  Our Maj. (Screven) has gone off sick, so has our Surgeon, and now we are borrowing a Surgeon.  Charley Lanneau has gone to the hospital, not seriously sick though.

	I wrote you that I am acting Adjutant.  It has kept me quite busy making out moring & monthly Reports.  I dont think I will hold on to the position any longer than until our Company comes here.  

	I paid Capt. Earle a visit a day or two ago.  He is camped only about a mile and a half from us.  We have had some very hot weather lately.  Today is a little more pleasant as we had a shower yesterday morning.  Muskitos bother us a good deal.  If you had such a thing as a Muskito net or could get me one I would like to have it.  On Picket it is a great deal worse than in camp.  I have not been on Picket yet.

	We get a daily mail here, being only about 5 miles from Green Pond Station.  We get the Charleston daily papers every day, so are able to keep up with the news of the day, though for the past few days there has been very little news from either Virginia or Georgia.  But no news is better than bad news.  I suppose Fannie will soon be at home again.  Ma wrote that Charlie was lame.  How is he now and how is my horse Wagoner.  Are his eyes any better.  I wrote you that I had lost my bay horse, the first horse I have had to die since I have been in service.  Captain Williams wrote me some time since  that you wanted some certificate about the loss of John Greens horse, and that he referred you to me as I was in command of the Company.  If you want the certificate write me what is the nature of it. 

	I have no news to write you.  Everything is quiet along this part of the coast apparently.  My horse is not thriving as well as I could wish.  He looks gaunt and wont fatten though Wiley gives him every attention.  I am very well myself and so is Wiley.  We live in tents as in Virginia, and the life in camp is pretty much the same, though it seems more monotonous from the fact that we are not expecting to move every day as we were there.

	Give my love to all.  Your aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

	I will write you before breakfast Monday morning as I may not have time after breakfast.

	Hext reached here about four oclock just before a hard rain.  He looks like a wet dog & he will go up tomorrow.  Your mother says Susan is not going.  He can carry Alice & Annie.  Dont let the Barouche come down again until the corn is finished.  Tell Alfred he must clean out the whole of the corn if it takes him to September.  None of it must be given up to weeds & grass.

	Whilst working the horses they must be fed with corn.  When the Barouche comes down I will send up corn for bread.
	.

	The people of the country are gloomy indeed.  I regard as gone.  Charleston will fall in a few days.  They are fighting there now.  The Batteries were attacked on Friday.  Two were silenced.  The news tonight..the fall of the City.  Lee has had to fall back into Maryland.  Hampton and nine other Generals are wounded & three more killed.  The slaughter is terrible but we have no particulars.  They foughtdays.  I will send you the papers which come tonight.

	I am very busy.  I find that I get $ as appraiser for every day since my appointment.  The pay continues as long as I am appraiser.  Next Wednesday I get $... a day as commission on Petigrus case for four or five weeks.  I shall work somethingday in my office.  The Court  of Equity is over & I did well in my business.  I am doing well amidst all of our troubles & bad things.

	No more papers can be purchased in theso you must be careful of the papers sent you.  I will send you money by Hext to buy& anything you.

	Tell Ward I can do nothing for his mother as I wrote him some weeks ago.  Tell Bill Fisher there is a man hereup all distilleries & if he does nothe will be caught.

	Scott is making the fence but has notto finish it.  

	If I have time I will write you tonight.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I am writing you in the House of Representatives, & amidst great confusion.  But it is the only chance I have of writing to you.  I am very busy & time to do nothing.

	We arrived here safely Sunday evening.  Fannie went to Dr. & Mrs. LeContes Monday morning.  Dr. Ward & Hext went down with her.  Hext remained all day & came back in the evening & got his clothes & returned to the doctors to stay,  He seems to be enjoying himself there very much in shooting with John LeConte.  I have not been able to see Fannie since she left the Hotel,  Col. Johnson enquired after you all very kindlysaid Mrs. Johnson would call to see Fannie today & that she must go & stay with them.  He is very kind.

	You will see from the Papers that Col. [Robert Bentham] Boylston has been elected Speaker.  The message of the Governor is published this mornibng.  The news from Augusta is very unfavorable.  It is  said the Enemy are in sight of Augusta.  Col. Martin telegraphed me that the Enemy wastowards his plantation in Georgia & he would not be able to meet me in Columbia.

	Judge Withers told me yesterday that Col. Lecowleys Regiment had been sent from Willmington to Georgia.  But at Florence there was a dispatch to send them back to Willmington which was done.  I am not sorry for this change for there is I hope less danger in Willmington than there would be in Georgia.

	Fannie & Mrs. LeConte & Lula & Miss Graham are now in the gallery & I have just been up to speak to them.  Fannie has written you this morning she says.

	Youir uncle Arthur has been sitting by this morning enquiring kindly about you all.  He is as loquacious as ever & very much out with the town & ext spirit of Columbia.

	I saw Vardry last night.  The cadets go to Augusta Thursday.  The Militia will all be sent to Georgia.  I have not seen Col. OHanlon.  I wish Hext to go down there before he goes home.  The weather is very warm, a great change since I left home.

	The spirit of everyone here is rather despondent.  Yeadon said yesterday that my expression The State was going to the devil was being rapidly realized.  This moment the Speaker read a telegraph dispatch to the Governor from General Bragg that the Enemys cavalry had broken rhe Savannah Rail Road thirty miles below Augusta & that General Wheeler was successfully pursuing them.

	I have just paid Col. Summer for the barrel of sugar $740.  Judge Withers told me yesterday that his family had only had one Barrel of Flour during all last summer & that they were almost starving.  He said he could stand it as he was raised roughly but his wife & children had not & it went hard with them. 

	I will now close as I have been very much.  If anything happens before night I will write you again.  I hope to hear from you this evening.  Write me as often as you have leisure & anything to write about & I will do the same.

	Give my love to the children.  Tell Susan that Vardry was in fine spirits & delighted with his prospects.  He got his coat &c. by.  YourHusband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz 

	I have a few minutes of leisure & will write you a line or two.  Last night I had to meet the Board of Trustees & on my return I stopped in at Dr. LeContes, but Fannie & Hext had gone to bed.  I saw all the rest of the family.  Today they were all in the State House with Fannie & Miss Holbeck.  The House adjourned about two oclock & I met them in the lobby & walked with the ladies into the Senate chamber where we staid some time.  Fannie went off with Miss Holbeck & says she is going to a dance tonight with Miss Holl near her Fathers house.  Fannie seems to enjoy herself very much.  I introduced her to sundry of my friends today & amongst othersGillmore Simms & Col. Pope.  She had already made the acquaintance of Col. Dawkins and Yeadon & others.  Hext is enjoying himself so much that I scarcely get sight of him. 
	
	The war news is pretty exciting.  There has been a battle at Grahamville & the result unknown.  Yesterday we heard of fighting in Georgiawas successful.  The Governor gets telegrams every day from Bragg, Chesnut & General Jones which are read to the House, but are not allowed to go imto the Papers.  It would seem that Sherman avoided Augusta & Macon.  The cadets were ordered from Hamburgh to thehead of Grahamville & may possibly have been in the battle yesterday.  But they could hardly have got there in time.  I have heard nothing from Willie & suppose he is at Wilmington.  Many persons thnik that Sherman is going to Richmondthat he will take water at Port Royal & try & get there before our troops can get back.

	Tell Anne I have sold her twenty dollar gold piece for $650.00 & herfor $750.  She will now have $1400 for the next year.  The interest of Col. Wares & Tuffers Bonds will more than make up for the capital.  In truth Confederate Bonds are of very little value.

	I have not heard from you except by your letter to Fannie.  Do write me.  I was glad to hear you were to send for factory corn & that the Bacon weighed so well.  Your affec[tionate] Hus[band], B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Wares case comes up tomorrow before a committee ofvthe Senate & I, and C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan  & Col. T.B. Cou are counsels in the case.

	It is now half after ten ocl;ock in the night & Chancellor Dunkin has just left my room.  I went to take supper with Mrs. LeConte.  Fannie & Miss Graham & young Holbeck went to the Tableaux.  Hext went to bed.  I came off to prepare for tomorrow & write letters.  The Senate will send for Beattie & Thurston in [Thomas Edwin] Wares election.  They will have to come down Wednesday.  I will have a Writ issued for Willie but I am afraid he cannot be obtained.

	They have had a severe battle at Grahamville where Willie was stationed.  His removal to Wilmington was fortunate.  We whipped the yankees.  I saw Col. Ball who passed by there today.  The yankees lost five hundred &sixty killed & wounded.  Vardry did not get there in time to be in the battle.

	Dr. LeConte lives well & they seem as kind as they can be.  Fannie & Hext are enjoying themselves.  Hext does not wish to go to Col. OHanlons.  I will send him home next week  Fannie & all of them were in the State House today.  She says she enjoyed herself last night at the dancing party with Miss Holbeck.  Lula was unwell this evening & I did not see her.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  I hope you are all well.  I must now close as I have other letters to write by  Thurston who goes up in the morning.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter last night and was sorry to find you so distressed.  You dont understand the Military Bill at all.  It applies to the troops already called out.  The second class from 50 to 60  were not likely to be called out at all & only in case of great emergency.  There is no danger of my having to go in in any event.  My broken leg disables me from marching.  So make yourself easy over that score.  The only contest in the passage oif trhe Military Bill was about the troops already called out being sent to Georgia.

	I did not see Fannie yesterday.  They were not at the State House.  Hext came to tell me that Mrs. Herbemont had invited Fannie & myself to tea at her house last night & that Fannie said I must come & go with her.  Mr. Lesesne came to me in the State House & said that Mrs. Herbemont requested me & my daughter to take tea with her.  But I could not well go.  Indeed I have no time to go anywhere or do anything except attend to my legislative duties.  

	Yesterday I received a very kind letter from General Hampton who is in Virginia.  He requests me to support Mr. Preston for governor.  But whether I do or not he feels assured I will do what I think is right.  The friends of the different candidates had their meetings last night.  I rather think Judge Magrath will be elected.  I shall vote for Preston but I cannot electioneer against the Judge.

	It is thought there will be an election for Judges & ifI am spoken of for Chancellor.  But it would be a ruinous step for me to take in these times when the salary is in fact little or nothing.  My practice & the various offices I fill are worth ten thousand a year.  A chancellor gets only three thousand.  I therefore think I had better remain as I am.

	We have issued summons for the witnesses in  Col. Wares contested election.  I have sent one to Wilmington for Willie but I do not know that he can come.  There will be a good many witnesses in GreenvilleCox, Beattie, B, Thurston &c. &c.  They will come down this week.

	I am glad you have had corn hauled from Suttons & approve of your trading for corn, wheat &c.  I hope you have had thekilled & sold.  The weather is so warm that meat will spoil.  Let the hog get pretty fat before killing him & take care that he does not get out of the lot or be stolen.  I likewise approve of your contract with Fisher about renting the place & hiring Alfred.   

	I do not think I shall stay here till the end of the Session.  After I get through with Col. Wares case I shall feel very much like returning home.  I shall certainly not stay here longer than next week.

	The papers this morning contain all the war news which I have.  Sherman is making for Savannah & will probably occupy the city as a base for future operations in the South.  I saw a brother of Governor Browns & was asking him about Mrs. Harrison in Monetta.  He told me that she & her daughter Mrs. Earle remained there & were treated very kindly by the yankees.  It is said Sherman is not destroying private Houses in his move through Georgia.

	I will enclose you some stamps.  Envelopes are dearer here than in Greenville.  I will go & see Fannie this evening.  I think Hext had better go home this week.  Give my love to all the children.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday I dined with Gov. Manning & his mess consisting of President Furman, Dr. Furman, Cols. Wilson, Richardson, Mullins, Whaley &c.  I spent a delightful evening.Governor Manning walked with me to the door & said he thanked me for the pleasant evening I had given him & his friends & wished that I should come often.  Everyone of them are for me warmly for Chancellor.  Governor Manning insisted on my going with him to see Mrs. General T Johnson who is in Columbia & a most accomplished Lady.

	After taking a cup of coffee I went to Dr. LeContes just opposite Governor Mannings quarters & spent an hour or two with the ladies there, Dr. LeConte & Col. Gage.  As I came off I met Col. Dawkins going there.  On my return home I found five or six letters & one from you.  I was glad to hear you were all well & hauling the corn from General Easleys.  But sorry theareyou have not killed them.  Make John feed them well & fatten them.  Carry corn to the mill & have it ground to feed them with.  But food is so scarce they must be killed as saoon as possible & the hogs too.

	Fannie reced a letter from Willie in which he sent his love to Lula.  She seemed unusually affectionate last evening.  I supposed Fannie had delivered Williams message.  H was there.  Governor Manniung & Col. Trescott had been there one or two evenings ago.  They have a good many gentlemen to visit them.  

	I wrote a letter last night to Col. Orr about being District Judge in case Judge Magrath was elected Governor.  At present there would be no necessity of my living in Charleston.  I shall writetoday.

	Tell Susan the terms in the Citadel are only twelve hundred per annum & the Boys find their shoes & under clothes & sheets &c. (See the Guardian advertisement).

	Fannie has a bad cold & has not been out since Saturday.  She is getting better.  Hext is quite well & wishes to stay longer.  He & John LeConte are great cronies & he stays there all the time.

	I am truly glad Willie is at Wilmington.  Had he remained at Green Pond he would have been fighhting.  Captain Earles Battery was in the Grahamville fight but the Capt. was absent.  Furman commanded the Battery.  They were fighting there on Sunday again, but we have not heard the result.  

	I have just taken my& must close my letter.

	Major Bolling wishes a paper left with me by Collins.  I think it is in my paper case on the left of the door as you go into my office in the Box marked Memoranda.  Tell him to make Capt. Hart wait till I return home.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F.P.

	I have just read the newspaper & will now write you a line or two before breakfast.  I recei[ve]d your letter last night, & was glad to hear from you.  I hope the Beeves are killed & that John is able to attend to his wirk again.

	I saw Fannie yesterday in the State House & introduced my friend   to her & Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  The members of the House went into the Senate Chamber to rattify  a Bill, & the ladies came into the Hall to look at some pictures.  Fannie has a bad cold, but was going to a party at  Mrs. Joseph LeContes last night.  I dine with the Governor today.  Capt. Williams passed through here yesterday on his way to Wilmington.  I thought he had gone on long since. 

	Mr. L sent down last evening & paid me $256.61 fees in my sequestration cases.  This will help me pay my board Bill.  It is now raining and we shall probably have a long wet spell.  In reading the paper this morning I was shocked to see the death of Col. [James] OHanlon announced.  I wrote a letter to him yesterday about Hext & myself paying him a visit.  I had heard he was sick but did not suppose he was dangerously ill.

	I met yesterday in the streets William the son of my Brother Foster Perry with his leg cut off.  He lost it at Rome Georgia.  But he was looking well & cheerful.  He had come down to be placed on the retired list.  Wilbu & John Perry are in Virginia & Clark in the army of Texas.  Warren & William are at home.  Harriet & Elizas husbands are in the army.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter last night from Mrs. Cunningham about her card factory.  She is very much provoked & wishes me to oppose or restrict the Charter.  She sent me a bundle of papers.  I will see to what she wishes & write her.  John Cunningham is here & has lost one eye.

	Col. OHanlon died of inflamation of the bowels as did Gov. Hammond & perhaps brought on in the same way.

	The Legislature refused yesterday to elect Judges.  There is nothing doing & if it was not for Col. Wares case I would come home.  It is likely that Judge Magrath will be elected Governor.

	I have no news from the army except what you see in the newspapers.  Sherman is marching on Savannah.  The Governor has ordered all persons on this side of Savannah River below a certain point to move or destroy their property.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Yesterday I made a speech & defeated a Bill to extend the planting of cotton.  Col. Dawkins & Mullins took the same view.  We are all complimented for our efforts.  In the evening I dined with the Governor in company with Judge Conrad of Louisiana, Gov. Manning, Gen. McGowan, Cols. Dawkins, Porter, Boylston, Buist, DeSaussure & others.  We had a very pleasant time.  Mr. Janney was so kind as to lend me a horse & one for Col. Dawkins to ride out to the Governors three miles from Columbia.

	I did not see Fannie yesterday, but Hext says she is better & going about the house.  But the day was unfavorable in the morning & they did not come to the State House.  There is no news.  I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear from tyou.  I have not heard from Willie since Fannies letter from him.

	Tell Susan I will make the arrangement she desires when I return home.  I have heard nothing from Vardry since he was at Charleston.  I suppose the Cadets are now at Grahamville.  I expect[ed] to have seen the witnesses down from Greenville in Col. Wares case last night but did not.  I write you just after breakfast & as I have nothing particular to communicate I will finish my letter after the House adjourns.

	It is now past eight oclock in the night & I have just returned from a dinner at Col. Campbells where we had a very pleasant party of Ladies & gentlemen & a fine dinner.  After writing the above letter this morning I went to see Fannie & she had walked up street.  She afterwards came to the State House but I did not see her.  Col. Campbells daughter told me that she came into the gallery whilst I was speaking  on the contested election between Dr. McConley & [G. Allen] Huggins.  She is better & Mrs. LeConte takes good care of her.  Hext has been to see me twice today.  He wishes to sell his gun to Dr. LaBordes son for six dollars in gold which would be about $200.  I gave $75.00 for the gun.  I told him that was not enough.  He went off & said he would take $9.00 in gold which would be about $300.

	Col. Campbell has several daughters & they seem pleasant girls.  I was seated to the right of the lady at the head of the tablethe post of honor.  But I do not know whether She was his sister or his wife.  Her name was Campbell, whether Miss or Mrs. I could not tell.  I walked back with Mr. Lord who is a most charming gentleman.  On my return I seeButlers name registered though I have not seen him.

	I have just read your letter & am surprised you did not hear from me Tuesday evening I wrote you.  I am glad the Beeves are killed & wish you to kill the hog as soon as possible & the weather will permit.  Beattie, Bane & Thurston are all here but I have not seen them yet.  It is now nine oclock in the night.   

	I have no war news.  I think with you that Easley ought to have told John not to come for the corn.  I hope I shall be able to get corn from someone else.  Col. Ware says he told his negroes to carry my Barrel of molasses up as soon as they get through sowing wheat.

	Good night my dear wife.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now past ten oclock in the night but I will write you a few lines by Beattie who goes up in the morning.  We have just got through examining all the witnesses who have come down & theirs will come hereafter.  It will be some time before the case is decided.  

	Today has been drisling & Fannie did not come to the State House.  We were all invited to Col. Johnsons this evening, but I could not go.  I had to examine witnesses befoere Senates Committee.  He sent his carriage for Dr. LeConte &c.  Fannie went I suppose & no doubt had a pleasant evening.

	Governor Pickens & his wife are here.  They came yesterday.  I saw Mrs. Pickens in the Gallery today.  She saw me looking at her & bowed most graciously to me in the Hall.  I was engaged all day & did not get to speak to her.  I met Gov. Pickens & had some chat with him.  I sent him Mrs. Haynes letter.  He enquired about Paul & said he drank very hard some time ago.  I told him I had never heard of it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight enclosing two to Fannie.  I also rece[ive]d one from General Easley saying he could not let me have any more corn & explaining.

	I have no further news, & will close my letter & go to bed.  Boyce & Price speak of going up in the morning & but for Col. Wares case I would also.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just come up from supper & will write you a few lines whilst I am waiting for the mail.

	The weather is wet & cold.  The conductor tells me you have ice, sleet & snow in Greenville.  There was some sleet here this morning.  The day has been so bad that I have not seen Fannie for several days.  Hext paid me a visit this evening & said all was well.  They had a pleasant evening at Col. Johnsons last nighta great deal to eat, but very few persons.  He said Mr.  was there.  I was sorry not to be able to go, but was detained by the contested Senatorial election examining witnesses as I write you this morning by Beattie.  One of the witnesses was Capt. Jno Charles who told me this morning that he was about sending his wheat to the mill & when ground he had instructed Major Alexander to take the very best of the flour & make a Barrel for me.

	Today as I went to dinner I saw Mrs. Pickens seated at one of the tables with her little daughter.  I went up & spoke to her & took a seat by her & we had a very pleasant tete a tete at the dinner table.  Governor Pickens had gone to dine with Governor Bonham.  Mrs. Pickens enquired kindly after you & Fannie.  I told her Fannie would have been to see her today but for the weather.  She said I must call up & see her & the Governorreminded me that I had once promised to pay them a visit with you in Edgefield.  She seemed very kind, & looks very pretty.

	I have just written a letter to Mrs. Cunningham telling her I would attend to her card.  We did nothing in the Legislature today, except pass the Bill for Soldiers families.  A great many of the members had gone home.  [James Petigru] Boyce was disappointed in going.  [William Pierce] Price went. 

	The election for Governor comes off next Tuesday & it is thought by some that [Henry William] Garlington may be elected.  This would be very strange indeed.  General [Samuel] McGowan had a long talk with me today about his chances.  There were several telegrams today from Georgia but they contained nothing more than you see in the papers.  I will now stop writing & go for my letters.

Letter 668
Sunday morning.  I have just returned from breakfast & will write you a few lines whilst I am smoking my pipe.  I recd your letter last night enclosing one about St. Julian & am glad you are getting on so well & exchanging yarn for corn.  I will go & see Fannie this morning.  The day is so unpleasant I do not suppose they will go to Church.  I had a long chat this morning at the breakfast table with Governor Pickens, who said a great many complimentary things to me, in reply I suppose that my expression to him that if he was gable he could be elected Governor again.  Mrs. Pickens was not at breakfast.  The news of trhe death of General [States Rights] Gist is confirmed by a man just from Coosawhatchie.  It will be a terrible blow to his young wife.   General [Patrick] Cleburne is also killed.  This is a great loss.  He was assigned under Hood.  The news this morning is that Sherman is marching on Savannah in three columns.  Another report is that a portion of his forces are attempting to cross the River.  I will conclude my letter after I see Fannie.

	I have just eaten my dinner and taken a smoke & will now finish this letter.  I went round to see Fannie this morning & found her quite well.  She had sent Hext with your letter for me to read but I did not see him till I returned to the Hotel.  Fannie says she wrote you yesterday I believe & would not write you today.  She is going to stay with with Maggie Tuesday & then two or three days with Ellen Janney.  She will then go to Dr. Croft & spend her Christmas.  So I shall leave her in Columbia when I go up next Friday with Hext.  I have nothing further to write you.  You need not send me any money.  I shall need none till I return home.

	I recd a letter from Col. Perryman last night requesting me to write to the Secretary of War requesting permission to pardon the deserters if they will come in & form a company for police duty in the District.  I have several letters to answer this evening & must therefore close this to you.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I did not write you yesterday but I think I have made you a pretty good correspondent since I have been in Columbia.  You likewise have done your duty in that respect & it always gives me great pleasure to receive a letter from you.  I recd a letter from you last night and sorry the weather is so cold.  You had better make John haul wood home and have a good supply to meet the coming bad weather.  

	I did not see Fannie yesterday.  She & Lula came to see Mrs. Pickens as Hext tells me.  He was here yesterday evening when I came from the State House.  Governor Pickens & his lady dined with Col. Campbell yesterday & I did not see Mrs. Pickens.  I suppose they have gone this morning.  I saw him at the breakfast table yesterday morning.

	  We did very little in the House yesterday.  By a majority of one vote we sent a message to the Senate to grant an election of Judges tomorrow.  But it is supposed that the Senate will not agree to our Resolution.  Today we commence ballotting for Governor.  No election will be made today.

	I have just come up from breakfast & saw Pickens & Mrs. Pickens.  They could not get off today.  Mrs. Pickens told me she was glad to see Fannie looking so well, that she had called to see her yesterday.  I told her Fannie had been unwell with a bad cold.  Mrs. Pickens came to trhe table whilst I was standing up talking to the governor.  She looked very pretty, and seems as good as she is beautiful.

	I have not heard from Willie since his letter to Fannie.  This makes me think that he is trying to come here as a witness in Wares case.  It would be very pleasant to meet him, but the trip will cost considerable.  Col. Wares eldest son came down last night on his way to Charleston to join the cadets.  He seems a fine boy.  I have heard nothing from Vardry.  I suppose Susan hears froom him.  

	There is no news.  The yankees are near Savannah & I suppose fightingthis time.  Though yesterday there was a report that they were going round Savannah.  General L says they cannot capture Savannah.  I will now close.  If anything happens before night.  I will write you again.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you a letter this morningwhich you will receive by mail.  But since that time Hext has concludedcto go home with Col. Wares son Willie.  He can tell you all the news.  Fannie & Maggie paid me a visit this evening at my room & sat awhile.  She is now at Hol.  They came in the State House whilst we were voting for Governor.  We had three ballots & Judge Magrath ran ahead.  I dropped Preston on the third ballot & voted for the Judge.  It will probably be a close race between him & Garlington but I think Magrath will be elected.  

	We have just heard that [Gen. William J.] Hardee defeated Sherman at Savannah with great loss, & that Sherman is in want of provisions & ammunition &c.  This information seems pretty correct although you may not see it in the newspaper.

	I have just been with Governor Pickens & Mrs. Pickens & spent a pleasant evening with them.  Inow go down & get the mail & hope to hear from you.  It is now doubtful whether I can return Friday & may be detained here till nexzt weekWares case will not be disposed of before next week & I cannot leave before it is finished.

	I have recd no letter from you tonight & am sorry I did not hear from home.  It alwaysgives me satisfaction to hear & I am uneasy if I do not.

	The enclosed letter from Willie was recd tonight.  I send it to you to read.  I am sorry he could not get a furlough to come to Columbia.

	There are several bundles here.  But hext cannot carry themone largeone for Lee & Beattie.

	Hext is out somewhere with Willie Ware & if is near nine oclock.  I am glad he is going home.  If he staid at the Hotel he would have too many temptations.  Make him study his Books at home.  I want to go home very much & see my wife & llittlew children.  Good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	We have just elected Judge Magrath Governor, & it is doubtful whewn the Legislature will adjourn.  I have just recd a letter from Col. Martin & we have agreed to have a meeting here on Monday evening next.  If I can get off I will go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin & the case of Col. Ware I would not come back at all.  The Senate have refused to go into the election of Judges.  I am not sorry, for if the election had taken place I should have run for Chancellor.  If elected it would have reduced us to starvation.

	I have just seen a piece of good luck which has befallen me & will enable me to pay my board bill.  Old Mr. Norton enployed me to get the pay for his negro who died on the coast.  The old man would make a bargain with me to give me one third of what I recovered.  I see the auditor has allowed him Three thousand dollars.  So I shall get one thousand dollars.  There are two other simillar cases in which I shall get them two or three hundred dollars.  I expect fine hundred of Col. Ware.  This will enable me to pay my debts although I may not get my fees from the Confederate government.  

	I saw Fannie in the Gallery today with maggie but only got toto them.  She was looking very well.I hope Hext arrived safely & that you are all well.

	I have further& I think you may expect me at home Saturday night & I will return Monday.  I have written Col. Elford to come down on Monday to meet the Commissioners.

	I have just succeeded in getting DavisHodges off his contract about the Saluda turnpike.  If the Senate passes the Resolution of the House it will be a great [word obscured] matter to Hodges.

	I must now close my letter before I receive yours tonight as I hope to do.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

House of Rep[resentatives, Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I received your letter last night in which you state that my leytter of the 8th by Thurston was not received till Thursday morning.  This is strange.  I wrote you a long letter Sunday which you ought to have received Monday night & yet you had not received it Tuesday morning.  I am afraid my letters are delayed a whole day in Columbia in consequence of not being sent to the Post office in time to be mailed the night sent.  I shall drop this in the Box here & hope it will [be] sent in time to be mailed & you will receive it Friday evening.

	I shall endeavour to go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin I would not return at all.  I am honestly tired of Columbia &, & wish to be with my wife & children.  I wrote you fully last night, & have very little to add this morning.  By staying till the end of the Session I shall be able to get the money for Norton & others for loss of slaves on the coast & out of the money I shall receive large fees.  Last night after writing to you, Sam Jones nephew of Col. [James] OHanlon came to see me & got me to write an obituqary notice of his incle, which I have done & which you will see in the Caroolinian tomorrow.  He showed me a copy of OHanlons Will.  It was written just before he died so Hext is not mentioned in it or anythiung given to him.  I think this very mean on the part of OHanlon after telling me & Hext that he had given him a negro boy..  He gave all of his property to his nephews & nieces except a negro to his Executor Dr. Ray.  It is wrong to expect anything from anyone.  And Ihappy to know that I have made.  I am& have supported & educated my children so far with credit.  I am now doing well & making something & hope that I may have[word obscured] for my family.  I could not be placed in any position where I would do better.  I am happy in being always with my wife & children, & working for their support. 

	I have just seen Fannie.  She & Ellen Janney & Ho came down to the State House to see me.  She came to my room about ten minutes after I left there.  She wanted to arrange about the day she leaves here & goes to Dr. Crofts.  She said that she was going to write you, but finding that I was writing to you she said to tell you  she would not.  Fannie is quite well & looking well.  She saw Mrs. Pickens at the Hotel this morning who said she was going round to see her.  I took breakfast with Mrs. Pickens & the Governor & had a great deal of chat with them & Miss Manning.  

	The Governor will be inaugurated tomorrow.  Fannie said she would not come to the State House today buy will come tomorrow.  Ellen Janney & Mr. Janney insist very much on Fannie staying there some time before she goes up.  

	The weather is warm & pleasant buy cloudy & will rain tomorrow.  I will now close bymyself as ever your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. You may expect me Saturday night & send a horse & saddle to the depot for me or the little carriage. B.F.P.

My dear Liz

	I am sorry I disappointed you in saying that I would be at home Saturday night.  Col Ware & Mr. Boyce were to have gone with me & they concluded that the business of the two Houses would not permit them to go.  This induced me to consider that there were important matters which would come up in my absence, & which I wished to discuss.  Moreover I went to Dr. LeContes Friday night & there met Mr. & Mrs. Johnson & Fannie.  We had a fine supper & I ate heartily of some sweet things  which has disagreed with me.  I came so late & Col. Ware came into my room  & sat a long time.  Then I sat down to write a letter toMr. Barnwell about the appointment of district Judge.  This made me reflect about the propriety of trhe appointment if tendered to me.  I thought of you & the children & povertyall of us trying to live on three thousand dollars.  I could not go to sleep till the clock struck three!  I did not wake up in the morning till just before the cars left.  Feeling ratherI woke up.  I thought it best to remain in bed & rest mysystem instead of riding three hundred miles & wasting three days to spend one at home.  It was a sore trial to me for I longed to see you once more & be with you & the children again.

       Yesterday morning General [William Edward] Martin came to me in the State House.& said Fannie was going to dine with him & wished me to meet her there.  At four oclock I went up to his House & Fannie was greatly surprised to see me.  She thought I had gone home.  We had a fine dinner & I spent the evening very pleasantly.  I walked home with Fannie Mr. H & Miss Maggie.  I came back to the Hotel, got a cup of coffee & went down to our night session at seven oclock & remained there till eleven oclockI came home & went to bed, slept soundly & feel quite well this morning.  Janney had Boyce & myself wake up early to take breakfast with him & I have just returned from the breakfast table to write you a long letter.
 ouses

	I recd a letter from Col. Elford last night stating that he would be here Monday evening to meet the Commissioners.  He informed me Col. [John Durant] Ashmore has employed me & himself to defend him for killing that poor fellow Pinson.  He says he has been down to see Ashmore & that he was suffering terrible both mentally & physically.

	Last night after ten oclock the Exemption Bill came up exempting the members & various officers & persons from conscription.  Told [we] had just received a telegram informing us the Fall of Savannah.  I got up & said it was a remarkable coincidence that we had just received in telegram of the capture of Savannah, & the crossing over of a portion of Shermans forces into South Carolina, whilst we were then, at that late hour of the night trying to exempt ourselves & our friends & various other persons from being called out to meet the invading foe!  It produced a furious sensation in the House & many of the members came ro me & said they had never heard remarks more appropriate.  The Bill was postponed till Monday.  I despair of the country.  Yhere is so much of cowardly selfish feeling pervading all classes that we do not deserve success.  

	It is said Savannah has fallen but I see nothing of it in the papers this morning.  The city was invested some days since by Sherman and the people suffering for the want of food.  I have no doubt it will fall if it has not already fallen.  The enemy will soon be marching on Charleston & extending their raids throughout the lower country.  You may have the consolation of knowing that Greenville is the safest place in the State.  It will hardly ever be reached by the enemy.

	Mrs. Johnson had called at Holbecks to Fannie just before I got there with her.  She will go with Mrs. Johnson to thetomorrow  & I have promised them our seats on the floor.  There will be a grand display.  I should have missed it all by going home.  Fannie will come to the Hotel Tuesday morning & remain with Ellen Janney till I go up Thursday.  She will then stay with Tilla Croft & spend the Christmas.

	A large majority of the membersmy appointment for district Judgeall except those whoCol. .  Many of them came to me & expressed a regret that they had not sooner heard of my applicationGovernor Manning among them.  If I secure the appointment I shall be sorry for it & do not know that I will accept it.  I was gratified to know that so large a majority of the Senators as well as members of the House had recommended me for the appointment of district Judge.  Boyce told me there were but four members who declined to sign it who had already signed one for Col. M.  Two of them said they never signed any petition, & one of the other two was C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan of Laurens.

	Mrs. Martin seems feeble & had toafter dinner.  Miss Salie is not pretty, nor is the younger sister,  Her son has gone to Savannah as captain of the foreigners & was safe yesterday.  I have heard nothing further from Willie.  Your uncle Hayne was in the House the other day looking very well & full of talk as usual.  I see Col. Isaac Hayne every day. but I have not seen or heard from Col. Taylor.  

	I shall not go to Church this morning.  Boyce & myself have promised to dine with Janney at half past twelve.  He says he is going to have a good dinner, turkey &c. &c.  I wish now I was at home to spend the day with you, & talk over all the incidents I have to tell you.  But instead of talking I am writing to you & can imagine you present.  Fannie goes with Mrs. Herbemont from church this morning & takes tea with her.  I suppose however she will write you and tell you everything about her self.

	When I told Mr. Johnson the other night at Dr. LeContes that I was going home, he said I must bring you down with me.  Governor Magrath is to be at Janneys this evening & has taken a suit of rooms.  He occupies my bed room & I have taken one next to it.  Mine was opposite his Parlor & I consented to give it up.  He takes my room, & I may, perhaps, take his seat in the Senate.

	I am glad to hear you are getting on well.  You have plenty of corn & meat & I hope Charles will bring the flour.  Elford writes me that corn is $15.00 per bushel & flour $250  per barrel & pork $2.70 per pound.  Swap off your spun yarn for corn & pork.  I hope to get money enough here to pay my Bill & all my debts at home when I get there.

       Now my dear wife I have written you a long letter like a good husband as you know I am.  I think we were both very fortunate in getting loving & affectionate companions.  Very few persons have been more fortunate than you & I in marrying.  Do not you think so?  I wrote Mrs. Cunningham the other day & sent her the printed note about her card Factory.  I did not succeed [word obscured] hercome very near it & sent her the proceedings on my motion.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just got the& the Inauguration.  Fannie & Maggie came with Mrs. Johnson & I reserved the seats of myself, Boyce & Price for them.  But Miss G,  Johnston & Fannie occupied the seats.  There never was such abefore.  The Ladies rushed in the House & occupied the whole House.  The gallery was full & the lobby.  It was all new to Fannie, & she seemed to enjoy it.  Mrs. LeConte took Col. Dawkins seat.  Lula did not come.

	I have just applied to the Governor to appoint Willie one of his aid[e]s.  This will take him out of the army & give him the title of colonel.  I hope the governor will appoint him.  I [would] rather have this appointment for Willie than that of Judge for myself.  

	I have just received a most cordial letter from [William Gilnore] Simms.  He says that he will use his influence witrh the President to have me appointed in Magraths place.  He says Col. Orr has got a majority of the South Carolina delegation in Congress to sign my application.  Senator Hill of Georgia has been written to by Mr. Boyce to use his influence with the President.  Mr. Simms says his whole family send their love to you & all my familysay Simms has been at the point of death but is well again.

	I shall be at home Thursday night.  Send John with the little carriage to the depot.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Col. Wares case comes up at 5 oclock.  So I must now close my letter.

	I have been engaged tonight with Lake & Gray in settling their accounts.  The Legislature is in session but I did not go down to the House.  Hext tells me that Dickson Irvine & his sister are here & going up in the morning.  I will send this letter by them.  Fannie Irvine is sick.  Hext is going in the morning to see H  & will go down  to Col. [James]  OHanlons at twelve oclock.  The Col. will have to come back Friday to court.  I shall go home Thursday if nothing happens to detain me in the Legislature.  Lake paid me $90.00 for fees & says under the late act of Congress there will be due me $800 more.  I suppose about as much.   Sitton, DeSaussure, Connor & Miles & myself have a consultation in the morning about our fees.  I have got Tuppers interest due your mother $157.50cts.  My pockets are full of money.  I hope to be with you Thursday night & therefore will close my letter.  Col. Ware returned this evening.  But brought no news from Greenville.

My dear Liz

	The arrival of Hext last night frustrated all of my plans & perhaps for the better.  I shall now remain in Columbia till Thursday & then go home to remain instead of going up & returning.  I am loth to move about.  This morning I found there was noat ten oclock as I expected to Col. OHanlons, so I wrote him Hext was here to pay him a visit & would remain till he came up.  I wrote the Col. a hurried letter last night & a long one this morning.  Hext is enjoying himself with Charley Janney & slept with him last night.  Yesterday Mr. Janney asked me to dine with his family at one oclock, which I did.  He seems very kind & obliging to me.   Sent his Horse & Buggy to go to the Governors the other evening.

	Today I will spend in writing letters & reading Prentiss life till dinner.  Then I think of taking a walk to your uncles with Hext for exercise.  There are some important matters coming up in the Legislature tomorrow & and next dayI would have missed if I had gone home.  I hope by Thursday all will be over & I can go home safely & leave Hext with Col. OHanlon till I come down in January to bring Fannie to school. 

	I hope the corn will come soon.  I shall see Lake Tuesday evening.  If you get out you must borrow of Pool.  Do have the cows well fed with meal or bean and hay, fodder or shucks & slop.  The Calf you can kill whenever you think best.  Janney bought two cows yesterday for $800.  If I could get Ss for $200 I would take her provided she  is a good milker.  If you can exchange salt for pork do so.  I wish to hear from Glencoe very much.  I hope Alfred & Johnny are done gathering corn & sowing wheat.  I must go up there as soon as I get back.

	I will have a settlement with Lake when he comes down & see more about the corn.  I hope you are getting on well and quietly.  Tell Vardry he must study hard & when he comes here he must be very careful to obey all rules and regulations and not be led astray by other boys.  It is a hard life, but it will make a useful man of him, & he ought not to throw away the opportunity.  He may now regard his life as just commencing so far as his own conduct & exertions are concerned.

       I will now write a long letter to Willie.  I wrote him just a week ago.  You & Fannie ought to write him.
       
       I have just seen Judge Magrath who came up last night to hold court here.  He says the shelling is injuring the Homes very much in Charleston.  I have seen nothing of my friend Simms & his wife yet.  Col. Orr, Simpson Farrow & other members of Congress have passed through on their way to Richmond.
       
       Write me so that I may get letters Wednesday evening before starting Thursday.  I will write you tomorrow if I have time.  My love to all the Children & tell Fannie the.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Col. OHanlon has just left my room.  He came up today without having received my letter.  He is on the Jury of the Federal Court & will be here all the week.  Thursday the Court will not sit, being fast day, & the Col. will go down home & take Hext wtith him.  He will have to return Friday & leave hext there.  He may be on the Jury two weeks.  I believe he has someone of his House.  He spoke of Hext hunting with the boys in his absence.  I will enquire further about it.  

	I shall come home Thursday.  That day is fastr day & the Legislature will not sit.  They adjourn Thursday week.  But I shall not come back.  The business will be pretty well through  by Fast day.

Letter 678
Wednesday I am invited to dine with Theand I suppose he will give a magnificent feast as he has invited for three days beforehand.  I dont know who are to meet.  He came to me & said he had a favor to ask of me.  It was to dine with him Wednesday.   He did not ask Boyce or Croft who were sitting by me & whispered to me.

	The Legisalature has done nothing today worth telling.  Tupper paid me your mothers Interest this morning.  Iin money at present.  Hext is well pleased here.  He went to church last night with Miss Ellen Janney.  Janney seems very kind to him & says his House is his home & that he is one of the finest boys he ever saw.  Ellen Janney is going to theCollege & seems pleased to hear that Fannie will be there.

	Col. [John] Bauskett called to see me this evening & expressed himself very much impressed with my views about the war.  Col. OHanlon says he met Alfred Huger today who told him he was utterly opposed to the movement &was still a union man!  The Secessionists are all.

My dear Liz

	I am writing you before day.  The clock has just struck four & I am dressed.  I recd your letter last night after my return from committee.  I was glad to hearfrom you & that you were getting on so well.

	The weather is so warm I expect you had better get Watson  to butcher the beeves & sell the meat.  I am afraid it will spoil.  They ought to be killed before they become poor.  If you keep them till the weather changes you must make John feed them well on corn & shucks & take care that they do not get out & go off and the same with the hog.  But as corn is so scarce you had better kill as soon as safe.  I am glad John is haulking the corn.

	I wrote you yesterday & have nothing further to communicate.  No further news from the fight at Grahamville nor nothing further from Sherman.  

	I hope Anne will be satisfied with my sale of her gold & Bond.  The Bonds are falling, but gold is rising.  I do not think her capital is lessened  by the arrangement I have made.  The interest will be so much more valuable than the Bond.

	Nothing was done yesterday in the Legislature.  Col. Wares case will come up today.  Col. Campbell & C.P. Sullivan are employed by Sullivan.  I am alone for Col. Ware.

	Judge W came into my room just now & untangled my writing.  We then went down to breakfast at five oclock & I have just got back.  I must now close & hunt up some passenger to send this letter by.  

	It is still not daylight yet.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

Willards Hotel, [Washington]

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening quite well, but very mush fatigued.  I wrote you a long letter at Charlotte, thence to Danville where we spent the night & overtook Dr. Darby & General Prestons daughter, also Mr. Mordecai & all his family who had been waiting there two days, for a passage to Richmond.  The Rail Road had been exclusively employed on transporting Federal troops.  I was vert much pleased with Dr. Darby & have seldom met a more intelligent pleasant younger gentleman.  His wife is a magnificent looking lady.  We did not reach Richmond till next morning.  I slepton my arrival here.  I addressed a note to the President, & he sent word he would answer in writing, but I have not yet heard from him.  There was a Cabinet meeting today & I suppose he has delayed designating our meeting till after that,.

	General Gue formerly in command at Charleston sent up his card as soon as he saw my name registered & sat with me two hours.  I was very much pleased with him.  Mr. Taggert a correspondent for newspapers called whilst the General was with me & took my speech to have published in the Washington papers.  Col. Beale called this morning & a dozen others.  The Col. is low spirited.  His wife is at Society Hill.  My arrival was announced this morning in the Washington & New York papers.

	The improvement in Washington is very great.  It seems I have got into a new world.  Everything [is] on a splendid scale.  My room is a large private parlor.  Theis most & we have everything  thatcan desire.  I bought this morning a new hat $6.50 & slacks $..., hat for Willie & one for Hayne & Ben.  I will wait till we go to Baltimore to fill up your list as good are much cheaper there.

	I find Col. Orr has troupes of friends in Washington.  He has been very kind to me.  Says if I wish to be U. States Senator there will be no difficulty about it.  I found my companions on the route all very pleasant & we have enjoyed ourselves very much.  James Gibbs returned this morning from New York & called to see me.  He says Miss Graham was in rapture at my appointment.  He left her in New York.  She is going to returnwent on to shop.

	It is said that President Johnson is very kind towards the South.  He has pardoned everybody who makes application.  This morning I signed recommendations for the pardon of Col. Orr, General McGowan, Col. Elford & others.  The Presidents wife is very sick & he has been sick himself.

	Mr. Gibbs will leave here this morning & take the letter to Columbia.  Not having seen the President yet I have not much to write you.  It is probable I mayhave three or four days yet and then I shall have to stop in Columbia to see General Gilmore.  But I will be at home the last of July. 

	In the morning I suppose my speech will make its appearance & this evening I will see what the New York papers say of me.  Col. Evans telegraphed Grady that our arrival was announced  & everyone said last night that the Herald would be full of the governors arrival in Washington.

	Tell Fannie I will make her purchases in Baltimore.  We will take a steamer there for Richmond.  Tell Willie his hat is a very pretty one.  Caps are not worn by children & I bought vestspretty for Hayne & Ben.

	I am now going down to look at the old capitol  & must therefor conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

	It is now twelve oclock in the night & Mr. Gibbs goes in the morning.  My room has been full of visitors, who have just gone all wishing to see the provisional Governor of South Carolina.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from the President this morning appointing three oclock for our meeting.  We had a most interesting conversation for two hours & seem mutually pleased with each other.  I cannot repeat all that was said.  He is kind & solicitous about the South & will do everything he can for us.  In reference to my appointment he said we lived only one hundred twenty miles apart & that he knew all about, that when he mentioned my name to the Charleston  Committee, Judge Frost immediately approved the nomination & the others cheerfully assented.  I made such an impression on the President that he insisted I should call on Seward & Stanton & talk to them about South Carolina politics, & [he] gave me letters of introduction to them.  He made me promise to come back & see him again before I left.  There were hundreds waiting to see him when I went & could not.  I carried with me Col. Orr, Elford, Grady, Blad, Gibbs, General Williams, & Leiter.

	I have just issued my Proclamation & will send it to Columbia by Gibbs,  Elford has copied it for Dr. Buist to read at the depot.  I have made Willie private Secretary & his name appears on the Proclamation.

	I went with my friend this morning to see Governor Denison Post Master General.  He went to the President for me.  I am delighterd with Johnson.  Tomorrow I go to see all the Cabinet officers.  I have rece[ive]d telegrams from Preston, Middleton & Campbell today.  I have the appointment of all Federal officers in South Carolina & have to approve all Pardons.  Never before had a Governor of South Carolina [had] so much patronage & power.  

	Goodnight my dear wife, B.F. Perry

	Col. Aldrich introduced firery resolutions which were put down & refused to be printedhad only five votes.  I have telegraphed the President this evening.  

	Your letters have all been distributed.  I saw Dr. LeConte & young Horlbeck.

	It is now ten oclock & I have just returned from dining with Col. Campbell.  Willie has gone to bed.  Tell Fannie that I have the sitting room as my parlor, & the music room on my right as my bed room.  Willie has the opposite music room for his chamberthe parlor between us & doors opening into it.  I am really situated as a Governor should be on the second floor with a fine chamber.a parlor which is full of visitors from breakfast till bed time.  All the distinguished men of the city & convention have called to see me.This morning General Huger & Chancellor Dunkin called.  The General told me he was a grandfather.  Mrs. Preston has a son. 

	I have never been so constantly engaged before & have had no time to write you or visit anyone.  I have only been out of the Hotel twice since I have been here.  I met Miss Maggie in the Streets & she spoke of going up with me.  I have not seen Lula nor has Willie.

	They said Willie read my message very well.  He has been appointed Chairman of a committee to investigate an election at Beaufort with Henry Gourdine & Col. Ball.  I have just read his report & it is very good.  He submitted a Bill of Rights this morning to the Convention.  So you see he is doing something. 

	My friend Janney & others tell me that it is unanimous that I go into the Senate.  My message has been well recei[ve]d.  Willie has written a letter for the Enterprize.

	I have had a return of my complaint since I came here, but it is over now.  Had a very pleasant dinner party at Col. Campbells this evening.  Saw Mrs. Richard Stone who enquired after you.  Col. Isaac Hayne looks as if he was in the last stage of Consumption.  General Martin wrote to me to give him some message to carry to Washington.  I have not seen or heard from your uncle Arthur.

	Just as I was going to the Convention today in came Janney with a pack of letters & I was kept busy from one till five oclock in reading them.  
	
	The Convention is getting on slowly, but I think will end this session the ensuing week.

	Tell Fannie I rece[ive]d her letter by Mr. Mills.  You may tell the people that the Post Master General has sent me contracts to all the rail Roads for carrying the mail next week.  You will have mails.

	It is so late I must close.  The Hotel is a first class one & the table fine.  Your affectionate husband & Governor, B.F. Perry

	I recei[ve]d your first letter the other day & thank you for it.  I would write oftener but I have not one moment of spare time.  I have only had time to go to the Convention twice.  Tonight the Board of Trustees meet.  I am all my time receiving visits, & signing applications for pardons & reading letters.  The Charleston Courier has published my message with complimentary notice.  I have recei[ve]d two Camden papers highly complimentary which I will send you.

	The Conventiopn is getting on very well & have agreed to most all of my recommendations or will do so.  I have telegraphed the President several times & he is pleased with our proceedings.  I am generally spoken of for U.S. Senator & there seems now no doubt of my election.  Who will be Governor is unknown.

	Willie made a speech the other day in the Convention.  He was chairman of a committee & made a Report.  Then he was called on for an explanation & he had to get up & explain.  He did very well.  I was present.  The Convention sustained his Report by a very close vote 56 to 50.

	Miss Maggie says she will go up with us.  Lula declines.  Willie has been to see both of them.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow.  Give my love to all the children.  I would write you long letters but I have not time.  M.  is absent & I cannot see him about the wheat.  It is foolish to be allarmed about the negroes & asking for a guard.  Your afectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have not heard from you but once.  You might write oftener.  I have no time to write.  From early morn till late at night I am engaged.  I have not had time to pay a single visit.

	The Convention is going on slowly. I do not know when they will adjourn.  Willie made a little speech last night on the representation of the negro in the Legislature.  But the comp[romise was not adopted & he will now vote against the negro representation again as he has been doing with all of his colleagues except Bolling who voted with the lower country on this subject.

	The weather is now pleasant.  We have had very warm weather.  I have very pleasant rooms & a large parlor where I recei[ve] my company.  

	Mr. Henry Heyward called with his application for a pardon & enquired after all of you as old friends.  You will see I have appointed my aidsW.L. Trenholm, General Stephen Elliott, Wade Hampton, Jr., Lieutenant Governor R[obert] F. McCaw of York & General Harrison of Anderson.

	I have appointed Trescott as agent to represent the State at Washington.  

	I must now close & go to breakfast.  Willie made ten dollars in cash yesterday taking charge of an application for pardon.  The members get five dollars a day.  Board is four dollars.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Instead of going to Church I will write you a letter.  My boots hurt my feet so much that I cannot walk well.  Last evening I went with Willie to Dr. LeContes & found it difficult to walk home.  Mrs. LeConte & Lula seemed very glad to see us & were pleasant.  Lula says she cannot return with us.  Her mother says her health is not good & fears an attack of typhoid fever.  Miss Maggie will go up with us & we shall be at home Thursday or Friday.  

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you since Beatty came down.  I have written long letters by  to the President & Seward giving an account of the proceedings of the Convention.  The Convention are doing pretty much all that I requested them to do.  It is pretty well understood that I am to be U.S. Senator.  W.W. Boyce & Governor Manning are talked of as my colleagues, which will be successful is doubtful.  Col. Orr will be Governor.  Col. Farrow, Reed, J.P. Boyce &c. are talked of as candidates for Congress  from our Congressional district which now includes Anderson, Pickens, Greenville, Spartanburgh, Laurens, York & Chester.

	Col. F.J. Moses has got up a Petition for district Judge which is signed by most of the Court.  He called to see me last night & said he supposed I would desire the office and on learning that I was to be sent to the Senate, he had concluded to make application for the Judgeship.

	Barnwell Rhett through his son, desired to know of me what I would require of him in making application for pardon.  I sent word that if he would pledge himself to become, & forever continue a loyal citizen to the U. States, I would favor his application.  I was introduced to Col. Rhett this morning.  Col. William Butler came to me for a letter to Col. Johnson for a position on the Charlotte R[ail] Road.  I gave him a very warm & earnest recommendation for I feel sorry for him.

	Willie has done well in the Convention & is very much esteemed by the members.,  I wish him to go into the Legislature.  The election will take place on the 18th of October & the Legislature wil meet in two days afterwards.

	I hope you & Fannie & the children are getting on well & that your freedmen & women are behaving themselves.

	Yesterday I dined with the yankee Generals here at the Hotel & was very much pleased with them.  Brevet Major General Ames is a young & accomplished gentleman.  He called to see me soon after my arrival & met me most cordially.  He comes frequently to my Parlor to give me newspapers and the other night he came to get me to write the President to keep him here.  Yesterday he brought me a parcel of letters to forward by Beattie & I see amongst several to young ladies.  He is a handsome fellow & a graduate of West Point.  General Richardson in command here is a worthy gentleman.

	I have been interrupted by several visits whilst writing.  Mr. Boyce of Fairfield has just left after a long talk about the senate.  He is very anxious to be associated with me in the Senate.  They all seem to admit that I am to be the first elected.  Governor Mannings friends wish him as second Senator as there will be a contest between Boyce & Manning.  It is also said that General Hamptons friends are wishing to bring him forward.

	They have all come home from church & I must close my letter by signing myself your affectionate husband & requesting you to give my love to Fannie & all the children.  B.F. Perry

	I have just received your letter dated Friday & Saturday enclosing one to Lula which I gave Willie to deliver.

	I wrote you yesterday all the news I had.  In the evening I went to see Mrs. Herbemont who lives close by the Hotel & sent word by Col. Childs that I must call.  I saw her and her mother in law & spent twenty or thirty minutes very pleasantly with them.  She has two exquisitely beautiful mosaic marble tables purchased in Italy.  Col. Childs bought one & I took the other for Fannie $35.00.  It is worth two or three hundred dollars.  Mrs. Herbemont leaves tomorrow for the north & has sold her House to Col. Childs.  The table will remain with the Col. till the Rail Road is completed.  It is round with a chesstop of beautiful mosaic.  It is really a curiosity & so cheap that I was tempted to buy it as a present for Fannie. 

	I have juist rece[ive]d the New York Herald & Tribune containing my message.  The former is complimentary & the latter abusive on account of excluding negro suffrage.  Governor Pickens, Governor Manning, W.W. Boyce & Col. J.B. Campbell are all spoken of for the Senate but all admit that I am first to be elected & each one wishes to be my colleague.  This is very grattifying .  Col. [Christopher William] Dudley has written an article nominating me for the Senate.

	The Convention will probably adjourn Tuesday night & if so I will get off Wednesday & be at home Thursday if not Friday.

       Mr. Heyward called this morning & sent his ciompliments to all of you.

	I arrived here Tuesday morning with General Easley very much fatigued.  Mr. Janney brought me a half bushel of letters which I opened & read till ten oclock except when interrupted by visitors.  General Hampton called to see & consult with me.  He is much troubled, & sincerely afraid he is elected Governor.  The election is still in great doubt.  I told him if elected he must serve.  Col. Orr is not here.  Mr. Trenholm called to see me this morning & to express his thanks for getting him released.  Governor Bonham & General Butler got me to telegraph the President for their pardons.  General Kershaw & Col. Townes have just called to inform me that the Senate had elected Col. Moses President & General Martin Clerk & were ready to receive my message.  The House have elected Col. Aldrich Speaker & Col. Sloan Clerk & are now voting for other officers.

	Col. Trescot asked me if I had taken a House in Washington!  He said there was no doubt of my election.  I have not yet heard any opposition.  I will send you the New York news in which there is a compliment to me as the U.S. Senator &c.

	After opening about Fifty letters yesterday evening & giving up all hope of receiving my check, it so happened the last letter opened contained it.  It would have been the first if I had known it.  But they deducted $30 for income tax & sent only $720.

	Today I have been very busy in writing letters and approving pardons all day except when visitors were present.  The Dr. LeContes came & paid me a long friendly visit.  Mrs. LeConte & Lula are quite well.  Mr.  gave me a bundle from Miis Buist which I will send by the first opportunity.  Mr. Janney expressed great thanks for our kindness to his daughter & son.  He goes to New York on Monday.

	Willie got here this morning & will have the same rooms.  Hammet[t], Goodwin & Price & Townes came down with him.  Col. Townes lost his new hat on the carsblown off his head.   

	I rece[ive]d a visit this morning from the Brother of Governor [Francis R.] Lubbock of Texas.  He brought me a beautiful letter from the Governors wife which I will send you asking me to intercede with the President for her husband, who is in prison & paying me a very high compliment.   I have written a long letter to the President. 

	Col. Isaac Hayne is gradually sinking.  His son is running for reading Clerk of the Senate.  My message will be read by Willie in both Houses tomorrow.  General Easley pronounces it the best Governors message he ever read.

	Campbell, Boyce, Pickens & Trescot & perhaps Manning & Bonham are running for Senate.

	I am overwhelmed with business & have but a few minutes to write you.  I sent in my message in first was read by Willie & is printed in the Columbia Paper.  The reporters have sent copies to Charleston & elsewhere.  This morning I have sent another message transmitting aCode of Laws prepared by Judge Wardlaw and Mr. Burt.  The message yesterday is highly approved.  I hear of no opposition to my election.  But great electioneering for Trescott & Campbell for the other Senatorship.

	I have nothing worth writing.  Your letter by  was rece[ive]d this morning & the letters by Porcher were rece[ive]d yesterday.  Willie went to see Miss Horlbeck yesterday but I shall not be able to see her.  I have been nowhere hardly out of the Hotel.  Letters & visitors are coming to me all day & I have to do all my writing as Willie is in the Legislature.  He seems to be doing well & I think enjoys himself here.  I am glad he is here in the way of.

	Miss Buist sent on the other packet & a letter for you which I will enclose.  The package I will send up by the first opportunity.

	General Hampton called to see me again yesterday & said he should consult & advise with me very often.  He is elected I suppose.  I told him he must accept the office of Governor.  He approved the Presidents policy & will do all that I could wish.

	Mr. Burt is going up this morning & will carry my letter to Belton.  Your letter by Col. Lubbock was read this morning & I was glad to hear from you.  Sell the Beef as soon as you can, it will grow poor.

	The election of Senator takes place Monday at one oclock, so before you receive this it will be over.  I dont think there is any doubt of my success.  But there is as great deal of manuvering & electioneering.  Some of the Parish members will not vote for me.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula yesterday.  They are so violent that I was displeased.  I read a letter from Mrs. Keith the most violent I ever read towards the yankees.  She says they may take all of her property before she will take the oath of allegiance or bow to Andy Johnson.  She was very kind in her remembrance of you.  I telegraphed the President for a Pardon for Governor Bonham & General M. Butler & yesterday [and] rece[ive]d a reply that they were pardoned.  I then sent a long telegraph to the President for General Hampton.  The General is a strong administration man.  He told me he was always opposed to the secession & was for maintaining our rights in the union.  He says he shall counsel & advise with me in all matters.    

	Tell Mr. Grady the check has come in & if he wishes me I can send it tofor him. Or send it up by the first safe opportunity.  Willie is quite well & was getting on pleasantly.  I have spent my time very pleasantly.  I will send you a paper.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	I wrote you yesterday & sent the letter by Mr. Raymond enclosing a check for Mr. Grady.  I hope you have received the letter & handed the check to Grady. There will be a balance due me on the check which you can get if you need money.  But be careful in spending for it is a hard matter to get money [in] these times.  I have not spent a cent since I have been in Columbia.

	I am writing you at the hour of one, the hour fixed for voting for Senate.  If the Legislature goes into the election I will keep my letter open to write you the result which may be for me or against.  It is all uncertain in Elections.  Now we are informed that Col. Orr is elected Governor!  Saturday it was positively assumed trhat General Hampton was elected & I telegraphed the President immediately explaining the course of the election & assuring him that politics had nothing to do with it.  I likewise requested him to pardon General Hampton.  He telegraphed me yesterday that he had pardoned him as I requested it.  So General Hampton has got his pardon by my mistake & solicitation.  I am glad of it.  Hampton is a noble gentleman.

	Yesterday morning Mrs. Pickens came down and immediately sent General Butler to me for an interview with her.  She wanted me to telegraph the President for Gov. Pickens which I did, but have not yet heard from the President.  She seened very much pleased and expressed herself under great obligations to me & did not know how to repay my kindness.  Her health is very much improved & She is looking very pretty.  The impression is that she came down to electioneer for her husband for Senator.  She has had a great many of the members to see her.  Tillman the Senator from Edgefield told me yesterday that he was going to tell Mrs. Pickens he should vote for me for the long term.  Campbell & Manning have both said they would not oppose me.  It is said Bonham & Boyce have agreed to unite their forces & run Boyce in opposition to me.  But I dont know that there is any truth in it.

	I saw Mr. Legare today who enquired after Mrs. Mathews & Mrs. McColl.  He had a petition for me to sign about a man who was convicted of killing a negro.

	I will now conclude & add a postscript about the election if it takes place.  Your affectionate husband.  My love to Fannie & the children.  Willie is well & doing well.  B.F. Perry

P.S. I am elected for the long term U.S. Senator.  I send you the Ballot.  Also the ballot for the short term.  I think Manning will be elected.  B.F. Perry

	I wrote you a letter this morning giving you an account of the election of Governor Manning.  I have nothing to do this evening & will write you again.  The election of Manning & myself seems to have given very general satisfaction.I heard of several persons remarking that South Carolina would have two of the finest looking Senators of any state in the Union.  This however would be a poor compliment for a Senator.  He should have talents, ability& patriotism.  Personal appearance is a matter of small consideration.  Governor Manning is not much of a debater and I shall have to speak for the State.  He says he can do something by conversation & management.

	General McGowan has just been in to see me.  He will be elected to the House & enquired if I was going to take my family.  He thinks we had better go on first & see if we are admitted to our seats & then come home and get our families.  You will think there are bright visions, living in Washington!  How are we to get money?  But I must continue to practice law when at home &make something additional.

	I am anxious now to return home and will do so as soon as I can.  But at present I am waiting to hear from the President, and attend to other matters.  General Hampton called to see me & thank me for getting his pardon, but he said as I obtained it through a mistake I ought to tell the President not to send it.  I told him I would do no such thing.  The election of Governor was still in some doubts.  Orr is, however, probably elected, but it will remain somewhat uncertain till the fourth Monday in November when the vote will be counted.  It is now past ten oclock & I will go to bed.

	Oct. [Nov.] 2ndThis is a gloomy day raining & I have nothing to do & nothing to read.I feel like going home.  It is said there is strong probability of the Legislature adjourning in a day or twoperhaps tomorrow.  But I hope not.  They ought to stay & do their business.  I have just been to breakfast & read the morning papers.  I cannot go out of the Hotel for the rain.  Visitors are not so numerous.  The election of Judges will come off today & tomorrow.  General Kershaw who nominated me for the Senate when they were going to vote  will be elected Chancellor.  Dawkins, Moses, Fair, Sullivan, Thomson, Arthur, Lesesne, Melton & Aldrich.

My dear Lizzie

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday & I suppose you rece[ive]d mine last night announcing what was to you very good news.  The election of myself to the U. States Senate by such a large majority 109 votes was indeed most grattifying.  The Parish members did not vote for me & thru away their votes on Governor Manning to damage him in the next election with my friends.  Gov. Manning heard of it the over night & sent me word that he did not & would not oppose me.  Still when the election came on the Greenville delegation did not vote for him in consequence.  But as soon as they understood the trick of Col. Campbells friends they went for Manning.  This morning Campbell & Trescot have withdrawn & will run Col. Dawkins.  But I think Manning will beat him.  If I hear the result in time I will write a postscript to this letter.

	You ought now my dear wife to be happy after the honor bestowed on me.  I am Senator for six years & the other Senator will only be for two years.  There was so much intriguing by all, that it is remarkable that I ran so well.  But some have shown very little grattitude in voting against me.  Col. [Charles Henry] Simonton  whom I had released from Prison & who called to see me in the Convention to express his grattitude voted against me.  So did Buist, Frank Porcher, Col. Davant & Townsend.  The latter I had done much for in trying to get back his lands.  But there is very little grattitude in public life.  Some of the Parish members voted for me, Dozier & Shaw &c.

	I have rece[ive]d several telegrams from President Johnson, but nothing about Governor Pickens pardon.  Mrs. Pickens is still here & has a dozen beaux around her.  But influence could not elect her husband.  She has great fascination of Manning & so pretty that I thought she would work wonders in electioneering.

	I will now conclude and write a P. Script if possible.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I am grattified to inform you that Gov. Manning has been elected my associate in the Senate over Col. Dawkins.  The vote was 95 to 50.  I did not think it right to manuver as they did against Manning.  I am very kind towards Dawkins.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you brace yourself up to hear my defeat in the best way you can.  This is very well on your part & you say further that you will not love me the less if defeated.  I hope now, my dear wife, you will love me the more, for my success, & feel proud that your husband is both Governor & United States Senator at the same time.  I do not know or feel at all changed by my new honors.  My feelings, hopes, manners & expectations are the same, & if I had been defeated it would not have cost me a moments uneasiness except on your account.  But I am elected & you ought to be happy & make everybody about you happy because you felt so much interest in the matter.

	I am glad to have Governor Manning as my Colleague.  He is a cordial warm hearted gentleman of good judgement & good principles.  He was once a Union man & his Father was a Union leader in 1832 & my friend.  Campbells friends offered to vote for me if I would vote for Campbell.  Then they voted for Manning & ran him in opposition to me in order to damage him with my friends & keep them from voting for him in opposition to Campbell for the short Senatorial term.  And they succeeded  in making the entire Greenville delegation & Spartanburgh vote against Manning the first time.  I knew the trick for Manning had informed me of it.  Col. Aldrich voted against me & Siegling, Miss Maggies cousin.  There was a great deal of manuvering & trickery, & would have been more if they had not known my strength in the Legislature.  Manning, Campbell, Trescott, Bonham & Dawkins all voted for me & they were all candidates & members of the Legislature.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Lizzie

	I wrote you two letters yesterday & as the mail goes out this evening I will write you again.

	If possible I will return home Tuesday evening to greet you & the family & receive your congratulations.  I hope you are now happy & I am now anxious to receive your letter tomorrow morning & learn what you have to say about my election.  All sorts of compliments are paid me by letters & the newspapers on my complimentary vote.  Buist paid me a very high compliment yesterday in the Senate for patriotism, honor, talents &c. but he did not vote for me.  It is amazing to hear so many compliments to Gov. Manning & myself on account of our good looks.  You woiuld suppose that we were elected on that account.

	This morning I rece[ive]d one hundred & forty Pardons which has put everybody in a good humor.  My pardon was amongst themalso General Thompsons, Elford, Gradys, Stokes, Donaldson &c.  You may tell them.  But poor Mrs. Pickens goes off today without hearing anything about Governor Pickens pardon.

	Willie was invited by Miss Martin to tea.  I think she is in love with him.  He went & found a few persons thereGeneral Kershaw, Wade Hampton, Jr &c.  Her father is a Methodist Preacher.  She is very pretty & smart.  She wrote him a note.  

	The election of Judges has been postponed.

	Give my love to all.  I wrote to T Tupper for your mother.  He is in Charleston.

	I shall stay at home till I start to Washington about the 25th of this month.  I have to come to Columbia then & count the votes for Congress.

	Your affectionate husband, Senator & Governor &c., B.F. Perry

P.S.  Mrs. Pickens was very anxious no doubt to spend the Winter in Washington with her husband as Senator.  She is fond of society & Edgefield must be a dull place for her.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to git off this evening & will therefore write you a line.  I may be up Wednesday or Thursday.  I am very anxious to return home & see you all.  And I wasdisappointed not hearing from you since my election.  I flattered myself that I would receive one of the prettiest & most affectionate letters you had ever writtenthat you would be so much grattified & so happy that your letter would make me happy.  But not a line from you!  But for Mr. Elfords letter I should have been uneasy.  He wrote me you said Thursday morning  that you were all well.  If I had been defeated for the Senate, I am sure you would have written me & given me a stern scolding, instead of consoling me in my misfortunes.

	I am waiting on the Legislature & the President.  The Legislature are about passing some Resolutions which I must attend to and I have telegraphed the President & wait his answer.

	`Mr. Buist came down again last evening & congratulated me most cordially on my electionso handsomely made.  Buist & myself have always been congenial spirits.  He spends most of his time in my room.  If the Provisional governorship is continued I will have him my successor.

	I will write you a line although I have nothing to tell you.  Our journey down was fatiguing, but otherwise pleasant.  Met Col. Orr at Belton & Mr. Alex Robertson & his daughter at the Greenville Depot.  All pleasant.  Fannie staid at Nickersons all night & Miss Janney came for her.  Mr. Janney gave me a long account of his visit to the President.  He said the President  immediately asked How is your friend Gov. Perry.  

	The votes for Governor are being counted.  Col. Orr read me his Inaugural in case he is elected.  It is a very good one.  I have left him nothing to say in his message.

       General Hampton called to see me last night & sat a long time.  He is somewhat afraid that he may be elected.  The Governor will be Inaugurated tomorrow whoever he may be.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from Gov. Pickens.  He is allarmed about his pardon.  Gov. Manning has gone on the where his wife is in Virginia & requested me to bring his commission.  I shall remain here till I hear from the President.  Gov. Aiken, General McGowan, Col. Farrow & Genl Kennedy are elected to Congress.

	Willie & Easley are boarding at Mrs. Caldwells, & I do not see much of them.  Dunkin called to see me this morning.  There was no quorum in the Legislature till today.

	Mr. Janney called to see me this morning & said Fannie & his daughter were going down to the State Housethe old College chapelthat he had a parcel of young friends at his house last night.  Seigling carried a letter to Fannie from Maggie.  

	I will send your mothers money by Holland Friday or Saturday from Charleston.

	Write me whenever you can.  Fannie will write you often I suppose & her letters will be more interesting than mine.  

	Give my love to the children & tell them to be good & study hard.

	The New York Papers are still full of Governor Perry & South Carolina.  I will send you some of them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Your letter of Monday has just been received.  I am glad you are so well pleased with your new Servant.  I hope you will continue pleased & that Laura may find a home elsewhere.  Let Lindys husband take Emma  if he wishes her  He may be able to do a betterby her than Lindy can.  I wish he would take Lindy also. But I suppose he has another wife.

	The Inauguration of Governor Orr took place yesterday  & I send you our speeches.  Fannie was present.  Young Wade Hampton my aid came to me & asked if my daughter was with me & that he would call & see her last night before he left for Louisiana today.  I told Fannie.

	There was a great crowd at the Inauguration.  The President says the South Carolina members had better wait till Congress organized.  His son in law Judge Patterson told Trescott he was very anxious to see me & for me to come on, that he thought the Senate would admit me.

	I am undecided yet about going on or coming home.  Shall hear again soon from the President.  Saw Willie this morning.  He says the members were more pleased with my speech than Gov. Orrs.

	It may be that Orr & myself will go to Charleston tomorrow to see General Grant.

	Write me whenever you can.  I sent by Steen $50 to your mother from Tupper & would have written but have not time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I received your letter this morning & was glad to hear from you.  I hope you will git all the corn you possibly can & let Wiley haul it whilst the roads are good.  

	You need not trouble yourself about legislation or politics for you always see trouble where there is none.  Give yourself no concern about the stay laws, or thousand propositions you will see in the newspapers.  

	I am not able to say when I shall go to Washington or Greenville.  I came very near going to Charleston this morning to see General Grant & Sickles.  Gov. Orr went.  I was afraid dispatches might arrive from trhe President in my absence.

	Last evening I dined with General Hampton & spent a very pleasant evening with the General & his lady, Gov. Orr, Lt. Gov. Porter, Speaker Aldrich,  Col. Haskel[l] & Lowndes.  Tomorrow I dine with General Easley at Mrs. Caldwells where he & Willie are boarding.  They had a party there last night & Fannie was at it.  I have not seen her since.  Col. Harris met me today & said my daughter was unmistakable looking so much like me.  No one could fail to know whose daughter she was.  He said his daughter was going to call on her.

	Mrs. Hampton euquired about you.  In speaking of her father Gen. McDuffie she did not seem to know much about him!  She did not know that he was wounded twice by Col. Cumming.  She asked me if he was wounded in the first or second duel.  She is very much broken & looks old & as thin as a.  I sent her today a newspaper containing Bill Arps last article which she wished to see.

	General Easley is going to have all my messages published in a pamphlet by order of the Legislature.  My farewell has drawn forth great praise.  Col. Orr is going to appoint Willie one of his aids with the rank of Colonel.  But I have not yet mentioned it to Willie.

	I went down to the State House today, saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula in the Gallery but did not go up to speak to them.  The two Dr. Lecontes came to speak to me & chatted some time.

	The Board of Trustees meet this evening.  Col. Farrow is going on to Washington on Monday next & perhaps General McGowan.  

	Mr. Holland goes up tomorrow & I will send this letter by him.

	I must now close as it is getting dark.

	I wish you would take my safe keys and look in an old pocket book in the money till & get my certificate of being a Rail Road director & enclose to me in your next letter.  If I go to Washington I shall want it to keep from paying rail road fare.  In opening the safe you had better get Mr. Swandale to show you how you take the steel key with the figures to the right & press it in till the handle turns.  Then the brass key opens the till drawer.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter of Sunday morning in which you regret I am no longer Provisional Governor.  How apt you are to make mistakes.  It seems you always construe everything of a public nature wrong.  I am still Provisional Governor & afraid I shall have to remain so for some time yet.  In my address which you read. I state that hereafter I will communicate with Gov. Orr instead of the Legislaturethat is all.  I telegraphed the President  to let me turn the government over to Gov. Orr & he will not even answer my request.  He has telegraphed me since, but says nothing about Gov. Orr, or my quitting the office,  I shall have to continue how long I know not.  The President telegraphed me that it was not necessary for the S.C. members to be there at the organization of Congress.  But Col. Farrow has gone on & took my account to git the money due me $1300.  Gov. Manning & Aiken are both going on.  As soon as I hear that I will be allowed to take my seat I will go, but not till then.  If not relieved, I will then resign my Governorship.

	We are all anxiety to see the Presidents Message.  It is the most important paper ever deleivered by a President for woe or weal to the South.  I still have confidence in Johnson & believe that all will come right.  

	I did not go to Charleston.  Gov. Orr went.  General Sickles had prepared a quiet dinner for General Grant, Gov. Perry & Gov. Orr and the citizens wished to give us a dinner but Grant declined.  Orr said General Grant assured him all the negro troops should be removed to the garrisons in the Forts.  General Sickles was very kind & favorable.  His wife is not with him.  Gov. Orr came back yesterday, says he saw myin Charleston.  Gov. Magrath is to be here.  His recent letter has disgusted his friends in Charleston.  

	Governor  Pickens has written me two long letters.  He is very much allarmed at not being pardoned.  He enclosed me a letter to the President, & I am afraid he will keep reminding the President of his case, till something will be done with him.  He is very much like you.  You are some kin I believe.

	I send you Mrs. Keiths letter.  She is getting nervous too.  I wrote her a beautiful letter, defending President Johnson & cheering her up as to the condition of the Country.  I advised her to go to Philadelphia for a change.  She wants society.  

	Carter Pool has offered me a fine riding horse whenever I wish it.  I took a long ride Sunday with General Easley.  Met Fannie coming from church.  In the evening Col. Dawkins & myself went up to see her.  Mr. Janney treated us to wine, brandy apples, cheese, crackers &c.  Yesterday I went to the Senate & met Fannie with Mrs. LeConte & Lula.  She dined with them.  I dined with General Easley, Genl Butler, General Kershaw and others at Mrs. Caldwells.  Then went at night to Janneys where there was a party.  This morning I went with Mr. Lord & others  to see General Ames & git him to have the State Archives sent back from Yorkville to Columbia.  He kindly agreed to furnish ten wggons & teams to haul them.  Lord &  were very much impressed with his politeness.  Mrs. LeConte seemed very friendly & kind to Fannie & myself.  She is afraid they will have to go to Louisiana to live.  The College here will not support them.  The Trustees meet tomorrow evening again.

	Tell Mrs. Butler I have not heard anything of her.  The other day I rece[ive]d from Philadelphia a letter to General Butlerperhaps from his sister.  General Martin told me that his sister Mrs. Bostick had opened a Boarding House in Washington for Southern members & wished me to stay with her. 

	Birnie goes up in the morning & I will send you some papers.  Fannie has one containing a handsome compliment to me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	Your long letter of Tuesday was rece[ive]d this morning.  Instead of scolding you I approve of your horse trade & think you have done well.  But now you must make Wiley sell his mare & dispose of Wagner.  Two horses are as many as I can afford to keep.  

	I have written to Mr. Buist in reply to his letter to me that I would take greenbacks if paid this year, & that he might pay the money to Grady who would git his note of you.  It is in my note packet book in my safe.  I owe Grady, & will be glad to pay him.  He can act as my banker & pay off several little notes I have given for corn &c. & furnish you with money as you may need it.

	I went with Fannie & Miss Janney to the State House this morning & there saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula.  We spent the morning pleasantly & several of our friends came to speak to us.  The girls went to visit Miss Gibbes and I returned to the Hotel.  Mrs. Joseph LeConte told me they had a likeness of me in Harpers or Leslies illustrated paper.  But that it was a very poor likeness.  I and the Governor of New Jersey were together.  I have not seen the print.  

	I hope to hear something definite from Washington this week so as to either go on to Washington or return home next week.  The Presidents Message is good, very good, but the first days proceedings in Congress are bad, bad.  I think however Johnson will be able to control a majority of the members.

	I am glad to know that Hext & Ben are willing to work & make money.  But it will be better for them to continue at school for the present.  Let Hayne & Hext both go to Mr. Anderson.

	I have just had a visit from Col. Childs & Mr. Rufus Johnston though it is now after eleven oclock in the night.  They came to git me to give a certificate for General Butler to General Johnston for an appointment in the Express Company which I did with great pleasure.  Col. Childs says my letter to him when he went north gave him credit & entre everywherethat I was well known.  Rufus Johnston said no one was more talked of in New York.

	I will write you a few lines by mail.  No one went up this morning, as I would have sent you a bundle of papers, which you might have loaned to your friends.

	I received a kind telegram last night, from the President saying he was gratified at the reception of his message un S.C. that he would send me in a few days instructions as to my being retained as Provisional Governor & that Congress would move off all right in twoor three days.

	I have just communicatred this news to Governor Orr who is delighted.  He says he wishes very much that he had brought his daughter down with himthat she & Fannie would have staid at Col. Childs with Mrs. Herbemont & had a delightful time.  He is staying there.

	I have just see Mr. Janney.  Fannie sent for your letters to read.    The package came safe.

	As soon as I receive my instructions I will return home and give up the State to Gov. Orr.  Then I will go on to Washington.  Willie is quite well.  Fannie was invited to a party at Mrs. LeContes last night. But the rain prevented her going.  She is quite well.

	The Legislature has agreed to adjourn this day (Tuesday) week.  The Judges are to be elected tomorrow.  It is thought Dawkins, Moses, & Presley will be elected.

	I have just returned from Col. Childs where I dined with Gov. Orr, Gov. Bonham & others.  After dinner, Fannie & Miss Janney, Mrs. LeConte & Lula, Mrs. Caldwell & her sisters, Mrs. Gibbes & a few gentlemen were invited to meet me.  It is now eleven oclock in the night.  I went with Fannie & Miss Janney to the State House today & saw them vote for JudgesDawkins, Moses & Aldridge were elected law Judges.  [William Dalrymple] Johnson of Marlborough &[Henry Deas] Lesesne of Charleston were elected Chancellors.  Col. Fair ran well & so did Presley, but Sullivan only got eight votes.  Col. Melton came within three votes of being elected Chancellor.

	I rece[ive]d your letters written Friday and Sunday.  Sorry to hear of your troubles with servants.  Let Wiley do as he pleases.  He will take care of everything & manage well.  I am under obligations to him for his fidelity to Willie & wish him to stay with me & do as he pleases.

	You must not worry about politics.  I think everything is going on well, & Johnson will carry out his policy.  I have entire confidence in him.  We may be kept out of Congress for a while.  But as the President said to me in a telegram Congress will move off all right in a short time.  I care nothing about Summer & Wilson.  

	I will send you a bundle of papers.  Mrs. King is writing for the Courier.  In one of her letters she congratulates me for my course in Charleston Convention.  Tell Mrs. Butler, General Ames has no power to give her transportation.  As soon as I hear from President Johnson again I will return home.  General Martin wishes me to carry his daughter to Washington when I go.  I gave your letters to Fannie to read today.  I wrote Mr. Barnwell a long letter about the college.  The Trustees will now meet & elect Professors.  The affair between Campbell & Warley was settled the next day.  Fannie will probably go with Mr. Cuttino & his wife to Aiken, or with Martin to Charleston.  But she will write as to her movements.  She seems to enjoy herself.  Willie is quite well.  I have written Buist to pay the money.  I sent you Harper & you sent it to me.  The likeness is pretty good.  You must read Mr. Pinckneys Sermon in the Courier.  It is admirable.  The churches in Columbia were not opened on thanksgiving day.  Howlike.  Mr. Jordan Pool is here sick, but improving.  

	I must now go to bed.  Do not worry yourself with the servants or about politics.  Take care of the Children & make them read & study.  You ought to be happy & contented with a loving & honored husband, promising children, comfortable situation with friends &c.  Do not let trifles & worthless servants distract you, & politics which you know nothing about, worry you.  Look on the bright side of the pictures of life.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	This is a dreadful day, & I have just been to see Fannie.  Willie came this morning & relieved me.  I thought Fannie went to Mrs. Caldwells last night & would have to walk home through the sleet & mud.    But she had good sense enough not to venture out.  Today she was to have dined with Mrs. LeConte, but the weather was too bad.  I met her however coming down to see me, as I went up to see her.    She has not heard yet from the Crofts, & it will cost thirty or forty dollars to get there with Cuttino & his wife.  I told her she had better go to Charleston & see the Crofts as she returns.  Mr. Porter is expecting his daughter here from Chester, to go down with him & offered this evening to take charge of Fannie & likewise return her hospitality to his family whilst she remained in Town.  I will see Fannie tomorrow & arrange.  Mr. Porter called this evening to get me to nominate George Bryant for district Judge.   Moses having been elected Judge now declines the appointment.  I made the nomination.  The members of the Legislature had already signed Bryants recommendation.

	I shall leave here Friday morning & reach home Wednesday night.  Gordon Pool  goes up in the morning & will carry this letter.  I have not been relieved yet by the President as Provisional Governor, so you will have the pleasure of meeting me still as Governor.  I begin to think that he does not intend to relieve me till Congress admits me as Senator.  I am still hopeful of getting my seat in a few weeks. 

	I am glad Wiley has parted with his mare & hope that Morgan will learn to draw well.  I will take a bowl of Wards whiskey.  The other matters in your letter we will talk about on my return home.  I am delighted at the idea of going home instead of going to Washington.  The truth is I had rather be with you & the children than to be in Washington with all the great men of the country.  I am sure I shall have to return home often unless you go on with me.

       I saw  Butler here this evening & he says he is going to Greenville in a day or two.
       
       In regard to the yankee troops General Ames has no power to remove them, but I think they will all be removed pretty soon.  Whilst they remain in Greenville it is best to have no difficulty with them.  They had a serious difficulty at Union & one yankee was killed & two wounded.  These unfortunate occurences will prevent their speedy removal.  
       
       Willie & [Henry Pinckney] Hammett made speeches last night, so Hammett tells me, against the tax of $250  on each Still, but the tax passed.  This will make whiskey very dear.  I suppose they thought their constituents were interested in defeating so extravagant a tax.  

	Now my dear wife goodnight.  Fannie rece[ive]d your letter, your mothers and one from Mattie Orr today.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	We arrived here safely in three days after a most fatiguing trip travelling night & day.  But we had a great deal of pleasant enjoyment in talking & eating & drinking.  In Richmond I purchased a very fine sack Coat $39beaver cloth &$18, cravat $1.50 & gloves $2.00.  Immediately on my arrival here I went to see the Secretary of War.  He rece[ive]d me very kindly and paid me in money my account $1520.  The gold note $285, another note of $200 lost.  of $200 borrowed of Ferguson when I went to Columbia--$25 for the horse & $20you have received.  I was delighted to git the money but grieved to have to part with the greater part of it immediately.

	My arrival was announced in the National Intelligencer & Trescott & Buist came immediately to see me & said I had arrived just in time to be.  They state mostin reference tp the s[e]izure of lands &c.  They insisted on my going with them forthwith to see the President.  When we got there, a large crowd had assembled in the East Room.  It was the Christian Society for the relief of Soldiers.  The President came down to meet them & made a speech.  In it he said his policy embraced all the states & he knew no section.  On retiring he came up to me  & said he was much grattified to see me.  I said I wished to have some conversation with him & he told me to call tomorrow Sunday morning when he would be at leisure.  He told me about the Black republicans sending Fred[erick] Douglass & a force of negroes to make a speech to him.  He said it was the most trying scene he had ever passed through, but that he kept his temper.  His reply was most admirable.  He looks very well & is a most wonderful man.  I shall have a long chat with him tomorrow in company with Trescot & Buist.  

	Tonight I have just learned that he will veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill.  This will be a great & unexpected boon to the South & requires more nerve than I thought he possessed.  But he is a wonderful man, & looks only to the interest of the whole country.  Black republicans will be furious & the lands will now have to be restored in the lower country.  The state works at Greenville will be given up by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Trescot told him I was here & that I had transferred the works to Gov. Orr instread of selling them to defray the expenses of the Convention.  The Secretary then said he would abandon them.

	I went to the Senate this morning & gave Reverdy Johnson my commission to present, which seemed to impress him.  He called this evening to see me.  I have just made the acquaintance of the Alabama Senators Parsons & Houston.  The crowd here is immense.  Willards is full to overflowing.  Tell Willie I have purchased a very fine hat for him.  I went into a singular store today where everything was a dollar.  I purchased a beautiful cup as pretty as silver one dollar, a Book full of photographs with a gold clasp for a dollar.  Then I was entitled to two draws in a lottery.  I drew a little silver Bell & a necklace.  The thing is a mystery.  I will have my photograph taken full length for $3 & then $1.50  for all copies afterwardslittle ones taken for three cents by the hundred. 

	In visiting the Capitol I was shocked to see ragged, dirty, stinking black negroes mixing in the galleries.  They go into the Senate gallery & sit & sleep &the whole House!

	I have subscribed for the Nationasl Intelligencer.  You must preserve the papers that come in in my absence.  I think I shall return the week after next.

	Your affectioinate husband.  Goodnight eleven oclock.  B.F. Perry

Letter 710
Tuesday morniong I went to see Mrs. King & she was out.  In the evening she wrote me a beautiful note to escort her to the Presidents Service that night.  Col. Elford & myself went & she had procured a carriage was magnificently dressed & said she had not been to any of the Presidents Services for want of a suitable escort.  She & I walked all over the rooms.  I introduced her to the President & his daughters.  There were two thousand persons present.  Such a jam you never saw.  We were much noticed, & Col. Elford said he heard the remarks made very often walking behind us there goes the governor of South Carolina.  I met Mr. Bancroft & had a long chat with him.  Mr. Washington came up and spoke to me & several others who remembered me in the Charleston Convention.  I saw & conversed with General Butler & Senator [Henry] Wilson of Massachusetts.  They were polite.  I have met Randal Hunt of New Orleans.  He says  is pardoned & living in New Orleans.  Judge Patterson is very kind to me & his wife is pleasant & also Mrs. S.  I have become acquainted with governor [William Lewis] Sharkey, Gov. Parsons & Gov. M.  Governor Sharkey told me that W[illiam] H[enry] Foote had just published a book in which he & myself were compared.  A Bookman has presented me with a copy of the work.  This morning The Chronicle announced that governor Perry of S.C. had an interview with the President yesterday.  I have written a long article for the National Intelligencer which will make a noise tomorrow morning, in the political world.  Last night Miss Sallie Martin sent for me to join a pleasant party at her uncles, but it was so cold I declined going.  I will call to see her today.  I have bought you.  I have got a full length Photograph likeness & smaller ones all fourteen dollars as a present for you of myself.  I got the President yesterday to sign an order for five hundred pardons for South Carolina & today I have sent for another order for two or three hundred more.  Col. Elford is having them executed & will bring them home.  I rerce[ive]d a letter this morning from Miss Simons & I have got her pardon.  There are about one thousand persons at Willards Hotel & the ladies all ugly.  Yesterday, at the White House, I saw an exceedingly beautiful young gentleman step into the room, dressed in cloth pants and sack coat, fair, ruddy & lovely complexion soft beaming eyes with a lovely smile& a fancy hat  on his head.  I thought to myself your face gracefull person and winning manners will play mischief with these young ladies.  As he came near me I thought of M in Bulwers Strange Story.  There was a perfectabout his air & expression, high bred manners &c.  I fouind out it was Miss Walker a doctor in the United States Army, who had been twice captured by the!  Col. Elford says he feels sick, & wishes to send for her.  I shall leave here Monday or Tues.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning enclosing Fannies & H.  I began to think I should not hear from you.  I gave me great pleasure to receive a line from you.

	I shall try & leave here Tuesday morning & reach home Thursday or Friday.  I went to see the President yesterday but there was such a crowd I had very little conversation.  He said he would try & see me before I left.  I met Mrs. Senator Clay of Alabama at the White House and spent an hour with her whilst waiting to see the President.  Her husband is confined a prisoner at Fortreess Monroe.  She is one of the most intellectual women I ever met, a noble lady & devoted wife.  She seemed pleased when I introduced myself to her & told me all her history & troubles & trials.  We took seats in one corner of the room & had quite a tete a tete for an hour.  She is with all very fine looking.  The President gave her a package & she smiled as if her whole soul was radiant with joy.  I hope it was the release of her noble husband.

	I went with Trescott one evening last week to call on Mr. [Lafayette] Foster President of the Senate & spent a delightful evening with him & his wife.  He is from Connecticut & we talked of New Haven and all your friernds there.  Mrs. Foster is a smart good looking yankee lady & very pleasant but very different from a Southern lady.  

	I went to see Sallie Martin & her aunt Mrs. Bostick & was pleased with them.  Sallie says she is homesick & was so glad to see me.

	This Hotel is magnificent & the fare most superior.  But the ladies all ugly.  Elford has written an article for the Columbia Phoenix in which Mrs. King & myself figure at the Presidents Service.

	My article in the Intelligencer is greatly praised & admired.  My Photograph is a failure.  I may try again tomorrow. 

	I think I mentioned my interviews with General Butler, Wilson, Randall Hunt, Governor Sharkey, Parsons & M in my last letter.

	The President thinks we will git our seats soon.  He is going to veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill & this will be a bombshell in the ranks of the Republicans.

	Hodges called to see me this morning, & Geddes and Trescott & Young.  Elford will not be able to return with me.  I have got all the pardons under way & he will wait & bring them.

	I bought a new wig making.  The Frenchman is working on it today (Sunday).  He said if he did not go to Heaven it would be my fault. 

        I have only been to the Capitol once.  The crowd of negroes, & the speeches are disgusting.  
       
       I have purchased a parcel of garden seeds.  I am glad you have commenced with your garden & getting on well.
       
       The weather has been extremely cold but I dont feel it at all in the Hotel.  It is now raining.  The Tennessee & Arkansas members of Congress are to be admitted this week.    Genl Lee is here but I have not seen him.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from a visit to Mrs. LeConte & Mr. Barnwell & wil spend a few minutes before starting in writing you a letter.

	Governor Orr & General Harrison met me at Belton on their way to Philadelphia.  At Cokesbury we were joined by Judge Thompson & General McGowan forming a very pleasant party.  They were all provided with very amply lunch baskets filled with good things to eat & drink.  We had a very cordial & social picnic.  The weather was very hot & dry.  We reached Columbia about dusk & after supper I saw Chancellor Carroll, Col. Harris & others.  Col. Harris told me that my letter to Wallace had obtained  his office as Collector.  Wallace said my request had been with him.  The Col. seemed grateful to me.

	I went to bed at nine ocl;ock in my old room, the room I occupied whilst Governor opening into the Parlor & two beaux singing & playing on the Piano till I went to sleep under the sound of their melodies.  

	I slept well & rose this morning very much refreshed.  After reading the papers & taking breakfast with Judge  & General McGowan I went to see Mrs. LeConte & thence to Mr. Barnwell.  They all seemed glad to see me.  Miss Graham gave me the address of Dr. Jackson in Philadelphia & requested me to call & see him.  She said he had talked a great deal about me & expressed a strong wish to see me.  They all enquired after you & Fannie very kindly.

	Mr. Barnwell gave me a great deal of political advice as to the Convention which corresponds with my own views.  He expressed great pleasure at my calling & begged that I would never come to Columbia without giving him the pleasure of seeing me.

	Governor Orr tells me that his convening the Legislature will depend on the President.  If the President will give him assurance that all the negroes will be turned over to the Courts for trial without interference on the part of the military, he will convene the Legislature, otherwise he will not.

	Mr. Barnwell is opposed to a special session of the Legislature & thinks the Legislature will do mischief instead of good.  He prefers that the Yankees should retain jurisdiction on the negroes.  He thinks very highly of Col. Green the yankee commander at this place.

	Dr. LeConte told me that he started up to call on me during the Conventionsaw me in the Chair organizing the Convention & did not have time to call again.

	Mrs. LeConte looks worse than I ever saw her.  She has lost all of her good looks & looks thin.  Miss Lula looks very well.  Miss Graham as usual.

       Tell Willie to take care of the office & its business.  Tell Hext & Hayne to study hard & be good boys.  You & Fannie need no advice & will do your whole duty.
       
       I hope to hear from you in Philadelphia & I will write again from Washington.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just got through with the Convention.  It was the greatest assembly of men ever convened on this continent.  Everything was harmonious & complete success.  I made a speech to 1500 persons which was well rece[ive]d & I have sent it to you.

	The South Carolina delegation are going to dine with the Mayor of Philadelphia this evening.  Tomorrow we go on to Mr. Fishers who married Miss Middleton & spend the night with him.  Heowns a magnificent country seat.

	We will leave here Monday morning & reach home Friday.  Tell Mrs. Butler I saw Woodward & his little daughter, a sweet little girl.

	I have just been to have my likeness taken.

	Tell our friends that everything goes well & success is certain.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Willies.  I have heard nothing from Mr. Barnwell yet about your purchases.

	Judge Wardlaw was robbed of $500 whilst getting into the cars here & Col. Campbell lost a fine diamond breast pin in the same way.

	I have lost nothing & am quite well.  I have enjoyed myself well.  It has been a joyous frolic & I have a great deal to tell you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Letter 714
2 September 1866
Greenville

My dear Sir [Benson J. Lossing Esq.]

	Whilst in Philadelphia attending the National Union Convention I subscribed for your Civil War in America & received the first volume which I am reading.  You state that all the South Carolina delegation left the Charleston Democratic Convention in 1860.  This is a mistake.  Colonel Boozer & myself remained in the Convention & after the other delegates retired cast the vote of the State for Hunter of Virginia.  During all the ballotings and severe hisses in the galleries every time we rose.

	In the morning before the Convention met there was a meeting of the South Carolina delegation to determine to go out with the Alabama delegates.  A Resolution was offered to that effect, where I stated that I would not leave the convention or feel myself bound by the Resolution.  It was then withdrawn. 

	Let me now say to you that I was always in public & private life, a steadfast Union man, and opposed nullification in our State Convention in 1832 & opposed Secession in our State Convention in 1852 & was equally open in my opposition to disunion in 1860.  I take some credit to myself for having defeated Secession in South Carolina in 1852 & when there was no Union Paper in the State I sent to New York & purchased a Press in 1850, & edited it as The Southern Patriot for several years.  In 1860 the disunion feeling swept over the State & crushed everyone who opposed it.  I said to Governor Means, who wished to know what course I was going to pursue, that for thirty yearsI had tried to save the union & that now the State was going to the Devil & I was going with her.  I wept like a child at her madness & folly & predicted that secession would prove the death knell of slavery!

	My union sentiments excluded me from office & position in South Carolina till the Rebellion was over.  Then I was appointed Provisional governor of the State, & afterwards, almost unanimously elected U. States Senator from South Carolina by those who had previously opposed me all my life.

	Enclosed I send you a likeness of myself, which was taken the other day at the request of Senator Cowan of Pennsylvania for the purpose of having theCommittee of Thirteen on the address & Resolutions, Photographed in one picture.  

	I am with great respect & consideration yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

	I have rece[ive]d two letters from youone by Runnion enclosing the stampsand I have used eighteen of them.

	Norton knows more about the case than I do, but tell him  I recei[ve]d a letter from Thompson requesting what I have done.

	I have been very busy since you left.  Have filed three answers in Equity, issued one Bail Writ against J.H. Arnold & got three appearances from J. Looper besides giving advice in several cases of some importance.

	I am sorry to hear you are likely to have a long session.   says he has twenty or thirty notes of oldfor me to issue on.

	Enclosed I send you a letter & certificate which you will which you will hand Mr. Read & git his written consent to settle the case of Chaplin & send me back immediately as Jake wishes to go to Memphis.

	Hayne & Ben are still sick in bed.  Hayne is getting well.  Ben is still lingering..  Fanny comes home tonight.  The rest of us are all well.  Nothing new.  Willie Beattey sent for your horse this evening.

	Give my respects to Easl[e]y & the Greenville delegation.

Letter 716
28 September 1866

	The Legislature of this State was convevened some weeks since by his Excellency Governor Orr to organize the District Court for the trial of negroes, & fighting a civil rights Bill placing them upon an equality with white persons in giving testimony & being tried, sueing &c.  I was called to Columbia during the first week of the session as a member of the Greenville Rail Road directors.  I had the pleasure of seeing a great many of the members and talking to them about the prospects of the country.  They were very despondent & I tried to cheer them up by telling them that I felt confident that the Fall Elections throughout the middle & northern & western States would go in favor of the administration.  This they did not seem disposed to believe.  I saw Ex governor Pickens & his lady on their return from Baltimore.  The Governor did not seem hopeful of the results of the northern Elections.  Neither did Judge Dawkins who had just returned from the north with his family.  I may be mistaken, but time will show who is right in his judgement.  I found my belief on the following grounds.  The political parties were nearly equally divided in the Election between Lincoln & McClellan.  The one recei[ve]d something over two millions & the other eighteen hundred thousand votes.  Since that time a large number of the leaders of the Republican party have come over to the administration.  The people are gitting tired of constant political excitement & agitation.  The Capitalists are becoming apprehensive that another civil war may ensue which would endanger all their government securities.  They have been assured that the Southern States do not desire repudiation of the national debt which they greatly apprehended at one time.  The masses of the northern people are not in favour of negro suffrage.  A large number of the Federal Generals have taken sides with the President.   Their convention at Cleveland adopted & endorsed the Proceedings of the Philadelphia Convention.

	It is said that the Presidents speeches in his northern tour have injured his party.  I do not think so.  On the contrary I am satisfied that they will have a telling effect on the Fall elections with the great mass of people.

	I regretted not seeing Governor Manning in Columbia.  He was sick, & has since been dangerously ill.  It is said Col. Campbell & his friends were getting up opposition to Manning & would try & defeat him this winter.  I regret this very much.  I like him, & would be glad to have him as a colleague in the Senate of the U. States.  Not having yet been allowed to take his seat, it would be cruel to turn him out.  J.B. Campbell is spoken of by his friends.  If he cannot succeed in defeating Manning then they are to start General Hampton or General Kershaw.

	Whilst in Columbia I called to see General Sickles in company with Governor Orr.  He is a good looking, light & frivilous man.  It may be, that my opinion of his character formed years since has prejudiced me against him, & that I do not properly appreciate his intellect.  He almost connived at his wifes adultery & then murdered her paramour when it became notorious!  The General informed me that he was going to send a Garrison to Greenville.  They have since arrived.  This is unfortunate.  The negroes will then behave worse, & there may be collissions between the soldiers & citizens.  I wish we could git rid of all Federal teroops.

	It was said in Columbia that Mrs. Pickens was anxious for the Governor to be elected to the U.S. Senate.  I said that she herself would stand a much better chance.  General Easl[e]y replied he thought she could be elected very easily.  She is a very charming lady, beautiful, accomplished & intellectual.

	General Orr received a telegraph dispatch whilst I was in Columbia requesting him or myself to attend the mass meeting in New York on the 17th Sept. & address the meeting .  On my return home I found a letter from the committee making the same request.  In reply I wrote a long letter giving what I would say if there.  I should have liked very much to have been there.  But it was impossible for me to go.

	The Legislature have adjourned after passing several important Bills.  Amongst them one to establish a Penitentiary.  This is the last great measure of mine adopted by the State.  It is very grattifying to me, to find, after thirty years advocacy on my part that all of my measures of reform have been adopted.  The election of Electors of Pres & Vice Pres by the people of South Carolina.  The destruction of the odious & unjust Parish system by which one voter in a Parish had as much influence in the Senate as two or three hundred voting in the upper districts!  The election of Governor by the people.   The equalization of taxation according to the value of property.  The abandonment of the right of secession.  And the perpetuation of the Federal Union.  The con of the South Carolina College into a University where young men can pursue such studies as they have a taste for & which will be of most service to them in after life.  The establishment of one court of appeals for law & Equity.  And a county or district court for the trial of misdemeanors & larceny & small civil suits.  All these measures I have advocated ever since I entered public life & at last they have been adopted by my state.  How much feeling some of them have cost me no one can conjecture.

	I have likewise been personally successful, at last, in my political aspirations.  In the course of twelve months I was district attorney, commissioner of Assessments & district Judge  under the Confederacy, Provisional Governor of the State under appointment of President Johnson & United States Senator by election of the Legislature of South Carolina.  It was said, by a friend, with great truth, that all of my honors came at once clustering around me.

Dear Madam [Mrs. Eliza R. Laurens]

	I recei[ve]d your letter last night with your circulars respecting your school.  The other circular about the Raffle I did not receive.

	The people of Greenville are so poor & hard pressed for money, that I am not able to give you any encouragement as to the Raffle.  And I may say the same in regard to your school.  No one, not living here, has any idea of the utter destitution of our people.  

	It would give me great pleasure to aid you in both your school & raffle if it were in my power to do so.

	I am with great respect & esteem.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	I received your long letter written on Sunday, yesterday evening & was glad to hear from you at so much length.  

	I have nothing special to write you.  I hope Sh purchased the mule & am sorry to hear Wagener is lame.  I am quite well pleased also to learn Cobb has brought the pork  & will bring more & that you are supplied with flour by our good friend Green.

	Mr.  Arthur is to be tried 3d January at Greenville & the trial is to be public.  Mr. McCready wished to engage me as judicial adviser of the Court.  But I declined to have anything to do with the trial.  He wants a younger lawyer to assist & I recommended Captain Earle.  McCready told me last night that Col. Trescott came down with Boyce & McBee yesterday & they told him that the Masons had instigated the charges against Arthur & there was no trust in them.

	I saw Col. Alston Hayne last night.  He is going to move to California.  He says his Brother is pursuing his Profession there & urges him to come.  He told me Arthurs wife went off with a gambler & is now married to himleft her three children bad woman.  How blood will show itself.  I always heard that she was illegitimateborn before her mother married .  But one could hardly expect virtue in an actress & her associations are enough to de her if she has virtue.  Alston seemed very despondent, had lost almost all of his property.  He left for Charleston this morning with two of the H daughters.

	The election of U[nited] States Senator will take place in a few minutes & I suppose [James B.] Campbell will be elected.  He has bargained & bought up enough votes  to elect him.  [Henry Pinckney] Hammett  & [Alexander] McBee and perhaps the whole Greenville delegation except Willie  & maybe [George Franklin] Townes will probably vote for Campbell to get his & his friends votes  for the Greenville Rail Road Bill.  Campbells friends have bargained with Reid, Easl[e]y and [word obscured] about the Secretary election &of them.  I am utterly disgusted with the want of principle.

	Willie recd a letter from Fannie last night saying that she would do to Florida next week by water.  I do not like Fannies separating herself from Mrs. Glover & going [text missing]

	I see Governor Swains letter to me, published in the new York Times.  My letter was crowded out this morning by the Presidents Message.  The President stands firm & insists the South should be represented.  His message is a noble document.

	I have made an arrangement to have a little keg of fresh oysters sent up every Saturday costing $1.25.  They will be about as cheap as any kind of meat & I am so fond of them.  

	I hope to get home Friday or Saturday.  I have just returned from the Court of Appeals & the Charleston cases will take all day today.  General [James] Simmons [Simons]  called to see me last night & talk politicsvery well.

	I have but a moment to write you before going to the Court of Appeals.  I am on the Committee to examine students.  There are fifty five applicants for law & twenty five for Equity.  I rece[ive]d your letter last night & if Mrs. Laurens sent any tickets to me they were stolen from the mails.  I see my letter to the Herald published in the paper of 22d.  The comments are moderate.  The Charleston Couriers New York correspondent says the letter is magnificent.  The Phoenix publishes notices of my letter on the Constitution.  The Charlotte News makes extracts from my Herald Letter & compliments.  

	I had a long talk with General Capers & advised him to accept the Greenville Church & run for Secretary of State.  He will resign his office as soon as he is ordained.  He spoke very kindly of you & your efforts to provide for him.  He appears to be a most excellent & pious gentleman.  

	In speaking of Mr. Arthur Chief Justice Dunkin said that you would not let me defend him.  Willie is quite well.  Henry Buist told me he saw Fannie at his Fathers just before leaving Charleston.  Col. Jackson & his Bride came down with us & stopped at Nickersons.  I had to give him my room for the night.  Miss Orr came down to stay with Col. Childs during the Session.  Edward Stokes was very attentive to her, but I think Van Wyck is addressing her.  His first wife was a daughter of Judge Battle of N.C.  I have bought me a new hat like the old one.  Janney invites you to come down & stay with him.  I do not know whether I shall be able to go down Saturday or not.  I will write you again.  I have been nowhere & seen no one except those at the Hotel.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Liz

	This is thanksgiving day & the Legislature & the Courts have all adjournedtill tomorrow.  I am therefore at leisure to write you a long letter.  I wrote you a very short one yesterday before going into Court.  I was appointed to examine the applicants for admission in law on Constitutional Cases.  I suppose the Judges thought from my letter on the Constitutional amendment that this subject was appropriately mine.  The class consisted of fifty one studentsWells, Westmoereland & Dargan amongst them.  They all stood a very good examination & were admitted.

	I then went to pay my respects to the Governor & whilst in his office his daughter Miss Mattie came in for the purpose of getting money to shop.  I went to Radcliffe & bought me a beautiful set of shirt buttons or studs.  In the evening I attended the Board of Trustees & did not return to the Hotel till eleven oclock.  Governor Orr went off to& a christian & did not attend our meeting.  This morning I went with him to call on Miss Childs & Miss Mattie.  Miss Mattie told me that Dr. Hoke & his Bride were there last night & that Dr. Hoke went up to the Hotel  to see me.  I was at the College & did not see him.   Willie tells me he saw him & his Bride.  I suppose they will reach Greenville tonight.  

	I was greatly shocked yesterday morning to hear that you had had a fire in Greenville since I left there.  I told Susan when she seemed so anxious to haveto her McBees Hall that it might be destroyed by fire & then her childrens whole fortune would be gone.  She ought now to see how correct my judgment was.  It is a most fortunate circumstance that the fire dd not extend over the village.  Alexander McBee went up to Greenville this morning & will not return till Monday.  

	I think I shall go up Saturday & return Tuesday.  Looper has not yet been tried & may not be before the last of next week.  I have several persons complimenting very [word obscured] about my letter which I will carry up with me.  Chief Justine Dunkin  and a dozen orthers have paid me very high compliments for this letter.  It seems to have attracted great commendation everywhere.

	Judge Bryan told me he saw Fannie & that she was looking more beautiful than ever.  She will remain in Charleston till the 11th of December.  Mrs. Glover has gone to Orangeburgh & will meet her at Branchville on the [word faded].  They will go to Florida by Rail Road through Augusta &c.

	Governor Manning is very ill, & his election comes on next Tuesday.  It is thought Col. Campbell will oppose him.  I hope Manning will be elected.  He is a good deal better than he was.  Dr. Geddings came up to see him not long since & changed his treatment.  His friends think he will recover.  I hope so most sincerely.

	I have not yet seen or heard from Mrs. LeConte.  I do not know whether Lula is in Columbia or not.  One of the Trenholms sons is to marry Miss Bryce very soon.  Judge Bryan told me that he courted a very poor lady in Charlestonhim not long since.  He thought it a rare instance of dis on her part.  ,,, Trenholm is good looking but very small, & his intended, a very large lady.

	I have not seen or heard from General Hampton or his family.  I saw General Martin yesterday who enquired after all of you very kindly.  I have not seen Isaac Hayne.  Edward Stokes & John W, Stokes were admitted yesterday in Equity & I suppose will go up tomorrow morning.  Looper tells me he expects money soon from Augusta & will pay me whatever I charge for defending his son.
	
	I am glad that Blassingame sent for the corn & hope that P is right in his cor. The weather is very warm & looks as if we should have rain.  I hope it is colder in Greenville on account of the meat salted away.  I trust you & your household are doing well.  Having so small a famiy at present I hope you [have] no troublei in housekeeping.  I shall expect to hear from you this evening.  I [word obscured] the letters you sent me & if any others should come you had better keep them till I return.  If I do not return on Saturday send them to me on Monday or write {word faded] their contents.

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & instead of going to church I will write you a long letter. It is a very cold day & I have a comfortable fire.  I have been to breakfast & the company have just left my room.  How long before someone also comes in I cant tell.

	Yesterday morning I got up & wrote you a line, went down & gave it to Westfield.  I came back & went to bed again.  I was anxious to have returned home yesterday, but was afraid my cases in court might be called up  before I could return.  I promised Looper too to remain & look at his sons case.  He seems very willing to pay me a good fee & I shall charge him a thousand dollars.  It is unpleasant too riding about on the Rail& getting up before day this cold weather.

	You will be gratified to hear that General Capers has been elected Secretary of State by a large majority.  He will hold the office till his ordination.  I think he ought to continue in the office after ordination till his congregation is able to support him and I told him so.

	Mr McCready & W.A. Pringle are to call to see me this evening after church on special business.  They did not say what, but I suspect it is about the trail of Mr. Arthur.  I sit at the table with all of the Judges & they all seemed curiousknow something about the charges against Arthur & I told them all I knew.  Pringle has brought up his brother Bton to put in the Lunatic Asylum & seems very sad.  They have one hundred & thirty lunatics in the Asylum.

	The election of U[nited] States Senator comes on next Tuesday and fear Governor Manning will be beaten by Col. Campbell.  They are forming combinations to defeat Manning.  He is not here.  The election of Solicitors comes off Tuesday also.  I am not able to say who will be elected.  Reid, Easl[e]y & Evans all seem confident of succcess.  Douglass who read law with me came within two votes of being elected commissioner for Fairfield.  He was beaten by [word obscured].

	There was a discussion in the House the other day on Resolutions about Jeff Davis & General E.  I made a fine speech.  Willie came in just now.  He has a bad cold too.  He recd last night the Mountaineer that Hext sent him andall well at Home.  This was very good in Hext & thank him for it.  I was glad to see the Mountaineer on account of the fire.  Willie also recd a letter from Willie Beattie giving an account of the fire.

	Judge Bryan and his Court have returned to Charleston.  He had a great deal to say in praise of Fannie.  You have heard from her I suppose.  Someone told me she was to leave for Florida with Mrs. Glover the first day of December.

	I have written another letter to Woodward on impartial suffrage & given it to the Phoenix.  I expect it wil appear Tuesday morning.

 	I hope Hext, Hayne & Ben are going to school & studying well & behaving well.  hard enquired kindly after Hext the other day and hoped to have seen him in.

	There is to be [a] grand fairTuesday night.  I see Mrs. LeConte is at the head of it.  I have not yet seen her.  There are only two ladies boarding at NickersonsMrs. Fisher who was a Miss  & cousin of Mrs. John Ashe Alston and a yankee officers wife.  

	The political news is unimportant.  We are anxiously looking for the Presidents Message.  The idesa of impeaching Johnson has been abandoned it is said.

	I wish you would get Mr. Gr to mark two bags of acts of Congress in my office & put them on the floor in another bag & have them all marked To Theodore Stark Esq. Columbia.  Send them over to the depot to be sent down by rail Road.  Stark wil pay the freight in Columbia.  But wish two copies of each act kept out for me.  There are four acts or pamphlets & I want two of each saved for my use.  They are numbered 1860 & 18611861 & 18621863 & 1864.  I think there may be two copies of each on the floor.  If not, look in the bagsnot on the floor.  The court of appeals & the Legislature want them.  Have the bags tied up or sewed up before they are sent to the depot.

	I hope to be at home as soon as Friday & I hope to hear from you Monday night.  I suppose you have seen Dr. Hoke and his bride.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Col. T. Edwin Ware]

	You once said to me many years ago not to sue you on your note & that you would regard it as a debt of honor.  I relied on your promise & still rely on it.  But in times like the present I must ask you to secure the debt in some way.  I do not ask you for the money though I am greatly straintened in my circumstances & hard pressed.  I think you ought to secure the debt as you have that of others not older than mine or of a more sacred character. 

       Please call & see me.  I am with great respect, yours truly, B.F. Perry

	The girls have gone to the  Catholic Church with Mrs. Livingston & I will write you a few lines during their absence.  The Episcopal churches are all closed during this hot weather.  The members are out of the city.  Fannie & Mattie wished to see & hear something of Rom.

	I wrote you from Columbia & Fannie has written since her arrival here.  The dust & heat were terrible from Columbia to this city.  We stopped in Richmond & spent a pleasant evening in riding over the city.  Moore the friend of our lost Frank called to see us & I was very much pleased with him.  He is now a widower.  His wife died a few months since.

	We staid two nights and one day in Washington & spent the time very pleasantly.  I called to see the President with Governor Aiken, Gov. Bonham & Col. Townes.  His friend Col. Cooper told me he wished to see me.  But there were so many persons waiting to see him that our stay had to be very brief.  We then called to see General Howard who saw us very graciously & we had with him a very interesting conversation.  He is a remarkably fine looking gentleman cordial & rosy in his manners.  He talked about the Presidential Election with great frankness & seemed very willing  to be nominated, & I should not be sorry to see him the nominee of the democratic party.  In the evening we went with Mr. Long of Aiken to see Chief Justice Chase & I was pleased with him too, but not sufficiently  to vote for him unless forced to do so by the convention,  Chase has more brains than all the other candidates, is a states rights man & a democrat.  Whilst he goes for universal suffrage & general amnesty he wishes it left to the states to regulate suffrage.   He says we will soon control the negro votes in South CarolinaBrains & property must control labor.  I had an hours conversation with Chase & was much gratified.  

	Whilst passing the Ladies parlor in the Metropolitan in Washington Mrs. Simms recognized me & ran out & caughte me by the hand & said dont you know me.  I had to confess I did not!  When she told me her name I almost embraced her to make up for not recognizing her.    She has two lovely little daughters.  I went to see her the next morning to see her children.  Fannie & Mattie spent the day in running over Washington & seeing every thing.  No doubt Fannie has written you all about it.  Col. Childs, Mr. Hough & Mr. H were escorting them over the city.  I saw Miss Col. Tom T & her daughter, Mrs. Simms nieces &c.

  	I had the pleasure of making a good many acquaintances in Washington.  We reached here Thursday night & went to Madame F.  Mr. [John] Livingston had been there that evening enquiring for me & left a message.  In the morning I went to see him & he insisted on our coming to his House.  He has a noble mansion magnificently furnished, & is a most warm hearted, generous, intelligent gentleman.  We have five large& the whole house.  He has so far insisted on our taking our meals in the House & hiswish on abundancelemonade & ice water.  His family are all in the country except a son, sixteen years old, who plays beautifully on the Pi for the young ladies.

	At Madame Figlettes we met the South Carolina delegation & Mrs. Simonton.  General Hampton came after we left the House.  The Convention met yesterday, but did nothing but organize. I am to be one of the vice Presidents of the ConventionGeneral Hampton on the platform, Simpson on organization, [Martin Witherspoon] Gary on credentials, & Campbell Chairman of the delegation.  Aldrich, Gary, Simonton, Mullins, Furman, Farrow are also here.  Chesnut & Manning & Preston are not yet here.

	The girls went to the convention with Mrs. Livingston & staid until they got tired.  The weather is dreadful.  Last night they went to the fire works with the two Vann Wycks fornerly of PendletonMrs. Van Wyck is now living here.

	I have seen Shu & Donaldson but have not seen McRoy.  I also met Dr. F & his daughter.

	It is very doubtful who will be nominated for the Presidency.  Pengleton is ahead of all at present.  The nomination is likely to fall on someone else[W.S.] Hancock, Johnson, [Horatio] Seymour, [Salmon] Chase, [Thomas] Hendricks, though last not least.  There is a good deal of ill feeling between the friends of the rival candidates & they are as busy as bees in electioneering.  The South will be passive & take whoever is given us.  It is possible the nomination may be made Tuesday & the Convention adjourn Wednesday.  I have a great deal more to write but close with love to you & the children.  God bless you, your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

	The girls have just gone to the theatre with Mr. H & Frank Cox.  I will write you a letter & go to bed.  Last night I went to the great Democratic club know as Manhattan.  They had a most sumptuous entertainment &as six hundred present.  I did not leave there till after twelve oclock, & did not sleep well on my return.  They had all sorts of fishes, game, meats & wine.  The rooms appeared to be filled with bottles.  These New York people dont know the value of money & do everything in a most expensive style.  Think of their spending $100,000 on the 4th of July in fireworks & crockery!

	I met a great many pleasant gentlemen from all parts of the American Republic & amongst them two from the town in which Mrs. Bullen formerly Miss Ligon lives.  They had a great deal to say about her & made a great many enquiries about the Bs & Mrs. Rutledge & Mrs. Walter.  They said Mrs. Bullen would ask them about the South Carolina delegates & they wished to make their acquaintance on that account.

	Today the girls have been shopping with Mrs. fern.  I have bought two watchfor Willie & Hext, a pen for my office, fivedozen han[d]kerchiefs, ? dozen socks & vest.  But everything is very high & I will not purchase any more clothes.  I have carried yourto have mended.

	The convention met today & have adopted a platform which insures a Democratic victory.  It is one of the best things I ever saw.  We ballotted six or seven times for President, but made no choice.  I got the South Carolina delegation to vote for Andrew Johnson & General Hancock.  [George H.] Pendleton was ahead every time.  But it is understood that New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey & Indiana will cast their votes in the morning for [Thomas A.] Hendricks.  If so the Southern States will fall in & all the West will follow.  My impression is that Hendricks & [John T.] Hoffman will be nominated.

	I saw Collin Ferguson today, who enquired if you were with me & when he found Fannie was, he insisted very much that we should go home with him & spend two or three weeks in New Haven.

	The girls have had [a] great many calling to see them.  In the morning they are going with young Livingston, , Donaldson & Cox to Niagara Falls & return Saturday.  They will go up the Hudson in a boat as far as Albany.  By their return I shall be through with the Convention & my business here.  I have not yet had time to see any Publisher or book binder.  

	We are living here in great splendor at no expense.  Mr. Livingston is a most warm hearted hospitable gentleman & is very kind.  For one days board at Madame Fillettes I paid $27.50.  She is a South Carolinian & Mr. Livingston a yankee.  I rece[ive]d your letter last Sunday just after writing mine to you.  I commenced writing you again, but the girls came back from the Central Park & interrupted me.  I hope to be able to leave here next week & reach home in a week afterwards.

	I am anxious to know how Willie comes on this week with his Equity business.  Tell Hext he must read & study as I directed him.

	The weather has been melting & I am not disposed to move about.  We have had a little rain this evening & it is cooler.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to bed.  You will probably hear of the nomination before you receive my letter.

	You have by this time heard of the nomination.  I think it a good one & the nominees will be elected.  Last night there was a rattification meeting here of ten thousand citizens.  General Hampton, Governor Vance & myself addressed them.  I had made a speech the night before by invitation of the Metropolitan Club.  Everything went off well.  This evening [Horatio] Seymour makes a speech & also General [Montgomery] Blair.

	I intended to write you a long letter, but the girls have just got back safe from Niagara & driven me out of my room.  Two letters from you to Fannie have been rece[ive]d in her absence.

	I went to see Appleton & left my writings.  He is to look over them & give me an answer.  I was invited by Brady to have my likeness taken.  He has taken three different sizes but I have not seen them am tomorrow.  

	I have bought afor Perry Leaphart, & a shirtfor Hext today.  Miss Simmons & Mrs. B called yesterday whilst I was out & will call tomorrow again.  

	The girls are delighted with their trip but tired.  Miss Pamela wrote me to come to Mt. Vernon.  I wish to leave here Tuesday next, & get home Monday following stopping in Philadelphia & Washington.

	The mail brought nothing for you & no news of any importance.  I am very lonely, but getting on pretty well.  The Servants are doing well.

	George ought to be willing to give ten stalks of corn to keep the freshet from ruining his crop.

	Let Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell get through with his painting.  Dont make him do too much.  The house is whitewashed outside & it is not in good taste to have much painting inside.

I have no doubt of the result, not guilty.  But my clients are terribly scared.  I told them I should charge the $200.00.  Herrick paid me $40 & said he would pay the balance.  I made a great argument & have the Judge & Jury with me.  But all future is uncertain.

	I will ride out this evening if I can get time, but I am very much fatigued & had to leave the Court House as soon as I got through with my argument.  I went back however & heard Corbin out.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	    I expect you must be satisfied with your loneliness by this time.  I miss you very much, but we are getting on very well.  Lindy does well.  The cow is famous as a milker.  Easl[e]y said he would rather have her than the gray mare.  J S says he would have taken her at fifty dollars but it was Sunday & he could not buy her on that day.  She gives nearly two gallons at a milking.  Bill A declines taking Petros because I rented part of the land to Paris.  Paris will not move there & rent the whole place.  His father in law Bill Jones will cultivate a portion of it.  I am glad to get rid of free negroes as tenants.  Smith sold his cotton for $30.00 & wanted to avoid paying rent on a part of it which grew on land he cleared up.  I told him he must pay me one third & he said he would bring the money this week.

	I am willing for you to employ Jack as you mention.  But it is too much.  It is not true that anyone in the country will give $11 per month.  We can employ any number at $8 per month.  But if he takes clothes & pays for washing it will all be the same.
	No letters last night.  Fannie came down to see you yesterday morning & sent  at twelve.  Hayne went to Miss Elfords wedding last night.  Church crowded.  We are getting on very well.  But it is lonesome without you.  I send you the Greenville Enterprize with your notice of the Library Society.

	I send you two letters from Hext & his likeness.  Hayne went to the wedding last night at Col. Irvines & did not get back till two oclock.  He went in a wagon with John Marshal,  & other boys.  I am not willing for Ben to go to Trescotts.  The expense & weather preclude his going.  The thermometer this morning was 23.

	I have just finished my speech & eaten my dinner & will now write you a few lines.  Everything passed off well.  There was a crowded House & a good many ladies.  I spoke an hour & a half.  Wallace sat & listened very attentively, but did not offer a reply.  Nor do I think the crowd would have listened to him if he had attempted to speak.  I have only seen three or four persons who spoke of my speech & they were greatly pleased.  My friends here tell me that the negroes are taking no interest in the election & will not go out to vote as they did in the last election.  I now begin to think that I may beat Wallace.  But it will be a close race.  I am not at all anxious about it & in fact had rather stay at home than go to Washington.  I do not regret my campaign for it has been quite pleasant.

	A lady has just sent Mr. Duncan a candidate for the Senate to ask me to meet her at five oclock, as she wishes to consult me as a lawyer.  She was the daughter of John Bomar & is now a widow.  Her name I have forgotten.  So I may get a law case by being here.

	Tell Ben to have the watermelon patch sowed in wheat after working it up.  If the rye has not come up I would like to have it sowed over again if he can get seed rye.

	I have just returned from church & will write you a few lines before dinner if some of my Democrat friends do not call to interrupt.  I would have written you from Chester but every moment I was engaged.  Col. Hamilton gave me two letters from you & Mr. Stokes & at Union I wrote you by Ben and also another letter from Spartanburg after I had made up my speech there.  I had a fine meeting at Union.  Judge Munro introduced me to the meeting with highly eulogistic remarks on my past political course.  His daughter who was present invited me to take tea with them.  But I had to decline as I left that evening for Chester.  I called to see Mrs. Dawkins who shed tears at seeing me.  She thought I suppose of my itinerary with the Judge & it recalls his death to her mind.  She expressed great pleasure at meeting me once more & told me how much gratified she was at hearing of my nomination.  I went down from Spartanburg with my old friend Mrs. Herndon and with her a great deal of pleasant chat.  My friends at Union were quite enthusiastic & confident of success.  They were also at Chester & this place.  But the election depends entirely on the turnout of the party.   

	I was very much fatigued in going from Union across the boundary to Chester in a miserable hack.  Major  who nominated me in the Convention called to see me & carried me over the whole terrain & introduced me to every lady.  He is an old bachelor & a great.  It seemed to do him good to be with me in charge.  I came up here last night & Col. Hamilton will join me tomorrow morning.  Everything is working well here in Wallaces own county.  He is terribly scared.  I have met a great many violent secessionists, who are my most devoted friends.  All, everyone is delighted at my nomination, & say they desired me above all others, & that I am the only man who can beat Wallace.  I shall speak here tomorrow, Chester Thursday & Winnsborough on Friday & home Saturday.

	Your going to Aiken so soon surprised me.  But I am willing for anything tomy dear boy Hayne.  I love him very much & to him Ifor one who would distinguish my name more than I have done.  I pray to God he may be improved by his visit to Aiken.  My tears are flowing whilst I speak of him.  If he could only be restored I would make any sacrifice of property, fame, & ambition.  

	The military school marched by this morning going to church & I thought of poor Frank & Hayne.  The sermon was a good one.  I was introduced to the preacher Mr. Dickson & to Col. Coward the Principal of the military school.  Col. Wilson called to see me & said the Episcopal church was closed today as Mr. Johnson preached at Rock Hill.

	I hope to hear from you at Chester on Thursday after your arrival in Aiken.  Dont write any more politics or say anything about the election.  I hope Willie is engaged but I dont believe it.  I heard from him last week at Anderson.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

	I have just made a speech & eaten my dinner & will take the three oclock train for Winnsboro tonight.

	I had a fine large meeting at Yorkville & my speech is reported fully&in the Paper yesterday morning three columns.  Monday evening I went to Col. Rawlinsons with Col. Hamilton & staid all night.  He carried us in his carriage the next morning to Rock Hill where I made a speech.  Mrs. Springs sent me word at Yorkville that her carriage would be at Rock Hill to carry me to her House that evening.  I went with Col. Hamilton & spent the night & next day.  They were very kind & hospitable.  Springs is worth two or three hundred thousand dollars & Mrs. Springs & myself have made a match between her little daughter & only child & Ben.  She is ten years old, very sweet & pretty.  We are to exchange photographs of her & Ben.  I said Ben was to be a farmer & she said that is just what she wishes.  Springs insisted I should send Ben down to see them.
	I rece[ive]d your letter at Rock Hill directed to the care of Col. Cadwallader Jones & was truly glad you & Hayne arrived safely at Aiken, and that Hayne felt better.  This is my only trouble.  As to the election I care nothing about it though I begin to think I may be elected.  I saw Mrs.  Jones who was a daughter of Governor Adams & Emma Waters my.
	Col. Hamilton invites me to take tea with him tonight.  He made a speech at Rock Hill & exalted me most extravagantly & gave a history of my life.  I feel under great obligations to him.  I refused at first, to take tea, but he said he wished me to make the acquaintance of his wife & I consented.  I have had a most pleasant campaign so far.  Tomorrow I speak at Winnsborough [&] return home Saturday night.  I have a great deal to tell you when we meet.
	I begin to feel [Horace] Greel[e]y will be beaten.  Pennsylvania , Ohio & Indiana have gone against the Democrats!  But I will not despair of the Republic.  I have heard nothing from Home or Hext since you left.  I have made a great many friends here.  I do hope Hayne will get better.  A great many Radicals will vote for me.  Gov.

	I wrote you from Chester after making my speech there & then went & spent the evening with Col. Hamilton.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Hamilton who is really smart & interesting.  She said she knew me very well although I did not know her.  She had seen me so often in Greenville.  The Col. has been a true friend & done me great service.

	I left Chester at 11 oclock in the night & came to Winnsboro.  They were expecting me the next day & had made arrangements to receive me & escort me to my friend   where they wished me to stay.  But I preferred being at the Hotel where I could see everyone.  I made a long & good speech in the Court House which was well received.  Judge  a Radical came up & congratulated me.  In the evening they gave me a magnificent dinner.  One hundred of the first gentlemen in the county sat down to the [word faded] all made speeches and if you could have been present & heard all the extravagant compliments paid me by the different speakers you would have been proud of your husband. They complimented my firmness, my pol, my talents & ability & then commenced on my personal appearance & really made me believe that I was a noble looking gentleman.  They spoke of my wisdom  in differing from them on Secession &c.  I send you a Bill of Fare which Col. [James H.] Rion told me to bring home & let the people see how well they entertained me.

	Everywhere I was well received but Winnsboro beat them all, when in nullification terms I could not have got a dozen votes, for anything even constable.  I met my old friend Major Wardlaw, Col. inson, Col. Lyles, Mr. Campbell.  The parlor of their church & manymany others, who seemed delighted to see me.  I left about twelve oclock in the night & came to Columbia with [D.T.] Corbin district attorney.  He told me that he wished me elected to Congress & thought I would beat [A.S.] Wallace.  But it is very uncertain & depends on the turnout of the negroes.  If they turn out well I shall be beaten.  Although we have a majority of white voters, there are at least two thousand scalawags in the congressional district.  I do not think the negroes will turn out well.

	I think Willies election pretty sure.  He is in Abbeville & will remain there till after the election.  I hear very favorable accounts of his success there & in Pickens.

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed in not hearing from you last night.  I am anxious about Hayne & wish to hear as often as you can write.  When I do not hear I am afraid he is not so well.  I have not seen Fannie today.  She may have heard from you.  Susan told me she had not.

	In regard to the election I have only to say that Willie was beaten 107 votes by the patriotic people not turning out in Abbeville.  They acted shamefully.  Willie rece[ive]d 717 majority in Oconee, 330 in Pickens, 450 in Anderson & 182 in Greenville.  But Blythe rece[ive]d 1800 majority of negro votes in Abbeville.  Willie thinks of contesting the election.  At one box in Abbeville Blythe rece[ive]d 250 votes where there were no managers.  150 North Carolina rail road negroes voted in Pickens who were not entitled to vote.

	I expect Wallace has beaten me.  I got a majority of 1150 votes in Spartanburg, 650 in Oconee, 400 in Pickens, 461 in Greenville & 250 in Union.  But his vote in York, Chester, Fairfield & Laurens overcomes my majorities by two or three hundred votes.  But great frauds were practiced in Laurens & two hundred fifty Democratic votes were thrown out because they were on two pieces of paper.

	I rece[ive]d a letter this morning congratulating me on my election.  He said all the papers in Philadelphia announced my election.  He wants more money & I have sent him a draft for $100.

	If Hayne is able to do without you, I think you had better return home as I want to see you very much & the expense of staying there is very considerable.  Your aunt Mathews has been here three times to see Willie about money.  She says she is pennyless.  Willie gave her $20 yesterday & she came for $60 today.

	Ben is hoeing well at the Farm.  He bought a coat & pants for $10, went to church & looked very nice.  He has hauled all the corn & will finish shucking today.  Tell Hayne the corn turns out well.  We shall make & git from tenants more than 1000 bushels.  I rece[ive]d $250 yesterday in peas &which came in good time.  

	We killed a mutton last week & a pig today & I shall have to buy some bacon for the servants.

	I beg you, & pray that you will take the result of the election calmly.  I do not wish to go to Congress.  My health forbids me.  Willie is able to live without the solicitors office.  He has & will receive from his aunts a large property.  To be beaten by negroes is no reflection on him.  He rece[ive]d large majorities in all the white counties.  Indeed he rece[ive]d the entire white vote of all the counties except the infamous scalawags.  I am as well satisfied as if we had both been elected.  I am going to publish an address to the Democratic voters of this Congressional district & tell them the only way to control the negroes is to make them vote with us or not employ them.

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your long letter written Sunday.  I have also read 5 pages sent Susan yesterday.

	I am distressed that you worry so much about the Election.  It is nothing to grieve over.  I am better satisfied than if elected.  At one time from accounts rece[ive]d I said to my friends that I was afraid I was elected.  I am not [a] fit man to have a seat in Congress.  My health, age, & inclination all oppose it.  I wish to spend the remainder of my life with you at the farm, writing & reading.  The notices of the Press everywhere have been very flattering & show how much of representation I have made for myself by honesty, firmness, patriotism & talent.

	This is a much better legacy for my children than unprincipled success in holding office.  Willie has gone down to Abbeville this morning to contest the election.  Blythe only beat him [by] 107 votes and at one Box in Abbeville where there was no legal manager, the negroes gave Blythe 250 votes to Willies 8!  If this Box is thrown out Willie will be elected.  Moreover 150 North Carolina negroes voted in Pickenson the Rail Road.  Thirty young negroes under age voted for Blythe at Calhoun Mills in Abbeville.  But Willie is able to live without the office & his defeat gives him reputation.

	You are in Aiken & have nothing to occupy your mind.  Come home & you will be engaged in your household duties & have me to console you & reason with you.

	If Hayne can only improve in Aiken I will forget all my troubles & be thankful.  This is more so to me than everything else.  When I think of it I care nothing about office &.

	Fannie sends me word she rece[ive]d two letters from you last night.  We are all well.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. Hamilton last night.  He thinks of quitting the State.  I rece[ive]d a letter from the Atlantic Publishing Company in New York this morning wishing a sketch of my life & Photograph to put in a book of Eminent Men they are about publishing.

	I have nothing from Willie.  The official count reducing Blythes majority to 17 votes!  But let me beg of you to quit thinking, talking & writing about the election.  It is all nonsense to worry about it, & worry your friends.  Dont speak of it in Charleston.

	Your mother states in her letter this morning that she will leave Aiken tomorrow for Charleston & that you are much better.  You do not know my dear son how much I am gratified at your improvement in health.  This has cheered me for all the results in the elections.  

	Blythe has beaten Willie only 17 votes, & the election will be contested.  I think Willie has gone to Abbeville for that purpose.

       Your mother says you wish to hear about the Farm crop &c.  Ben has gathered all the corn 450 Bushels.  Johnson & Simmons & Calvin are gathering things.  We have ours& the shucks put up.  The crib is half full & will be full when we get our rent.  It holds 1000 bushels.  Ben has put up 11 hogs, to fatten & sold one for $5.00.  He went to Col. Ervins sale today to buy me a sou for a breeder.
       
       The rye sown the second time has come up beautifully.  The oats & wheat look well.  The cows are running in the bottom fields.  The sheep are doing well.  I had the weather [wether] killed for mutton.  Ben killed a shoat the other day for meat.
       
       Willie has got a nice.  Today Jack & Mallory are ditching, cleaning out the long ditch.   Jimmy cleaned out as far as he cultivates.

	I am concerned about your room & board.  Do not let them put you in a damp or disagreeable room.  Change your boarding House first.  Ask George Croft to look you out comfortable lodgings.  When you want money write to me & I will send it to youno matter what it costs!  You must be comfortable.  It might be well to engage board for the winter & you may get it cheaper.
	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother in Charleston, but she said she had written you.  I am in hopes that you will greatly improve at Aiken.  But you must write me a line or two, a half page every two or three days & tell me exactly how you are doing & feel.   
	Willie is at Abbeville court.  Hext wrote me the other day.  Fanny has been cleaning up the village House after Miss Trescott left.  Perry is quite well.  
	Simmons shucked his corn last night & Johnson shucks tonight.  Jack Jenkins day before yesterday.  Calvin has hauled his up.  Ben & Jack are now hauling corn from Jack Jenkins.  Tomorrow they will haul from Simmons & next day from Johnson.  The corn is turning out well.  The potatoes are half dug & put awayturned out well.
	The cows are now running in the fields & Zion minds them.  One of the sheep died, & we killed the weather [wether] for mutton.  I have had Jack & mule cleaning out ditches.  A pointer puppy came from Carson in Virginia to Willie yesterday by Express.  The charge was $3.90 cts.  It is a tan collor rather poor & almost perished, when it got here.  But Willie has no use for it.
	The elections are over & I suppose your mother worried you no little in talking about them.  I am better satisfied than if I had been elected.  Willie was cheated out of his election.  But it matters not.  He can live without the office & do well.  He is well off.

But take care of yourself, dont catch cold or be imprudent in your living.  Take moderate exercise in good weather.  Continue your cod liver oil.  I will send you a jug of whiskey by express this week.

	Your mother came back last night quite well and delighted with her visit to Charleston.  She says she got Mr. Glover to send you a draft for $50.00.  I will send you one whenever you ask for it.  Let me know before you get out of funds.  I will repay Mr. Glover tomorrow.  I know your stay in Aiken will be expensive but I do not mind the expences if you are benefitted by it.  

	Willie came back from Abbeville last night also, & goes down to Columbia Tuesday morning to see about contesting the election & to visit the Lula.  He bears his defeat well.  Your mother asked him about the news of his being engaged, & he said there was no truth in it.    There is none at all.

	Ben has been hauling corn & shucks.  We made 450 bushels & have got 250 from Simmons, only afrom Johnson & none yet from Calvinonly 64 bushels from Jack Jenkins & $27.00 in cotton.

	There have been two or three corn shuckings every night last week.  Johnson has had two & not done yet.

	Fannie & Perry are quite well. I left them just now at Susans with your mother.  She came in with me this evening to see your grandmother.

	The potato crop has turned out well.  The oats look fine & the wheat pretty well.

	I hope you get the Enterprise.  Give my respects to George Croft.  Write me soon.  We are all well.  Hext wrote me three days since.  He is well & hopes to be appointed to a position in the hospital.  The appointment is made shortly.

	Your mother came in with me this morning & Fannie has just been here with Perry.  There was a horrible attempt night before last to burn up your aunt Susans House.  The fire was put in a parcel of lightwood under the house.  Just before day the cows got in the lot & in driving them out Ben discovered the fire powders& cotton had been used!

	They have not as yet made any discovery of the incendiary.  Suspicion has fallen on one or two negroes.  One Alexander turned off at the depot, and the other a strange negro from North Carolina, who was cutting wood for Susan.

	Willie is in Columbia attending the Fair & looking about as to contesting the election.  He has to go to Walhalla court Saturday.  Ben staid last night with Lewis Moonwent to look over his place & see his crop.

	Grant is elected.  I give up all hope of our country.  Thepeople seem almost as bad & foolish as the negroes.

	Hext wrote us this morning that he was elected for two months in the Hospital.  

	Write me how you come on.  I was delighted to hear of your increased weight.  This is very encouraging.  Aiken may bring you out if you take care of yourself.  Let us hear particularly how you are doing in everything.

	I received a letter from you last week which gratified me very much.  I am so anxious about you & it gives me great pleasure to hear you are improving.  I also saw this morning a letter you wrote Fannie which likewise spoke of your improvement.  I had just written you a short letter enclosing a draft for $100.00 before receiving yours & your mother wrote you the day I received your letter.  I did not therefore write you.  I hope you rece[ive]d the draft.  Annie sent the letter you wrote to Mr. Glover to Fannie & I saw it this morning.

	Your mother went with me this morning to the village & we came back to dinner, as the day is very bad raining & cold.

	Willie went to Columbia Tuesday to attend the Fair & see about contesting the election.  He went from there to Walhalla court & will be back the last of this week.  McDaniel, Southern, Shumate, Wells &c. all went down to the Fair & returned Saturday.

	Fannie came to see me at my office this morning.  She & Perry are quite well.  Mine & your mothers likenesses have been sent to Fannie to keep.  Your mother was afraid the House might be burnt & said she cared more for the portraits than all the rest of the furniture.

	Ben is making himself very useful in attending to the farm & superintending the stock.  He & Jack were sowing & ploughing in wheat yesterday & this morning in the sweet potatoe patch.  The rain has stopped them.  Ben has had corn ground to feed the hogs with.  He has eleven in the pen fattening.  They are fattening very fast.  The cows & calves are looking wellalso the sheep.  The horses have not yet taken the disease which has broken out in Columbia & Charleston.

	I am going to clear the pine woods where Henry planted corn last year.  It will improve the appearance of the place very much & give us fire wood this winter.

	Willies Virginia pointer is doing well & is a beautiful puppy.  Bull & Alta &are all well.

	Hext wrote us that he was elected for two months resident Physician in the hospital & hoped to be continued. 

	Ben McDaniel is to be married tomorrow night & Vardry waits on him.  He marries Will Coxs daughter.  Lida McKay is soon to marry Williams and Alex McBee was invited to be groomsman.

	Your mother asked Willie about being engaged & he assured her there was nothing of it.  I am sure there is not.

	Take care of yourself & take your medicines & consult some doctor about your treatment.  Put yourself under his direction.  I hope to hear of your improvement & see you return in the spring a well man.

	You get the Enterprise & have seen my address to the voters of the Congressional District.  It has excited a good deal [of] criticism all over the state.  I see the Aiken Radical paper has been very severe.  I know [Henry] Sparnick.  He turned radical to get office like all the other scallawags.   Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

My dear Sir [Hon. J. Izard Middleton]

	I had the pleasure of receiving your very interesting letter this morning.  In regard to the centennial celebration of the Declaration of Independence I concur with you more heartily in sentiment & feeling.  In my address before the Medical College in Charleston last spring I used the following language What would the Revolutionary heroes  & patriots of South Carolina have said & done if they would have foreseen their descendants in less than a century, living under the government of their former slaves, carpet baggers & scallawags?  Would they not have paused on their rebellion, & said it was better to remain a British Province than become a sovereign State.

	But, my dear sir, the result of their patriotism & heroism, has been so disastrous to their descendants after the lapse of a hundred years, yet it does not terminate their glory or dim their virtues.  
We should feel as proud of their great actions & cherish their memories as dearly, as if the results had been different.  We must not think less of our glorious ancestry because misfortune has befallen us nor should we less cordially unite, in celebrating their patriotism , their heroism & their virtues.  The South has as much right to honor & boast of that Declaration of Independence as the north has.  The Southern people contributed as much to the success of the American Revolution, as the northern people.  One of them penned the Declaration of Independence and another one of their sons was commander in chief of the army during the whole war; and but for his wisdom, unerring judgement & unselfish ambition our independence would never have been achieved.  The Southern members of the old Continental Congress were the peers of any from the north in ability, eloquence & statesmanship.

	Why then, my dear sir, when it is proposed to do honor to the memories of these illustrious men, Southern men as well as Northern men, should we hesitate to unite in the celebration?  I am sure we love & venerate our patriots & heroes as much as the people of [incomplete]

	I returned home from Walhalla last night half past eleven.  We had a grand meeting fifteen hundred persons present & three hundred mounted on horses.  General Hampton, Col. Simpson, myself, General McGowan, Col. Aiken, Col. Cothran & Col. Wallace all addressed the meeting in the order of their names as stated.  General Hampton told me that he insisted to the committee of arrangements that I should address the meeting first & they replied that would never do as a great many persons would leave after hearing me.  The General said this was a very high compliment to me but a very poor one to the rest of the speakers.  They all say I made a good speech.  

	We all left after dinner at five oclock & took the Airline road at Seneca city.  Hampton & company stopped at Easleys station to go to Pickens this morning.  I came home.

	At Central Station a company of young men met us dressed in red flannel shirts to represent the bloody shirt of Morton & demanded speeches from all of usa few words were given.

	On reaching the depot Mrs. G was waiting to receive her beloved husband who had been to Montgomery.  She wished to know of me all about the Bellemont House & whether you & Fannie were staying there.  She goes on in a day or two to Philadelphia.

	I found all well at home.  Snyder had been dismissed & a negro had taken his place which I am pleased at.  I had ordered Henry to meet me this evening at the depot.  Ed Rowland sent me home & charged two dollars.  I have seen no letters or papers but will get them this morning.  I hope to hear from you & Fanny.

	I may go to Honea Path tomorrow to attend their great meeting, but it is uncertain.  I have written a speech for the occasion.  I hope you received my speech delivered at Walhalla.  Your centennial letter has not yet been published.  I will send you a copy when it is.

	You need be under no apprehension about any disturbance in South Carolina.  The Democratic party are gaining strength every day.  Judge Cook has come over.  Corbin will not vote for all the Radical ticket.  Earle says he will vote for Conner for attorney General & for General [Johnson] Hagood as Comptroller General.  He feels hurt at negro [Robert Brown] Elliott beating him.  The negroes in the lower country have fallen out with Chamberlain & say they will vote for Hampton.  I begin to think Hampton will be elected and I am certain of Tildens election.  

	You need not worry about Ben selling brick.  I wish he could.  He is going on burning another kiln & is making an engagement with Williams for 200,000 next summer.  He has brick on the brain.  The stable will not be built till next year.  As to our House we must consider well the expense before we begin.  I am not in a condition to advance any money.  Willie has none & I cant.  Think you have much at your command.

Hawthorn came in to talk about the negro meeting last night at Terry Edwards.  Willie & Ben and ten or fifteen white men attended the meeting & Hawthorn made a speech.  They got three to join Democratic club.  Whitner came in to talk about my praising Judge Cooks speech at Honea Path.  Nance came to show me his fine stallion.  Col. Spann to talk about his stealing Willies double barrel shotgun.  I told him I knew he took it, he was seen with it & to bring it back.  He denied of course.  Col. Croft called to know if there was any news about the negroes below Aiken.  Nothing further.

I send you one copy of my Walhalla speech today & tomorrow will send you a number of them just got in the Weekly Enterprise.  If you send one to Governor Tilden, you had better cut it out & enclose it in a letter.  Newspapers are never noticed.

	No northern mail yet.  I wrote you a long letter this morning and as my office is clear of company at present and I am at leisure I will write you again.

	There was a Radical meeting here last night, & Dr. Vance & Isaac Bryan made speeches against Tom Bryer &  Evins Radicals.  Speights was present also.  Bryer gave Judge Cook & Speights some hard threats.  He said the Democrats were always talking about the corrupt scoundrels in the Republican party.  We are trying to snuff them off as fast as we can.  We have lately got rid of one of the corruptist men in the Republican party, Judge Cook, & he has gone over to the Democrats!  I know Mr. Speights pretends to be a Democrat, but I have heard conversations between him & Judge Cook which showed that he was as much of a Republican as any of us.  This was pretty hard on Cook & Speights. In the Daily News Speights gives an account of the meeting, but says nothing about Bryers onslaught on him & His Honor Judge Cook.

	The office has been full again since I commenced writing.  Trappier, Hayne, Nance, Freeman, Pelham &c. have been in, talking politics & law.  Willie has just gone to attend to a case Freeman vs  Jennings.  He is trying to eject her from his house.  She wont pay rent & defies him.

	I received a very nice letter well written from John Perrys wife thanking me for my likeness & the pamphlet about dear Anna.  She says she will read it with great interest when she gets well, John has been sick but convalescing, & she is a great deal better than when I saw her.  She signs her name Burt Perry.  Burt is a singular christian name for a young lady.  I received a card addressed to my care from  Wylie, to Miss Emma Julia Blum.  He is coming to Greenville.

I have written to Mrs. Keith that I should not go for your mother; but that if she went, or her daughter went under the charge of someone else, you would take great pleasure in showing them the Exposition &c.

	I received yesterday a letter from Mrs. Lizzie R. Smith requesting me to write her a letter for publication in the New Haven Register explaining the Hamburg riots & the condition of South Carolina &c.  Mrs. Smith is the mother of the young ladies you saw at the Arsenal in Philadelphia.

	You must write me on the receipt of this what your mother & Fannie intend doinghow long they will stay in New York & when they will return homewhether they will stop in Philadelphia.

Forty thousand dollars would educate eighty students for one year.  The Charleston College, the Wofford College, the Furman University, the Due West College will answer for the present.

	I thank you kindly for remembering me, in so pleasant a way, of that important & happy event in our lives & which has resulted in having two such grandchildren.  I said to your grandmother this morning that I thought you Miss Emily the sweetest & prettiest little thing I ever saw; & that you master Perry was the noblest & most remarkable little boy, morally, physically & intellectually that I had ever known.  

	I have an abiding confidence my dear little grandchildren that you will both do honor to your grandparents & to your dear father & mother.  Would to God, that I could hope to see you both grown & settled in life.  It would be the crowning wish of my heart.  Your affectionate loving grandfather, B.F. Perry

Mr. Editor

	I am not surprised that the people of Laurens should be in favor of taxing themselves to extend their Rail Road to Greenville.  This will put them in connection with the Great West, by means of the Air Line Rail; Road, and enable them to get their bacon, lard, flour, corn, molasses, sugar &c. as cheap & as conveniently as the people of Greenville.  It will, likewise, enable the merchants of Laurens to sell all these articles, at as low prices as the merchants of Greenville now do.  Consequently, the whole of this Laurens trade which is a very important one at this time to Greenville, will be taken from Greenville & monopolized  by Laurens.  The cotton of Laurens will be sold at Laurens Court House, & the farmers & planters be supplied there, with their groceries instead of coming to Greenville for them.

	The extension of the rail road from Laurens to Greenville is a matter of vital importance to that county, but it will be a serious injury to the trade & commerce of Greenville.  Let the merchants of our city consider how many thousands, & tens of thousand dollars worth of groceries & dry goods they sell every year to the farmers & planters of Laurens?  How many thousand bales of cotton are now brought here from Laurens County every year?  This will in great measure all be lost to Greenville.  The merchants of Laurens, when not in connection with the West, by means of the proposed Laurens Rail Road, will be able to sell groceries as cheap as the merchants of Greenville & pay as high a price for cotton.

	In the name of common sense I would ask where is the necessity of having two rail roads starting from Greenville & running parallel with each other not more twenty miles apart at any point,  coming together at Newberry, not one hundred miles from Greenville.

	What the people of Greenville want is a road over the mountains.  The building a road from Laurens to Greenville will not in the least facilitate or aid this project.  Let the people of Greenville reserve their funds and taxation to put them in connection with Asheville, by the extension of the Greenville & Columbia rail road over the mountains.  We should not be so public spirited in building a rail road to injure ourselves & the city of Greenville.

	It is said that the amount each taxpayer will have to pay is a mere trifle.  These trifles in the course of twenty years will amount to something considerable; and we are now very heavily taxed for State, County, Rail Roads, public schools &c.

	The agreement in favor of the Laurens road is that it will be the means of putting us in connection with the West.  How building a road thirty six miles in another & opposite direction is going to do this I am at a loss to concur.  We already have a rail road to Newberry, Columbia & Charleston & let us extend that road over the mountains.  If the people of Laurens wish to connect their road with ours we are very willing for them to do so though it will injure Greenville.  But we are not willing to be taxed to assist in injuring ourselves.  B.F. Perry

My dear daughter

	Your mother & I thank you most affectionately for your magnificent present on the forty fourth anniversary of our wedding day.  Its value is greatly enhanced by knowing that it is the work of your own hands, a display of your own taste & ingenuity.  It is a beautiful cushion & whilst reposing on it we will ever think of our loving & affectionate daughter, who is endowed with genius, beauty & all the Christian virtues in an eminent degree.  I hope most sincerely that you & your most estimable husband may live to receive a similar present from our dear little Emily, on the forty fourth anniversary of your wedding, and that she may possess all her mothers loving dispositions genius beauty & accomplishments & be then as happily married as she is with a noble promising little son & a sweet beautiful little daughter.  Your affectionate & loving Father, B.F. Perry

Dear Father

	I have nothing special to write you more than what you see in the papers.  I think it probable that the Legislature will take a recess on Monday the 19th to enable those who wish to accept the invitation to visit Atlanta to do so.  I may go to Atlanta, but am not certain about it.

	I think Besss plan about the dam instead of the bridge on Mas road is exactly right, even if it should overflow the spring, which I hope it will not.  To raise carp properly there ought to be three ponds, and some time we might make another dam lower down.  So let Bess go ahead with the dam, but not cut down any more trees than absolutely necessary.  

	I think Croft or Hawthorne must have that note on Tutwiler which the postal from Yadkins inquired about.

	I think the Senate will pass the Registration law but the passage in the House is doubtful.  The House has passed the general Stock law, and it will probably pass the Senate by a light squeeze.  Last Saturday night and Sunday was spent by Mr. Crayton and me in the country with a Mr. Sims who was in the army with me.

	The weather is cloudy, and there will be rain soon.  I am glad to hear from Mas letter that Adaline will remain next year.  She is the best cook we could get and quiet.  Yours &c., W. H. Perry

P.S. Tell Fred to feed the fish.  I ordered another trio of Plymouth Rock chickens which ought to arrive about this time.

Dear Father

	I reached here without any accident or delay on Monday afternoon.  The Fair is going on and I will remain until it is over.  After that I have not yet determined whether I will stay to the Paris Fair which comes on next week or not.  I received a telegram from Hext, saying he hoped I would return via Philadelphia.  I do not think it likely that I will do so.  I have got out of the notion of buying stock.  Mules and horses are higher here than they are at home.  I saw a pair of mules at the Fair which the owner had paid $650 for, and expected to sell at a profit.  They were rather too high for me.  I have not priced any saddle horses, but they say a stylish saddle horse is worth or will sell for $400.00 or $500.00.  If I can find any at fair prices I may buy a saddle horse and two or three mules.  Tolbert a Kentuckian who trades to South Carolina offers to ship any I may buy, with his.  I will write you towards the end of the week, and let you know my probable movements.  I am well and hearty, happy and wtented and hope you are the same.  Yours &c., W.H. Perry
