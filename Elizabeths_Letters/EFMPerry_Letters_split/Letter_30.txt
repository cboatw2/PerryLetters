Letter 30

Monday morning, 27 May 1844
Monday night

My dear husband

	You have made me so uneasy by not hearing from you last night.   If I were not uneasy, I would be provoked, & would not think of writing to you, as it is, I am only induced to write, to tell you about Willy�s hat.  In this letter I will send you the measure of his head, which you will see is much smaller than the measure of his hat, which I gave you.  You may get a hat the size of the tape I enclose in this letter, but not any smaller, if you can, get it larger, but if not, I will be satisfied with one the size of this tape, which is the exact measure of his head.  I asked Willy when I commenced writing what I should tell you to bring him, he said, �tell Pa to bring me a pretty hat & don�t tell him I have been bad, tell him, I am going to try & be a good boy,� & Anna immediately said, �tell Pa to bring me a doll, & I�ll be a good girl.�  Frank I am sure will be pleased with the rattle, for he was delighted with my box of Hooks & Eyes this morning.  The Book of Pictures, for which you must thank Mr. McCarter, is quite enough for me, so now you must just get a trifle for Susan & Ann, & then that will do.  An invitation to Miss Sloan�s wedding came this morning, also one for Susan.   I expect everybody is invited.  It is Thursday.  I wish you were here to go.  If I can know of anyone to go with, I think I will go.  Susan came in to church yesterday.  John got Mr. Pinckney�s horse to draw with his.  It is a great inconvenience having such a horse as Plough boy.  Half of the time he is perfectly useless.  Only when Barrister is here can he be used, & Barrister is more than half the time away.  I think Barrister�s master is very fond of being from home, notwithstanding what he says to the contrary, for not, at this important time for electioneering, when Dr. Sullivan is getting far ahead  of him, he is at Columbia, wasting his time & his money.  I have not heard a word of the election since you left, but I know Dr. Sullivan is (as is perfectly natural) making the most of your absences from the musters, to secure his election.  How grateful he must be to you.  You are the first person I ever heard of, who tried not to be elected.  I cant conceive why you are a Candidate.  What pleasure does it give to be defeated.  Mr. Ware told you, you would have to electioneer.  That it was particularly important for you, & instead of that you are glad not to be here to electioneer.  Next Sale day such an important time for electioneering you will not be here.  I see in Columbia the Whigs as well as the Democrats are in favour of Texas, as every Southerner should be.  Have you read Genl Cass� letter?  If frightens me.  I hope you would not be one to bring about the state of things he mentions.  I see Genl Jackson is in favor of annexation.  You are a real Jackson man, so I know you agree with him there too.  Oh my husband you�ll not give me any uneasiness on this point, & if you have any regard for my feelings, though not for your own, try all you can to be elected,  I assure you if I was certain of this, I would be quite happy.  For with the love of such a husband as I have, with my children who are not worse than others, with my pleasant house & many comforts, I should have quite enough to make me happy, if your election was only certain.  But that is enough to make me forget all my sources of comfort, & I do feel very unhappy, when I think you are not even trying to be elected.  I am anxious you should be Senator, & if you had tried hard, I know you would have been elected.  I write you now all I think when you come back, I�ll not worry you about this subject.  I miss you a great deal.  I have no one to talk to.  I am too busy  to visit now.  When you come back I will go to see anyone you think I had better.  Margaret has been here several times, which has been some company for me.  Mr. Lester has been to the door several times.  Mr. Barclay was here a short time when he brought the pencil case.  Mr. Holcombe came to see me last Saturday.  Miss McBee sent word she was coming Saturday morning, but she was not able to.  She & one of her cousins leave for the North tomorrow with Pinckney McBee.

	It rained last night & a little this morning but not enough to prevent the servants washing.  I hope it will do good to the garden; we are now having Snap beans.  Our dinner generally consists of Hominy & Ham.  When you return I will add to it Cherry pie & Maccaroni.  Victoria gives so little milk.  Often we have not a drop for Franks tea.  When you return, you must buy a Cow, & not feed Victoria & let her go dry.  How useless Exception has been & what an expense, the Interest of the money she cost, & her feed would amount to a good deal now.  She certainly is an Exception to cows generally.

	I have not been to see your picture again since I wrote.  I am anxious to know what impression it will make on me the next time.  I saw Mr. Barlay as I was going to church yesterday.  I have not heard if he has any other engagement.  A letter came the other night from those same merchants in Spartanburgh.  At the top is a peice signed by Mr. Leitner as Notary Public, saying Mr. Folger appeared before him & testified Mr. Barclay owed him 37 dollars not a cent of which he had paid.  Mr. Folger in his letter says Mr. Barclay has returned to Spartanburgh very angry & declares he will never pay a cent of the bill, & that they cannot force anything from him.  They say since contracting this debt, they  have been cautioned by [a] gentleman in Columbia not to trust Mr. Barclay, & they beg you to hold him to bail, or assign to them the first painting he has.  Mr. Barclay I am afraid is not as prudent as he ought to be, for Mr. Watson showed me a beautiful peice of muslin off of which Mr. Barclay has bought a dress for his wife.  It is was 62 1/2 cts a yd, more than I could afford to give for a Muslin.  If he paid for it, I suppose he paid for it with some of the money you gave him, & which instead, he should have carried to Spartanburgh & paid as much as he could of the debts he owed there.  He had no right, though he might have wished it, to get a costly dress for his wife, & she has no business to wear it, when she knows her husband has not paid his just debts.  I hope you will never make me presents in that way. I am surprised at your buying books in Columbia.  I hope you have not gone in debt.

	A letter also came from Wesley Robinson, about telling the Sheriff to levy on some negroes of Hinmans & a Mr. Satterfield I think, brought a receipt for some money he paid in Pickens for you.  Mamma received a letter from Aunt Anna Hayne last night.  She says cousin Edward Finley was quite serious before he died.  He had been sick so long, he was prepared for it.  He read a great many pious books, & intended when well enough to make a profession of religion.  Aunt Anna says Capt. Beall has left Fanny, for his station, & she does not expect to see him before November.  She is now at Carlisle, where her grandmother lives, waiting the arrival of her parents.  So Aunt Anna says her cares have commenced.

	Poor Judge Earle was carried over to Pendleton the afternoon of the day he died.  His coffin was put in a box, & the box was on wheels.  I saw it as it passed. & felt sad to think that all that remains of him was contained in that box.  There were only two Carri[a]ges following. Mr. Mays & Mr. Henning�s  hack with Sam & Edward Earle & Mr. Maxwell I believe.  Mr. R. Duncan & Mr. J. Choice were on horseback, but I don�t know whether they went or not.  They set off after dinner & were to travel all night (it was moonlight) until they got to Mr. Mays.  Susan says when they passed her house, the horses were going fast, that she thought it seemed shocking, to pay so little respect to his remains.  I feel sorry for Judge Earle.  They say now he looked shocking on his return, worse than when he left, but everyone flattered him & told him they knew he would get well, when they knew he would die.  Those who saw him when he was sick, say it was a most awful sight.  Mrs. Holcombe says when she saw him, He was as white as chalk, perfectly cold, his eyes shut fast, his mouth half open, & blood coming out.  He was uttering groans.  There was a �tting in his throat, & he could scarcely get his breath.   He was unconscious of his sufferings.  I am sorry for your sake he is dead.  He was one of those, who you would take pleasure in associating with.  He will be a loss to his family.  Though in one respect I suppose they will be the gainers.

	I cannot but be uneasy at not hearing from you.  You have no excuse for not writing, for even when busy you can spare 5 minutes to write to me.  It is my only comfort when you are away.  Until Wednesday night, I will be uneasy, & then if I do not hear I will be miserable.  All this you could have spared me by a few lines, & besides you are not busy, for your cases are not to be tried.  Perhaps you are  on your way home.  You have served me shabbily, & the next time you go to Columbia, unless it is as Senator, I�ll not write at all.  I ruled these last lines with your gold pencil, & I will seal the letter with your seal, so you can judge of the Initials.  Anna is looking better than when you left.  The servants have not worried me much.  I intend to ask Eloise Butler next Saturday to dine with me.  I have seen her once riding.  She looked well.  She goes to school.  I shook hands with Mrs. Dr. Butler at church yesterday.  I would write more if I had room.
