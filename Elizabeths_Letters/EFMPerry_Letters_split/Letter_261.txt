Letter 261

Monday night, 9 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have just returned from Aunt Brewtons, & have only time to say, that if possible I prefer you coming down for me.  By next Wednesday I would like to leave here.  I think two weeks is as long as I ought to stay.  I do not intend going to Aunt Anna Turnbulls today.  If you cannot come, I will go up without you, but I have no time for more.  I received the money today.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I wrote you a few hurried lines last night on my return from Aunt Brewtons.  The 10 oclock bell was ringing, & the servant was waiting to put the letter in the Office.

	I received two letters from you yesterday, one enclosing Willie�s letter, the other 40 dollars which I thank you for.

	  I think the expense of boarding is too great for me to stay here longer than two weeks, so next�day I ought to leave, or at least Tuesday, will make it two weeks.  If your cases will not be called for before then, suppose you come down now, & when you return to Columbia, attend to your business, or cannot you beg the Court, in consideration of your wife�s waiting in town for you, to take up your cases at once, & then come for me.  I will be very glad for you to come, but if it is entirely inconvenient, then I must get Wm Ed Hayne to carry me to the R[ail] Road, pay my passage, & have my trunks marked, & in Columbia you will be ready at the Depot, to receive me.

	Uncle Arthur will be very glad to see you.  Alston Hayne also expressed a wish to see you, & all my relations I know would like to see you. so therefore there is not much to interest you here.  If you can with convenience come I would like it.

	I am to dine at Uncle Arthur�s today. He is to send his carri[a]ge for me.  Last night at Aunt Brewton�s I saw Mr. Pinckney Alston who asked after you.  Mrs. Julius Pringle is still in this house.  Mrs. Richmond Lowndes is expected today.  Her husband & family�.  She was a Miss Parker.  The company is constantly changing.  It is very private, & I feel quite at ease.  It is not so pleasant for you as the Charleston  Hotel.  You do not see so much company, & it is not known that you are in town, so you had better go there first & register your name.

	I told Aunt Anna Monday, I would let her know whether I would stay with her.  If she says nothing further on the subject, of course I wont think of going, & I dare say she will not, for as she has given the invitation, she feels she has done her duty, & I know it would give her trouble.  If she presses me as she did at first, & you are not coming for a long time, I may go, but I will let you know.

	Aunt Eliza invited me to take tea with her last night & Aunt Emily tonight, but I was engaged elsewhere.  I wish you would write every day.  I like to hear better, than when I am at home.  I long to see the children.  I suppose Hext has almost forgotten me.  I was pleased to see Willie�s letter.  I am glad Eliza�s children do not give way to grief, as it would distress me very much.  I am sure Missy feels it greatly.  Her loss is great to me.  I have not paid one cent for making my dresses for years, & now I have to pay 3.25 for one.  Washing the least peice here is 6 ? a peice.  It will be a saving another time to bring Clara to sew & wash for me.  My washing will amount to a good deal.

	If you do not come, you must write me word whether I shall get Groceries, & the Dinner Set.  I had to buy things to make me look genteel, & those who have shopped with me, think I have at least 500 to spend, & make me go beyond my means.  Hereafter I will shop alone.  Aunt Mary McCall said I must buy what would look well at the North , where they dress very fine.  I have not bought a great deal, but money in a City is soon spent, & yet very little to show for it.

	Mrs. Wilkes & Mrs. Perroneau called to see me yesterday, & Miss Drayton & her niece.  The servants are very careless, & even cards left, they do not show me, so I do not know who has called.

	As I wish you to look your very best when you appear in Charleston among a people who once abused you, you must provide yourself with a dress Sack Coat suitable for the season.  I wish them to see that you are a striking looking man, & as I am taken for a girl of sixteen, wish you to look of a suitable age for me.  If you can get a nice�Sack in Columbia get it there, if not here.  

	I will�write by return Mail, whether you will come or not, & when.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I wrote you already today, & will now write to send by tomorrows Mail.  I went up King st. this morning before breakfast, to shop a little.  It is the best time as from after breakfast until night, the streets are crowded.

	Today I am to dine at Uncle Arthurs.  Aunt Anna Turnbull also sent to invite me, but as I was engaged to Uncle Arthur, I had to decline.  Tomorrow Aunt Mary McCall has invited me to dine at her house just opposite here, at 3 oclock.  It would take a month at least to see all my relations & to return the visits paid me.  I have not seen Aunt Susan Hayne yet.  She lives very high up, & keeps no equipage.  Anna is now quite well, only bit by muskutoes, which as yet though are not very bad.

	You must write me, whether you can come for me or I must go up without you.

	I have not much to write now, as I have written already to you today, & I wish to write to Susan.
