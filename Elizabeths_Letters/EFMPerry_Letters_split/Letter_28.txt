Letter 28

Wednesday morning, 6 December 1842
Greenville

My dear husband

	Contrary to my expectations I am enabled to write to you today.  Margaret came so late this morning, I begged her to go away and come tomorrow.  She will be here the remainder of the week, so it will be impossible for me to write you by Sundays Mail.  I have just returned from seeing Mrs. Marion.  She looks wretchedly.  You say you always expect a death to occur before you return home, but you little thought one would occur in your own family.  Our old sou is no more.  She was found dead by the Market house this morning.  Mr. Hoke sent to tell me of it.  I enquired if she had been killed; (knowing how troublesome she was,) or had died a natural death.  He sent word he expected she died of�self, that she was very much swol[l]en.  He thought she must have been where they were killing hogs and eaten too much lights, that he lost one very suddenly a few days ago.  She has been such a useful animal to us, that I regret her death very much, and am afraid now even if we wish it, we will not be able to raise our hogs, for she was the only prolific sou we had.

	Susan and myself went last night to hear the converted Jew preach.  He was not as interesting as I expected, though he will be more so tonight when he will preach about the Jews in particular.  The Baptist church was very full.

	Dr. James Williams and Anna D�Oyle[y] are still in trouble.  Last week Mrs. Baker permitted them to see each other, but this week her heart is hardened, and she will not permit him to visit at the house.  James Williams the other night stopped the Columbia stage.  He had an idea that Mrs. Baker intended sending Anna to Newberry to the Dr. Croft�s, and that she was in the stage then.  I expect they will have to make a runaway match of it.  Old Dr. Williams says he will give them a home.  Perhaps he thinks marrying will improve his son.  The young man went to see Mr. Pinckney a few days ago.  It appears he wishes him to exert his influence with Mrs. Baker.

	Having written so lately, I have nothing to write about.  I do not think it is worthwhile even to send this letter containing so little.  I have visited very little since you left.  The Snow made the walking for such a long time bad.  It was impossible to go out.  Next week I intend to return my visits.  The weather is now warm and pleasant which will make us feel the cold weather when it comes again.

	I hope you are passing your time pleasantly, and you ought to, for you are now among gentleman more like yourself than those you are generally with.  Mamma wrote work to Aunt Eliza, that she had better let Susan come up and pay us a visit, that she could go to Columbia and come on to Greenville with you.  She forgot you were travelling in your buggy.  I know she will not come, but if she were to, she is so small she would not incommode you, and her trunk could come in the stage.  I am certain however that she will not come.

	Miss Pinckney came to see me yesterday morning.  The servants still do well.  I hope to receive a letter from you tonight, and to hear that Mr. Hayne is elected.  Dinner is coming in, so it is a good time for me to close my letter.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. I am ashamed to send so poor a letter, but hope you will be satisfied at hearing we are all well, except Ann who is still suffering greatly.
