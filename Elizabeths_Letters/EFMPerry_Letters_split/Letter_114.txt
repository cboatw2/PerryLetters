Letter 114

Tuesday night, 28 March 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will write a few lines to you tonight, as perhaps you may remain long enough in Anderson, to get this letter by the Mail, which I will be obliged to send it by, as I know of no private opportunity.  I write, because I think your mind will be more at ease, & your absence from home, you will bear better, if you receive a few lines from your Wife assuring you of the welfare of herself & family.  So I hope you will get this letter before you leave Anderson.  I will tell you now of all that has occurred since we parted.  Sunday morning, Susan came in, & the children & myself went to church with her, in her carri[a]ge.  I was glad not to use our carri[a]ge, for Jim thought it entirely unfit for use,  It was damp & muddy.  Mr. Arthur gave us a very good sermon.  Mr. Arthur met with me.  I spoke to a good many after church, who enquired when I returned.  We rode with Susan over to see Mamma, & then Susan came back with her children, & went up to dine at Mr. McBee�s.  Sunday afternoon I staid at home, & read to the children, & myself.  Monday morning, Susan & Ann walked in, & Ann staid here, while I went to shop with Susan.  In Mr. Beattie�s we saw Mr. Erwin Jones, who said he supposed you had gone to Anderson, that there was too little business for the other Lawyers to go, for if there was business to be got, you would get it.  Mr. Beattie & himself both said, that you ought to go to Court now, for other purposes as well as Law business, to see the people.  In the streets I saw Mr. Elford who was just setting off for Anderson.  I told him to tell you we were well, that I had not had time to write, & that he must bring me a letter when [he] returned.  In the afternoon Mamma said I must walk & meet them on the road, & bring home Anna, who had returned with Susan & Ann to dine with them, so I set off with Frank & Fanny, but not meeting them, walked the whole way to their house, where I found them just starting.  So I went in & paid a visit, & Susan walked part of the way back with me.  This morning Mr. Croft paid me a visit.  Soon after he left, it commenced raining, & has been raining pretty steadily ever since.  It is raining now.  Yesterday Jim cleaned the carri[a]ge , but he says, it does not look as well as it did.  He thinks it is so much injured it ought to be varnished.  It is a pity he did not clean immediately, instead of letting it remain damp & dirty so long.  Charles spaded the beds in the garden, that had not been spaded, & hauled manure.  Today Jim hauled Manure.  As soon as the weather permits he will plough.  Delia today seemed ailing, & said she had dreadful pain in her chest, so I thought she ought to be attended to at once, & sent her to Dr. Earle to prescribe for her.  He gave her a phial of Medicine, of which she is to take two teaspoonsful every day, & a box of ointment with which she is to rub the lumps in her chest & neck once a day.  He wrote word, her symptoms were Scrofulous.  So I am very glad I sent her to him, so that she may at once take what is necessary.  Willie has got head in his class.  He says there are about 27 boys in the class.  So I think the little fellow deserves praise.  No letters have come for you.  The Charleston Courier�s, the Carolinian, the Union, & Mr. Footes speech sent you by himself are all that have come.  I see by the Courier tonight, that the Model Artists have been exhibiting at the Theater in Charleston & have been treated with deserved contempt, by the press, the Ladies, & the Moral portion of the gentlemen.  I suppose, for it would only be the low & vile who would degrade themselves, by going to such an exhibition.  I have no further news of Mrs. Ru�, when she left Edgefield, she was barely alive.  The Doctors gave her�constantly to sooth her pain.  He saw her only once, & the room was so dark, he could hardly distinguish her, but he expected she was altered so much, that her friends would not recognize her, that the family were all in great distress.  Mr. Croft made me a pleasant visit.  He likes Mr. Bradshaw very much, says this was a hard hearted community, that if one was going downhill, all felt disposed to give a knock, that Mr. Bradshaw owed about a thousand dollars, that his school was worth to him 1500 a year, so in a short time he would be able to pay all he owed, that he had borrowed money to pay old debts, & also to send to an aged parent in Ireland, the part of the church money he had returned, that he wanted to put him at the head of the Sunday school, that he was a first rate farmer & gardener, & his wife had 7 children, & going to have her eighth.  Speaking of the Election he said, you would get all of Greenville with a few exceptions, one of which was Mr.Wa�, that your friends were doing all they could for you, but that you must do your best, & made assurance doubly sure, that Mr. Orr he heard would get all of Anderson.  Speaking of L.W. Barksdales cases, which he said you mentioned to him. He said you were right to defend Mr. Richardson when he asked you to, but he says Mr. Richardson ought to have whipped his servant well for his impertinence in driving against Mr. Barksdale.  He also said what I wish you would have heard, that Lawyers can defend cases, justly to their Clients, without hurting the feelings of their opponents at all; that it is their business to argue on the testimony brought into Court, & not leave that to abuse the Character of the opposite party, that when they do so, they are travelling out of the Record, for the characters of the parties have generally (though of course sometimes) nothing to do with the case, though there is no reason at all why you should hurt the feelings of your opponent, & when the feelings are so hurt, the person never forgets it,  but harbors a secret revenge, which he embraces the first opportunity of gratifying.  He says Judge Gailliard always made it a rule to argue with the greatest ability & success for his Client, yet without saying one word to hurt the feelings of the opposite party, insomuch as after gaining his case, the opposite party would come to him. shake him by the hands, & say �Sir we thank you for the manner in which you have conducted this case, & the very next case we have, we will give it to you.�  Mr. Croft spoke so sensibly on this subject, I wish you would have heard him, you might have profited from him, for on this subject my dear you need a lesson.  There is no Lawyer I believe who makes so many enemies as you do, & it may be that you travel out of the record, & deal in wholesale abuse of your adversary.  So for the future improve in this respect, & Mr. Barksdales cases & all others, keep to the testimony, & disdain all else, take Judge Gailliard as your example.  Men do not like to receive advice from their Wives, & you really go contrary, just to show they are not going to be governed by them. But in this instance the advice comes from a wise & loving wife, who has her husband�s interest at heart, so he must even follow it, because it is such wholesome good advice.  I hope you are doing the best you can in your enemy�s stronghold, better than he will do week after next in your stronghold.  Make as long a Circuit as you can, through Anderson & Pickens.  If you pass through Pendleton, if you can see Frances, & I dare say Mrs. John Ewing Colhoun will be glad to see you.   You must go to Bachelors Retreat & as many places as you can, & take care of yourself over the bad roads, & do not take cold.  Colds seem now so serious.  Mary Crayton has been very sick but is better.  Mrs. Hay is very ill.  I will leave this open, in case I have anything to add tomorrow.
