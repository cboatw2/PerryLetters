Letter 24

Tuesday night, 1 December 1842
Greenville

My dear husband

	Though quite late I have taken up my pen to write to you, for I am afraid I might be prevented tomorrow.  You will be disappointed in not hearing from me tomorrow night.  Margaret was here yesterday and the day before and kept me so busy I had not a moment to spare.  I sat up last night until 12 oclock working on my dress so you may judge how closely employed during the day I must have been.  She has not finished with us yet, but will come back next week for a few days.

	I received your letter, and was very much pleased to hear from you, and still more so when I think perhaps I was the only wife so soon remembered  by her husband.  I know Mrs. Townes
did not hear from her better half, and I am almost certain Mrs. Earle did not, for she was surprised when I asked her if she had written.  I rather think Mr. Cox is so much astounded at the novelty of his situation, and feels such a responsibility on his shoulders, that he has not had time to think of his good wife at home, and what husband do you think received two long letters written only two or three days after he left home?  I wrote you a long letter by George which he promised to deliver into your hands.  I think he seemed rather pleased to leave Greenville.  He said if he could not belong to yourself or Mamma he would rather not stay; all (except you) are fond of change; even when well situated, and George is not an exception.

	I suppose you are anxious to hear how we get along without him; why as far as I can perceive, we do just as well without him as with him.  The chief business of a man servant in winter [is] cutting up wood; James seems to get along with pretty well.  The stable perhaps may not be attended to so well; for George devoted his whole time to it, but I dare say it is kept in sufficiently good order, & the corn in the crib probably feels safe now, though I think that was only a suspicion of ours.  I do not know that I will regret it, if you decide Mamma had better not purchase him.  I am afraid I was too urgent, and that  you have been influenced by me (as you are more apt to be when absent than present) to decide against your superior judgment.  I hope however you followed my last advice, which you know generally comes after advising you strenuously on any subject, and have done as you thought best.  We have some difficulty making up fires in the morning, having no splits, but that has always been the case.
Today Mr. McBee sent a load of wood, and I took the liberty of asking the man to bring some wood that would answer for splits and he said he would.

	The servants have given me no further trouble than what I mentioned.  Eliza is now making Delia�s dress, and next week I think I will let her make up her childrens clothes.  I think Victoria does better than she did.  We seem to have an abundance of Milk; and yesterday I made two quarts of custard with cream.  I have been very neighborly to Mrs. Townes in sending her different things, and tonight she has sent me some Eggnog.  I have drunk some of it only; and the Brandy has got into my head.  Do not tell Col. Townes for the world, but do you not think he ought to take his name off from the Temperance Society.
	
       Some Fence Lumber was brought here yesterday, sent by Mr. Loveland.  I had no idea you intended building a new fence.  I hope it is for the front of the house, and the next lumber that is brought must be appropriated to the additional wings, we are contemplating for the house.
       
	Mr. Vicaes has put in the panes of glasses; and brought in a mallet to beat biscuits with. Col. Dunham has a sister here and neices recently from the North.  I saw the young ladies at church last Sunday dressed very fine.  Margaret says he is going to make them his heirs.  I hope they will be comforts to him.  I know of nothing new to tell you, except that the ground today and yesterday has been covered with sleet.  It is now melting.  

	I am really glad your accident on the road was not more serious.  You must be careful in driving.  Your horse is used so little I wonder it is not more fractious.  Your economical scheme well nigh proved a very expensive one to all parties, particularly to the members of the Legislature.

	I am afraid Mr. Hayne stands a poor chance of being elected, as he is not a good electioneerer himself.  Mr. Martin I suppose will try his utmost, and Mr. Rhett also.  Cousin Isaac Hayne I believe is not coming on until January.

	You must not forget to buy a bell for the dining room.  I think you had better also get one for my chamber.  It would be the greatest convenience, so get two bells for ourselves; and Mamma says she would like you to get one for her.

	Ann is still suffering a great deal and sleepless; she has exerted herself and taken exercise, but it has not prevented, or alleviated her sufferings.  The rest of us are well.  Willy makes me read what you said about his horse in your letter.  He thought of course you had written about the horse.  Today I mentioned your name to Anna; and she looked around the room, and out of the window for Papa.  She is as pretty and interesting as ever.  

	You see I have bought pen & paper & charged them to you, only 18 ? cts, half quire of paper for 12 ? cts, a dozen steel pens & stick for 6 1/4 cts.  It is now quite late, half past ten; time you will think to retire.  I will leave my letter open and perhaps add a few lines tomorrow.
