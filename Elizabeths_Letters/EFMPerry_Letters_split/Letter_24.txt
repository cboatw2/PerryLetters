Letter 24

Friday morning, 9 December 1842
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have a few moments to spare from Margaret, and will devote them to writing to you, as this may be the last letter that I will write, as you may leave Columbia in a few days.  I wish to mention two commissions I forgot in my last.  One is that you will get some Leads for Susan�s Gold pencil.  They are so small. I know they cannot be procured here, and without leads the pencil would be useless.  The other is that you will get a prayer book for yourself.  You had said you would get one, but I think you may have forgotten it.

	I was very much pleased to receive your letter on Wednesday.  When I read that you hoped I had received the pencil case by Col. Townes, I was frightened, for he had sent me the letter but no pencil.  I instantly sent over to him to know if he had it.  He sent it over by Delia, and said when you gave it to him, he put it away safely in his pocket book, and never thought of it again.  In a few moments he came over, and apologized for his neglect, and I told him all the news in your letter.  He was anxious to know about Cauble�s case, which you had not mentioned.

	I do hope Judge Huger will be elected.  If you were only in the Legislature, you would vote, and do so much more for him than you can now.  Dr. Crook says if he was there, he would get his vote; that he hopes he will be successful.  Those Rhetts are so ambitious.  They ought to be disappointed, and Col. Davie I think is very presumptuous.

	I am so anxious to hear of Mr. Hayne�s election.  I wonder you have not written me of his prospects, when you know I was so much interested on the subject.  Aunt Eliza says he went to Columbia sanguine, and even she had permitted herself to be hopeful.  I suppose it is decided now, and that he now has better certainty, instead of trying suspense.  Willy will be delighted with his horse.  You are fortunate to have found an opportunity so soon of bringing it home.  This morning in bed, he said he wanted to see Pa.  Susan is with me, and thanks you for the pencil.  We all think it very pretty.  We have been fortunate lately in receiving presents.  Dr. Irvine brought a package from Dr. Wurderman, containing four books for Mamma, Susan, Ann & myself, and a little box of old coins for Ann.  I was gratified at being remembered by him, and think it was kind & thoughtful in him to think of us.  He has now left for Cuba, and wrote that his health had failed so rapidly for eight or ten days, that he left Charleston with less regret than he otherwise would have done.  Yesterday Anna received a present from Frances Marion, a pretty little chain, a pretty little one.  The day before, Mrs. Smerdon told me she never could return my kindness to Mrs. Marion, and I suppose to show her gratitude, she sent the chain.  I was very much pleased at it.

	Mr. Simms is really complimentary to Ann at his wife�s expense.  I wish his cold water remedy could benefit her but she does not get better, through as she is able to ride, and sit up and take exercise, she is not as bad off as she was last winter,  Mamma has just sent word that she slept last night.   I think when sleep returns to her, she will then recover.

	I have stopped writing to read the Mountaineer, so I see the contest for secretary of state lies between Mr. Pinckney and General Jones, and it is decided before this.  I am very glad to hear you are so complimented on your good looks.  I think you are altogether indebted to me for your improved appearance.  As soon as those tremendous collars of yours were clipped, a marked change took place, and ten years seemed taken from your age, but your improvement is not altogether owing to the collars, but also to the happy life I have led you, for you look younger than when I married you.  The old Bachelors life you led would not have agreed with you, for as soon as you became a husband and father, an evident change took place.  If you would get a nice little sc�toh to cover that exposed spot on your head, I think you would be still more improved, indeed it would be the greatest improvement to you, you can imagine.  I would then be perfectly satisfied, so for my sake if your can procure one that will answer well, you must get it.

	I would like you to bring Ann three or four oranges.  Remember only three or four, if you conveniently can in your trunk.  I am almost afraid to make the request unless you should waste your money and bring more.  But I hope you will only bring a few, & those few only if it is perfectly convenient.   

	Not knowing the state of your funds, I may have been unreasonable in the number of my commissions, so I leave it to you to leave as many unperformed as you choose.  As I have kept you informed of Anna D�Oyleys  love affair, I must tell you the result.  Mrs. Baker has had her way, & she has refused James Williams.  Report says Mrs. Baker whipped her, but I can hardly believe she went as far as that.  Altogether I think it has been a very disgraceful affair, and quite uncommon for Greenville.        

	I hope this evening to receive a letter from you.  I must now close.  I have written a newsy longer letter than I expected to when I commenced.  Susan sends her love, and said she needed nothing to keep you in remembrance, but if she did, your present will bring you to mind & almost every moment of the day.  It is such a useful as well as pretty one.

	Mrs. Earle went home last Monday, but her mother expects her back again in a few days.  She was at church last Sunday.  Mrs. Carson is coming tomorrow to stay with her mother.  I saw Miss McBee a few days ago.  I suppose you have seen Mr. Carson.  I think Miss McBee said he wrote word that he was going to take a ride with you.  I should think you would find it pleasant having your buggy in Columbia, and I dare say you have plenty of time, not being in the Legislature, to ride.

	There is no news, nothing at all to relate, we are all here quite well.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

P.S. The servants still do well.
