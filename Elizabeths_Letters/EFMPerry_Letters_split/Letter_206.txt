Letter 206

Sunday morning, ? past 10, 2 May 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just sent off Anna, Fanny, & Frank to Church, & before I read to myself, will perform my duty to you.  Yesterday was May day, & getting ready so many children, Mary being still sick, & having to do it principally myself, fatigued me & gave me a headache, which though I partly slept off last night, I still have a little left & preferred staying at home this morning & resting, & go to church this afternoon.

	Dr. Crooks went to his farm Friday morning & said he might not return soon as he might find more of his servants sick.  I think he must have done so, as last night he had not come back.  Mary is getting better, & comes down into the kitchen. But she has not come into the house yet.  This put me to great inconvenience, so I live in great discomfort & make me reconciled & even pleased you are not here & I would rather live as I do than [to] have Minerva back again.  Since she is away, the other servants do better.  This morning while Lindy was fixing the house, Edward made some biscuits, & Eliza washed the dishes.  A general happiness has been diffused throughout the household since Minerva�s departure.

	Yesterday I received no letter from you, which disappointed me greatly.  This morning before I was up, Mr. Duncan sent you packages, & after breakfast when I sent to the Office a letter of yours came, which I expect I ought to have received yesterday, as it was written before the one Mr. Duncan brought.  I suppose there was some carelessness in the Columbia Post office.

	I will have scarcely room to tell of May day.  Frank was at the School House all day, until 10 oclock at night, looking at the Tableaux & eating.  Very different from last May was this, for everybody I hear had plenty to eat.  Frank asked this morning how long it would be before May day would come again, so he must have enjoyed it.  Anna also did.  She returned home in the afternoon. Dressed anew, went back again, & staid until 10 oclock at night.  The little H� I think had very little pleasure, their poor little feet had to paddle along so fast, they were quite worn out.  Fanny dwells on the �ness of the Queen, who said she wished she had a stick to make them go faster.  The Queen if she noticed us, must have been mortified at observing our attention was entirely on the H�, not on her.  Her iron rule it is well bestowed only for a day, & her subjects were rebellious, for they would have the Tableaux, which she objected to.  I looked at them from the carri[a]ge, did not go into the schoolyard.  All of the Marshalls walked, so Hocky was not used,  Rudd strutted about in a cocked hat.  The sun was so hot, it was enough to give them all fevers.  Hext was out, & looked sweetly.  I am glad the Convention adjourned in harmony.  I wish your resolutions had been adopted by the whole, but they paid you more respect that Mr. Memminger.  I long to read the account of the Convention in the next Patriot.  I read your Editorial this morning, & sent it to Mr. Elford with your printed Resolution & Mr. Greggs.

	You must be sure & have your likeness taken, for without these the life is far less interesting.  You must stay in Columbia for the purpose if necessary.

	I recollect in Columbia the servant at Maybins saying Mrs. Hemming a widow kept a boarding house opposite.  I suppose it is her son Miss Walker married.  I thought when she kept school she would meet with someone, as schoolteachers always manage to make a match.  As she is so unpleasantly situated at home with a stepmother. It is a providential thing for her to get a husband.

	Mr. Burketts business being of less interest to me, than your  own,  I did not mention it. as I had not room for all, but I have opened the letter now, & will tell you what is in it.  Mr. Verner says he obtained a note on Mr. Hunnicut for 4 dollars, at a Muster, which he agreed to have paid in the fall; that Mr. Burkett says all are well & progressing at the Farm.   The Corn short 40 bushels, Lard 50 lbs.  Shucks one load which he paid for himself, which amount can lie, until he has some settlement about the notes in his hand for collection.  The country generally healthy.  One of the Mares at Burkett has a fine mule, & something about R� Susan Perry was here.  Friday, her Grandmother had toothache�  A letter came this morning about some change in Post office & one from John C. Sullivan about some Law business.  You must try your best for the Paris� not to get a new trial.  Mr. Luther I am afraid & Susan never can be happy.  An un� wife wife perhaps might be able to resign herself, but no other.  What do you think of his sitting down almost naked to breakfast only in his shirt, & going over the house before children & servants, & strange servants in that condition.  Vardry even asked if it was right for Pa to come down naked.  He is still harping on the Joyce estate.  Mr. Hoke told him the estate was 160000 dollars, & he had given security only for 20 .  Mr. Luther told him he could give security for 500000 dollars.  Soon after Mr. Joyce died, old Mr. McBee sent for Mr. Luther to go to see him, & when he refused to go, sent again, & Mr. Luther went, & on his return home Susan asked him for what he was sent, & he said to talk about Mr. Joyne�s will, so Susan thinks his father put it into his head to try & get it.  You know he persuaded him to run for Ordinary, an Office he was entirely unfitted for.  So if this is so. You make old Mr. McBee give security to you, that you may not lose.  Pinckney is not as bad as Mr. Luther & is better off.  He has carri[a]ge, buggy & 3 horses.  

	Tell Willie when he returns I am going to have a May day in the orchard, so he must bring me a pound of cocoa nut & one dozen nice oranges.  This will do instead of any presents for the children.  Anna will be Queen & he must deliver an address.  It will be pleasanter than the Academy May day.  I have come to a close.  Hext is now playing on the floor. E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
