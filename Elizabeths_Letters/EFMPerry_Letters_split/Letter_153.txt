Letter 153

Saturday night, 30 March 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		As you will be disappointed if you do not have a letter from me tomorrow I will write you a few lines, but I have a shocking pen, & am very tired.  I invited some company for the children here today, Mrs. Pearson & a few others.  I have been on my feet all day, as I always have so much to do myself when I have company, & as usual it has fatigued me.  I have written a few lines to Mrs. Sharpe to send along with the shoes., & if I have time I wish to write to Mrs. Duboc.  

		I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, but I am sorry you made no mention of having received money from Mr. Norris, & nothing of Mr. Dickey�s case.  I expect as you have left it to Mr. Norris� generosity to give you what he thinks right, he will give you nothing more.  I am afraid there is no chance of your being appointed a Delegate to the Nashville Convention.  I would have like that  you should even if you had declined going in case the first nominated declined going, would have gone in your stead, but you have no ambition.  That is your failing & in that lies your bad success.  When a man wishes, & is determined to gain what he wishes, he is certain to succeed but you are too lazy sometimes for exertion, but I will not dwell on your faults.  

		Reuben & Charles have ploughed every day since you left, & will finish the Oats sometime next week.  The fence is you mention being down is up now & Reuben does not know who would have taken it down.  He did not see it down.  Charles has finished the Stable & has been cleaning the yard.  Jim has made the Arbor in front of the house in the garden, has finished the Chicken pen, & made the fence by the Stable.  Next week if there is Lumber enough he will make the pig pen & Cow Stalls.  He says Mr. Hooker has hired two hands, & said nothing more to him, but I hope when he has finished here, Mr. Hooker  or someone will hire him, but when you can, you had better sell him, for it is very troublesome to keep servants to hire.  In your travels you ought to look out for a purchase for him.  900 I should think you would get, at any rate 850.  I would be glad for you to have a note for that amount.  Jim has made a step to Anna�s house & a fence would�separating it from the servants yard..

		Eliza is sick in bed today with pain in her back & side.  Monday I will go in the garden & direct Charles what to do there.  The garden needs some attention now.  Wednesday night we had a heavy Snow, & I am afraid the fruit is all killed.  One of my large wild oranges was broken down.  We have cold weather & cold nights now; it is unfortunate, our winters are mild, & our Springs cold.    

		Yesterday was Good Friday, & Mamma & myself Willie & Frank went to church.  Mr. Leary gave Holiday.  There was service again today, but I did not go.  Mr. Arthur for several mornings has had Sunrise meetings, to stir up his congregation, but I believe he has not stirred up many out of their beds.  Even Mr. Leary said he would not go, & Mrs. Pearson said she went with the greatest exertion.  I am sure if I was to go, my household would be put in entire confusion. 

		The Ware�s dined here today, & Sally Crook.  Sally says Mr. Davis says, he has enough to support him without teaching that he teaches because he likes it.  I am glad to hear that Susan has given Anna a pretty doll, which has made her very happy.  I have been dressing it for her, & it will teach her to work.  Ann has been suffering from Calomel.  She took rather too much & not enough medicine after it, & is salivated & Mamma says her head feels as yours did.  Her mouth is sore & bleeds.

		Edward says Mrs. Mooney sold his home because he is in debt, that himself & Mr. Dyer get very little work to do, are sometimes weeks without any, but they manage to keep him employed, but Edward is not infallible authority, so I would not mention what he says.  		

		Mr. Cox & Mr. Griffin are exchanging homes.  I know of no news to tell you, except to church I have not been & at home have only�.  The children are well.  Willie rode on his colt today & it did pretty well, did not throw him.  Fanny talks about you, & what she will buy with the money you will bring her.  Anna has gone regularly to school.  Willie & Frank Wednesday staid at home because it rained & they have colds.  I hope Mamma will dine with me tomorrow.  I thought I would have had things left today, but all was eaten.  I am glad you sleep well, for that contributes a great deal to ones feeling well.  I hope your face when you return will be of its�.  At Pendleton last summer I saw some Smiths related to Mrs. North.  One of them lives with her.  Perhaps it was one of them that inquired about me of you.  Judge Withers I think must be quite trifling.  He seems to be a great talker & I thought�in his remarks the evening he spent here.  Susan told me Mary Creyton was trying for Mr. Campbell.

		I will send your letters & papers along with this letter, such papers as you have not seen, only one letter has come.  I hope you will come back with plenty of money, at any rate enough of the Tugaloo	 estate to pay you what it owes you, & you to pay all the Rail Road then after that.  I wish you to send for Groceries, which we now greatly need, then get a new carri[a]ge for me  to ride more comfortably in, & then get a Piano, & furnish me with a generous supply for�, so you have a good deal to do.  Write by someone coming back before you leave.   I expect he now has been as ill as said in the papers.  I was never uneasy about him.  I can�letter up.  It wont do to be bound.  It is written too badly for Mrs. P� & Mrs. Williams to read.  Hetty D�Oyley has gone to Aiken to Mrs. Theodore Crofts who has been very ill.  Your�, E.F.P.

Though I forget to tell you, you must not leave Pickens until all your business is finished.

My dear husband

		I have time to write only a few lines.  We are all well.  I send a Carolinian.  You will see Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore is appointed Senator.  The Governor has been cunning.  He says he need not serve more than this Session.  Next winter he can return to the Bank, & I suppose he himself take his place.  I send a receipt for money Mr. Dill begged me to give you, to collect money for Mr. Farr.

		Mr. Arthur has a daughter, born only 2 hours after Mrs. Thomas arrived Saturday evening.

		 I went to church morning & afternoon yesterday.  Mr. Arthur preached on the love of the world, going to Theaters Balls &c.  I am sure in Greenville, there is no theater to go to, & so few Balls, one is not tempted to show their love of the world in that way.  I think Mr. Arthur loves the world as well as anyone.

		I called in Edward & told him about the flower.  His behavior I will tell you of when you return.  I hope you will gain Dr. Andersons case.  Miss Greens was certainly the most unjust decision I ever heard of. 

		You must think of what I said about offering for the Legislature.  You certainly ought to be there next winter when the important Banks question will be discussed.  Do not wait to be asked; come forward yourself.  People are too selfish to think of you, if you do not yourself.  I promise you not to worry you on the subject.  I think you will if in the Legislature be elected Speaker, & then I will be gratified.  

		Jim is building the low�.  I long to see you.  I was prevented writing this morning, & now the Mail is about closing.  I will  have to stop.  


		Only one letter came last night from Mr. Squier, asking you to collect Tom Butlers & Butler Thompsons money due him.

		I will write a longer letter next time.  Adieu.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		To prevent your being disappointed I must write, but I really have nothing interesting to write about, but I must try & think of something.  Today it is raining so not much can be done at the Farm.  They intended planting Corn today, but the weather being bad, Reuben is hauling Manure.  I told Charles to cut�for the Peas, but I do not know whether he will.

		Jim has been working at the pig pen & cow stalls ever since you left.  He has not finished them, says he has not enough to cover them with.

		I do not like to dictate to you, but it seems to me when you can get what you think his value & a good price it would be well to sell him.  I think he is worth a great deal, for he is so smart & capable that will a strict owner, he would be invaluable, though to you he has been of little service, but I am willing to take 800 though would be glad to get more.  The interest of the money added to the principal would be more than he makes for you, deducting his expenses, risk of losing him, & his unsteady way, but I wish you to act for yourself
