Letter 81

Friday morning.  You must be sure & pass one night here.  If you cannot come for me to go home, you must come one night during the week.  You know I am to leave here tomorrow week.  I am not going to worry you about the election, if you will only do your duty.  Mr. Orr is so far inferior to you, that if it had not been for these cases, & the influence of Genl�Jones, which is great. & the extensive connexions Mr. Orr has in Laurens district through his Wife who was a Marshall. I would not have been uneasy.  You have not the advantages which he has, in being connected with so many families.  You have so many enemies made by your Law business, which he has not.  You have your merits alone to depend on, & that is the last thing people think of.  I will conclude by saying, I long to see you & love you dearly.  E.F.P.

       If you do not come for me, or do not come at all, write word what house I had better stop at on my way back.  I am inclined to stop at Mr. Barksdale�s where I stopped coming here.  It was so comfortable, or at his brother�s six miles from him, who you have offended, but I hope the cases will be conducted so fair & honorably, that he will change & become your friend again.
       
       If you see the Mr. Barksdale I passed the night in coming here, speak to him, he seemed a good old man.  I do not know his given name.  I thought it was Allen, but Mr. Cunningham says Allen is the name of the one Mr. Richardson drove against.  I expect Jim will stay with him when he comes back, & you if you see him, can pay him or as we go back, you can pay, or I if you are not with me.  You might be friendly also with the other one I should think & explain that he should not be opposed to you, for what is not meant as unfriendly on your part.  Since I have heard Genl C. Jones is such an influential dangerous man, I wish you could have made him your friend again.  I staid with him hitherto.  Now I have expressed all my thoughts I feel easier.  Mr. Cunningham says he has always given you four fifths of Laurens D.  He had no idea until lately, Mr. Barksdale�s cases were to be of so much importance.  He says there is not a more influential family in the whole District.  He says Mr. Orr will make exertions, & after the Canvass commences, you must also.  All knows you to be the superior man, but various motives influence men, & they vote often for those qualified,  but to�revenge & other�.

My dear husband

	Though My letters I believe cannot be very welcome to you, containing so much bad news as they do, still I feel that I must write to you again, to give you more information respecting your prospects, & our personal welfare.  I never felt so uncertain of your thoughts, acts & concerns, as I do now.  It is so long since I have seen you, & you have been to so many different places, since we parted & perhaps been through many trials, & also without being able to inform your Wife, & let her know what is going on, & how your affairs are proceeding.  I feel that this is an important week with you, that your words & actions this week, will lead to either good or bad results. So I beg you will be useful, while performing your duty, to do nothing unnecessarily to prejudice others against you.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow when I believe the mail comes from Laurens , & that I will then know all that has passed since we parted, & what your plans are, what time you will be able to come here.  We are all quite well, & I have been passing my time very pleasantly, as I always do here, for I consider this family as our best friends.  I believe I like them the�I know of them.  Mr. Cunningham seems a perfect gentleman, honorable & good hearted in the extreme.  It is under the influence of �[word illegible] that he would act imprudently, & he is a sensible man too.  I have seen more of him this visit, that I ever have done, & I like him more.  Mrs. Cunningham I have always liked, & Pamela too, I have a great regard for, indeed we may put them down as our very best friends.  Mr. Cunningham told me one day, that Mr. Quin said, he heard the R. Road question would be brought forward in the Congressional Election.  Mr. Cunningham said he did not know if it would be, but if it was it would not injure, but on the contrary benefit you, for Laurens & Greenville of course would go for you  in that question, & in Anderson only Mr. Orr would be sustained on that question, & in Anderson where Mr. Orr has always lived, & represented it, of course you expect to be beaten..  Pickens I suppose would take no interest in the matter.  The Aiken route Mr. Cunningham is certain will succeed, when they get a charter, because it will pass through so many districts.  The subscription for building the road can easily be obtained without any aid from the State.  He will subscribe 10,000 dollars.  In this neighborhood Mr. Cunningham says, there will he thinks be very little division in the support you will have.  Mr. George Anderson who keeps the store at Waterloo, married a Smith, & the Smiths are connected with the Marshall�s, the family into which Mr. Orr married, so he & his influence he thinks, from what he has heard him say, will go for Mr. Orr.  I had no idea Mr. Orr had so many connexions.  Mr. Orr�s vote will be principally with the families with whom himself & his wife are connected, & from the families who you have had Law cases against.  You have been a great help to him.  You never could have done him a better service, than taking these cases against Mr. Barksdale, for that man is popular & powerful, connected with the most influential families in the District.  Genl C� Jones who supports Mr. Orr has a plantation adjoining John Smith, & John Smith is connected with the Marshalls, & Jones & Smith always go together.  You my dear stand upon your merits alone; your opponents support comes from those who are connected with him, who in an election of this kind will vote for him however remote the connexion may be, because they consider it an honor to send to Congress, one who is connected with them, never mind how remotely.  You will not gain one vote from the influence of your Wife, unless it is through the influence of her merits.  In this respect we are �ted alike.  But my dear you are so far superior to your rival that seriously I would have no fears, except for the exertions I know that we�make. If you are true to yourself I should hope you would be successful, but labouring under disadvantages as you do, particularly as a Lawyer making so many enemies, you must be on the alert.  It is a duty you owe your country, you ought not to permit it to send one who can do nothing for it, but�them send you, who can stand up for it.  Mr. Cunninghams overseer saw Mr. Anderson (the postmaster at Laurens village) the other day at some Muster in the neighborhood.  Mr. Cunningham asked me who he went for, & I told him he went for you.  He said Mr. Wells the Overseer, had thought from his manner, that he was not your friend, but it may have been only suspicion.  You must not think my mind is occupied only with this subject.  I have hardly thought of it, since I last wrote to you.  It is a relief to me to open my mind to you, & after that is done, I cease to dwell  on the subject that has oppressed me.  I have not passed any sleepless nights since I wrote.  Today when I took up my pen I thought I would give you all the information I could, on a subject so deeply interesting to us both.  When I am done writing, I am going to sit with Pamela, & invest myself in what concerns her, & forget you & your prospects for the time.  Pamela has been down in the Drawing room only one evening since I came.  I sit with her in her room in the morning & afternoon, & in the evening in the Drawing room, she would like me to sit with her in the evening too.  Last evening I stole away from the Drawing room, & did pass with her.  I sit up till past 10 oclock every night, so you see time does not hang heavily, but rather passes too quickly.  I am working for Mrs. Cunningham a pr of Shoes.  She says she has long wanted a pr, but I am the first friend who ever offered to work her a pr.  She says I have done more work for her, than any friend she has.  Pamela is very much pleased with my having furnished her with two anecdotes for Mrs. Ellet.  She was applied to for anecdotes by Mrs. Gilman, the Wife of the Unitarian Minister in Charleston, the Authoress you know. She became acquainted with her last summer.  I have been reading some affidavits of old persons who flourishes in the Revolutionary War, regarding what they know of the exploits of others. & the affidavits are really amusing.  They represent things Mrs. Bowen the Wife of Keith Bowen, who lives at Waterloo, paid Mrs. Cunningham yesterday.  She seems to be a very fine lady, & very sweet looking.  She begged me to go & see her.  If I had time on my way home, I would like to stop for a few minutes, but I do not expect to be able to.  She is a Tennessee Lady.  Mr. Cunningham has been reading Wille�s pencillings by the way, & is very much pleased with them.  He talks at night of what he has been reading during the day.  I have seen a Mountaineer, but have not heard otherwise from Greenville.  I have written to Mamma once.  Pamela wished me to write for her to buy her some Gingham & send her by Jim.  Perhaps Jim may bring me letters for her.  It seems strange when I think of home.  I know so little of what is going on there that my home now seems to be here, where my children are, my husband only is wanting, & he I hope to see soon.  I hope to hear tomorrow when he will be here.  You must be sure & come one night during Court, if you find you cannot come for me.  I have only spent 2 dollars, bundles by 5 cts. I gave the servants before I left home, so I have plenty of money.  Fanny has given me no trouble.  She has become so attached to Delia that I would wean her easily, except at night, but as I have no idea she shall be weaned, I make her nurse during the day.  I do not wish her to be entirely independent of me.  The other children have also behaved well.  They are thoroughly good children.  Believe me my dear husband your attached Wife, E.F.P.
