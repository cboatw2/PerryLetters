Letter 81

Wednesday Morning, 29 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I do not know how it is, but I feel so cool today whenever I think of you, that my heart feels as if it would burst.  Oh! If I could but see you safe at home again, how happy I would be.  It seems to me, I only now feel how much I love you, & how essential you are to my happiness.  My love now is mingled with anxiety, & the latter feeling has increased the former.  I have been unhappy ever since your first letter appeared in the Mountaineer.  I have been fearful lest the free manner in which you spoke of the Members should get you into trouble, & until I hear from you, that you are in no danger, I will be uneasy.  I dreamt last night you had been challenged by Dr. Austin for saying something about his daughters dancing.  A wretched night I passed.  When I woke up, my thoughts were on the same subject, & when I went to sleep, the dream was continued.   Oh my dear husband, for the love you bear your wife & children, & that they bear you, come back safe to them.  We cannot do without you.  What would existence be to us without you.  So if you get into any difficulty, you must get out of it peacefully & quietly.  If I had only been by you while you were writing that first letter I would have told you to leave out the second paragraph describing the members.  A womans instinct often tells her what is right, & it is a good rule & one which you ought to follow in writing, that if you cannot write well of a person, it is better not to mention them, at any rate not abuse them.  I took up my journal this morning.  I was laying on the bed & wanted something to read & suddenly thought of that as I read what you wrote in the first part, my heart overflowed.  I could not resist getting up & writing to you.  I thought I would feel better if I did.  I did not object to your mentioning & disapproving of the conduct of the Members, but I disliked the terms in which you mentioned it,  You might have written in a way , that would not have given offence.  I hope [lined through] & you ought not to make yourself disliked even at the North, & the uncomplimentary manner in which you speak of some of the distinguished men must make them dislike you.  I hope however, that my fears are groundless, & that nothing will happen to you.  The wish uppermost in my head now, is to see your face once more.  I value you more than ever, your long absence has made me appreciate you more.  If that were possible, the tears come so fast in my eyes, I have to stop to wipe then away.  The children long to see you.  They speak of you constantly, Frank particularly who I thought would have forgotten you.  I wrote to you only day before yesterday.  I am afraid I write too often.  My letters are a drug.  I expect to hear from you tonight, & ought to postpone writing until tomorrow, when I may have a letter from you to answer, but I cannot help sending you this.  I wish you soon to know my anxiety, that you may be doubly careful of yourself.  I wish also to tell you, that any purchases you wish to make, you must make, in preference to what I have written you to get.  I would much rather you should get what you think best, & I dare say you would prefer getting things more valuable than a dress, shawl &c. so you are at perfect liberty to do as you choose.  If you see a neat reasonable Sofa, & think you had better get it for our Dining room, I would like it very much, for the one now there is so ugly, & particularly uncomfortable, but if you had rather not get it, you need not.  So on, with regard to the Musical box , bracelet, & everything I have mentioned, but one thing I do wish is a bag, which I really need & would like you to bring Susan one too, & I wish you to bring a present for Ann.  I have no news to tell.  There are very few strangers in the village at present.  I know of no one but old Maj. Porcher & a Mr. Gaillard & family, & Dr. Tyddiman.  I ride out almost every afternoon.  I have not visited yet.  A good many persons have been to see me.  I feel quite well, & look as well as usual, but do not feel as happy as I will, when my dear husband returns.  Mamma & Susan have been quite a comfort to me, & Ann being willing, they should leave her.  They feel thankful to have a place to come to, where they can have quiet & tranquillity.  Ann prefers having but one at a time with her.  She is the same as when you left.  Mr. Brooks & his family have returned.  I do not know whether Ann Brooks has come.  The weather is now excessively hot, & we feel it more after the cool weather we have had.  I hope you will return gratified by your trip, & having seen all that was worth seeing.  Mr. Poinsett says he has no doubt, you have gained information, that will be profitable to you all your life.  On your way back if possible, & I know it will be possible, you must stop & see the persons in Philadelphia.  Mrs. Jones & Mrs. & Miss Hazle� that Mamma gave you letters to, & if convenient go to Carlisle, Wilmington.  How [page torn] you will have to talk about to me when you return.  Mrs. Bea� [page torn] has gone to the North.  Do you think you will return by the Virginia Springs?  If the mode of conveyance in that direction is safe, you will find it pleasant, & from all accounts they must be worth seeing.  I have heard it was like Fairy land.  Do not, above all things, return by Salisbury & Charlotte.  Mr. Poinsett said it would have been a risk going that way, & of course now later in the season the risk would be greater.  He said you were right to go by the way of Charleston.  How uneasy I would have been if I had known what a storm you were in.  For several days past, it has rained every afternoon, so I hope the Corn has benefitted by it, & that we will not now have too much rain.  Adieu my dear husband, my constant prayer is, that you may return to me safe & well.  I have written more than I expected to.  I do hope to hear from you tonight.  Ever yours true, loving, faithful wife, E.F.P.

Do not forget to price & perhaps buy some Tea in Fulton st N. York, & perhaps it would be well to look at Thorburn�s seed establishment, & make an engagement  for his sending you on seed every year.  You might also make arrangements for buying others things, such as Books, Groceries &c.  We are buying tea now at Nicols, so you might as well bring on now, that is if you have money.  One thing I have always forgotten to tell you to buy, is two or three bunches of Quills for Willie.  He is learning to write & needs them & here they are too dear 75 cts  a bunch.  I wish half a yd of fine blue black Broadcloth, if you can get it much cheaper in N. York than Greenville, & have the money to spare.  I would not object to your getting one half a yd, but if it is not cheaper & you have not enough money, or wish to spend the money in something else, you must by no means get it.  Broadcloth here, I believe, is 8 dollars a yd.  I am afraid my letters & commissions confuse you, but I do not wish them executed unless perfectly convenient.

You ought to direct that letters that arrive in N. York after you leave should be sent on to you here.

Benjamin Perry
