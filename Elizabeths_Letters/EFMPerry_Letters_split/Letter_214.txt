Letter 214

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter & Anna�s & am very glad to hear from you.  I am glad you arrived safely, for I think there is great danger in the boat conveyance.  I am sorry you have so little time for writing to me, but that is only of secondary importance, & I wish you to neglect nothing else to write.  I am sorry you should have to make your own fires.  Another time you had better take a servant with you, Reuben to wait on you.  You ought to attend to your comfort when you leave home.  Charles can attend to us here.

	Tell Anna I am glad to hear from her.  I dare say she will receive no message from Mrs. Taylor.  She is sick in bed, has recently for the fifth time lost an infant at its birth.  Aunt Eliza said both Mr. Taylor & herself requested you to take Anna to their house & not doing so, they may not think it necessary to send to ask her, particularly if it is true as Mrs. Thomas told me that Sarah was hurt at Willie�s not going to stay with her, when he first went to Columbia.  We are all well.  John is well again.  The horses are quite well. & the stock generally I believe.  I will give particular directions about Genl Thompsons Heifer.  I rode yesterday to Mr. McClanahan�s & paid the money.  He was not at home & his daughter said, her Mother instead of receipting the bill, which I asked her to do, would send a receipt today,
	
	Yesterday old Mrs. John Stokes brought me some Butter 15 cts a pound, & the servant said, she would engage it to me all winter at that price, & I said I would be glad to.  Mrs. McClanahan asks 20 cts, , & does not send it.  So I will take from Mrs. Stokes.

	If Judge Evans is elected Senator, a judge will be elected in his place.  I wish you would be a Candidate.  My ambition is to be a Judges wife.  It will be easier for you to be elected to that office, than  to any political one, as a Judge has not much to do with politics, & then I can go to Charleston with you every year, so get some friends to interest themselves for you.

	The ride I took yesterday was quite pleasant. Susan, Ann & Fanny went with me.  This evening I intend to take another.  Reuben drives us.  I am sorry to mortify Willie, but I am afraid to trust him with the two horses.  Bill starts constantly, & it requires a a strong hand to keep him in.  You will have to buy a horse for Willie�s especial use.

	I will be very glad for you to pay Dr. Irvine for Becky.  It will save interest, & like you I like to pay my bills immediately, & if possible never go in debt.  He soon goes to Florida.  You had better send the Check at once.  Dr. Irvine I can beg to leave your note with someone, so it will be paid even in his absence.  I dare say he would like the money before he goes to Florida, as he is going there to purchase land.  When Mr. Hamilton pays you. you must pay all your debts, & then invest the rest profitably.  You see I was right.  Mr. Williams has not paid you what he promised.

	Willie says the Mountaineer office is removed to that small house by Rutledge Stables, that Mr. Long had built over his Ice House.  I cannot say I am sorry for Mr. Sam Town[e]s sickness.  I instinctively dislike him.  He & Mr. Burt, both make a tool  of you for their own interest, but whenever an opportunity offers they injure you.  For 100 dollars a year Mr. Town[e]s would abuse you as much as your enemies would wish, but when he wishes you to write his book for him his abuse then stops for the time.  Mamma says she hears he is going to purchase the house Mr. Lynn Watson is building near her.

	Luther lately wrote a note to Susan begging her to return, but she declined.  He told her not to mention to anyone, particularly to Mamma, that he had written.  She told it to me in confidence, & I tell it to you as we are one.  

	I know of nothing new to tell you.  An Eclectic is all that has come for you.  Tell Anna I will write soon to her.  I hope she will go to Charleston before long.  Yours, E.F.P.
