Letter 117

My dear husband

		As you have not returned home today, I will write you a few lines, which perhaps may reach you, & inform you how matters stand with your family.  I am happy to tell you that Mary is a great deal better, Dr. Crook finding that it was not the Morphine, that excited her, & that she needed sleep, gave her a large dose Friday night, & in the morning she awoke in her right mind.  She asked Delia about herself.  She thought from her feelings, she was about to be confined & was astonished when she heard she had been sick a�had her baby, had had convulsions, bruised herself &c.  Her sight is not perfectly restored yet, but that is improving, & Dr. Crook tonight said all she needed now, was a good nursing.  He yesterday said Mary would soon be able to take charge of the baby.  If she is not, when Mom Charlotte leaves, we must hire a woman with a child, to attend to Mary, & nurse the baby.  I have become attached to the little thing, but I must reserve my strength that may await me hereafter.  From the moment you left, things took a better turn.  The baby seemed to give less trouble & Mary seemed better.  I was sorry you could not know of the favorable change, as it would have been such a relief to your mind.  I hope you are this evening at Mrs. Cunninghams; at any rate I imagine you there.  You must do the best for yourself.  You know it is the universal opinion you have a cunning adroit opponent. The Carolinian & Charleston papers have come tonight, & Judge O�Nealls report on Col. Dunhams call.  I did not go to church today.  The children went with Susan & Mamma.  Tomorrow Jim says, both Charles & himself will work in the garden.  I am sorry I have so bad a pen to write with.  This is the 9th day of Mary�s sickness, when if a change for the worse is to take place, it would have taken place.  As it has not, we have every reason to think she is getting well.  I asked Mom Affy today, if what Mrs. Horton said about Caroline�s asking certain questions was so, & she says there is not a word of truth in it.  I miss two silver teaspoons, & four yards of unbleached Homespun I had given Mary is gone, & a spool of thread of Mom Charlottes was actually seen in the hands of some one.  Mamma & Susan paid me a visit going to, & coming from church this morning.  Mrs. Arthur is going to Virginia in a few weeks.  Mrs. Hoke came to see me this afternoon.  Frank will commence going to school tomorrow; he wants to go.  I must now conclude, & go to bed, before my little charge�the children are all in bed.  I hope you will soon receive this, & that it will relieve your mind.  We have great cause to be thankful for Mary�s recovery, & that her child also is doing well.  Now if your prospects in Laurens are good, & you do not become inert, & let your adversary get the advantage of you, I will have no cause of complaint.  Take care of yourself, my dear husband, adieu, Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
