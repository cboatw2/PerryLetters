Letter 194

Thursday morning, 11 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

		I did not hear from you last night, which disappointed me greatly.  I hope it is the Postmaster in Columbia�s fault, & that tonight I will get two letters, at any rate one.  When I receive no letter, I have not much to write about, as I write so often.

		Yesterday the children & myself all went over to Mamma�s & spent the afternoon.  Susan was there with a bad headache.  She suffers with them almost all the time.  Ann also feels poorly.

		Mamma says Mr. Hutson is so distantly related to us, she does not look upon him as a relatiall.  His con� is so remote, I do not even know what degree it is.

		Mamma has at present a girl of Mrs. Pearsons, who she likes very much.  The girl says her wages are 6 dollars a month, but if she cannot get that, she is to take 5 dollars, & that she has tried all over the village, & cannot get a place.  When Mamma heard of her she was working for Dr. Koch for nothing.  She told Anna yesterday that Dr. Koch had got wood from so many persons, & not paid for it.  Now, no one would carry him any, & some cold days had been without fire, that he had but one mattress for his whole family, & two blankets.  She told Mary at the Spring, that Dr. Koch bought a Possum, & one day he would cut off one leg, & give it to cooked, & the next day another, & so on, until it was all gone, that his Wife sits down & cries.  The law is that if a man is strong enough to support his Wife & family they are to look to him alone for support.  But there ought to be a law for families situated like Dr. Koch where the father will not work to support them.  The son & daughter ought to be taken from him, & put to trades, & the Wife & young children sent to the poor house.  Dr. Koch is a worthless creature .  He sets up for a gentleman, so he is above working.  It was presumptuous in him to charge 1 dollar a lesson for Music when he is as poor a teacher as can be.  Anna[�s] improvement is owing only to me.  If I had not attended to her she would have learnt nothing.
	Fanny came running in just now to say Anna said I must tell you, she was teaching her, her lesson.  Fanny got her spelling book out of the Library, & carried it to Anna to teach her.  Willie was seated in the room looking over a little book.  I told him he had better read Baker�s�, so I might give a good account of him.  He went in the Library to get it, & I have been rattling some bones, & I sent to tell him, I would write you word he was shaking bones, instead of reading, so he stopped, & I hope now he is reading.  
	Mrs. Walker I believe goes today.  Her negroes have already passed  I have heard so often she was going.  I won�t believe it until she is actually gone.
	I wish you would ask Col. Ashmore what the ladies said about you.  I love to hear you complimented.
	Mary says Mrs. Barnard Cleveland�s father, old Mr. Jim Cleveland is dead.  
	The weather now & for several days past, is like Spring.  I hope you will have such to come home in.  The nights are as light almost as day.  I wish you would consult the best Physician in Columbia about your cold, & ask if your tooth has anything to do with the flowing from your nose, & if you had better have it drawn, & you can have the gold to be artificial tooth fixed in a way to do without the decayed tooth.  No one is better off for a decayed tooth in their mouth.  It is best to get rid of it.  Do attend to this matter now while you are in Columbia, & can ask advice of a good Physician.  For my sake do it, for if your cold is not put a stop to at once, you will go into Consumption.
	We are all well.  I see Miss Cornelia Crittenden & Dr. Blackman walking together every now & then.  I once heard Mr. Walker tell her, she would be satisfied only as a Princess, but I think she has lowered her pride, instead of a Prince to take an unknown Dentist.  
	I hope to hear tonight from you.  I suppose no Election has been made to the Female Academy.  Mr. Erwin I believe is the only Candidate, so I hope he will be elected.  Frank can then get rid of him, & there are so many Female schools, we are not obliged to send Anna to him.
	I must now close after writing a letter literally about nothing.  When I commenced I did not know I would fill a page.
	Do your duty. The next Legislature I suppose will be composed of Members of entirely different politics from the present.  Since the people have been enlightened by the Patriot, & you can then carry your measures triumphantly, without any difficulty, so do not be discouraged.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
