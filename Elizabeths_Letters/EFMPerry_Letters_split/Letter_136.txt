Letter 136

My dear husband

		I received your letter Wednesday evening, & cannot tell how mortified I am at the useless purchases you have made.  If money was�, or if you were ever out of debt, I would be less grieved, but when you know how much at present you owe, & that you are making less, than you have done for years, I cannot but be surprised, that you should so thoughtlessly spend your money, & show so little judgement, the things we need, you do not get, & what are entirely superfluous, you get, what we have�for an Entry Lamp which is only necessary, where much company is entertained, & a chamber Lamp. what in the name of wonder are we to do with it.  I told you expressly if you bought Lamps, to get them for the Drawing room, for the only one we have in there, is an old fashioned�, out of repair.  I did not think at present you could afford even for the Drawing room, but if you would get them, it ought to have been for that room, & not for our little narrow Entry, where it will not be used more than once in a year.  I must say I am provoked at this purchase & if it is not too late, would wish you to exchange it, for something more useful; then again to give six dollars for Wine glasses, when 2 dollars would have been according to our means, & when we have not even a nice set of Cups & Saucers, to use for company, & 16 dollars to give for Decanters, when 1 pr would have been sufficient, to get two bed�when only one we needed, & so many Pitchers & Basins, when we have not Basin Stands to put them on.  My dear husband, you see how inconsistent your purchases are, so do in future I beg you, learn first from me what we need, before you throw your money away.  I have [page torn] as if the money was lost, & I think how many things we really need, & that I have been denying myself of so long [page torn] would have purchased.  Col. Dunham is good for the money, therefore there was no necessity of laying it out at the agents.  It would have been even better to have had the note gaining interest, & to be of service, in extricating you from debt.  You have certainly forgotten, what you owe, & that the house is to be painted, & will be such an expense.  We ought to save all we can for that, & now Col. Irby�s note is�upon, & that will soon go principle & all.  As long as you are alive, your family will be supported, if your health does not fail you, but even that is uncertain, & when you think of the uncertainty of Life, & how unprovided your family would be if you were taken away, I wonder this thought does not make you�, & determine you to begin before it is too late, & lay up all you possibly can for your helpless family.  In future I beg you to give me 100 dollars a year to supply myself with clothes.  It is 50 dollars less, than you allowed me when we were first married.  I find it is of no use for me to deny myself, actually of necessary clothing, when all that I�is spent so uselessly by you.  You ought to see my petticoats, my night dress, my stockings, actually in rags, & then your Entry Lamp would�, but I could fill sheet after sheet with my reproofs on your want of thought, for I must attribute imprudence to this, so I will stop.  The Wig I am glad you got.  I am always pleased at your providing yourself, with what is necessary to your good appearance.  It is a duty you owe your Wife, to make yourself look as comely as possible.  We should take the same pains with our appearance after marriage as before.  It is more necessary then, for the Leaf gold is then wanting, which each party had thrown over the object of its love.  The Dining Table I am not displeased at your getting, though the freight will�high, but you must now get a Table Cover for it, & I hope as you have been so liberal in buying what we do not need, that you will buy a Transparent Curtain, which we do need for the Library.  When I said we would not purchase Groceries at present, it was to [page torn] my determination to be economical.  I did not think you would argue from it, that the money that ought to have been appropriated to that purpose, you would spend in other ways less useful.  I need clothes, & I am actually letting E� take in Clothes so as to make a little for me, to supply myself with the Clothes.  She is now working with Mrs. Shoolbred at the Mansion house.  I told her she must bring me 50 cts a day, & I am doing the work of all my family.  Our circumstances have pressed upon me lately, for I saw you were making little. & the expenses of our family increasing, for we will wish as our children grow up, to give them every advantage of education, but I do not see how we can, for now you spend more than you make.  You ought to have saved to buy a horse, & I do not know anything that makes a housekeeper so comfortable, as a great supply of Groceries, but we cannot get them now.

		It has rained ever since I wrote to you.  The weather is gloomy & cold.  I have been able to have nothing done in the garden.  The ground continues so wet.  I expect much ploughing has not been done at the farm, but they have been hoeing, but I suppose the rain makes the Oats & Corn grow.  Reuben goes off early & returns late.  Miss Long has had bad weather for her honey�.  I hope Love has made up in warmth, for the loss of the pleasant sunshine.  We have had fire constantly.  It is not raining at this present moment, but it is cold & damp & the wind is blowing.  Frank is quite well.  Willie yesterday was taken with a throwing up, & continued during the day.  Dr. Crooks is away so I sent for Dr. Earle to know what to give him, & he sent him Senna & Salts.  Today he feels pretty well, but I have kept him at home.  I sent to Dr. Earle for something for Fanny, & he sent her two doses of Calomel.  I gave them to her with Oil afterwards, & her operations were dark green stuff.  I think she looks better, so I hope the Calomel has done her good.  The children say you must bring them some Paint boxes.  I suppose Tom Butler [page torn] not sent the money.  I hope not, as I am afraid you would {page torn] it all, & we must spend some now in consequence the purchases you have already made.  We will have to get more Pillows, Pillow cases, Sheets, Basin Stands, Table Cloths for the Dining Table &c & Curtains are needed for the Room we used to sleep in.  & when we can I wish to buy a Carpet for that room. 

		Mr. Edward Earle died before Dr. Earle got there as I mentioned to you.  I have not heard any particulars.

		The old Cow has broken down almost every Orange Tree.  I am so provoked, but feel to her as I do to you, that my vexation can profit nothing, & even any punishment I can inflict cannot restore things, as they were.

		Do supply yourself with all the clothes you need.  I hope you have got a Sack Coat.  I love to see you looking neat & nice.  Judge Evans imagines what his feelings will be for a Wife if he gets another.  I have no thankful feelings, on account of your defeat.

		Eliza Hayne writes me that Mrs. Taylor has been very ill, & the Doctor ordered her to change the air, so she was going to Charleston to pay a visit.

		The children long to see you, so do I, so you may expect & prepare for many scolds, for I assure you I have been worried & even kept awake, thinking how many things we needed could have been purchased with the money you spent for what we did not need.  An Entry Lamp is very little used even in Charleston, & Gas is dangerous; change it I beseech you for Drawing room Lamps or something else useful.  Now I have opened my mind, I hope I will feel easier.  But I have not said half I intended.  But I love you still.  I only grieve you understand your circumstances so little & take [page torn] thought for the future, while it is in your power.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
