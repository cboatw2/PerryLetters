Letter 173

Saturday night, 14 December [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, in which you mentioned you had spoken, but only an hour, & had not said half you wished, that you had astounded the Legislature, & your speech been poorly quoted, misrepresented &c.  All this is so different from what I had expected, that I feel disappointed.  As you have said the majority of the Members agreed with you.  I did not know your opinions would astonish them so, but the truth is you only agree in wishing a Southern Convention, but they wish it for the purpose of dissolving the Union; you to preserve it, & that is a great difference.  I knew I would not like the notes of your speech in the papers, as they have not done you justice. So I thought it best today, not to look at the papers.  All the speeches on the other side, never mind how poor they all are praised.  Mrs. Pickerell told me. The correspondent of the Mountaineer spoke highly of Mr. Leitner�s speech.  I hope you will have yours published just as soon as possible; that justice may be done you, but I am thinking in what paper you can get it published; that perhaps none will publish it.  If all refuse, you must have it published in pamphlet form, even if you have to send it to Augusta.

		My greatest comfort during you absence has been to go every Saturday afternoon to the Miss Andersons & tell them the news from Columbia.  They are so few now with whom I can converse freely, & meet sympathy.  They are the finest ladies I know of.  They are so conscientious & act so on principle.  They are poor, & yet live respectably.  At one time they were afraid they would have to give up their house, & if they would get no other board out, & if so, they would be obliged to apply to their brothers for aid, which they were very reluctant to do, but for the present they can keep the house.

		Mr. & Mrs. Campbell left the morning after the wedding.  I believe for Augusta, but I am not certain.  They did not wait for the sister to return from Virginia, though she is expected every day.  Mr. Luther went to the wedding, & says though many were invited, there were only a few there.  Mrs. Arthur today sent each of us some cake.

		I am sorry you make no mention of a bundle having been sent to you from Charleston.  I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to get me a Sashe, & send it by someone to you, or if no private opportunity occurred to send it on the Rail Road directed to the Columbia Depository to your care, & I have repeatedly written to you to send to the Depository & see about it, but you give me no answer on the subject, & now the time approaches for you to leave Columbia.  I feel very uneasy, for fear you will leave without seeing about it.  Though a little matter to you, it is a great matter to me, for I have nothing warm to wear to church.  My cloak is too old.  I have had it now 15 years, & my shawl is too thin, so I beg you to interest yourself & send the children down to the Depository every day to see if the bundle has come.  It will be a pleasant walk for them, & keep them from annoying you with their company, which I am afraid they do, as you say they are constantly with you.  I thought Willie having Frank as his companion would have been independent of you, that they would have spent the greater part of their time in walking about the town.  Today a letter came from Mr. Spartan Goodlett, inclosing a list of 10 subscribers, & wishing you success, & his best wishes.  The names are Wm J. Pennington, James K. Dickson, W.J. Gilreath, W.D. Berry, John Groce, Asa Cunningham, Lewis Cockrell, William Dickson, John Mosteller, Spartan Goodlett.  If all you send Prospectus to, will send you 10 subscribers, I will be glad.  Except Mr. O�Hanlon, all wish the weekly numbers, so I do not think there will be any use for a triweekly.  If so, the expenses of the printing establishment, I hope will be less.  I see pretty plainly, the paper will not be issued the 1st January, for that is only two weeks from now, & the type is not even here.  Mr. Elford ought to hurry.  How times are changed.  The Mountaineer that seemed to belong to you, now your greatest enemy & governed by such a little mean of set of men, who have been hitherto of so little importance, & edited by a simple schoolmaster of Chester, & a drunken sot from Alabama, they dictating to your friends, & reeling with a rod of iron, & carrying everything before them.  Papers have such influence & they misrepresent so, & in this State at present, there is no chance of vindicating oneself.  

		I am sorry Mr. Young was defeated, but on the first ballot Mr. Reed ran so well, I thought he would be elected, & his being a Member of the Legislature was an advantage.  So Mr. Young though he got himself elected to the Nashville Convention, did not gain his end as Genl Whitner did.  

		Scott is about the same,  He is very weak & stays down a great deal, but Reuben says he eats & drinks a good deal.  Dr. Earle told Mamma , he noticed him last summer & thought him S�, & if I sent him to his stable, he would try & cure him, but it is now Sw� you know, it is the reverse, his under parts seem affected.  Reuben says, it may be worms in the Kidneys.  I think it is Spinal affection.

		This is the last letter but one, I am to write.  You must write so I can hear from you three times:  Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday.  If I hear nothing to the reverse, I will send Reuben Thursday, perhaps Wednesday & let him rest a day at Fulkes.  Will Mr. Duncan return with you, or come in the Stage.  If you set off at 8 oclock I do not think you will come all the way to Laurens that day.

		Tomorrow is Sunday.  I will let the horses rest, & walk to church if I go.  Today has been cloudy & cold, looking like Snow.  Dr. Turpin has had a very bad drinking spell.  I hear old Maj Turpin left no will.  

		Mrs. Pickerell has been sick in bed for several weeks.  Every day I send her something.  As she has no one to�for her, I have been to see her twice.  She is very grateful.  Says she knows I need nothing she can do for me, but if I did, she certainly would do it.  Mr. Pickerell & herself are good Union persons, so there I meet with sympathy, & they are both very sensible.

		I hope your speech will soon be published.  I do not suppose it will be approved of then, but still you can do some justice to yourself then.  I expect you did while making it.  I am afraid you did not do as well as you expected to.

		If any more ideas occur to me, I will write more tomorrow night, & dare say many will.  Love to the boys, Your wife, E.F.P.
