Letter 38

Tuesday night, 10 December 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	Again do I write to you at night, because tomorrow I will not have a moment to spare.  I am now prepared to go to Mrs. Cunninghams.  I know in tomorrow nights letter, you will express no unwillingness that I should go, & now I have gone so far, I do not think I can turn back.  I have written to Pamela, that she may expect me Friday evening, though not certainly.  I have purchased materials to work you a pair of shoes.  I have bought a beautiful pattern to work them by, so I will be able to work them now, whenever you wish them.  Jim yesterday killed the hogs, & today he has been setting them up & salting & making the Sausage meat.  Tomorrow he will stuff the Sausages.  He killed seven hogs, but one of the hogs does not seem good,  It has white round spots or pimples all over it.  Jim says you have some sous you can kill if you wish it.  Today & yesterday have been the coldest days we have had.  Miss Earle is married tonight.  Susan & myself preferred not going to so large a party, so soon after Uncle Haynes death.  Mrs. Sam Earle was not invited.  Mr. Earle & Mrs. Earles sons have had some difference; & on that account she was not invited; her sisters child, what a quarrelsome family they seem to be.  Mr. Lester came to see me this afternoon, to mention that he had left you well.  Robert Foster paid me a visit the other day.  I thought he must have come to borrow something, perhaps your horse & buggy, but he only came to pay a visit.  He says he is going to move to Pickens.  He says his mother wrote word all were well at Toogaloo [Tougaloo],  

	What do you think I did this morning?  Why I had my tooth drawn?  You know how long it has worried me, & last night I do not think I slept an hour; & fortunately it continued to ache this morning.  I say fortunately, for it was only excessive pain that could have given me courage to have it drawn.  I sent for Mr. Buice before breakfast, & after taking an hour to dress himself as neatly as possible, he came.  At first he frightened me, by saying he must be candid, & tell me that it was a very bad tooth, & might break in pulling. But I must let him cut the gum deep, that he might get a good hold, & then he would try & draw it out safely.  I said if there was any danger in it I would wait until you came back, but he said no.  If it did break, he would try & break it low down, so that the gum would close over it, & when the air was excluded, it would no longer ache.  So I summoned up all my courage & sat down.  He then cut the gum low, & that he said I bore well.  He then drew the tooth, & I did not even make an exclamation.  He said I was the bravest soldier he had seen for a long time.  It gave me great pain, but not as much as I expected, & I am really thankful it came out so safely.  I think Mr. Buice must draw teeth well.  He did not give a sudden pull, as I thought he would, but he took a firm hold, then seemed to loosen the tooth,  & then draw it out.  I feel happy tonight.  I would not pass such another night as the last, on any account.  I have another tooth which Mr. Buice says ought to come out, & which I myself know ought to.  Some day I will summon up courage & have that out too.  It has ached me dreadfully, but it does not now.  Such teeth Mr. Buice says  (& I believe all do) injure the stomach & cause Dyspepsia .  I have four which he says plugging will save & some that need scraping. I would not have the tooth that was drawn this morning back again, for a thousand dollars, indeed for no sum whatever.

	Mr. Pinckney came to see me yesterday afternoon.  Mrs. Coleman has been, Miss Crittenden & Miss Skinner, Miss Pinckney, Mrs. & Miss Jones & Mrs. Duncan, when I was from home.  We have had a good deal of warm, rainy weather.  

	Mamma has written to Aunt Eliza to say, her business may be put in the hands of Alston Hayne, & he must act for her, as for his Mother.  I do not think there will be any necessity for you to go to town.  Ann is still very poorly.  Susan & Mamma came in today.  They are very kind to me.  Mamma not long ago gave me $6.50 to buy a Mantle, & she has lately given me a Shawl 5 dollars & a tippet 2 dollars.  I would like you to bring Susan & Ann a present, something that will cost very little, for it is not the value of a present they care for, but the remembrance.  You are wrong to think you must not make a present, unless you can make a valuable one.  I think the merest trifle from a friend acceptable.  I would be vexed if you bought them handsome presents, for that you cannot afford, but a little trifle, ornament for the table, Mantle peice, or anything that will cost little, will do, merely to show them you thought of them.

	I saw Mr. Thomas Cox the other day.  He said he supposed you were gaining new Laurels in Columbia.  I have to remain silent when I hear the Hoar case mentioned.  I hope you will be able to explain your conduct satisfactorily.  As I have no letter of yours to answer, I have less to write about, than I otherwise would have.  I never saw the village quieter.  I am glad you are in Columbia, with something important to occupy you.  I hope you will act your part well, & increase your reputation.  I wonder you complain of having nothing to write me.  It seems to me, you might write a good deal.

	The children are well.  They are all asleep upstairs.  The servants are doing well.  I have indeed nothing to write about.  I will write you again on Thursday if possible before I start.  There may be something in tomorrow nights Letter I may wish to answer.  I will write you as soon as I get to Mrs. Cunninghams, but as the Mails are irregular in that part of the country, you must not be uneasy.  I would like you to spend Christmas there.  Everybody seems to think it will be a pleasant trip for me.  I think the children will enjoy it, & it will improve them, & it will be so pleasant to come home again.  I was agreeably surprised that in your two last letters, you did not scold me, for expressing so much anxiety on the subject.  I opened them with fear & trembling.  Your two sheet one, made me shed some tears, & lost me some sleep.  We will meet now in less than a fortnight, remain satisfied in Columbia, & do not think of leaving until the Session is over.  When you return home you will be long enough there to get tired.  Joe Powell told Minerva one day at the kitchen window, that he had got a letter from you & you were quite well.  I hope you have had some friendly correspondence with him, such men it is better to be on good terms with.  They can injure you so much.  It was wrong in you at the first to make him your enemy, but I forget, I will not give you advice.  M� Mauldin today brought Anna a little basket, & Oscar [Mauldin] brought Willy & Frank a tumbler.  Ever Yours, Liz
