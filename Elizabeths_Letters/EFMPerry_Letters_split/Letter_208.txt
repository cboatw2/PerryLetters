Letter 208

Tuesday morning, 11 oclock, [4 May 1852]
[Greenville]

Dear Willie

	I have written to your Papa, & as you are now at leisure, & not much to occupy you, it may give you pleasure to read a letter from me. So I will write to you.  I will first tell you of Hochy, who you are most interested in.  He was not used May day, as I have informed you.  I saw Rudd strutting about with a cocked hat on, & though he would not have graced Hochy much.  Aunt Anne inquired what plain looking person he was.  I dare say he is good, which is far better than good looks, but he is not as handsome as Hochy.  Sunday afternoon Reuben put Hochy & Selim in the carri[a]ge & drove us a little way.  It seemed to me both horses looked thin.  It may be I only imagined it, for I expect no horse under Reuben�s care  to do well, & I am aways expecting to see them looking thinner & thinner.  Reuben said Hochy was quite well, & had been used very little to haul wood.  He is so young, it gives no pleasure to use him, for fear it hurts him, so I determined not to use him often in the carri[a]ge.  Anna wrote you a letter Sunday.  She would not let me read it, so you must make allowances for mistakes, as she composed & wrote it entirely herself.  Yesterday she wrote to her Papa, & I read that.  I was amused at her arrangements for the May day she is to have; at everyone having a part assigned them, & when it came to Alex�s carrying the May pole, I laughed aloud.  Hext will be an odd little H�, unless he walks alone before that time.  There will have to be a third H� to lead him & the Procession will have to make a very short circuit, in consideration of his little feet.  I hope you will acquit yourself well on the occasion, & that your first effort as a public speaker, will foreshadow who you are to be in after life.

	The boys gave a party last night to the girls.  Anna wished to go, but as you were not here to go with her, I was very glad it rained so hard, that she could  not go.  I hardly think any girl could have gone, & it was not in the favor of any who did go.  Until girls grow up, they should show themselves very little in public, & even then only occasionally.  They should be retired & modest, though at the same time polite.

	Franks mumps have troubled him very little.  He has gone about as usual except the first day he stayed from school.  He has gone to school this week.

	Mr. Wallace Thompson�s judgment I think very bad, to tell you, you ran about too much & neglected your school.  Judge Butler would have told you differently.  The foundation you lay out at school is very important, but the knowledge you gain in the occasional trips you make from home, are of great benefit to you, & will be through life, & give you information, that probably you never would have. If you staid all the time at home, went to school, & devoted yourself to Grammar, Geography Arithmetic &c.  Perfection in these studies, would make you a good schoolmaster, enabling you to impart  the same knowledge to others, but as you are to be a Lawyer or Statesman or something of this kind, you must have a knowledge of mankind, in general information matters & things which you can never gain at school only.  Your occasional association with the good & great has already done I hope much for you; for you know Hugh Thompson told his mother you knew something on every subject mentioned.  Your character it seems to me is different from the other little Willie[s], who stay at home, & whose Papas are not like yours, who have not the advantages you have.  You are more enlightened, & ought to be better than they are, when you think of the trouble & expense your Papa puts himself to, to improve you, so you must come back a man in behaviour, & such a thing as quarreling with Frank, & being rude & unkind to Anna & Fanny you must be above, & be respectful to your Mama & not scold the servants.  I would have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read, but as you forgot to send your love to her, I thought she would be hurt at the neglect, so did not send it.  She takes great pride in you, as you are her oldest grandchild.

	The Temperance Cadets turned out May day, & were very intemperate in eating.  I believe if it were not for the marching occasionally, & the scarfs & banners the company would not be near as large as it is.  I hope nobler motives than these will influence you to be good, virtuous & temperate.  Read your bible & be governed by the principles there inculcated.  We are all born sinful creatures, but some certainly even by nature more virtuous than others.  Your Papa is innately virtuous, & I hope his children may be like him.

	If you come home Thursday night, tomorrow I will write my last letter to Columbia.  When you return you must devote yourself with increased application to your studies.

	I hope Paul Hayne�s talents will be of some use, & not like some of his cousins, but what was his end.  He had no energy & was wanting in many things, but he was sensitive & many allowances must be made for him.  I am glad your Papa dresses so well, as to be observed.  He loves you�, [E.F.P.]

My dear husband

	I will write you a few lines, though with a shocking pen, to prevent your being more anxious than is necessary.  Dr. Crooks this morning said Edward was doing reasonably well, that with the fever he has, the patient one day is better, the next day perhaps worse, & sometimes so for 12 or 15 days, sometimes longer before they begin actually to get better.  He also says that there is not so much danger of the fever spreading in the yard, as if one of the servants about us had it, for then it would have originated on our premises, & the same cause would give it to others, but that Edward was not living here, his sickness originated elsewhere.  You know Mr. Dyer said he had 3 servants sick like him.  All the rest of the family are well, & I hear of no new sickness anywhere.  I expect certainly to see you Saturday night & wish you would come back sooner, as you are to leave Sunday.  You ought to give me one day at least.   Take care of yourself.  I hope Frank is behaving well.  You must not be uneasy about us.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
