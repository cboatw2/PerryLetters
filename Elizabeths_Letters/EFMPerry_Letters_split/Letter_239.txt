Letter 239

Sunday, 12 oclock, [1852]

My dear husband

	Today has been so unfavorable, that we did not go to church.  I have just done reading to the children, so will now write you a few lines.  One important matter I nearly forgot mentioning to you.  When you are away the servants have so much�to do, I thought this a good time to purchase their summer clothes, for them to make up, so the money you left, I first bought some necessaries, & the remainder spent in Homespun for servants, but it was not enough to pay for all.  Would you be so good as to send me by Mr. Elford 10 dollars, to finish paying for the Homespun & to carry me on in Housekeeping.  It will be more than is necessary but you had better send that sum.  I have to pay Mom Phillis 2 dollars for being with Lindy.  I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you & pay you for all the cases you have been engaged in with him.  In writing your Editorial from Pickens, do not mention Mr. Easley�s name in connexion with the case you have against him, as his family are respectable, you must have some regard for their feelings.  If Miss Wynn were modest, she would now keep herself secluded & not wish to bring herself into public notice, as she is by bringing suit.  She is sufficiently disgraced & if a trial comes on, I am afraid other acts of indecency will be brought forward against her. So instead of vindicating her fair fame, she will establish its infamy.  Her father perhaps does not know how bad she is.  Like Mrs. Rabe Dr. Rabe before her trial did not know half of what was brought against her.  

	Lindy & her baby are doing well.  Write me a long letter by Mr. Elford.

	The Patriot in which you mentioned Scurry�s case you ought to send to Belton Williams friends,, mother, Uncles, , & cousin.  I think it a shame Scurry should be acquitted.  It was almost deliberate murder.  Massey certainly then ought not to have been hung, & I hope Mr. Wiliams will still pay you the additional fee.  I am afraid the�spirit will pass over.

	Mrs. Earle across the river, told Mamma she heard Mr. Sharpe was losing his property fast.  When will you be paid for Mr. Barnes Rail Road Case.  You will have been longer from home now than sometimes when you go to Columbia, & a Call was bad to have during Court week at Anderson.  Many are at Court, who would wish to attend.  

	Good bye.  We all long to see you.  Ever yours, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
