Letter 15

Tuesday night, 8 December 1840
Greenville

My dear husband

	I told you not to expect to hear from me by Friday�s Mail, but I have changed my mind & think I will write you a few lines, as Margaret will be here tomorrow, & I will be busily occupied with her.  I will devote this evening to you.  I write principally to apologize for the liberty I have taken in giving you so much advice.  Why my letters have been filled up with nothing but reproof and counsel.  I meant it all as a joke, but you may not have taken it as such, & perhaps may have been influenced by it.  If this has been the case, I will indeed be grieved.  I hope that you good sense and firmness have not deserted you, & that you have had independence enough to act out your own opinions, even contrary to dictorially  .expressed ones.  I woke up last night & began thinking about all this, & I was so worried at the thought that you might even unconsciously to yourself, have been influenced by my advice, that I could not go to sleep for hours.  I hope you will comfort me in your next letter by the assurance, that I am quite mistaken in thinking my opinions have such weight with you, that you course in the Legislature should be influenced by them contrary to your own judgment.  Even on the subject of the Penitentiary of course you are the best judge.  I suppose I have an opinion on every subject whether I understand it or not.  It is a chance whether I am right or wrong, but you who have opportunities of improving your mind, such a great mind, clear head, & good judgment; of course you are well qualified to think and act on every subject brought before the mind.  I am very presumptuous to direct your course on Political & other great matters.  I go beyond my sphere & do not understand what I am about.  That is your department, but household arrangements, decorations of the person, providing for the family, servants &c., & even keeping books.  In all these things I may be the adviser, & perhaps even the principal; in all except the latter business, there I will only give my assistance.  So my dear husband, with the hope that you have not been influenced by me, even on the Penitentiary subject, I will drop the subject & turn to another & more interesting one.

	Willy is a pretty interesting boy, & looks quite healthy.  I hope he will continue to look as well as he does now until you return.  He has not forgotten you.  We speak so often to him of Papa; it is impossible he should.  In the morning when I wake, I say Willy look for Papa, see him in the other side of you, & he instantly looks round.  He does not talk, & understands everything so well, that I am afraid he will not for a long time.  He understands everything, tell him to bring the Broom to Delia, to shut the door, to put wood on the fire, to sit down & he will do it.  He will do everything except behave quite as well as he ought to, & not be cross & troublesome some times.  I miss you at Meal times particularly, for you know it was your privilege to be favored with his company exclusively.  We all now enjoy that pleasure.  If you see no reasonable suitable hat for him, you need not be worried.  We can send to town for one at some convenient time.

	Mamma & Susan rode to the house today.  The carpenters had almost finished ceiling the garret, the front steps are up, but not the banisters or railings.  The Bricklayers work I believe is finished.  Mr. Powel  is painting.  Castles says the Well will be a splendid one.  He has dug 14 or 15 feet and has come to two or three feet of water. & he says first rate water.  He says the Spring with a little labour will be an elegant one.  I must tell you how sociable he has become with me.  The day we went to choose the spot for the well, we were quite undecided.  Mamma would choose one, he one, & I one.  At last Mamma fived upon a spot she thought would do, & I was about to select another, when he hollowed out, �Lizzy mind what your Mammy says.�  We were all very much surprised & laughed, & thought it was a slip of the tongue from hearing Mamma & Susan call me so, but he continued calling me Lizzy & calls me so ever since.  It does not seem to proceed from familiarity but from artlessness & innocence.  We like him very much & think he is quite an artless & honest man.  Mamma�s Well will cost very little, perhaps not six dollars.

	Susan & Ann went to see Miss Harrison yesterday she invited them to the Wedding.  She is to be married the 24th Christmas Eve.  Mrs. S� invited us all to pass the evening with her.  Mamma & Susan went.  The Miss Anderson�s have come.  They are staying with Mrs. Marant.  Mr. Suddeth prefers not taking them; says his house is not a suitable one for Ladies.  Mr. Buist has returned; he could not bring the box from the Miss Seabrooks as he came in a Sulky.  It was of no consequence, as Mr. Hoke will bring it next week.

	I will tell you what a trick I served Delia & Eliza unintentionally the other night.  I woke up & it was so light I thought it was daylight so I called to Delia told her to get up & make the fire & then go down & wake Minerva that we might have an early breakfast.  She got up & made the fire.  I told Eliza to go in to make Mamma�s fire, & ask what clock it was by her Watch.  The clock had run down, so I had not heard it strike.  Mamma sent word she thought it was Midnight, for she had not been to sleep since she went to bed.  I was shocked, & there were Eliza & Delia, bed put away, fires made, & ready to commence there days work at Midnight.  Eliza had even been downstairs to Minerva, who said she had just gone to bed.  They laid down by the fire & we all went to sleep again & slept for some hours.  I laugh whenever I think of it.

	   I hope you have the list of books I wrote you.  I only mean you to buy them if you see them at the Auction & they are sold for very little.  I thought it would be better for you to purchase them than others you know nothing about & may prove to be of no value.  I know them all to be beautiful, interesting & valuable & know that you even would be pleased with them.  I dare say you will meet with none of them, as they are books that meet with ready purchases, & are not often sold at Auction.  Bulwers novels were really cheap.  His latter works would be worthwhile getting at that price.  If you see the book I mentioned written by Mrs. Hamilton & Hints on Nursery Discipline & by looking over them think they will be of service to me in training Will, bring them to me as my present.  They will be more useful than a Gold Thimble.  Indeed there are so many necessaries that we must get, that I would be loth to wear a Thimble of such value, while we are denying ourselves so many other things so needed.  I would rather give Delia some good clothes.  I am now making her the d[ress] I bought.  I have cut it & fitted it very nicely.  Margarets working here has been of great advantage.  From helping her so much I am more expert in doing the difficult parts of a dress, which otherwise I might never have known how to do well.  I have promised Delia another dress & a few aprons.

	I sent to the Mill for a barrel of Flour on Saturday.  I did not pay for it, so I have contracted one debt for you to discharge on your return.  I gave John your message about the Cow & he says the Cow has as much as she can eat.  He says of Mamma�s horses, the one is 10 years old & the other only 9.  He insists upon it, says he has made particular inquiries.  I suppose he thinks since he has had the care of them they have improved so much that they have dropped some of their age.  Lawyer the other day brought you some Fodder, & after putting it away came in to ask for a dram.  As I poured the Whiskey out, I asked him how much I should give him.  When I had nearly filled the cup, he said that would do.  I said that will make you drunk.  He replied, Oh no!  I never get drunk.  I engaged from him a bushel of Potatoes.  He brought them the next day.  I paid him 37 ? cts, the price asked now.  He said they were as good Potatoes as were ever eaten.  On cooking them everyone proved to be decayed.  Yesterday Mamma called to Castles as he was passing.  He replied he would not come.  As then he was in a hurry, but would come tomorrow., that he was going to bring Lizzy some Potatoes.  I had engaged some from him.  James Williams is out of Jail.  I wish very much to know whether Mr. Townes or Mr. Butler is elected.  I would send to ask Mrs. Townes, but if he is not elected, she may feel mortified to send word no.  Who do you think will be Governor.  So Mr. Magrath has not been made Attorney General.  I hope he will gain the object he has in view without that.  I am glad you were not a Candidate.  I expect even you would have beaten.  The village is very quiet & there is no news that I know of.  We all think it is much pleasanter than in Summer.  Mrs. Croft leaves in a fortnight.   

		As I have written two such long letters, you must not be disappointed if you do not hear by next Mail.  I will write if I have time, but I am very busy.  Mamma Susan & Ann send their kindest regards to you, & Will I am sure would if he were awake & could speak.  Mamma & Susan have returned from Mrs. S�.  Mrs. Carson, Miss McBee & Mrs. Marant & Miss Anderson were there.  Mrs. Marant is willing to let persons have her servants if they will only [word obscured] & feed them , paying no wages whatever.  She offered Dianna to Mamma & a little boy also [word obscured] she is the favored one if the offer is accepted.  There are so many servants now to be hired, it is difficult to get places for any.  A great many have been here to apply.  Yours truly & sincerely, E.F. Perry
