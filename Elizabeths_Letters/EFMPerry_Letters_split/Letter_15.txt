Letter 15

Wednesday morning, 24 November [1841]
Greenville

My dear husband

	According to promise I have taken up my pen to write to you , & hope sometime during the day you will be employed in the same way.  I suppose you arrived at Columbia safely Sunday night & by this time have recovered from your fatigue.  You have been gone so short a time, that I have not much to relate,  but I will tell you all that I think will interest you.  I have been out but once yesterday for a little while to ride.  It has been raining, or looking like rain I think ever since you left.  I saw Mamma on Sunday.  She stopped for a little while on her way from church.  She said she was afraid John delivered you a very odd message from the answer he brought back to her.  She says she sent word to you that you must take great care of yourself, for you were of so much importance to us all, we could not do without you, and he brought back as your answer, �that the prayers of righteous men availeth much.�  I told her Johns message, that she would pray for you, and you must pray for me, and that you told him to tell her, that you expected her prayers would do you more good, than yours would her.  So John was very incorrect in his message.

	I suppose you would like to know how I get along with the servants.  I have had no quarrels with them.  I get along quietly, but am not near as happy as I was this time last year when I was a simple Captain with one good Craft under my command.  My promotion has brought along with it so many cares, that I believe I would be willing again to occupy my former position.  Minerva is in good humor (and from this I judge that harmony exists in the kitchen).  She goes about her business, and does not complain of having too much to do.   Delia sleeps in the room with me at night.  Her only fault is not coming the instant I call her, and doing immediately what I tell her to do.  I read to her last Sunday some verses in the bible.  I selected those that told servants to be obedient to their owners, and one in particular that suited her.  �Servants be obedient unto your Masters, and please them well in all things, not answering again.�  George has been at home several days.  He said the ground was too wet to work at Mamma�s.  Today he is raking up the leaves in the front garden, and James is carrying them to the Stable.  George says the morning after you left, Mr. Cleveland as he was passing by, walked into the lot, and garden, & examined the piggery &c.  As he looked at the hogs in the pen he said, �Did Perry raise all those hogs?�  George said, �yes, and two more that we killed fatter than any of those.�  He then looked at the Manure.  �Did Perry make all that Manure?�  George said, �yes every bit of it?�  He then looked at the Turnips.  �Did Perry raise those Turnips?�  George said, �yes! and and pulled up one to show how large it was.�  Well I declare Mr. Cleveland said, if Perry is not beating all of us.  Ninny takes care of the baby & washes its clothes.  She goes home at night.  Eliza works, she has made one frock for Willy since you have been away.  I do not think her work will pay for her food & clothing.  I see her only when it is necessary.  I have had no cause of complaint against her, but doing her best she is such an unpleasant servant, that intercourse with her is disagreeable.  The Pigs, George says, are doing remarkably well.  I have not seen them, the weather not permitting me to walk to the lot.  The Cow does well as when you were here, that is tolerable.  Victoria gives no Milk, and Rose about two quarts a day.  Minerva says she milks Rose clean, & Victoria will give none, unless the calf sucks, & that she wont do.  Your horse is well, and I believe everything else about the Lot, particularly the Muses.  Willy I think I am making a better boy.  I find it much easier to make him good, when he is in the house & away from Clara & Edward.  I used to think he would be a better boy if he had children to play with, but I think it is the reverse.  He & Clara are constantly quarreling.  She came to me a minute ago saying he had struck her.  The book I have been reading, has been of great assistance to me in teaching me how to bring up Will.  �The Mother at Home.�  You must read it.  I hope by the time you come back, Willy will be a good boy.  He has been more obedient to me within a few days past, than he has ever been.  I have whipped him very little, but I have been positive with him in making him do what I told him.  He speaks of you very often.  Little Anna still suffers with wind and acid stomach.  I was obliged today to send for some Infant powders for her, which I hope will so benefit her, that when you return you will have no more of wind, that enemy of infants.

	I wish you to execute a commission for the house.  I wish you to buy a pair of Table covers for the Tables in the dining room.  The one on the table in the middle of the room is so much soiled & faded I have been obliged to take it off, & the other one is very much faded too, so you must get a pair of Covers.  I think Scarlet Covers are very pretty, but you may follow your own fancy.  The Covers must be 1 yd. and ? square.  If you cannot get them that size a little larger would be of no consequence but they must not be smaller than 1 ? yd.  You must send the Covers by Col. Townes, or the first opportunity that occurs.  You  understand the size, one yard and three quarters square, and Scarlet ones I think are pretty, but exercise you own taste to get what you think pretty.  They will be about $1.50 a peice $3 a pair, or perhaps a little more.

	Mamma begs you to ask Mr. Roper when he writes to Mrs. Roper to ask her to send her bundle by someone going to Columbia, and you send it to Greenville by the first good opportunity.  You must excuse this badly written letter my dear husband.  I have written in a great hurry, part of the time with the baby in my arms.  I have met with so many inter[r]uptions it is now quite late, after dinner, & I have a shocking pen.  My other letters shall be mates.  You must not be uneasy about me.  I get along quite well though I miss you more than I can express.  I am willing for you to be absent every winter a month at the Legislature, as long as the people will send you.  Mamma Susan & Ann desire their best love.  Ann feels unusually badly at present.  You must write me everything.   I have heard two books highly spoken of & recommended to get them, which you may get if you wish.  �The Queens of England,� �Life of Miss Landon.�  Lately published.  They are the kind of books I like.  I must now conclude my dear husband, the baby is crying for me.  Believe me Ever Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry
