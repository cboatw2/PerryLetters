Letter 195

Friday morning, 12 December[1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have been visiting this morning, & have just returned.  It is 1 oclock so I have not much time to write to you.  After dinner I am going to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Willie is going to drive me in the Buggy.  Reuben is at the Farm cutting wood, & Charles wants Jock to plough some beds in the garden this afternoon.  This morning Willie drove me in the carri[a]ge.  I received your letter last night, in which you mention you had to be in three places at the same time.  I wish to know how you managed.  I expect self interest governed you, & you went to Court.

	Frank says you must bring each of them, that is Willie & himself a pack of Crackers, but I expect you can get them cheaper here. 
	Some of the news I heard this morning is, that Mrs. Campbell has a daughter.  Two weeks ago it was born.  I am glad Mr. Campbell had not a son to boast of as a Secession boy.  Miss Lewis is engaged to Mr. Ioor, to be married the 30th of this month.  Perhaps you will recollect I predicted this match, when I saw them together at Professor Hale�s lecture.  I said he would be glad of a little property & she would be glad of a husband.  I went to see Mrs. Arthur this morning, as I am going to change the pew.  I thought I would go just to see her, to show her I was not vexed with her, though knowing you do not speak to Mr. Campbell.  She had no business to take the pew she has.  Mr. Campbell does not wish to sit behind you, you who have never illtreated him, & yet wishes you to sit behind him, he who has abused you.  You will say it is a little matter, & it is, but it is matter enough to make me feel very disagreeable at church, a place where I ought to feel pleasant, so I will arrange matters, that my seat may be pleasant & free from insolence & impertinence.  Mr. Campbell last Sunday sat with his face turned entirely towards our pew, so we could see the whole of his face.  I think he is the most vain, conceited person I ever saw.  He beats Mr. Jones.  Next Sunday, his self conceit will be pulled down.  I found Mr. Arthur reading the Patriot.  He said the verses were very complimentary to you.  I Iold him the Author wrote word.  I ought to be proud of my position as a Wife.  I like him, much better than Mrs. Arthur.  I hope to hear tonight from you.  I read your letter in the Patriot this morning.  It was such a short one.  I am really surprised you do not take part in the Convention bill, & the Bank bill, that you do not raise your voice to defeat them.  It is what you owe your Constituents. To do all you can for them, to relieve them from Taxes, & oppression.  I am glad you are grateful for my advice.  If I had time, I would put you under further obligations, but I am obliged now to stop.  I will write you a longer letter tomorrow.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
