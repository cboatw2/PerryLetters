Letter 259

My dear husband

	I went to St. Michael�s church this morning.  Aunt Elizabeth called for me.  I did not see Uncle Arthur.  He went to Grace church, Mr. Pinckney�s church to hear the new Bishop.  Mr. Arthur preached at St. Phillips.  It was an old sermon but Aunt Elizabeth liked him.  The Bishop preaches this afternoon at St. Phillips.  Perhaps I may go there.

	Yesterday afternoon Aunt Brewton called to see me.  She said I must take tea with her Monday.  Aunt Anna Turnbull then called for me & took me up to the Magnolia Cemetery 3 miles out of the City.  It is a beautiful spot on Cooper river.  The river winds along through the grounds.  A bridge is across it.  In one spot, there is a Gothic chapel in the midst, & some beautiful monuments, one recently erected to a Mr. Jones a stranger who died here, by his widow cost 6000 dollars.

	After tea last night, Aunt Mary McCall called to see me, & before she left Mr. Isaac Hayne & his wife called.  I was surprised.  I thought after my conduct to him, they would both have passed me without notice.  They were very affable, & from this time we must bury the hatchet, for really I feel sorry for him.  He has the same abstracted look Mr. Treville has, except more worried, so I have come to the conclusion, that the Attorney general�s�is never out of their minds, that as the Contest is always such a close one Mr. Treville is looking forward to getting it, but afraid he may not.  Isaac Hayne is looking forward to losing it, but hoping he may not.  His manners are not playful & lively as they once were, so I make allowances for his apparent coldness to you, & believe now, it is unintentional.  He asked about you.  He looks like his father.  

	Aunt Brewton said I must take tea with her Monday.  Aunt Elizabeth said I must dine with her Tuesday, that she was sorry she had seen so little of me.  She is the kindest of my Aunts in law.  She seems to have such a kind heart.  Uncle Arthur & herself have been repeatedly to see me, but I have been out.  Aunt Brewton said her daughter in law, Alstons wife had been, & left her card, but I never received it.  I do not know who has been.  Mr. Arthur this morning called before church.  I was very anxious to see him to know if he had received a box a Milliner was to pack & send to him, but the servant never asked him in.   	

	This is a pleasant house on account of the situation & privacy, but they have but two boys & one woman to attend to the whole house, & one little boy, so I miss not having a servant.  The board for a servant I see on the rules is 4 dollars a week.  If I had brought Clara, she would have saved me 3.25 already.  I have to pay for making a dress & would have gone on messages & shopped for me, so another time I will bring her.

	Write me word what time you think you will be down.  I wrote a note to Aunt Anna yesterday, & said if you were not coming down soon, perhaps I might go to her house, but if you were coming down, it would not be worthwhile to move, & I would give her an answer Monday.  She seemed really sincere in asking me, but I know her disposition, & she dislikes so having trouble & expense, that I am certain she would like me better if I do not stay with her, so I have no idea of leaving this house.  She has been kinder than I expected.

	Mr. Isaac Hayne says Columbia is not as hospitable a place as it used to be.  I expect as Cities increase in population & wealth, they become more fashionable & less hospitable.  

	Aunt Susan Hayne is the only Aunt I have not seen.  She lives very high up & keeps no equipage.  Anna is better, but today I thought she had better not go to church.  I expect this afternoon to go to St. Michaels again with Aunt Elizabeth, & tonight to St. Peters with Aunt Martha McCall to hear the new Bishop.  Dinner is nearly ready so I will close & hope to hear soon from you.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

I have not seen a paper since I came here.
