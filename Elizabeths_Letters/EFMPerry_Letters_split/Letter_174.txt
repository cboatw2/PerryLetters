Letter 174

Sunday night, [15 December 1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		As I thought, I have many things to write about.  I did not go to church this morning, but I did this afternoon.  Next Sunday Mr. Arthur gave out, he would handle preaching morning & afternoon on the subject of Slavery.  As I have no doubts on the subject, & think it a very inappropriate subject for a Sermon, I am not going to church to hear him.  I dare say it will have a political bearing.  It is hard that those in the minority who dare to express their opinion are branded as Traitors, & it is impertinent for persons to be writing to Mamma in that strain, when they know you think as the minority does.  Today Mamma showed me a letter from Miss Drayton, & of course she must allude to Politics, & she expresses herself as follows.  �I suppose you are as much interested in the state of public affairs as I am; things are coming to a crisis, which might all have been prevented by fairness & unanimity in ourselves a few years back & even now unanimity would not only save us, but place us on a better understanding & finer position than we have possessed for years, but alas! Traitors within the camp are often exhibiting their satanic�some bought with Texan lands, with Northern dinners & flattery, or the hope of preferment.  They do not feel, �this is my own, my native land.�  I will say the reward attendant on their course.�  I suppose she alludes to Genl Hamilton & Mr. Poinsett.  I have not seen the letter of the former, but the latter I am sure, if he had not felt �this is my own my native land.�  Would have kept quiet, & not exposed himself to be assailed & persecuted as all who express their opinion on that side are.  Mamma says in the Mountaineer Mr. Poinsetts peice is answered & he is made out to be certainly wrong.  It is signed Tyger & Mr. McBee says Dr. Crook wrote it, & Mamma says Genl Hamiltons letter is ridiculed & spoken of as showing so little sense, that the writer does not believe Genl Hamilton wrote it.  I suppose you will also be scored.  If it were not for the Southern Patriot I believe the Mountaineer governed as it is now & nothing to counteract it, would not leave you a friend in Greenville.  Mr. Pickerell says it is an incendiary paper.  I am more provoked with Dr. Crook than anyone.  He priding himself on his patriotism when he is a selfish designing deceitful hypocrite, nothing but self interest has changed him.  I am sorry I spoke to him the other day.  I never will again, & as for being our Physician, he never enters this house again in that capacity, if I can help it.  He is a Traitor.

		Mr. Croft leaves tomorrow.  I saw him after church.  I forgot to tell him why you had not written to him.  He will be in Charleston before long.  If you choose you can write to him there.   I have given him some Prospectus� to distribute.  I rode with Mr. Croft over to Mamma�s in his carri[a]ge.  He was at Miss Lewis wedding.  He says only about 30 were at it.  Mr. Campbell has rented his house, so he says.  Genl Thompsons wife he told me was neither rich or handsome, that he married her because he wants a family, that his children are outrageous, that Genl Thompson is coming here in January, that he chooses to he can be happy, & if he is not loyal & faithful, her family will take it up.  I hope it is not true that Genl Thompson is to be here in January.  He will ruin the paper.  There never was a man so disliked & thought so dishonourable, & I am truly sorry he is not your enemy as he used to be.  You then flourished, but leagued with him, you will fall with him.  

		Miss Drayton says Jenny Lind is to be in Charleston about the 19th.  That will be about Thursday.  Do you not wish to go to town to & hear her.  If I had known it, I would have proposed going down in the carri[a]ge to meet you in Columbia, & gone on with you to Charleston to hear her sing.  Mrs. Erwin Jones I hear is going down, will meet Mr. Jones in Columbia & go with him to Charleston to hear Jenny Lind,  They have money enough to do anything.  Do not speak of this to Mr. Jones.  I do not wish him to know that I think of her or mention her name for I despise her, & think her as malevolent & bad as ever be.  They are well matched.  Mr. Arthur has some as bad Christians in his church, as you can find anywhere, some who if they do not commit murder, are murderers in heart.

		Scott all today has been lying down.  He eats & drinks  but is too weak to stand well.  The stable is so small he hurts himself when he gets up, strikes against the stable.  You made a great mistake in hav[ing]  so little room for the horses.  I believe that is one reason they are lame & sick so constantly.  They did better in the old sable which was larger.

		You must not forget to buy the few things I have mentioned.  1 dollars worth of Hops, or fewer if you cannot bring so large a bundle.  Some Clover & Blue grass seed for Mamma, a bottle of Otto of Rose for Ann, 50 cts.  You got it at the confectioners I think.  Try & find my bundle that I have told you was to be sent to the Depository.  I am sorry you have said nothing of the writing desks I begged you to inquire the prices of for Mamma.  I would like you to have given me an answer.  I have not looked in the last papers, so I do not know the last news from Columbia, who were run for Governor even.  I was afraid I would see you spoken of as I would not like.  I thought as the majority agreed with you in wishing a Southern Congress, that you though you differed somewhat would on the whole please them.  I expect now you are more coldly treated as Dr. Lieber is, you ought to get those few who do agree with you, to do more for the Southern Patriot than merely take one copy.  They ought to take a dozen & help you sustain it at the commencement when it will need the exertions of every friend.  They ought to tally around you, come to your support.  Your attached [Wife], E.F.P.
