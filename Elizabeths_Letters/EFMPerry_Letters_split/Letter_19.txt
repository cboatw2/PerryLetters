Letter 19

Thursday night, 5 May 1842
Greenville

My dear husband

	It is now past eight oclock.  Margaret has just left me.  She has been here all day,  She is coming again tomorrow which would prevent my writing to you, so I am obliged to embrace this opportunity to enable you to hear by Sunday�s Mail.  I received your letter last night and as you may suppose it gave me great pleasure.  I was glad to hear you arrived safely and enjoyed the stores Mamma and myself provided for you.  I wish I had furnished you more abundantly, for I was afraid among you all you had hardly enough to stay your appetites.  I hope you found the Cherry bounce an agreeable addition to your bread stuff, at any rate that it was not in the way.

	I am sorry you have not been able to purchase �Destiny�, my heart was set upon your reading it.  It is so interesting, and I was desirous you should see that my taste and judgement were better than you imagined.  I think to make up you will have to bring me �Womans Reward� or �The three Eras in Womans Life.�

	You say you hope I have had no trouble with the servants.  I have had none except with George, who I am sorry to tell you has not done as well as usual.  He will not do anything except when he pleases, and it only pleases him to work in the garden.  Day after day he goes into the garden and hoes, hoes, when there are no weeds to be hoed.  He will neither whitewash, scour or cut up wood.  The wood is so large it can hardly be used in the kitchen much less in the house, and these cold days, particularly cold morning I have been obliged to sit without fire, and with my baby looking blue with cold until today when I paid Mr. Goodlet�s Jacob 12 ? cts for cutting up some wood,  Do you not think It would have been much more comfortable for myself & children to have been seated by a warm fire [on] a cold morning, than to have the weeds hoed in the garden.  As for the Scouring I excused him, because he said he had a pain in his shoulder, which he thinks perhaps he will never get rid of and that he may never again be able to scour.  But it put me to great inconvenience to hold the baby while Delia was scouring.  He will not Whitewash either, the only thing he likes to do is to work in the Garden.  I tell you these things to amuse you, and show you what an odd disposition he has.  I am glad you did not purchase him at $500.  It is too much to give for an old man, who will be less and less valuable every day that passes over his head, and who is disabled by Rheumatism from doing almost any kind of hard work.  I think another year you ought to get him�dollars, and the next year for less, particularly if the pain in his shoulder continues.

	Susan & myself rode to Mrs. Tabers one evening  and went over the house; there is scarcely any furniture in it, but of the little there is, there are a few peices I would like to have.  I dare say if she can neither sell or rent the place, she would like to dispose of the furniture, and that she would take very little for it.  There is a painted press such a one  as I have often told you I would like to have; also a wooden Sofa, stuffed, very comfortable, almost exactly the shape of our drawing room, with a pretty cover on it.  It would look very nice in the dining room.  It would be delightful to loll on by the window in summer and by the fire in winter.  You would like it exceedingly.  There were two nice bedsteads, a looking glass, 3 basin stand[s], & a few painted chairs.  These things with a few tables some paint stained, some common pine ones, & two Ottomans is all the furniture in the house.  You must ride there when you come back.

	I am getting quite sleepy & as you can perceive from the mistakes I make, you disapprove of going to bed late, and as it always gives me pleasure to act according to your wishes, present or absent, I must soon close my letter and retire.  I have no news to tell you.  I will be very glad to see you again, but you must not return before you have finished your business.  Do not be worried about me.  I get along quite smoothly and comfortably.  George, I dare say will do better.  I have not been worried by him, only provoked a little at his obstinacy.  You must write when convenient.  You forgot to take the measure of Wills Shoe.  I will send it in this letter.  Do not forget Anna�s carri[a]ge.  She and the rest of us are quite well.  Susan was here today, Ann is suffering a great deal.  Willy says Pa is coming Sunday night.  I bought this pen on purpose to write to you, and Delia has spoilt it by making nose eyes & mouth on a cloth baby.  I heard from Mrs. Townes today.  She was quite well.  Good night.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

If you do not hear by Wednesdays Mail you may know I have nothing to write about.Be sure to get the shoes large enough.
