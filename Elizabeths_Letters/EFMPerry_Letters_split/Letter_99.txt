Letter 99

Tuesday night, 20 June 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I have just received your letter.  I was so anxious & yet afraid to open it, that as usual, it gave me the pain that I have often told you anxiety & fear produces.  This shows you how much interest I feel in your success, & an unfavorable result may produce serious consequences, to me, so this must make you exert yourself  more than ever for the love you bear your Wife do not let her be disappointed.  Mr. Orr is doing all he can, & he will not be particular what means he uses.  You have not so good a chance as you only avail yourself of honorable means, & your friends are also honorable, so you must try the harder in the ways you allow yourself for I would not have you beaten on any consideration.  I am glad you have been encouraged.  I am a croaker like Mr. Norton, & I hope you are not flattering & deceiving yourself.  I am afraid Mr. Norton is only half a Perry man.  In one of his letters he said he had promised Mr. Orr not to do anything against him.  The evening you left Mr. Lester paid me a visit.  He said he heard Washington Shepherd say, (who has been ped[d]ling in Laurens, that you were doing well there, that in G� Wrights neighborhood I think 3 or 4 steady men  who were going to vote for Mr. Orr, changed after hearing both of you speak, & were going now to vote for you,, & that Sullivan was now for Orr, but before the Election he might find it to his interest to vote for you.  Th� Mr. Lester said was warm in your favor.  Mr. Robert Maxwell he said he heard say he would like to be your friend, but you must take care & not make any more Railroad speech, as they might cut you out.  I send you a letter of Mr. Bridwell�s & one from Mr. Simpson, which I opened as I considered it addressed to me, as we twain are one flesh, as Mr. Arthur said last Sunday.  He is decidedly against Mr. Cass, & has objections to Genl Taylor, so your position is like the South Carolina Delegation neutral.  I hope Mr. Orr will be served right, & lose instead of gaining by the position he has assumed.  I dare say he will take some of your friends from you, Mr. Reed for instance, but I hope you will take from him in returning Sunday morning.  Susan & myself went to the Baptist church to hear Mrs. Thompsons funeral sermon.  Mr. Arthur had no service in the morning in consequence of it.  Mr. Bre� spoke of Mrs. Thompson as a most perfect person. Compared her to the beloved Di[s]ciple John, & from his description she was as perfect as our Saviour himself & possessing every accomplishment of mind & person.  Genl Thompson & his family sat in the front pew.  As far as I could tell they seemed composed.  In the afternoon we went to our own church.  I carried Mrs. Walker home in the morning.  On the way back, I was caught in the rain, with my new dress on, the rain came in, & wet it.  I was so provoked I determined not to carry Mrs. Walker home ever again. For after all my kindness to her, she is your enemy.  Mr. Lester said he hardly supposed Col. Walker would vote for you, & what objection has Col. Walker to you.  I suppose you are too far his superior, for him to wish well to.  Yesterday Frank chewed a Lucifer Match & I sent for Dr. Crook to know whether it would hurt him,  He said, no, one match containing too little on it to injure, but I gave him a dose of Castor oil, which I knew would do him good.  Frank found the match underneath the Sofa cushion in my chamber, the having to take Oil, will be a lesson to him never to touch a match again, & I will keep them where there will not be scattered about.  Speaking of the election Dr. Crook said he heard persons say, even those who thought you would be elected that Mr. Orr electioneered so much better than you did.  He said if he had been a Candidate, he would have such opponents as Mr. Mc�, Jones & Elias Earle, & they by electioneering might beat him.  Mr. Orr�s reputation for electioneering is wonderful, but you will prove his reputation is undeserved.  Saturday night Mr. Long�s servant brought the shoes.  Some lady had brought the bundle from Columbia.  They are made up better than I expected.  The material with which they are lined, is much better than that used by the Charleston Shoemaker, but the shape, & the work is not fixed as pretty.  Instead of putting all of my work, he cuts off some of it.  The red pr I last worked, he was obliged to make according  to the shape I worked them, & they look beautiful.  Today I sent Mary to the farm, to hoe, & kept Jim to whitewash the living room.  When the carpet was taken up, there was an immense quantity of dirt underneath.  Tomorrow Jim will go to the farm, & Mary will wash the paint.  Thursday  I will again keep Jim to whitewash the Entry & send Mary to the farm to hoe, then the housecleaning will be finished, & then Mary will at her leisure whitewash the fences, & Jim when you can spare him, the kitchen & chairs.  Yesterday the Rye was cut.  We have had showers every day since you left.  Yesterday it rained almost all day.  I thought of you, but hoped you were beyond the rain.  Minerva is not taken sick yet, but one of Willie�s Sows has been, & brought forth her first pigs 6 in number, 2 of which died, & 4 are living, & Willie says he has another one about to have pigs.  Mr. Beattie this afternoon sent an account for the Gingham dress I bought months ago.  I had a receipt for it & kept it in my Wardrobe until last week.  I thought I would never have any use for it, & tore it up.  I am so provoked that I did.  I wrote him a note, which satisfied him, but I would have been delighted to have had the receipt to have shown him.  Tonight two notes came from Dr. & Mrs. Thomas inviting us to their house the evening of 4th of July.  Perhaps Dr. Thomas� daughter is to be married.  I was in hopes you would have stopped to have seen Col. Keen Saturday as you passed.  I forgot to tell you to.  Do stay in Pickens as long as you can & electioneer, go over every part of it, that you possibly have time to, & bring me back good news.  I wish you to beat Mr. Orr severely, & in future making [page torn] afraid to contend with you.  Mary McLeod said today, that Mr. Sam Earle did not even write to his Wife, & here are we  when absent only a few days, writing to each other.  I send you all the papers & letters that have come for you.  No one has been to inquire for you.  Do try & bring some money with you, so that you may not have to borrow to return Mr. Folders money.  I am certain you can get someone to pay you.  If you could see Josiah, I am sure he would be able to pay you some.  Eveline says Col. Dunham  is better, & his mind is restored, but I do not know whether this is true.  I have no news to tell you.  We are all well.  Willie is head.  Fanny looks a great deal better, & is more interesting than ever.  She kicked Frank this morning when he was asleep.  Frank without knowing it, pushed her, & she was quite indignant & tried to push him out of bed.  It is past 10 oclock.  I am writing with a bad pen & bad light.  I know you are very particular, but you must excuse my shabby letter.  I am also sleepy, not having taken my usual nap.  If you come back too soon, you will find us in the midst of housecleaning, so you need not hurry home, not that I do not wish to see you, but I wish you to be better employed, in shaking hands with the men, kissing the women &�the children on your knees.  Good night my dear husband.  Write me by Col. Town[e]s.  Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P.

Frank was 5 years old yesterday,  Fanny will be 1 year old Saturday.

My dear husband

		I will write you a few lines to inform you of all that has happened since you left, to prevent your being uneasy & hurrying back sooner than you ought, & when you hear all, you will find you could not be from home at a better time than now.  Frances left yesterday, & she had scarcely gone, when Minerva was taken sick, & in a short time was delivered of a girl, & both doing well.  She will now be up when Frances returns in a month.  Mamma Susan & Mr. Arthur dined with us Wednesday & with�assistance I was able to prepare a nice dinner.  Delia was sick all day.  What with her sickness, the company, the ironing has been so retarded, that scarce any is done, & now Minerva confined.  I expect to live comfortably for a long time, as I have been living ever since Mary�s sickness.  So I advise you to take this opportunity & do all the Electioneering that is to be done between this & October.  You will fare better anywhere than at home, for with Delia sick & at the same time our cook we will necessarily live economically, & it will be a convenient necessity.  Money is universally scarce.  Mr. Sharpe said he heard a merchant say, he did not believe there was 50 dollars in Greenville.  You had better bring back some money from Laurens.  I dare say if you try you will get interest money, or from someone that owes you.  If you can pay the money you have to without borrowing I will be so glad.  I never wish to go into debt.  You saw Mrs. H� with me.  She  came to beg a great favor, that I would lend her four dollars, to pay a debt, but I had neither inclination or power to�her going into debt, for the purpose of getting out of debt.  Before she left, Mrs. Walker came, with a subscription for the organ headed with her name 5 dollars, & she wished mine placed next.  I told her I had put down 100 for the church which I ought not to have done in your absence, & I was not going to contract any more debts.  She said if anyone gave for the church, you ought to,  for you were the first Lawyer here, & had a most extreme�.  She forgot that she once said, no Lawyer made enough here to clothe his Wife.  She was quite vexed, & said she had done so much for the church, her work would amount to 100 dollars, but that everyone must do as they chose, & I told her I thought so too.  The next time I will ask her how much she has�for the church.  Little did I think we would have so much cause to regret her joining our church.  If it was not for her, the church would remain just as it is, which it ought to until they have enough money to build a new one.  After she left Mrs. Tom Lowndes stopped to leave a bundle for Mamma, & begged me to go to the Working Society where she was bound, & said I must go & see her.  I told her I would go to the Society when I could, but that time will be very far off.  Yesterday Susan & her children dined here.  In the afternoon we set off to go to Mrs. Stones, but it rained, & we had to turn back.  It poured, & today Jim says the ground is too wet to plough, so this afternoon if it does not rain we will go, & then I will not take the carri[a]ge until the�is finished.  Willie went to the Methodist Fair, but he said he wished himself at home.  He was obliged to stay until after 11 until Frank Hoke came away.  I was uneasy & sent for him, but he was then on his way home.  I expect very little was made, but I have not heard.  I write to you my dear husband, though you did not request it, but I think if you hear that all at home are well, you will stay away with more comfort.  Otherwise you might come home sooner than you ought, merely to see how things are going on.  I wish your mine to be at ease respecting home.  I hope to hear from you this evening.  You must do all you can for yourself.  The time is approaching, & I tremble at the result.  I hope & trust that you will be successful;  you deserve it, but merit does not always bring its reward.  Art, intrigue, vanity & deceit, often triumph. Therefore it behooves you to do all that is honorable to ensure success, & I think as yet you have done but little, & but little time remains.  New questions have been started.  You must try & see your way clear before you.  If you can you must see my friend Mr. Barksdale & the other brothers that you have not been to see yet.  I see all the communications you wrote for the Herald about Burnley & Johnson, in this mornings Mountaineer.  I hear Mr. Croft is to be married tonight.  I hardly think he would choose Friday, & Caroline Earle next month to Mr. Mills.  You ought to be thankful that your property is gradually increasing as you have now an additional negro.  Minerva[�s] children do not interfere with her work, as Mary�s baby did.  Frances came just at the right time,  She will stay one night when she returns.  I would like very much to go to Pendleton this summer, stay at Mrs. Heywards.  I always prefer boarding to a private house, (except Mrs. Cunninghams), but Frances pressed me to stay with her & said you may but the persons I like most Mrs. M� for instance, she seems to have little to do with, never seen Mrs. Burt even.  The village is very quiet.  Susan said she heard Mr. N� was going to stay six months in Stewarts store N. York.    You affectionate wife in haste, E.F.P.
