Letter 108

Friday morning, 3 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	Again has the day come around for me to write to you.  I assure you it is a great interruption to your work, but I am willing to be interrupted if it is any satisfaction to you to hear.  I judge of you by myself, & I am not willing a�Mail should come without bringing me a letter.  I have just been reading the Mountaineer.  I miss your letters, they were more interesting to me than any others.  You are Chairman of Finance & Banks.  You must recollect what Mrs. Colcock told me last winter in town, that her husband though President of the Bank, disapproved of it, & said it was of no advantage to the State.  I read Mr. Sullivans letter about the Rail Road meeting, & he clearly shows, that it was from manuvering beforehand, that the Convention terminated so unfavorably for Laurens & Greenville.  If there are to be as many R[ail] Roads through the State as are now projected, after they are all built, they will not be able to pay their own expenses, for there is not freight or passengers enough for all.  It was the patronage of the greater part of the State, that was to make the Greenville Road profitable.  She was to get help from all, but now that help is to be divided.  One thing I am glad of that you are released from the payment of your Stock, & when you submit again, you must only subscribe one thousand dollars, the sum that so many richer than yourself subscribed.  I received your letter Wednesday night.  I am sorry that you spent Sunday writing letters.   I know that going to church alone will not carry us to heaven, but I think it shows our hearts are not in a right state, when we think it of no consequence to say Gods�.  �Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy.�  It certainly was not holy, to be writing Electioneering letters.  I wish you to write the letters, but not take the Sabbath Day for it.  Abridge time from your sleep. business or pleasure, but not from that day.  You have been peculiarly prosperous, & you above all others, ought one day in reserve to return thanks to God in his house for all his mercies to you.  I like to go to church on Sunday, not that I think performing that duty, & leaving others undone, will benefit me, but keeping the Sabbath holy is one of Gods commands, & I can keep it more holy at church than anywhere else, & it is a respect we owe to a time honored custom, but I did not mean to say so much.  You are as Judge Butler said of Cousin Harriett his second wife, you are near perfection.  I wish you to be perfection itself.  If Col. Benjamin Perry opens my letters, he will think his wife has grown very sensible, that he was not aware how superior she was before.  You ought to have learnt by this time always to look at the back of your letters, & open them very carefully, & look at the signature.  I am sorry you refused lending Mr. Jones the money.  I would not have lent 50 but 25 dollars to show my good will, & it would have put him under obligations to you, which would have been to your advantage.  You must consider it a compliment as I do to be requested to lend.  My neighbours have much better opinion of my obliging disposition than I have of theirs, for I scrupulously avoid borrowing from them, knowing their closeness & illiberallity, but they constantly let me know that they think me just the reverse of themselves.  Unless you have been very extravagant, you certainly have money to spare, so you must repent of your unkindness, & go to Mr. Jones immediately as soon as you receive this, & say Mr. Jones here are 20 dollars, I find I can lend you, you are welcome to it, if it can be of any service to you, I am sorry I have not more to spare.  He will be grateful to you, & he will then be able to bring his Wife & children a present, & even if he never returns it, I would rather lose it, than be disobliging.  It gives me great delight to oblige others.  I find it hard to refuse.  I expect that is the reason you are blessed with your dear Wife.  I knew it would break your heart, hard as it is, if I refused you.  I am certain Mr. Jones will return the money, so lend him some, & not be disobliging.  He must have been hurt at your refusing, & you had more than usual in your purse, & ought to have been glad to have it in your power to assist.  

	Yesterday it was cloudy all day but did not rain.  Last night it rained, but stopped before breakfast.  It continues cloudy, & is wet & damp.  Perhaps it is well we have not killed the hogs yet, as it is rather warm, & they are so fat, they might have spoiled.  Jim is today putting the cabbage under a shelter.  Mr. Hoke he said intended killing hogs next week, I suppose if the weather is cold.  Jim said Mr. Hoke intended sending me 10 or 15 bushels of Potatoes, & when I had used those he would send more.  Instead of that he has sent me about 1 bushel.  I think Jim worked for him 7 or 8 days.  Willie & Anna are at school.  I told Willie I was going to write to you.  He asked if I was going to say they had been good children.  I told him I would say, pretty good, which meant not very good & not very bad.  He said I must not say, pretty good then.  I think they are as children go good, just as good, if not better than most, & they have honourable feelings.  Anna this morning got up before the fire was made, dressed, came down & got her book, & went upstairs, & commenced reading.  She is very quick, in all she does.  I feel very much interested in teaching them, & I am glad to bring the little knowledge I have into use.  I do all of Willie�s sums for him.  He is now even with Frank Hoke who is 15 & Willie is 8.  His last letter was written in a hurry.  Dilia Derbeck came home with Anna, & she distracted his attention.  He will write soon again.  Fanny is very sweet & good.  In the evening when she wont go to sleep, I lay her on the pillow on the floor, & she is happy kicking up her feet.  She can put her foot in her mouth.  She is so quick & active & lively & strong & sweet & good.  She loves Delia & me.  I expect she will not go to you.  She knows strangers & does not like them  & she will think her Papa a stranger.  I dare say my dear husband you would like to take a peep at home, but when you are homesick, recollect if you were at home, you would be worried by Wife, children, & servants, which worriment you have not now.  You have no one to scold you.  At Washington you will find it much pleasanter than Columbia.  There will be so much there to interest & improve you, & come May, I may go on to see you.  Instead of six months you will have to go six years, but that circumstances  will determine, when you see how your business goes on.  I will make any sacrifices for your happiness, & I think it will be happiness to you associating  with the great & learned, & seeing men & things.  No happiness is without�, but perhaps ,you can even make arrangements, sometimes to have your family with you, hire out all our servants, & give up housekeeping in the winter, but I am calculating too surely.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Yours truly & sincerely, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
Columbia
