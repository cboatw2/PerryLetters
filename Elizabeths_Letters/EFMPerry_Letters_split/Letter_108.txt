Letter 108

Monday afternoon, [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	Mr. Elford called here little while ago, to say he was going to Anderson tomorrow & would take a letter, so I will write a few lines.

	Yesterday I had a very bad headache, owing to the trouble & fatigue I had had with the children who were here Saturday.  I am so unaccustomed to have my quiet disturbed, that having even one person stay in the house any time, fatigues me, so that I feel the effects for several days after, so in future I intend to trouble myself very little about company, only your friends to stay one night at a time I am willing to have.

	I am glad you have decided at last about Kossuth.  He is too bad a horse to be at the expense of feeding.  I sent word to Mr. Elford to advertise him, horse saddle & all you bought.  The bridle which is broken, I will have mended.  I will be delighted to have the 145 dollars back in your pocket as soon as you sell Selim, & the first fine pr of horses you come across buy.

	Mr. Ward came here today to see you to know if you had heard from Mr. Harrison about his Land case.

	A letter came from the office today from Mr. Gordon, begging you to cash his bond as you had proposed, that he had written to you at Columbia about it, but supposes the letter miscarried.

	If Mr. Elford can take your brush which by mistake I left out, I will send it to you.

	Write by Mr. Elford.  Your letters are always a comfort to me, & break in upon my loneliness.

	Stop to see Mrs. Dub�.  I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you, & pay you some large fees.  It is time to have a settlement.  We are all well.  I have nothing new to write you, take care of yourself, particularly in the fever country you pass through & believe me, Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. I do not mean that I intend to give up all company for the children, but when they wish it, it will be one or two at a time to spend the day & when they wish a larger number it must be in the evening.
I love to have my house to myself.  It is a privilege to be alone.  A boarding house is the last thing I would keep.

My dear Anna

	I am sorry you have such bad weather in Columbia.  You will find it duller than at home.  I hope you are behaving well.  You must write what purchases you make.  I sent the Book marks to Mary Mauldin & Mrs. Hopkins & they each sent word, they were very much pleased with them.  Mrs. Hopkins said she must look for something for you.  The pincushion Mrs. Hoke gave you & you intended giving to Aunt Harriet McCall, you had better not give to her, as it would be making a difference between her & your other Aunts, which would not be right.  You can give it to someone else, Sally Martin perhaps.  I would rather you get a Cloak, a nice one to wear to church, in preference to anything else.  Get the Cloak first & then what else you need afterwards.  Aunt Mary McCall wrote me word she had got a Cloak for herself in New York, where she was the past summer, & I have written to her to get me a Cloak.  Mr. McKay is going down next week & will bring it up.

	I hope you have given your Papa no trouble.  You must not interfere with his business.  Let him attend to that, even if you are left alone the whole day.  Tell Aunt Harriet when you see her, that I have not forgotten her Pincushion & needle�& as soon as I can get a pretty pattern will make them.

	Aunt Eliza wrote word that Mrs. Isaac Hayne & Eloisa Martin being in Columbia would make their social circle much smaller than usual, but there were many who would take a kind interest in you & she would carry you to see all of our friends.

	In a City you must remember persons are more particular than in the County, & as your good behaviour will reflect credit on your Parents, you must keep that in mind & acquit yourself well.  I do not wish you to be grave & restrained.  Be lively & happy, but be correct in all your words & actions.  As soon as you get down, have your patches cut out, so you can have some employment.  Aunt Mary or Aunt Eliza or Eliza or Sue will cut them for you.  Practice every day on the Piano.  Read your Prayer book & say your Prayers, begin your day well, & it will be apt to end well.

	I will now close.  Hext is asleep in the cradle.  Fanny is busy fixing something in the Entry.  Willie I expect is in the Library, & I do not know where Frank is.   Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.
