Letter 212

Sunday morning, 28 November 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	This is a bright pleasant day, but as I am not altogether prepared to go to church, I will stay at home, write to you, take care of Hext, as Charlotte is going to church, & read the services to Fanny.  Willie & Frank are going to church.

	 I have not received a line from you yet.  Yesterday I expected certainly to hear but did not.  Today I supposed I would but no Mail came from beyond Newberry.  Tomorrow no Mail comes at all, so until Tuesday, the ninth day since you left, I will not hear, but I bear it patiently, hoping it is your business, that has prevented your writing, or the irregularity of the Mail that has prevented my receiving what you have written.  It will be a great satisfaction when I do hear that you have arrived safely in Columbia & are well & Anna enjoying herself.  This is the fifth letter that I have written, so you have heard every day since you reached Columbia.

	The weather cleared Friday evening & is now very fine.  Charles is anxious for you to buy some Kentucky hogs before you come back, says those that pass by now are better & cheaper than they will be later.  Shall I tell Mr. Hoke to buy some? or wait until you return.  He has not bought the Hog yet.  We do not need it for immediate use, as we have a supply of Beef.  It would only be to put away for future use,  John is better of his cold, & was out yesterday, but complaining of Earache, which he sometimes has.  He is going to church this morning, so must feel well.  The rest of us are well.

	Fanny amuses herself as well as she can, but often wishes someone to play with, but is better alone, as she then cannot quarrel.  Yesterday she & Hext went up to Mrs. Hopkins to carry two little presents to Miss Eliza & Rosa.  She returned with two presents for herself, a pincushion & little tiger, & is anxious to give more presents, that she may get a return.  She wishes Anna had gone long ago & come back so as to show her all the pretties.  Nothing at all has come from the Post office for you since you left. 

	I have nothing new to tell you, have not been out once, & seen no one but those I told you of before.  I am busy working all the time for the servants.  Baylis & Becky have Prayer meetings every night in their room, except Friday night, when they have it in Eliza�s room.  I hope they will cause a reformation in the yard.

	You must write me everything, whether you think Jones will be elected Treasurer.  I wont feel easy until he is beaten, for he is too unprincipled to be rewarded, & if he is, I will think it only requires a person to be vain, presumptuous, a fool & unprincipled to succeed in this world, for never has a man been more undeserving of success than him.  Merit & deserts do not meet with their reward & are not appreciated; that I know & feel from your experience, but I trust & hope, you will even yet be rewarded not by you own conscience alone, but that the consciences of others will make them honor you, in some tangible shape, give you an office or Honor that will show the whole world you have been appreciated.

	Give my love to Anna.  She forgot her Veil.  She must buy one.  I hope she is pleased, not disappointed in her anticipations, & able to get along alone, & been a good girl.

	Hext is now pulling me, & crying for me to take him, so I must stop.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
