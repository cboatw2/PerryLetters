Letter 164

Thursday night, 28 November 1859
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.  You must write me every Mail.  I live on your letters & think on the contents of one, until I get another.  Your news as regards Politics is cheering, but I am afraid you are mistaken.  It is a bad idea for Judge Cheves to be thought of as Governor, & I think would be unpropitious  for the State.  Mr. Memminger with his usual hypocrisy, begins with appealing to the Most High, & re commencing a Fast.  He thinks after this, his sincerity cannot be doubted & he will certainly be made Chancellor.  Do you vote against him, & do all you can against him.  He has done more to cause the excitement, at any rate in Greenville, than any other man.  He has deceived the people, & told absolute falsehoods to gain his worldly ends, & then at the same time, pretends he is such a Christian.  He uses both worlds.

		As for Mr. Jones, he is as contemptible & mean a man as ever lived.  He occasions me more vexation than anyone else, for he is constantly doing something so mean.  He gets what he can from the Anti Bank men, & then what he can from the Bank men.  It seems as if he pursues the course to get along, for instead of being treated with the contempt he deserves, he is rewarded.  By treachery he gats into the Legislature, & now by Treachery, he will be elected Solicitor, for it only requires electioneering to succeed.  Court both parties, & he will get what he wishes.  If he is elected Solicitor, I will never get over it.  It will be too provoking to think of, & I have no doubt he will, for he is a better Electioneerer  than Mr. Young.  He is a Member which is an advantage, & he will by his vanity & conceit make the impression that he is a very important man at home.  He is no better than Joe P�.  It is strange he should ever have been tolerated in Greenville, but it seems as if he can act just as mean as he chooses, & yet he is thought not the less of.  I hope Mr. Duncan is now convinced of his true character.

		Mr. Burt�s deceit equals his malice. He has injured you as much as he possibly could  killed your paper in Pendleton as Mr. Keith said, & now to gain your vote, tells a falsehood, & says he ordered your peice to be published.  He did no such thing, & he must think you a Simpleton, to try to deceive you so�.  I hope you have more sense & spirit than to be taken in by him.  Tell him from me, that you have my orders not to vote for him, that if you vote for him, I will never forgive you.  I look upon him, as having helped, more than anyone else, to defeat you for Congress, & you are not to turn round & help him to what he wishes.  With the exception of Mr. Jones, he is one of your greatest enemies, insignificant men, those even you have a contempt for can injure & ruin you.  The�in Cuba can undermine & destroy the strongest foundations.  Mr. Burt need not trouble himself about amusing Willie & Frank.  He shows his interested motive too plainly.

		I am glad Willie & Frank have behaved well.  You must be particular in making them keep themselves clean, have their boots cleaned, their hair parted nicely & smooth, & combed every night with a fine tooth comb.  They must clean their teeth, wear their gloves when they go out, & keep their clothes brushed, & then behave like little gentlemen.  Tell them I hope to hear constantly good accounts of them.  You must get a good supply of clothes for yourself, everything you need.

		I am glad Col. Brockman is right in Politics.  I was fearful not seeing the right side of the question he might go wrong.  I am pleased also that the prospects for your paper are encouraging.  Mr. Elford ought to act for awhile as agent in Charleston.  Miss Anderson told me she wished she had thousands to assist in sustaining the paper, that she would take it of course, & you would find persons springing up in every direction  who would take it.  Now you are in Columbia & see persons from every part of the State.  You must not be backwards in asking them to subscribe & do all they can for it.  Do not forget to stop the Palmetto Banner.  I saw Mr. S�ham the other evening & gave him Mr. O�Hanlon, Mr. Pettigrus, & Mr. McLures letters to read to encourage him.  Mr. Nicol today sent to ask me  if I had heard any interesting new[s] from Columbia to let him know the items.  You must tell me all the news, so I may tell others.  I wish the Mountaineer would let you write for it.  You can tell the people in that way so much, & influence them right.  Anything written for that paper now, by the other party will be entirely false.  Mr. Jones� treachery ought to be known.  He�ll not tell it, but I dare say he will gain by it. In future,  instead of being treated with the contempt he deserves, he will get both Bank & Anti Bank votes.  I always knew he was for the bank, for I dare say he is indebted to it in some way. Either borrowed, or other borrowed for him.

		Minerva has now been 3 days in her room doing nothing, says she cant come out to lift pots & pans.  I tell her she can have Charotte to help her, but she is not satisfied with that.  She wishes Mary & Lindy, & with the small family I now have, & so little cooking, it is not necessary to have a grown woman & herself to cook, so she stays in her room.  I try Bakers bread, & have tea & toast & Eggs & Charlotte looks after the servants.  She makes more fuss than Mrs. Sharpe with her delicate health.  Eliza is up now & sewing.  Reuben instead of wearing his own hat to travel, borrowed a new one of Charles & returned  a different one to Charles from the one he sent him.  Reuben says it must have got changed.  Charles says he knows he sold it, & pocketed the money.  He was in a great passion, when he found it out, but now he is calm & says you will make Reuben pay him.  The horses have rested now, & today Reuben hauled Mr. D� a load of wood  & brought me 50 cts.  It has been raining all day, so he hauled only 1 load.  Mr. Davis went somewhere today on business, so Anna has holiday until Monday.  Tomorrow Dr. Simons scholars speak in the Methodist church.  He has but 2 boarders, but his school breaks up for the holidays this week,

		Miss Anderson was here this morning to borrow books.  She says she hopes you will buy the 3d vol of McCaulay�s history of England in Columbia.  She is anxious to see it.  If you can get the continuation of �Laneton Parsonage,� I would like it.  I have the first one & a second & a third I think have been published.  Also the�Daughter by the same author, & there is a Book called �the lady Alice or the new Una,� which Mr. Brown mentioned as being very fine, I would like, but I only mention in case you have a Book mania  as usual.  Whatever you get, must be something pretty.  

		Mamma wrote today to know if I had heard from you.  She is as much interested in your interests as I am.  The Chronicle & Sentinel has two speeches by Mr. King & Clemens of Alabama, which are very good.  You must get the paper & read them.  If you make a speech, you will find them of service.  I would send you the paper, but I make great use of them.  Mr. Arthur has them now.  Mr. Clemens says from Maryland, N. Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky & Texas & Delaware some of their men have voted for the admission of California, so we must secede from them too.  Mr. Jones goes to Columbia tomorrow, no letters but what I have mentioned have come.  Good night, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
