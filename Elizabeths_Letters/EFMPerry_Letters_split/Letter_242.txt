Letter 242

Monday afternoon, [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	Mr. Elford called here little while ago, to say he was going to Anderson tomorrow & would take a letter, so I will write a few lines.

	Yesterday I had a very bad headache, owing to the trouble & fatigue I had had with the children who were here Saturday.  I am so unaccustomed to have my quiet disturbed, that having even one person stay in the house any time, fatigues me, so that I feel the effects for several days after, so in future I intend to trouble myself very little about company, only your friends to stay one night at a time I am willing to have.

	I am glad you have decided at last about Kossuth.  He is too bad a horse to be at the expense of feeding.  I sent word to Mr. Elford to advertise him, horse saddle & all you bought.  The bridle which is broken, I will have mended.  I will be delighted to have the 145 dollars back in your pocket as soon as you sell Selim, & the first fine pr of horses you come across buy.

	Mr. Ward came here today to see you to know if you had heard from Mr. Harrison about his Land case.

	A letter came from the office today from Mr. Gordon, begging you to cash his bond as you had proposed, that he had written to you at Columbia about it, but supposes the letter miscarried.

	If Mr. Elford can take your brush which by mistake I left out, I will send it to you.

	Write by Mr. Elford.  Your letters are always a comfort to me, & break in upon my loneliness.

	Stop to see Mrs. Dub�.  I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you, & pay you some large fees.  It is time to have a settlement.  We are all well.  I have nothing new to write you, take care of yourself, particularly in the fever country you pass through & believe me, Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. I do not mean that I intend to give up all company for the children, but when they wish it, it will be one or two at a time to spend the day & when they wish a larger number it must be in the evening.
I love to have my house to myself.  It is a privilege to be alone.  A boarding house is the last thing I would keep.
