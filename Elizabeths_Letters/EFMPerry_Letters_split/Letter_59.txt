Letter 59

My dear husband

	I do not know whether to be most provoked or uneasy at your silence.  How would you serve me so, as not to let me hear from you last night, unless you are sick, which I hope & trust you are not.  You have no excuse, for never mind how engaged; you would be spared a few moments to tell me you had arrived safely, & were quite well.  You do not deserve that I should write to you by this Mail, not having heard from you, & were it not, that I dread your feeling the same anxiety that I do now, I would not.  If I do not hear by Wednesday�s Mail, I will be miserable indeed.  It is cruel in you to keep me in such suspense.  I did not think you would be so unkind.  I do not even know if you have reached Columbia in safety.  However I must hope for the best.  I will now tell you all that has occurred since I last wrote.  We have a great deal of rain, so that not much ploughing has been done at your farm, but they have been replanting & hoeing.  The Rye looks well, and the Corn better.  No Cattle have been jumping the fences.  Mary was at the farm the greater part of last week.  Today she is with Delia washing, but tomorrow I will send her out, to remain for the rest of the week.  Very little has been done in our garden on account of the rain, which keeps the ground constantly wet.  It has been weeded once.  The walks have not yet been cleaned.  As soon this week as Delia gets through her ironing, she shall work in it.  I am sorry to tell you that Jim & Maria are getting along very badly.  Yesterday afternoon Maria�s mother Winny came to me crying, & said she heard Jim had been abusing Maria, had beat her, broke her head, & her face, & the flies had blown it, & she said her Master would take Maria back any time.  I told her I did not believe all that, but I was going to the farm then, & would see about it.  So when I went I found Jims abuse of her had been exaggerated.  Maria was alone in the house, everything about her filthy, the floor not even swept, the�pails &c. all dirty.  She showed me a scar on her neck, where Jim had struck her.  I talked to her, & gave her some good advice, about doing better.  I then went on to Charles house & there saw Jim, & told him Maria�s mother had been to me.  He said he had struck Maria about 3 blows, that it was not half she deserved, that she was the worst creature that was & that her mother, father, Mr. Cauble & everybody knew it, that he knew Mr. Cauble would not take her back, for they were delighted to get rid of her, that Mrs. Cauble said she could not make her do anything at all, that people told him about her before he married her, that he felt when he married her, that he was doing wrong, but somehow was forced to do it, that she behaved so audaciously just after she was married, that her father stripped her & gave her 100 lashes so Maria told him, that she is obstinate & mulish, & lazy & dirty, that she wont clean the house, & wash his clothes or mend them, nor even wash hers, that their meals she would give them in dirty plates that they had eaten peas in days before, the peas all sticking to them, that often he had to neglect his work in the field, to clean the house & wash the dishes, that he was sorry when you bought Maria, that at that time he had taken all of his clothes away from her room & had them in the carri[a]ge house, & given or almost given her up, that as you wished to purchase her, he made no objection, & was in hopes when he got her to the farm away from her family she might do better, that she was worse than James, if you watched James he would work, but Maria you could not make work. & the more you coaxed & tried to please her the worse she was, she would not hoe or do anything.  Charles corroborated all he said.  I told Jim as Winny said Mr. Cauble would take Maria back, to ask Mr. Cauble to come & speak to me, for though I would not act in your absence, I would like to know if he would.  So Mr. Cauble came this morning, & to my great sorrow said, Winny has no authority for saying what she did, that nothing would induce him to take Maria back, not if he were given 5 negroes along with her, & he described her character precisely as Jim had done, says Mrs. Cauble would not have her on any account, that she has�learn her nothing, that she is mulish, lazy obstinate & so on, that he would not have her in the yard, that he told you what she was when you bought her, that she could do nothing, not even spin.  If he did tell you all this I think it was astonishing you should think of buying her, & such a high price for a worthless negro.  I want her sold to the first drover who passes.  Jim says through he loves & respects you & would rather belong to you than anyone else, rather than be with Maria he would like you to sell him.  He says Maria can work if she chooses, but she wont & that you are not strict enough with your servants.  You don�t make them work, & Mr. Cauble says you are not a good manager of servants, & I have always said that.  Now I have done with Maria, hoping you will sell her as soon as possible.  I have never liked her.  Elias, Mr. Cauble says you would be pleased with, & if Col. Dunham is willing he will sell him for 600 dollars, but about this I will give no advice.

	Saturday I had the horses & paid with Miss McBee & Reinhardt�visits.  Mrs. Smith we went to see & Mrs. Bradshaw, we went into the garden, which has the greatest variety of vegetables in it.  Some I have never heard of.  He gets his seed from Thorburn N. York, & they are the finest vegetables I have ever seen.  Susan went back to the Factory last Friday & returns today, to remain a few days & go on with her work.  She has not staid with me yet.  I stopped at Mamma�s yesterday & carried herself & Ann to ride a little way.  It was the first time I had seen them since you were away.  I am so busy I will not be able to write to you again.  In my last letter I told you what to get.  India rubber for me.  Hat, ball, picture books for Willie.  Anna says you must bring her a doll, & Frank says an ip (whip) but I don�t say so.  I would like you to bring some little trifle for him, if it were only a 25 cts present.  Do not forget to draw the pattern of a fence.  The Mountaineer mentions Col. Town[e]s is to be the editor for a year & perhaps longer.  I have no news to tell.  I long to see you, & long to hear from you.  The children are quite well, & often say, �I want my Pa� & I reply I want him too.  Yours, E.F.P.
