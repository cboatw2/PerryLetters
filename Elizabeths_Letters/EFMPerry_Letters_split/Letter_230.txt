Letter 230

Wednesday, 1/2 past 9, 15 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you & I cannot help saying, I feel very sorry when you are so respected by the Members, & appreciated by them that you should not aspire to some of the honors in their gift.  Why do they elect such inferior persons to office as Mr. Glover & Manning, & not elect you who are superior to them.  I believe if you wished it they would elect you, & you ought to have been elected Judge.  The 3000 a year would be a certain income which you rarely ever make.  This Session you seem to have been better treated than usual, & you ought to have tried for something.  You seem to be more popular out of your District now, than in it, & I wish it was known in Greenville, how well others think of you, for I wish everybody in Greenville where you live, to respect & look up to you.  I will live on hope that you will not always be excepted in the distribution of honors, but it is your own fault, even Jones got what he tried for.

	This is another gloomy, rainy, cold day.  The roads will be dreadful.  It has given me no chance of cleaning the house & yard, which need it much.  I wished everything to look nice for your return.  Even the washing cannot be done in this weather, which makes us very uncomfortable, having to do without handkerchiefs, towels &c.  This is no weather to leave home, at least for ladies, so much as I would like to hear you speak in the Legislature, I do not expect to go down, unless it is to see you inaugurated.  I hope the Secessionists voted for you, & another time that they will elect you.  It is strange there have not been more Candidates this time for Judge & Governor.

	The servants say Mrs. Thompson was confined Sunday night & has a Son.  I suppose it was in expectation of that, Genl Thompson was looking in Rice�s Digest at laws respecting property given to children.

	Mr. Rosemond yesterday sent some Lumber for the kitchen. 

	Four Cans of Lard were dried yesterday, & five or six more there will be.  That alone at the price Lard is selling 15 cts a pd, is more than 60 dollars.  The Kentucky Hogs are so fat.  In future I would prefer buying a few of them expressly for Lard, the rest�meat.  We will have a good many Sausages.  The servants are stuffing them today.  We got a machine from Mr. Rutledge which grinds the meat fine instead of chopping it.  We gave Mr. Lasly some of the Back bones, Spare ribs &c.  He & two sons were here the first day; he & his daughter the second.  I would not have had him the second day, but Reuben said he himself would be obliged to haul wood, but it rained & he did not.  Mr. Lasly has 10 children, the youngest 7 months old.  They are too large a family for our small Farm.  I think he has made a good bargain.  He ought to have paid for the house himself.

	I wish you had sent me all of Anna�s letters she wrote you.  I would like to read them.  Letters are my chief comfort when those I love are absent.  My disappointed hopes make me unhappy for a while, but I get over it & hope on.  I now look to favors from the President for you.  I may not write again.  I suppose tomorrows letter will tell me when the Legislature adjourns.  If you do not hear from me again, you may know it is that I have not written, thinking you will leave Columbia before the letter reaches there.

	I do not suppose one wife besides myself has written to her husband every day as I have.  I assure you it interferes with my duties.  I am obliged often to send Hext away crying because he disturbs me, & after writing I am fatigued & unfit for cutting out work & sewing so it makes me waste my time which is precious, for there is sewing still to do for servants & children, & Eliza being near confinement, often feels unwell & has done nothing for me for weeks.  As for myself I have not done the first stick, & what I most need is in the box that has been sent to you & which I hope you will soon send up, or bring up with you.  I give up all to you, as my first wish is that you should be happy, & if I do not write every day, I know you will be uneasy.  I wish your mind also kept calm & quiet so you can attend to your Legislative duties.  Since Mr. Memminger is away, I expect you are the most important member in the house.

	This is dreadful weather, so cold & cheerless, & raining slowly which makes the roads & yards so muddy.  I am glad you have heard from Mr. Livingston.  I was thinking the books had failed, & no more numbers would be forthcoming.  Nothing comes from the Post office for you.  I suppose it is known you are away from home.

	Charles this morning was speaking of Becky in such a satisfied manner, that I told him if Baylis & Peggy were out of the way, I believe he would try for Becky.  He laughed immoderately, & said if he was young he did not know what he would do.  He told Willie Mr. Dean was going to move into the village where Mr. Bacon has been living, so Peggy would be nearer.  He will be saved his long walks.  I hope you will have a safe & pleasant journey home & pleasanter weather than we now have.

	I will now conclude.  My hands are cold & go to the fire & warm.  I hope to hear every day until you return.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

P.S.  I wish Willie had gone with you.  He always improves when with you.  I wish there were better schools than in Greenville.  The Baptist College is a poor affair.
