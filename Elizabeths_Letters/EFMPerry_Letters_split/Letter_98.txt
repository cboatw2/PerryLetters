Letter 98

Friday morning.  You must be sure & pass one night here.  If you cannot come for me to go home, you must come one night during the week.  You know I am to leave here tomorrow week.  I am not going to worry you about the election, if you will only do your duty.  Mr. Orr is so far inferior to you, that if it had not been for these cases, & the influence of Genl�Jones, which is great. & the extensive connexions Mr. Orr has in Laurens district through his Wife who was a Marshall. I would not have been uneasy.  You have not the advantages which he has, in being connected with so many families.  You have so many enemies made by your Law business, which he has not.  You have your merits alone to depend on, & that is the last thing people think of.  I will conclude by saying, I long to see you & love you dearly.  E.F.P.

       If you do not come for me, or do not come at all, write word what house I had better stop at on my way back.  I am inclined to stop at Mr. Barksdale�s where I stopped coming here.  It was so comfortable, or at his brother�s six miles from him, who you have offended, but I hope the cases will be conducted so fair & honorably, that he will change & become your friend again.
       
       If you see the Mr. Barksdale I passed the night in coming here, speak to him, he seemed a good old man.  I do not know his given name.  I thought it was Allen, but Mr. Cunningham says Allen is the name of the one Mr. Richardson drove against.  I expect Jim will stay with him when he comes back, & you if you see him, can pay him or as we go back, you can pay, or I if you are not with me.  You might be friendly also with the other one I should think & explain that he should not be opposed to you, for what is not meant as unfriendly on your part.  Since I have heard Genl C. Jones is such an influential dangerous man, I wish you could have made him your friend again.  I staid with him hitherto.  Now I have expressed all my thoughts I feel easier.  Mr. Cunningham says he has always given you four fifths of Laurens D.  He had no idea until lately, Mr. Barksdale�s cases were to be of so much importance.  He says there is not a more influential family in the whole District.  He says Mr. Orr will make exertions, & after the Canvass commences, you must also.  All knows you to be the superior man, but various motives influence men, & they vote often for those qualified,  but to�revenge & other�.
       
Benjamin Perry
