My dear Husband
        
		Again I have to write to you, & have nothing of importance to tell you, except that I received a letter from Aunt Mary McCall last night, & she says she received the Check for 70 dollars safely presented it to the bank & obtained the money.  Last night Willie went to the Post Office & brought the papers & two letters for the Southern Patriot, but I thought I ought not to open them, so do not know what they contained.  I sent them this morning to Mr. Elford with your Editorial.  

		The weather is still gloomy & cold, no sunshine today.  

		I hope you have before this reached Columbia safely & have pleasanter weather than we have here.  Reuben went to Mr. Suddeth�s, but did not see him.  The servant he saw seemed to think Mr. Suddeth did not intend to take the Cows.  If he does not come & look at them, I will send them to Mr. Fosters.

		Willie & Frank are at school.  Anna has just come home to get her dinner.

		I have to write to Aunt Mary for Susan, so can write you but a short letter.

		Hext is asleep.  The colds generally are better.  I have told the children, whichever behaves the best I will tell you to bring a present to.

		I have not as much to write about as I will have when I hear from you, so I will now close by assuring you, we speak & think of you constantly.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
