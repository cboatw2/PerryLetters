Letter 162

Sunday night.  My dear husband, I will now finish my letter.  I went to church this morning, & heard an old sermon from Mr. Arthur in praise of the Liturgy, which I expect was not interesting to Col Town[e]s & some other Baptists that were there.  Mr. Arthur attends to his worldly business all the week, & then Sunday gives us an old sermon.  This afternoon Mamma sent for me to go & see Susan�s baby which was not well, but it is better than it was this morning, & after paying Susan a visit, Mamma & myself rode up the Anderson road  & stopped at Mr. Tom Butlers house & went over it, & then stopped at Mr. Saxons house where Mr. M� staid & went into that.  Mrs. Carson is to live there, & they are now preparing to plaster it. so Mr. Carson & Mr. Butler will be near neighbors.  The day has been so cold.  I thought tomorrow Charles with Marys assistance had better kill some of the smallest hogs, but he says he has to haul more wood first, & tomorrow he will borrow Mr. Goodletts horse, & put with Selim, & haul a load of wood, & if the next day is cold he will kill some of the hogs.  A good many persons have killed.

		I see in the Chronicle & Sentinel Mr. Kings & Mr. Clemens Senators from Alabama expressing the same views you do.  You must while in Columbia do all you can for the paper.  Get Mr. Pettigru, Mr. O�Hanlon, Mr. Yeadon & all your friends who agree with you to interest themselves in sustaining it.  They ought all to get subscribers for it, for never has a paper been more traduced or have more to encounter than yours has.  The State is so provoked that after buying up the Mountaineer & get that in the proper training, another should be started in the very place, that they know is above a�& may spoil their game.  

		Write me every Mail, tell me everything, & tell Willie to write.  I hope Frank & himself are doing well, & will return improved & do credit to you.  Tell them from me, they must be good boys.  They must keep themselves neat & clean, & they must read in the prayer book every morning & night.  And my dear husband you must act judiciously & wisely.  I do wish you could have been elected Judge or some honorable Office that the world might see you had at least met with your reward for people are apt to think until persons are rewarded, that they do not deserve i, & my ambition is you should be appreciated by others, & you seem further from it now than ever, but I must be resigned & hope that even you will meet with your reward & I believe if you were more anxious for it, you would.  Adieu, your attached Wife, E.F.P.
