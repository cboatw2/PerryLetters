Letter 90

Tuesday morning, 1 December 1846
Charleston

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you last night�third one, & having a few moments to spare, I will spend the time in writing to you.  I am in the Dining room with my Aunts, the children also are playing about.  We have just done breakfast,  I am today to dine at Aunt Susan Hayne�s.  We will then have dined with all I expected to dine with.  On my way there, I intend stopping to see Mrs. Dickson, & Mrs. Ramsay, who both live high up.  I yesterday �ed some visits with Aunt Anna & Martha.  I paid 8, 4 persons � at home, & 4 persons out.  While I was visiting, a great many came to see me, though so many come, I see very few, for I am out when they come to see me, & they are out when I return the visits, so I do not expect to see half of my friends.  We yesterday went to see Mrs. Poinsett, & at same time she came to see us, so we missed of each other.  I have spent my time much more pleasantly than I expected, have been treated very kindly, & like Charleston exceedingly.  There are few who come so well situated as I am, for I abound in relations, friends, & acquaintances.  I mean to try & persuade Mamma to come down next Spring.  She has so many intimate friends, that she would find it � pleasant than I do.  I regret that she ever left Charleston, for though she does not think so, I think she would have been much happier here among her friends who she has known from childhood, & among her relations � I believe are really attached to her.  My interest & duty fixes me in Greenville, & I am perfectly satisfied to live there, & If I can only pay a visit now & then to Charleston, I will be quite contented.  I will � all the year, so as to afford to come.  Aunt Anna has made me more welcome than I expected, so in future when she invites me, I will not hesitate to accept.  Aunt Eliza is so hospitable, that I would not mind staying with her at any time, & if Eloisa had not been with her I would have divided my time with her, so the next time I come, Eloisa will not be with her.  Eloisa is now more cheerful than she was � first & more affectionate.  At first she was so very grave, that it � appear cold, but her affection was so great & so sudden, she must have felt it keenly.  I went Sunday afternoon to the Huguenot church.  It is a beautiful church built in the Gothic style.  Aunt Mary McCall asked me to drink tea with her, but as Aunt Anna would have been expecting me, I did not stay.  Next Sunday I will go to the Circular church, the church in which we were all baptized, & I would like also to go to St. Philips where my paternal relations are buried.  I saw in St. Michaels church yard Uncle Roberts Tombstone, the handsomest one there.  The children are well, & behave better than they did.  I have been quite well.  Sarah the Milliner told me, she had sent some bonnets to Columbia for Mrs. Walker & her daughter, so I suppose Mrs. Walker wishes to try her captivating charms there.  Eliza Thompson leads a more sober life now than before she was married.  If she was single, she would have been in Columbia.  Several persons here have asked me if Genl. Thompson  was not opposed to the match, that they heard he disliked both of his childrens matches.  I am decidedly of the opinion that if a lady cannot marry well, she had better not marry at all.  In Charleston I see so many respectable single ladies, that it may be much more respectable to remain single than to marry one unworthy of you, for a lady rises or sinks to the level of her husband.  With regard to leaving Charleston, I have not yet determined when next week to leave.  I would like to reach Greenville one Mail before the Members go up.  If I knew what day the Legislature adjourns, I would then exactly determine.  As it is, I think I will leave one day next week, but I will write you what day it is as I know you cannot afford I should stay long in Columbia, & I do not care to stay more than one or two days.  I merely wish to see you in the Senate, & take a peek at the House of Representatives, so as to see how things are conducted.  I would rather have the money that it would take to pay our board there, to spend in things here.  I do not wish my bust taken at all, & do not intend to have it.  I would like my portrait taken, when you can afford it.  Aunt Emily had hers taken by Sully.  It looks like her, & yet is a beautiful picture, much prettier than she is.  I believe he takes good likenesses, but also �tters.  So he is just the painter I would like.  His painting is [page torn] is so soft & fine. The one Mr. Barclay took of you was so course.

	I have not been able to buy any clothes for the servants, my money having given out.  If you think I had better buy them here, you must send me some money, & I will buy them.  We will have to get them as soon as we go to Greenville. So it would be�to get them here at a wholesale store.  If you have not the money I would have a bill made of them, & you would send the money when you get home in Greenville.  I expect Mr. Lawton where I would get them, would be perfectly willing to do so . so write me immediately, if I may get them.  If you would send me 10 or 15 dollars for my own use, I would be very grateful, but if you have it not, you must not send it.  To make up for all the expense I have put you at I will try & be a most devoted wife.  I hope some time or other we will have something left us by our kind friends.  Aunt Harriet told me yesterday that a maid [page torn] some years ago, & who if she had lived, would be [page torn], always intended for me, that everything she had should be mine, & I suppose she meant my sisters also, for I would not wish a difference made between me & them.  She has a woman now at the point of death, & the woman has 2 children 4 & 2 years old.  I yesterday went to Klincks for a Jar of preserved Ginger, & gave it to Aunt Anne.  As I was staying with her, I thought I ought to give her something.  She seemed pleased with it.  Before I go away I will give her something else a box of Prunes, Raisins or something of that kind & I also wish to give Aunt Martha & Aunt Harriet my other Aunts I have given Pincushions to, which is sufficient.  It is only because I am staying with these Aunts that I give them anything.  You must excuse this�letter.  It is the first time I have written on paper not ruled.  I will be willing to stay only one day in Columbia, as it is so expensive boarding there.  I hope one of the Judges will be elected Senator so as to leave another vacancy on the bench, & then you must certainly be elected Judge.  If your prospects are favorable, I do not wish Mr. Rhett, Davie or Pickens elected Senator or Hammond either.  I hope you [final line llegible].

	I have not seen either of the Greenville Representatives mentioned once in the papers.  Be careful & not be too independent & say things to injure you.  I am sure Greenville ought to be indebted to you for being willing to serve them.  What could such a Senator as Dr. Sullivan do to benefit her.  With such members the Upper country would be trampled on.  The Volunteers I believe now are very lukewarm.  Is Mr. Jones ready for service.  I believe he was a volunteer.  I must now dress & get ready to go out.  I have not heard from Greenville once, & know of nothing that is going on there.  Adieu my dear husband & believe that your Wife loves you more & more, E.F.P.

P.S. I am ashamed t send this letter, but you must take such or�.  I will write whenever I can.  When I do not write, know that I have not the time.  I think it would be just as well to go in debt for servants clothes & send the money when you send Klincks, & send me 10 or 15 dollars for my use, & if you are able to send it send it in your next letter, but if you have it not, I do not expect it [page torn] I hope you will be able to send 5 dollars [final line illegible]

If they did not charge for Frank, I would have 3 or 4 dollars more for my use, but I will give it to you.
