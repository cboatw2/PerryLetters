Letter 238

Dear Anna

	I have just written to Aunt Eliza to say, you may remain longer in town, that my only fear was, you would put her to inconvenience. & be in the way, when the family became larger, but as she says this is not the case, & you are passing your time so pleasantly, & are anxious to remain longer, we have no objection at all to your remaining, & coming up with Mary Crayton, if she does not stay longer in town, than you think you ought to stay.  Your Papa is better today, but will not be able at present to fix upon any time to go for you, & if you come up with Mary Crayton, or any other lady coming, he will not go down, as the traveling is too unpleasant at this season to visit town for pleasure.  We leave it to you now & your Aunt to return, at a suitable time.  Of course I would not object to your lengthening your visit, except that I thought you were trespassing on your Aunt�s hospitality, which she says is not the case.  I am very much pleased with the accounts Aunt Eliza & your cousin Eliza give of you, they say you have pleased all your friends, behaved exceedingly well, & have all the virtues that adorn the female character.  I hope you will improve as you grow older, & not disappoint your friends, & be a comfort to all those kind friends, who are interested in you, & set a good example to Fanny.  The character of the oldest sister has great influence over the others, & therefore a great responsibility rests on you.  I am glad you perform all of your duties so regularly & do not forget the most important, the religious one, you must keep yourself very neat, clean your teeth regularly, wash your hands, face, ears clean your nails, & be very nice in person, you know cleanliness is a virtue placed very high in the bible.  I see in the paper Charcoal recommended as the best tooth powder, buy a box & use it every morning.  If I cannot get any here, I will get you to buy some for me.  I do not need the key basket now.  Mr. Elford has bought a nest, which I suppose includes the�for keys, so if you have not got it already, you need not.

	I much prefer Fanny�s cloak being made.  I countermanded the order thinking it could not be done conveniently, but Eliza has engaged the mantua maker, & says it can be done.  I will be very glad to have it made, & of a large size, as the winter is so far advanced it will be more useful next winter than this.

	Tell Eliza by Butler Thompson I will send down a Gaiter boot, so she can know exactly the kind I wish, & I may write for a pr of India rubber shoes, & she can put them over the Gaiter.

	Mamma asks Eliza with the money she has of hers to spend 2.25 or about that, for a Silver spoon for Sarah Taft�s child.  It is named after Mamma, Susan Hayne McCall Taft.  She wishes the four Initials marked on the spoon S.H.M.T.  Eliza will know what kind of spoon will be suitable.

	I am glad you spend Christmas so pleasantly, & am sorry as you were, that you could not have been at Mr. Wm Ravenel�s where I suppose the tree was beautiful. But it was kind in Mrs. Drayton to ask you.

	I am pleased you remembered your Aunt & cousins with a little present.  If I had not a large debt to pay to Aunt Mary McCall, I would send you money to make them handsome presents.  Minerva�s wages are due in two weeks & the whole of it I have to send to Aunt Mary & more besides, & what is mortifying, the Cloak is useless, & the bonnet almost so.  I have worn it once only, & am sorry I wore it then, as Eliza has got me one I know I will like better, & Aunt Mary�s, perhaps I might have disposed of it at a low price, or kept it for you to wear at a future time, taking out the feather.  But Aunt Mary meant to please me, but Ella being so much smaller than I am, if she had thought about it, she would have known the bonnet was too small for me.  She has been kind to you, & I am grateful to her, & will not let her know my disappointment.

	Ask Eliza the price of her cloak, materials & mating.  I can better judge by the estimate she sent me, & wish to know what just such a one as hers costs.  I will be sure to get one, perhaps just like hers next winter.  Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Thompsons Aunt says she will take down mine, next week.  I will direct it to Aunt Eliza & get her to send it to Aunt Mary.  Perhaps I may send you a sun bonnet, apron, and flannel petticoat.  You may have use for them as you are to stay longer & I will send you my gold chain to wear with your medallion when you take tea out, as I think you have nothing suitable to wear with it.  I see Eliza bought you two Collars 12 ? apiece.  If you need it, get some more, & if Eliza thinks you need undersleeves, buy or make some.  Tell Eliza anything you really need, I wish her to get for you, if she can get it with convenience.

	I have written word you may get a wicker box.  If you can get one, you will find useful for every day use.  Generally they are only for show, & the scissors, thimble &c in them only for ornament.  Perhaps you can get one without thimble scissors & buy for it all that is needed, but consult with Eliza, & beg her to get you a useful one.  Another Christmas I will get you a Writing desk, as you must keep up a correspondence with the relations who have been so kind to you, & will need a desk.  Inquire the price & let me know of a neat writing desk. & when you get the�box, tell me the price.  

	You must continue to behave well as you have done, & not make your Aunt regret having to ask you to stay longer.  She is very kind to you.  Give my love to all my Aunts.  I will let you know when the box comes.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna

	I have just written two letters one to your Papa the other to Mr. Elford on business, & will write to you now.  My pen is bent, so I cannot write well.  I suppose you have seen Mr. Elford before this.  If he stays longer in town than you wish, or ought to stay, you can come up by any other opportunity you hear of.  He told me he might be only 10 days in town, but perhaps 3 weeks, so I thought he & his Wife would be the very best persons you could come up with, & the Stage at the time he comes, will not be so crowded, as at the time the Legislature adjourns.

	I received a long letter from you today.  I was glad to hear from you.  I am sorry your Cloak had not been made, as you must have needed it, ever since you have been in town.  I am sorry you did not mention the price of the things you bought.  I your next letter you must.  As you have written to your Papa for money I do not like you to write a second time for me so unless you have money left, I may not send for the articles I wish until he returns home, & then I will send the money.  I thought you would need more than 10 dollars.  He says you wrote for 10.  You write me if you have any money left, & then I can tell you what to get, but first get all you need, a dress frock for Fanny & a cloak for her, are what I would first get, after you have supplied yourself, a pr of gaiters for yourself, myself, Fanny & Hext I wish, such as your cousin Eliza wears.  The price of a bonnet for Fanny, I would like to know.  The Candy if you do not write in time for, you can get as much as you think best.  Buy a pretty pair of Ear[r]ings, for yourself.  Eliza had best write the list of your purchases.  If you need more money send to your Papa.  He will send it to you, & I dare say you will need it.  I do not care to send to him for money for myself, but I wish you to get for yourself all you need.  I can do without the things I intended sending for, for Aunt Maery McCall has got me what I most needed.  

	I am glad you are enjoying yourself, & that your friends are so kind to you.  Remember me to them all.  I send you a little book to read  that your Aunt Eliza gave you.  I read it this morning to Fanny, & it contains just such advice as I would like to give you now, but I am obliged to stop, for since beginning this letter I have received by Mr. Beattie two letters from your Papa.  I had written to him & told him I had not heard, & now I must write again, which makes me shorten your letter.  I write so badly.  You must tell Aunt Eliza & your Cousins what I say, & can read aloud parts but do not show them the letters, for I am ashamed of them.  Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.  
	Willie Frank & Fanny & Hext will all be glad to see you again, also your Grandmama Aunts Papa & myself.  Your attached Mother, E.F.P.

[Dear Anna]

	I do not know that I can get a cloak this winter.  I hope Aunt Mary�s can be changed.  If not I expect I will have to do without, as I cannot afford another, unless one could be got reasonable, so tell Eliza merely to let me know the prices.  I will then let her know.

	If she has not got the second dress for Fanny, I expect one will be enough, for Aunt Mary�s bill is high.  Until I have paid for that, I find I must be economical.  Your dress I can have
 made here. & materials for a S� for Fanny & a pattern will be sufficient.

	You will be so well supplied with clothes you will need nothing next winter.  

	If I had known Aunt Mary�s bonnet I could wear at all I would not have sent for another, but it is very small.  Next summer I will have a peice added between the crown & front, & cover it over with ribbon & wear it as a summer bonnet, & make up for my extravagance in get[t]ing two, but the one Eliza has got will be very useful.

	Thank Aunt Eliza for her letter.  I write now in great haste, & when I have leisure I will write to her.  I am glad you pleased Mrs. O�Driscoll by your playing, & that your friends are satisfied & pleased with you.  I am sorry you have missed seeing so many.  The Spring is the pleasantest time for a visit.

	Tell Eliza I will not trouble her with shopping for a long time again, & when the Rail Road is finished I hope once in a while we can go down & shop for ourselves & not trouble our friends so often.

	The most economical way is not to send at all, but go without what we cannot get here, for when I once begin a list, I do not know where to end it.

	The weather is again bad.  You have had nearly 3 days together clear.  I am thankful that you have a happy contented disposition, & it is well , as you know in Greenville our happiness has to be found at home.  There is nothing beyond home to amuse & divert.  Everyone complains of the want of society, & the little sociability there is now, that there is less than there used to be.

	Give my love to all my friends, particularly those in the house with you

	Mr. Elford ought to have been to see you.  I suppose he was busy.
