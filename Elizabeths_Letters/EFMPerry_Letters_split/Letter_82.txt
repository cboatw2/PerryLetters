Letter 82

Thursday afternoon, 30 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	This is the ninth letter I am writing to you, & I am provoked to think you have received but two.  In N. York you ought certainly to have heard, & I have written four letters there.  I hope you will receive them on your return.  In Boston you should receive three, including this.  You ought to go to the Post office yourself; perhaps then you might get them.  You must direct all letters that arrive for you after you leave, to be sent back to Greenville.  I wrote you yesterday telling you how uneasy I was for fear something might happen to you.  I am sorry now I expressed these fears, for you will think me foolish, but you must excuse me & lay it all to my love.  I directed my letter to N. York.  I heard from you last night, so today am free from anxiety, & I write to tell you so, & also write in consequence of a visit from Mrs. Butler this morning.  She wishes you if possible, to make arrangements to bring on her niece Miss Rogers with you, who she says can meet you in N. York, or any other place.  She lived in New London, which place Mrs. Butler hopes you will visit.  She says it will not be out of your way, & is well worth visiting.  She gave you a letter to her sister Mrs. Rogers.  If the young lady comes on with you, of course she will stop at the Springs & other places as you wish, so if you find it convenient, I know you will be obliging, but if inconvenient, they cannot expect you to bring her.  In N. Port you must deliver the letter to Dr. Perry, Mrs. Butlers nephew.  She will be mortified if you do not, & if you go to Bristol which will not be out of your way she says, & is well worth visiting.  You must deliver the letter to her other nephews.  Her brother went to Washington after you left which she regrets.  He lives on the North river an hour & a half�s sail from New York, so if you feel inclined you can pay him & his family a visit.  Mrs. Butler is anxious for a French cap.  I wrote you to get her one, for though you have not much taste in such matters, the Milliner can select for you.  You can be directed or�yourself find a Milliner.  In every letter I have told you of different things I wish you to buy, at the same time leaving you at liberty to invest your money to better purpose if you choose.  As I hope you will yet receive those letters, I will not repeat what they contain.  You must be certain to get those letters before you leave N. York for it would be such a long journey for them to take back to Greenville.  Col. Town[e]s did not hear from you last night.  You must write regularly.  Your letters excite great interest.  All speak of them to me, & are glad you write.  You must be sure & not come home too soon, before you have seen everything, though I know you must be anxious to be at home once more.  Yet on this point, you must practice self denial, & avail yourself of all the advantages the present opportunity affords you.  I think it so much better to have letters of introduction.  It makes you enjoy yourself so much better, & become acquainted with a place.  In N. York where you had none, or what you had, did not deliver, you seem to have not much to write about.  It required someone who knows a place, to direct you about it.  I am very sorry you have travelling companions.  I am certain that has prevented you delivering your letters, & you even left Washington at the most interesting time on this account, for you wrote me you intended to remain during the Tariff debate.  You ought to visit some of the Penitentiaries while you are away.  Mrs. Butler says she is sorry she did not give you a letter to Commodore Reed in Philadelphia.  In New Haven be sure to deliver all of your letters & do not omit visiting the Grave yard, where my sister lies, in the spot owned by Mr. Ingersoll, & by the side of Commodore Shubricks child.  In my letters you will find a great sameness, for fear you may not receive�of them.  I report the same thing in all, so when you get four at once, the repetition will be tiresome.  I sent on a letter by Mr. Swandale.  He was to leave it with Mr. Anderson if you stopped at the Atlantic Hotel,  It is said to be in a delightful part of the city, near the Battery, & I should think you would find it much pleasanter than the Astor House, & the society so much better.  Mrs. Dickson & Mrs. Lowndes, made pleasant visits.  Mrs. Butler went with me.  I wish you to go as soon as you return.  Mrs. Butler�s health seems very bad.  She is so swollen, I should think she has dropsy.  I feel sorry for her such a large family as she has what a charge upon her.  She is anxious to go to the North, & I do not wonder at it.  Instead of your never wishing to leave home again, you must leave, but carry me with you, a second visit I should think even pleasanter than the first, the same as reading a book the second time, you observe & notice what you did not at first.  I would like you if in your power to travel every year.  Living in such a small place as Greenville, it is more necessary to leave home to see something of the world.  Greenville I always feel is too small a place to learn much in.  Jim says the Corn is doing very well, all say the best Corn they have ever seen on that land.  He expects to make from 150 to 200 barrels.  The Rye & Oats are put away, & he says you will not need to buy before it is made again.  The horses begin to look well.  The ploughing has reduced them a great deal.  They now feed in the pasture, & also the Cows so at present, they are no expense.  James also does well, & Maria is doing better.  Mr. Bailey of Laurens is dead.  He was thrown from his buggy & killed almost immediately.  I never can finish without mentioning what you are to buy.  Mrs. Butler says at Stuarts in N. York they make sugar candy, sugar Dogs, & all sorts of things.  Willie wants you to lay out a half a dollar his Grandmama gave him in something of that kind.  Says you must bring him some picture books.  I want the Musical box if they are reasonable & the Bracelet plain & genteel reasonable also, two pins gold or some kind to pin my shawl on the shoulder, & a bag, �present for Ann & something for Susan a bag perhaps.  I have mentioned other things in my letters, a thin fancy shawl, white with white or coloured bars.  I mentioned also a black silk dress, but I know you wont have money for all, so you may leave out the dress unless you can get it reasonable.  Things I believe are very cheap in N. York.  So you had better make all your purchases there.  If you see a nice reasonable Soga get it.  Adam & Eve is so indelicate a picture, that if you had the money I would not wish you get it,, bring presents for the children, some books such as I like to read.  Do not forget the Tea in Fulton st., & to make arrangements about getting seeds at Thorburns.  You must fit yourself up well in clothes I think.  The clothes you bought in Washington were quite cheap.  I hope you will continue to write descriptions of all you see for the Mountaineer.  Your letters are too short.  You ought to pay the postage on them.  Uncle Arthur & his Wife are somewhere at the North, at some Springs I believe.  If you hear of them, do make it a point to see them.  I hope at Boston you will receive 3 letters, at N. York 4 & if I write again I will direct to N. York, unless you order me differently.  Boston I should think you will be pleased with.  I should think you would be delighted with your travels.  Adieu my dear husband, according to your directions, I have not whipped the children, & fear they will be as bad as ever when you return.  E.F.P.

You must read all my letters when you get them Y recollect I repeated the same things not knowing which you would receive.  I would like you to bring a present of�for Mrs. Butler.
