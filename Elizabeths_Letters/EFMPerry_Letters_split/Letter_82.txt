Letter 82

Monday morning, 10 May 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	You did not seem particularly anxious to hear from me when you left, but as you may be uneasy if Wednesdays Mail carries you no letter I will write if it is only a few lines.  Yesterday when I got up in the morning I had a little headache, & as both Dr. Earle & Dr. Crook had said Calomel would not hurt me, I last night took 6 grains, & this morning some Oil.  I hope it will do me good, & prevent my taking as many Pills as I would otherwise have to take, but you may imagine having taken this medicine, today I am not much inclined to write.  I only write for fear you might be uneasy.  I do not wish you to suffer what I sometimes do.  Friday morning Susan came as she promised.  In the afternoon Mrs. Butler paid me a visit.  That evening the news came of Genl Scotts Victory, & at night there was a Torch Light procession, Music & speeches.  Mr. Walker, Mr. Elford, Mr. Town[e]s, Mr. Spears, & Dr. Crook all spoke.  Not knowing all this was to take place, we had retired early, otherwise we would have gone near your office & heard the speeches, but I dare say we did not lose much.  Some appropriate transparencies were made very quickly, one with Santa Anna running off on a Mule without his wooden leg, some�the battle the day it was fought & so on, & some made for the night previous were used.  Mr. Elias Alexander said you hit the mark exactly in your prediction.  The servants at Mamma�s came in.  They said none of the speeches came up to yours, & that one person spoke as if he had mush in his mouth.

       Saturday we had some Showers.  Yesterday we went to church.  Mr. Cornish preached both morning & afternoon.  Mr. Arthur had his child baptized.  We dined at Mamma�s & after church in the afternoon rode to Mr. Poinsetts, to get Strawberries, but they have none yet & the plants seem to be bearing very few, like ours.  I expect this is a bad year for Strawberries.
       
       I saw Perry Butler at the church door with his Uniform on.  I asked him how many recruits he had gained; he said not one.  The children are all well.  Willie on Friday got down four more boys.  They all went to church yesterday morning, & Frank was so good as to go in the afternoon also, but he slept the whole time in the afternoon.  He says very often what makes Pa stay so long in �Lumbia.�  I say, �he has just got there�, he says, �did you see him.�  Saturday  Jim went to the Farm, & he & Charles planted their Corn.  Today he is Whitewashing, & Mary washing.  Tomorrow they will both go to the Farm & commence ploughing.  Jim says the Corn does not much need the ploughing yet, for it has not all come up, & the ground is hard.  However they will plough tomorrow, & Mary shall go every day.  Last night Susan slept at Mrs. McBees; today she has gone to Mammas to work.  She will come back this evening.  She hopes to go to the Factory next week, & I do not wonder she wishes to go, for I had rather be to myself, than living with anyone, & particularly persons so strange as they are.  Susan hopes Genl Thompson & yourself speaking to Mr. McBee will be able to effect something for Harriett & herself.  She thinks if he was aware, that the world thought he ought to do something for his children, that he would do something.  If you & Genl Thompson both speak together, he will not be offended with either.  Mr. & Mrs. Arthur have just been to see me.  Mrs. Thomas is paying them a visit.  
       
       Mr. Wallace was to have Whitewashed here today, but he came this morning, & said he was working for Judge Gantt who would not let him off, but that he would come Friday.  
       
       As I may not write again for sometime, I will tell you again the Commissions you are to execute, for me.  Get the books, or some of them on the list I gave you.  The children have told you what they wish.  For Ann be sure to get some present, & I would like very much that you should get the Straw chair for Vardry, for I told Susan long ago you would give it, so if you can afford it, you must, & you are his Godfather & ought to make him presents sometimes, but if the Chair costs more than we calculated on, I do not wish you to give it.  I suppose 2 dollars or 1.50 [page torn] be what it would cost, for it is only straw.  A letter [page torn] from Dr. Hardy  about the Check, saying if you would send it to him, he would forward you another without the condition on the bank notes which you might prefer, that he had long since wondered that he had not heard from the owner of that check.  Another letter came from Mr. Nathaniel Morgan, & one from Mr. John McClanahan, saying Mr. Salmon thought your account just, but the 10 dollar fee Stroud ought to pay half of, & he preferred to give his note for 60 dollars.  I have no news to tell.  Mr. Croft has not yet returned.  Our household are well.  If you do not hear from me again do not be uneasy, but in all probability I will write.  Excuse the shabby looking letter, for I have no good material for writing, not even ruled paper.  Take care of yourself for the sake of Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
