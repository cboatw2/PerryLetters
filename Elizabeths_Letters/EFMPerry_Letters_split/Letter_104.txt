Letter 104

Greenville

My dear husband

		Mrs. Du�   has just paid me a visit, & I am so sorry you did not see her.  She came about half an hour after you left, & she told me a great deal about the Election, & gave me great comfort, for she explained how much chicanery & cheating went on in the election, & which when you are aware of, you might another time counteract.  She says your friends are indignant at the way things were managed & say Col. Orr shall never get as many votes again, & indeed they think that he did not in reality get all the votes counted him.  At Bachelors Retreat Ebenezer Verner voted for you, but did nothing more for you.  Sam Verner certainly voted against you.  Old Mr. Verner said he did not care for either you or Col. Orr.  Old Whitfield she says acted a double party at Bachelors Retreat pretended to be for you, so that your family even voted for him, & elsewhere abused you, & tickets that were written for you & given to voters, he withdrew & gave others with Orr�s name on it.  She says he acted most deceitfully.   Mr. Taylor Mrs. Du� says turned against you two weeks before the election & electioneered against you all he could.  Says�were attributed to you, as being in favor of, which you never�that something I think Genl Cass said about poor people being sold, it was said was a measure of yours.  In short such cheating, stealing & corruption as went on at this Election, was never known before.  Mr. Lee says Orr is a disgrace to the country, & you ought to hold your head higher than ever, but he thinks he could never be elected again.  Mr. Humphries the minister electioneered against you.  He is Wm Lee�s brother, told Mr.M� Judge [page torn] was a great friend of yours.  Mr. Orr�s friends thought you would be elected, & that is the reason they made such exertions.  Mr. Orr, your friend, I suppose, thought you would be, & did not exert themselves as they ought to have done.  Mr. Ben Hillhouse the gentleman who dined here, was a good friend of yours.  I hope you will hear a great deal from your friends about the election, & write me about it, & if they think so you ought to, & run again & beat the drunken demagogue.  It is a disgrace to send such a creature to represent the State, & I hardly think the people would do so another time.  You have pursued such an honorable  & manly course, that I must believe you will be rewarded.  Your intellectual countenance. & fine commanding person  were not given you for nothing.  It is meant that you shall take a stand among the highest of Creation, & then you  will be appreciated.  Mrs. D� says  all that was said against you was your pride, but the idle lies, about Brandy &c. were circulated.  They may have injured you this time, but another time, I think they will lose their effect.  If you are ever a Candidate again, I will put in the newspaper an especial advertisement for myself, saying all the idle reports of my sayings are false, that I love the poor people, & have always been particularly kind to them.  Mrs. D� threw a new light upon Mrs. Choice�s dislike to you.  She says Mrs. Choice  once thought you were going to marry her, & I believe it firmly, even if you do not.  You never have suspicions of that kind, but I dare say she would like very much to have married you, for when she was young, among her acquaintances in Greenville, there would have been none superior to you, or who a young lady would have been more likely to wish to make a conquest of than yourself.  So my dear husband, I feel very gratified & quite complimented that you should have chosen me, when I know there were others, who would have been glad to have bestowed themselves [page torn] & who also at the same time would have bestowed a fortune likewise.  I must try & make you a good wife, & I assure you I would not change you now, for anyone else in the universe & as for Col. Orr, he is not fit to black your boots.  I am too worrying a person, should have triumphed over you.  It would have been quite natural for you to beat him, but I think it must have been a most unexpected surprise to himself & his friends, when they found he was the successful one, but you must hold your head above him & hold it higher than ever, & he ought to put his in the dust when he knows how many tricks he had to resort to, to accomplish his ends.  Yes he triumphed, but he ought often to pass in rev� all he means he used.  I wish you would mention to him or his friends, that they must have really determined to use all means, when he even tried to injure you through your wife.  Tell them you heard what he said of me.  It was a mean thing, & I wish him to know it.  He ought to know that we heard it.  Mr, Pickens Mrs. D� does not like, says he thinks only of himself.  I expect among all the Candidates in Pendleton District you had (except Mr. Lee) not one friend.  Tell Mr. Burt from me, that I always knew he was a false friend.  Mrs. D� says Josiah is confined to the house.  Wilbern is staying with him.  Perhaps you had better return home from Anderson, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court, for I�say he is in immediate danger.  Mrs. D� did not know anything more of him than this.  She told me a great deal about the Election which I would like you to have heard, before you went to Anderson.  Col. Orr�s brother, though he was treating so for him, did not expect him to be elected.  I do not suppose anybody did.  Mrs. D� will come & see me tomorrow again, & I expect pass the night.  I expect she will stay with me off & on while she is here.  You must certainly write to me by Tuesday�s Mail & I think you had better return home, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court,  I wish you would go to Pendleton Village before you re[turn] next week on your way to Josiah, & see what the people there say. I think there will be a reaction in your favor, at least I hope so.  Mrs. D� thinks Mr. Taylor acted shamefully, but W�field the worst of all.  I hope you will hear all she told me, & I suppose you will, when you see Foster, & Mr. Keith & others.  I have nothing to write about, which is the reason I dwell so long on one thing.  Willie is downstairs.  I have spent the morning in writing to you, & this afternoon I must read.  Mrs. D� says Col. Orr can never again get the same number of votes, as he got this time, that the eyes of the people are opened, & they are disgusted at his electioneering, & this is the last thing I will say.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
   
Write to me Tuesday, whether you will come back, or go on to Pickens & see Mr. Lee if you go to Pickens, & he will tell how things were managed at Bachelors Retreat.

My dear husband  

		According to promise I have taken my seat at the desk to write to you, & I must commence with the business part first.  Mrs. Harrison has just left here.  She came to ask if I knew if you would buy Reuben, that Reuben was anxious you should buy him, & though she would get a higher price for him, from others, she would be willing to sell him to you  for 500.  She says her son James saw you, as you were starting to Columbia, & asked you if you would buy Reuben, & you said yes, you would give 500 for him.  She begs you to write to me immediately, so that I may hear by this Friday�s Mail, for next week she is to leave for Florida, so you must be certain & let me hear Friday night, & immediately as I get the letter, I am to let her know.  She seems exceedingly anxious you should buy Reuben.  I know not what to advise you.  She speaks in the highest terms of Reuben, says she does not know his age exactly, that he is 30 certainly, how much more she does not know, that Dr. Harrison bought him when her daughter Mrs. Earle was a baby, to go to the Mill, & Mrs. Earle is nearly 26, that he was a little boy, that he is sober & industrious  & made her last summer 10 dollars a week, that Mr. Cox speaks highly of him &c. &c. &c.  Write me an answer by Fridays Mail.  I will now speak of other matters.  Fanny is a great deal better.  I have not given her any medicine.  I hope she will be quite well when you return.  The rest of the family are well except John who now has the Measles, & Delia who though complaining, is better.  She is able to hold Fanny & today is cooking while Mary & Minerva are at the Spring washing.  The weather cleared up so soon, I expect you are almost sorry you did not go down in your Buggy, but perhaps the first day you might have taken cold, so it is all for the best.  I hope you & Mr. Keith had a pleasant journey down.  I expect to hear from you by Jim.  Mrs. D� slept here Friday night, & � slept here last night & this morning went to Mrs. Service�s to prepare to start.  They were to stop to bid me goodbye, but they have not come yet, so I expect they will not leave today.  Mrs. D� had a pain in her face, which perhaps prevents her going.  The children & myself went to church yesterday morning, & Mr. Arthur preached a sermon on temperance, alluding to the Law lately passed by the Town Council, & said the community ought to sustain them.  Mrs. Tom Jones was at church.  As well as I could see, she was not remarkably pretty, looked very pale.  In the afternoon there was no service.  Mr. Arthur had a bad cold.  � the children & myself walked over to Susans house.  It is a very plain looking house, & seems built in the most economical manner, & ought to have had a chamber downstairs, which I think is essential in winter.  Mr. Hoke had a load of wood hauled Saturday for us.  It has all gone already, so Charles today has got one of Mamma�s horses & is hauling wood.  Jim cut up so little Sausage meat, that with the greatest economy, it has only lasted for 7 meals. & then we each had only two little ones, not enough to satisfy us.  I should think one hog, the trimmings from, would have furnished more meat than that.  A letter came last night from Walker & Bradford, saying they had forwarded a box to you.  It weighs a hundred pounds, the freight is 50 cts a hundred.  It is the box I suppose Aunt Eliza sent.  It will be here Friday.  A letter has come for you from Mr. Barclay who is now in Canada, patronized he says by the nobility & gentry & standing at the head of his profession.  He wrote to you for a friend who is writing a book on Indian traditions, & who wanted to know something of the Carri�, who lived in Georgia, & as you had interested yourself in Revolutionary Incidents, he thought you might be in possession of information relating  to the Indians, which might be of service to his friend.  His name is J.A. VanHeuvel, Ogdensberg, N.Y.  He was a classmate of Mr. Calhouns.  Another letter came from Mr. Berry & wished to know. If you would wish the Lumber that was at the Mill for Josiah, that Josiah had hauled off 88 cts worth more than he had paid for, & that if you needed the lumber he had, he would like for you to pay for it immediately, as he was closing his business & was going to Mississippi & that if it was not convenient to pay immediately for the lumber, he would rather keep it, that Josiah would have preferred getting it at Sh�s Mill which was in sight, but engaged it from him, thinking he would have finished it sooner.  I have no news to tell you.  The village seems very dull.  The weather is very cold.  I suppose you will wish the other hogs killed now.  You must write me by every Mail.  Your letters will be my chief pleasure in your absence.  I hope you will be able to get a new trial for Dr. Anderson.  You must speak to your friends in the Legislature for Cousin Isaac, Mr. Cannon, Col. Ware, Mr. Earle & others I am sure might be influenced by you, & do what you can for Wm Ed to retain the office of Inspector.  I am sure your speaking only to enemy would cause them to vote for Cousin Isaac, & you may with very little exertion do him good, for many would give their votes to the one who has first asked them for it, so you ought to have spoken long ago.  I am anxious Cousin Isaac should be elected, particularly for Aunt Eliza�s sake.  I have a bad pen to write with, & nothing to write about, which must be the excuse for this uninteresting letter.  When I hear from you, I will have�to write you, & I will try & get a better pen.  Anna went to school today.  I was reading a peice in the Spartan last night, which says children should not commence to learn until 7.  That those children who know the least at 12, prove in after life the smartest men, that Dr. Adam Clarke when a child was thought rather stupid, that it injures the brain to exercise it too much.  I intend Willie to write to you sometimes instead of me.  I have so much work to do, writing takes up too much time, particularly when I have nothing to write about.  

		I hope to hear certainly Friday your answer about Reuben.  Mrs. Harrison says until then, she will make no exertion to sell him.  She says Mr. Mooney offered her 6 dollars a month for him which would be 72 a year, but she does not wish to hire him out.  She seems very anxious you should buy him, says Col. Irvine would buy him  & give more than 500 but she prefers you having him, says she heard you were willing to give 550 but was advised by someone not to do it.  She says you told James before you started, that you would give 600 for Reuben.  I told her I had not heard you say anything before you left, that not hearing from her, I thought she had made other arrangements.  So my dear husband, in this instance I leave you to act as you think best, for fear that I might influence you, & then be blamed by you.  If she is correct, Reuben would be an invaluable servant, but you know we must make allowances for her representations.  She says she knows you would not sell him, you would be so much pleased with him.  I wish you could see Fanny now playing about the floor.  Our carpet is getting so old.  I am trying to save to buy one.  If I show you the 10 dollars when you return, you must let me get one either send town or get one at Mr. Nicols.  Now adieu my dear husband, recollect when I give advice, I always�you to consider it, but do as you think best.  Late events have made me lose some confidence in your judgment, & place more in mine.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

		I received your letter Wednesday night, & am glad in writing this time to have a letter to answer.  Your letter as usual gave me great pleasure.  You know they are my chief source of pleasure, in your absence.  I regret, as well as the Members, that you are not in the Legislature.  It is a place suited for you, & I feel now that your talents have no field for their usefulness.  You ought to have remained there at any rate, until the Electoral Bill was passed, for you have been its great Champion, & others will take the credit from you.  As regards the Presidency of the Bank, it is a subject too important for me, to give any advice on.  Your comprehensive mind, can judge better of that, than I can.  I never could like some wives try to influence my husband against his judgment, what will effect his whole life.  You know what your prospects are in Greenville.  I have often wished you could be, where there was more congenial society for you, minds on a footing with your own, & with whom you would have pleasant intercourse.  I regret this more than you do, but such an important step , as changing your residence & your business, I cannot say one word either way.  Mr. Hooker was here today.  He says, he heard a Charleston gentleman, say at the Mansion House, last night, that Mr. Elmore wished to be Judge, when Judge Richardson resigned.  I wish you could be Judge.  I have always wished it, & when there is a chance of your succeeding, you must try for it.  The upper country Members are in the majority, & they generally would vote for you, so I think your chance would be good.  If you had thought of it in time, I would like you to have been a Candidate for Attorney General.  Being from the Upper Country, you would have beat both of the other Candidates, & that would be an eligible office, worth removing to Charleston for I wish you to get some office or other, & I hope there is still a chance at any rate of your being a Member of Congress.  You were foully treated this time.  As you say it is doubtful who will be elected Attorney, it behooves the friends of each party to use their influence, so I hope for my sake, you will speak to your friends in behalf of Cousin Isaac.  I do not wish you to make strenuous exertions, but such friends as you can influence, speak quietly to.  He will lose all the Taylor Democrats & Whig votes I expect, having taken an active part on the other side.  I am sorry to hear Sarah Taylor is sick, but hope she is better now.  The box containing the Shrimps has arrived.  Aunt Brewton sent Willie a little Gold pencil case.  A few of our other friends sent presents to the children, & Shrimps to me.  I am glad to tell you, that my Gold Thimble is found.  Night before last, Lindy took the Candle out of the Candle Stick, to grease her face, & when she was putting the candle back, in the socket of the Candle Stick she found the thimble, almost concealed by grease.  I instantly conjectured, that Frank while at the stand, the night I missed it must have put it there, & that it was the spool that dropped & you picked it up the next morning.  So in the morning I asked Frank about it, & he says yes, he put the Thimble there.  Yesterday on removing the Fender to clean it, my large scissors was found.  So Mary is no longer implicated in those supposed thefts.  I hope now, my Che�, & other lost articles will come to light.  It was natural I should suspect her, when the morning after the Thimble was lost she stole an apple & a few days after a quarter of a dollar.  I believe none of us were glad to see Jim on his return.  We had got along so comfortably without him.  He is a worthless servant.  A plank has been off the carri[a]ge house a long time, & instead of mending it he let it remain, & in his absence someone got through   & took out a peice of leather.  The person knocked off another plank.  He yesterday was wearing the nice pantaloons you gave him, instead of keeping them for his dress pantaloons all winter.  I told him to take them off.  He said he had no others to put on.  I told him he must, & he then went & put on others, & I made Elizer make him a pair.  He seems to like to destroy his clothes, & every thing about him.  He has a bad temper & is at war with the whole world.  In contrast to him stands Reuben, who though I know is not perfection, yet he cant be worse than Jim, & must be better.  The day I wrote you he hauled two loads of wood for us.  He also hauled three loads for his mistress from beyond Mr. Brooks.  That was five loads in one day, & Jim scarcely hauls 3.  Jim took all day yesterday to clean the carri[a]ge & did not do the harness.  Today I told him to do that, but he is always so mysterious, he is never to be found.  Charles this morning cut wood, got his breakfast, & went to the farm before I was dressed.  He is so different from Jim.  Indeed there is no servant as bad as Jim & I would rather be without him even if you do not purchase Reuben.  I feel happier when he is away, even if I have to give up riding but I hope tonight, to get a letter saying you will buy Reuben.  His mistress & himself today I know are very anxious, for I think Mrs. Harrison is a kind mistress, & wishes for him to get a good owner, for she sells him to you for very little 500 dollars, the interest of which is 35.  I am sorry I did not beg you to buy him, but I was afraid to, for fear you might blame me.  As soon as Jim returned as�& worthless as ever, I was sorry I did not beg you.  If what Mrs. Harrison says is so, that you told her son James, you would give 500, I suppose there is no doubt, but what your answer will be in the affirmative.  Otherwise I believe on my own responsibility I will get him, for I am so much without you, I need a good man servant.  Your first large fees you must pay for him & secure it, so he will not be taken for Mrs. Harrisons debts, & this I suppose you can do, as you did the farm.  If you will not buy him, then Charles must stay here, & Jim sold or hired out, & Charles learn to drive, or you get a buggy & drive me.  Jim knows you have thoughts of selling him & yet he does not do any better for it.  I hope my dear you will look at low Buggy�s with�, & let Jim carry your Buggy down for you, & see what you can get for it.  I am anxious you should have a nice Buggy with a cover.  You travel so much, you need a nice one, that will protect you from the rain.  I knew you would buy knives.  We would have done without large ones; small ones only we needed.  They could have been got cheaper in Charleston.  I am glad you bought clothes for you needed them.  The young�you do not need.  After being 11 years married, it is too late for that now, your habits cannot be changed, so change it for another book.  I wish �to the Married, & those contemplating marriage.�  Mrs. Cunningham wishes all females only to have it.  I am afraid the Brooches  are not very pretty, as they are as cheap.  I wished one as pretty as you got before.  If they are as pretty I will be satisfied, & as they are so reasonable would like you to get me another, to give to Ann & one of those you have got I will give to Susan.  Willie says get him a glass slate.  He is fond of drawing; bring Vardry a little present, as you are his Godfather, a trifle will do, just to show you think of him.  Thank you for the fruit.  I sent some to Susan, Ann, Mrs. Irvine & Miss Payne.  It rained yesterday all day, & is wet today.  Yours, E.F.P.

Greenville, 3 December 1848
Sunday night

My dear husband

		I have just received your letter by Mr. Keith.  Mr. Long�s son brought it.  I told him to ask Mr. Keith to come & see me, but I dare say he will not.  I write to you tonight, because tomorrow I expect to be engaged visiting.  Jim arrived safely, as you have heard.  The two next days it rained, so he only cleaned the carri[a]ge & put up Elisa�s Stove.  Yesterday he hauled one load of wood, & some leaves.  All next week I am going to use the carri[a]ge, so I expect he will do very little work, but Charles will work & Jim as much as I can spare him.

		Since writing the above, Mr. Keith has paid me a visit.  He has just left, so I will continue.  You will be surprised to hear, that I have not purchased Reuben.  You merely said, if I desired it, you would purchase him.  This permission, I do not consider authority enough.  I will tell you all that has passed.  After receiving your letter, I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, what you said, & that I would not decide unless I knew your wish, to purchase Reuben.  She said I must decide at once, for Mr. Beattie & Mr. McBee both wanted him, so I sent for Mr. Hoke, to get advice from him. He said he had never thought much of Reuben, but admitted he knew nothing against him, except that he drove Mrs. Harrisons horses hard, that he knew he would suit me better than Jim, for he was obedient, sober, & industrious, that Jim was a worthless creature, drank, traded with poor people, was idler, careless, &c. that he saw him constantly at Pecks stable & numerous other things that he mentioned, & yet said he would rather have Jim than Reuben, for he would whip him & make him know his place, but with you he would never be of any account, because you were too indulgent.  After this account of Jim, I was determined to buy Reuben, so I sent to Mrs. Harrison that he should come for me to look at.  He came, & I liked his looks, & what he said, but still not give a decided answer.  At night when Jim came in with the keys, I felt sorry for him, so I thought I would say something to him, so I said �Jim you know if we buy Reuben,  & are pleased with him, we will sell you, but I do not suppose you will care, for you never have seemed happy here,[�], he said, � if my owners are not satisfied with me, I am perfectly willing to be sold, I do my work, & if I cant please them  I am willing to leave them�.  I said, �you have told me you would rather belong to a strict owner, than your master�.  He said, �I would rather belong to an owner who treats his servants alike some of them here are treated well, the other have to poke about,� insinuating that he, the most indulged of all, was treated the worst.  I now lost all pity for him, & determined to buy Reuben.  I was in this frame of mind, when Mr. Hoke came in, & brought with him Dr. Crook, who he said knew more about Reuben, than he did.  Dr. Crook said he had always seemed to him slow motioned, & if you sent him on an errand, he would stop if he met anyone & laugh & talk with them, that he thought compared with Jim. It was 6 of one & a half a dozen of the other.  Mr. Hoke said he had worked for him & worked faithfully, & what Dr. Crook knew against him was literally nothing, yet they both advised me not to buy him, & said if he ever acted badly, I would blame myself.  Of course advised in this way. I would not make the purchase, so I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, that in your absence I could do nothing.  This morning Reuben came again & said his mistress said, that she would let him remain so, until you returned, that she would send me the bill of Sale, & then if you did not wish him, you could give it to Mr. Beattie, & Mr. Beattie would buy him.  She said you would fix all right.  She had perfect confidence in you.  Matters rested so until this evening after church.  I saw Mr. Beattie, & asked him if Mr. Harrison left Reuben & you did not buy him, if he would, & he said he had sent word to Mrs. Harrison he would take Reuben, but had not received an answer so he thought if Mrs. Harrison would agree to it, he would take Reuben at once, & when you return if you wish him, he will sell him to you at the 500 dollars.  If you do not wish him, he can easily sell him to someone else.  So here the matter rests, & I think I am a perfect Metternich to arrange things so well.  Dr. Croft after church this morning, said he wished to see you, to consult you on some business.  I told him, I could advise him, I knew a great deal about Law.  He said I was indeed, the smartest lady he ever knew.  He invited us to visit him at Newberry this winter.      
 And now for your letter.  I must my dear husband say that I am vexed at the foolish purchases you make.  You show no judgement at all, knives, forks, spoons, when we have not a decent cup or plate to use with either, the spoons, but particularly the forks we could have done without & as the forks are not real silver, it was foolish to get them, for our�ones answer perfectly well, & one set of imitation is quite enough.  What we need is a dinner set of Crockery, a nice set of cups & saucers, some Table Mats, a carpet for the Dining room, which we will be obliged to get, for our present one is in rags, a chamber downstairs, our house painted, an oil cloth for the Stair case.  These things are necessaries.  The 36 dollars thrown away in the spoons & forks, would have bought the carpet, & then our chamber would have been made comfortable with the old carpet, & the dining room with the new.  Every thing of this kind is yet so much cheaper in Charleston, & comes up so much more conveniently, that I prefer getting them there.  Things are so dear in Columbia, that when you go down, I do not even mention what we want, for fear you may buy it, but as you will throw away your money so foolishly I will not be so scrupulous another time.  If you knew how self denying I was, how I deny myself of every comfort in clothing, because you cannot afford it, you would reflect more before you spend your money.  If you were to see my petticoats, my drawers, my stockings you would be shocked.  Of the money that passes through my hands. Precious little is spent on myself.  It is all expended on the house, children & servants; a few handsome dresses I have & those you bought me.  I have taste, & make my things look well but nothing more than I possibly can help, do I buy.  Aunt Eliza who thinks herself so straitened, would be astonished if she examined my Wardrobe.  You preach economy, & in your dress you are economical, but at one blow you spoil it all; 36 dollars or at least 18 thrown away, for forks we had no earthly use for.  What we have are good enough for our circumstances, & they are not even silver.  What you have bought therefore I must say it was very foolish to buy a second set of imitation silver.  I would like you if you would  to get back your money & keep it for some of the necessaries mentioned above.  The first 20 dollars you can spare me, I am going to send to Charleston or the North for a Musical box.  If you had�the money you�to, I would long ago have got one.  I do not wish it now, but next year some time I hope to git one.  Now I wish the house painted, and a Chamber downstairs, & a Carpet, & an Oil Cloth, & a Dinner Set, & a Tea Set, & Table Mats, & more Table Cloths, Towels, Pillow cases &c., but these things I intend getting in Charleston, everything now is cheap there.  Columbia particularly during the Session is extravagant,  Therefore I do not care for them to be got there.  I  have spoken long on this subject for I really feel it.  I know that we have no money to spend uselessly.  I never have a fourpence to give away.  As you have I want you to bring a present for Vardry.  You are his Godfather, & have never given him a present yet so get something for him, & the three pictures for 50 cts for Ann, & the glass slate for Willie, & engage the Lady�s book for me, & if Graham & that together can be got for 5.00 engage Graham for Mamma.  Willie has 15 cts I owed him for Chickens.  He says you must buy something pretty for him at that price besides the slate & he will pay you the money when you come home.  You must buy what books you can afford, but I expect that will not be many.  I expect the Women of the Bible, is too costly, so you can get that another time.  Per[s]ons here seem to think Mr. Edward Earle is sick, but as you do not mention it, I suppose he is not.  Mr. & Mrs. Perry Duncan were here this evening a few minutes to see how Fanny was.  They had heard she was sick, & did not know she was better.  I went to church today, both morning & afternoon.  Mr. Hoke says Genl Thompsons family say he has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.  I wonder he does not accept it.  He boasts enough.  He loves nothing from his humility.  I cant bear him or his family.  They are too conceited, but conceit & vanity helps a person in this world.  It has made Genl Thompson.  I am pleased at the compliments paid you, but nothing can make up for my mortification at your late defeat, until you have triumphed over your base enemies.  Until then I can not feel as happy as I once did.  I took�pride in you, & it has been humbled, & so many are pleased at your defeat in this Congressional District.  The Lower County appreciates you much more than the Upper.  I wish Judge Butler could be beaten.  He never ought to have been elected.  I do not wish Col. Manning elected Governor.  He has no claims to it.  I hope Cousin Isaac will be elected.  You must do what you can, without injuring yourself.  I am sure you can influence many.  I feel great interest in his election, not only for Cousin Eliza�s sake, but for the sake of the name he bears.  He is the only one at present, to preserve it with distinction., & I am sorry for him.  Gloria has not much manner.  She is like her father, & she is very cold.  She always was.  I hope Col. Orr heard the speech made by Genl Brisbane, & I hope Col. Edwards with be elected Solicitor.  I wish you would be elected Solicitor when Genl Whitner is elected Judge, which Mr. Keith says he will be when Judge Richardson resigns.  Do you not think your chance is better than Mr. Youngs.  You must watch your chance, & be elected to something to cover the disgrace of your late defeat.  You must certainly price Buggy�s & Carri[a]ge�s, but a�Buggy you most need, & if you can make a good bargain, buy one.  See how much they would give for your old one.  Describe it to them, & then let Jim carry it down to you, or if you can get a reasonable one, perhaps you might�your old buggy here.  At any rate see what kind of bargain you can make.  If you cannot make a good one, then get one from Mr. Cox here.  You might price Carri[a]ges & at one time or other change ones.  I dare say you would sell ours here, to someone in the country at a good price, when you wish to get another.  I have had a long chat with you, & if you were not tired would go on much longer.  I am not as silent as Gloria.  It is going on 10 oclock.  I am sending Willie upstairs.  I am glad you thought his letter did pretty well.  You might have told Col. Dawkins, if he meant it as a disparagement  [of] the four children only that you had had 6, & asked him how many he had.   They having married twice, you supposed  he had a house full, & tell him we were going on quite as rapidly as we desired, but if�would leave some of his property to one, we would try & have another & name after him.  Mr. Henry Thompson will be disappointed in not being Bursar.  I am going to write to Aunt Eliza now , & will tell her you think Cousin Isaac will be elected, & that the Greenville delegation will go for him.  The village is dull.  I have only been out to church, since you left.  I have been working for the servants all the time.  Eliza has worked two days for Margaret Croft, which will come to 75 cts.  Adieu I may add something tomorrow.  I am going to see Mrs. Town[e]s tomorrow.  Several messages have passed between us.  I am going to see Mrs. Tom Jones,  & Mrs. �.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

I have a shocking pen to write with & no way of getting another.  I am ashamed of my letter but cant help it.

Monday morning, 9 oclock.  Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a visit.  She is very anxious, that I should take Reuben, with the bill of Sale, & on your return if you do not wish him, let Mr. Beattie have him, or she says, or perhaps she may let Mr. McBee have him at once.  I told her I proposed that to Mr. Beattie but he said the other was the best plan.  I suppose Mr. Beattie in taking him now & selling him to you would have his debt paid, but otherwise he would not.  I cannot buy Reuben on my own responsibility, for I do not know whether you wish to buy him or not, so I will not take any step.  You write me word so I can hear Friday, whether you prefer buying him. Or prefer not.  Just tell me what you wish, & I will do exactly as you say.  Mrs. Harrison will be here I expect then, & then I can give her the answer.  I preferred waiting until you returned, that we might have a long talk on the matter, but I expect it will have to be settled now.  Mrs. Harrison asked who was elected Messenger to carry votes.  I told her I expected Mr. Black would be & told his motive for going.  She said he ought to be elected.  She says Mr. Jones is a candidate for Treasurer of upper division.  I hope he will not be elected.  You need not do anything for him.  I am going to his house today, but I am sorry to have to.  Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a second visit to say Mr. Nichols says he knows you will be willing to buy Reuben.  You write me word distinctly what to do, whether to buy him or not.  I will do just as you say.  Mr. Cox says he likes him.  Mr. Hoke & Dr. Crook say they do not.  You know what Jim is, & I expect you have some idea of what Reuben is, so just do as you think best.  Mrs. Kerrison is so anxious you should take him.  She seems averse to Mr. Beatties taking him, but you must do as you think best.  Do write me exactly what your wish is, so that I may not have to act on my responsibility, but yours.

		I have not said all I wished, so will write a little more.  If you have good news for Mr. Henry Thompson, you must write & tell him.  I am going soon to see his Wife.  Mrs. Tom Jones sees company, so Susan & myself are going to see her.  I suppose Genl Thompson has gone on to Washington to get an office.  He is well situated now, for his disposition, able to go wherever he pleases.  I do not think he is suited for domestic life.  As Mrs. Pattersons expectations were so large, I hope she got something, at any rate enough to make her lead a virtuous life, & not be the means of leading many a young man astray, as I expect she now does.  I wish my dear husband you would be elected Senator.  I have such aspirations for you.  I believe I would be happier, if you were a stupid ignorant man, for then I would expect nothing for you, & would be satisfied, but as it is, my opinion of you is so exalted,  my expectations for you are great, & as they are not realized, I am unhappy.  I am not envious of others, but I am provoked, when those, so far your inferior, triumph over you.  I never can forgive the people of Pickens, Anderson, & Laurens for letting Mr. Orr beat you, when they knew what low means, he was using, & should have made them feel a contempt for him, instead of that to put him in such an honorable position, as he now holds.  Mr. Burt acted basely, & I hope he may never succeed in obtaining an office again, but he is so mean I dare say he will.  Col. Irby, Mr. Sullivan the Pendleton people & others, I think are contemptible, & yet such a man as Sullivan, can get forward better than you, & I dare say will be a Member of Congress some day.  If you can do nothing better, you must go back in the Legislature, which I am sorry you quitted, for another time you might have been elected to Congress.  It was most unfortunate you should have come out when you did.  I wish you had staid 4 years more in the Senate, & then run for Congress.  When I think of these things I am so unhappy.  I cannot feel as happy as I once did.  I have a bitter, mortified feeling, which I will never get over, until you have triumphed over your enemies, & made them see, that they cannot always pull you down.  Then again I will be happy, & I hope that time will come.  It is too bad to think that such men as Garvin, Reid, Whi�, headed by Calhoun, just as mean as they are, should succeed in preventing your obtaining the place, that Providence by giving you the proper qualifications for, meant you to have.  I hope they will yet be mortified, by seeing you successful.  I hope experience will teach you in future to manage better, for you are greatly to blame yourself.  Your publishing your peice, your controversy with Sullivan occasioned your defeat, & now that it is over, the speeches we can see helped to it, but I know  you acted for the best, though unwisely, so now I will stop.  Fanny is better & looks better & prettier than I ever saw her.  Write me every Mail.  The rest of us are well.  It has been a relief to me to write what I have done.  You know I must express my thoughts to you, & it is my high opinion of you that makes me feel you have been so illy treated.  Your defeat is astonishing.  I cant understand how you could have been except there are too many Mr. Burts.  I hope Mr. Burt will be defeated.  He is one of your worst enemies, & pretending to be a friend.  Mrs. B�. who you & Mr. Beattie & other denominations have to support, immediately after Mr. Beattie had paid 5 dollars on Mr. Elfords subscription, went into Mr. Beatties store & bought 16 dollars worth of velvet to make herself a V�, supported by C�, & then to be so extravagant, more so than the wives of those who support me.  Tell Col. Evans & Mr. Elford of this.

Greenville, 6[5] December 1848
Tuesday night

My dear husband

		I have just written a long letter to Aunt Eliza, & you will see by the date, that it is now very late, but I cannot go to bed, without writing to you, because tomorrow I may not be able to.  I expect to spend the morning in writing.  This morning I went to see Mrs. Kingsland, & then Susan, Mamma & myself, to see Mrs. Bryan, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Robert Smith, & Mrs. Coleman.  Mr. Bryan is trying to sell his place.  He asks 2500 dollars for it, & he is selling his furniture at private Sale now, & afterwards what is left, will sell at Auction.  They will go to town whether the house is sold or not.  Mrs. Bryan was very anxious to go & says she does not wish to return.  Says Mr. Bryan says, perhaps he may return & buy a farm.  Dr. Simmons must have a very bad judgement before he has tried Greenville, & known whether he will like it, & known whether he will succeed.  He has bought a poor farm of Dr. Atwoods near Piney Mountain, given 800 dollars for it, & engaged board for himself Wife & children & 2 servants at Dr. Atwoods for 650 dollars a year.  �at the Mansion House he would have boarded the same family for 450 dollars.  Mrs. Bryan says, he said the Trustees had thrown out�inducements to him (which he would not mention) that he would not decline settling here, that she knows next year, he will get the Female Academy, & that she is sorry for Mr. Bradshaws family, they are such a fine family.  I myself am sorry for them, & as Mr. Bradshaw seems a good Teacher, I think for their sakes even, he ought to be continued.  Anna learns well, & of the two I prefer Mr. Bradshaw to Dr. Simmons,�looks too young, & too weak, & simple, & I dislike hurting Mr. Bradshaws feelings, & sending him & his family adrift into the world.  Mr. Mc� Mrs. Bryan says is going to remain, & has the promise of 30 scholars.  I must tell you the final settlement about Reuben.  Mr. Beattie is to take him, & you buy him, or not, just as you please, on your return.  So we can have a long talk about it, when you come back.  I have no letter to answer of yours, so have no more to scold you about at present.  Mrs. Coleman today, showed us over her house, & told the price of the furniture, for Susan�s benefit, who will have to get furniture for her new house.  She had in her Dining room a beautiful Carpet, Red & Black, colours suited for this Soil.  It was only 80 cts a yd.  I intend to write to town for just such a one.  She bought it at Lambert & Brothers.  She had a set of the handsomest Waiters I ever saw. Which she gave only 5 dollars for, & a beautiful Sideboard with a Marble top, which she gave only 50 dollars for.  I wish you to buy as few things as possible in Columbia.  Everything is too dear their.  I expect you could have got Knives much cheaper in Charleston.  Mrs. Colemans chamber looked so comfortable opening into her Dining room.  As soon as you come back I want you to have one made for me back of my Dining room, so much of it being made already, it will not cost much, & I wish the house painted.  The paint is so dirty now, I cannot make it look cleaner, so save all your money for this.  You need not buy any Books, except engage the Lady�s book.  The Croft family left today, all except Mr. Croft & Mrs. Pearson�s family.  Jim this morning drove me out.  This afternoon he shelled Corn for Meal & Hominy.  We are all well.  Mrs. Town[e]s is better.  I hope Cousin Isaac�s prospects are brightening.  I take no interest in the Legislative proceedings, as you are not a member.  I hope you will be, this time 2 years, if nothing better offers.  I cannot let you remain as useless as you now are.  You are too well fitted for the duties of a Legislator, not to be one.  All the bills you introduced about giving the voting for President to the people, the Penitentiary &c. will be passed, & you gain no credit for it.  I will stop now & add some more tomorrow.

Wednesday morning.  I have just done breakfast.  Mrs. Town[e]s sent me a few Oysters, & some bread, & says she is quite smart, & that Maj. Earle returned last night & says Col. Townes is better.  The Oysters as usual were shocking.  I sent them into the kitchen.  The pickled Oysters brought to Greenville, are not fit to eat.  You know the Cornfield at one side of Joe P�s house, between his house & Mr. Luther McBee�s .  He has sold half of it, a narrow strip to Mr. Rowand for 500 dollars, which I think was enormous.  Today it is very cloudy & warm.  I expect it will rain.  If you get a Buggy, & can have yours taken in exchange, you must write for Jim to carry it down.  If you do not get one, & wish to come back in the carri[a]ge, write for that, & I will let Willie go down in it.  The horses seemed not at all injured
by the journey, or the Carri[a]ge either.  If you get a Buggy, it must be a fashionable kind, but if they are too expensive, you can wait until next Spring.  Columbia is so dear, perhaps Buggy�s & Carri[a]ges may be dear too.  So I do not tell you to get either.

2 oclock.  I have just returned from paying visits.  In the course of them I heard the Governor was dead, that Maj. Earle brought the news.  I heard also that young Elias Earle, intended next winter to be a Candidate for Comptroller General, & Mr. Jones also, that Mr. Jones had declined running for Treasurer.  I went to Mrs. Arthur�s where I saw Mr. Rosemond who is building a nice piazza in front of Mr. Arthur�s house, for only 27 dollars.  Mr. Arthur furnishes Lumber & Nails.  I asked him how much he would ask for putting a room in our Piazza & described it to him.  He said he would not exactly say, but he supposed 10 or 12 dollars.  I told him to come down tonight & look at the Piazza & tell us exactly.  He is going to build the house for Mrs. Pearson, & is said to be the cheapest workman here.  He has been working for Mr. Pinckney at Flat Rock, & was recommended by him.  So I wish you as soon as you return, to get the Lumber, & have the room commenced by Mr. Rosemond.  I hope to hear tonight from you.  Susan is going to Housekeeping, & I will wish you to make her a valuable present.  So a dozen large & small forks, such as you have got, I will wish you to get for her.  If you could afford it now, I would like it, if not in the Spring when you go to Columbia, perhaps what you have got for me I may give to her.  I will see about it.  This week I expect to get through with my visiting.  Every afternoon Jim has leisure.  Yesterday he shelled Corn; this afternoon he is going to haul wood.  Tomorrow I am going to see Mr. Henry Thompson.  This afternoon I am going to pay visits in the neighbourhood, so when you return, I will be able to stay at home, & entertain you, & ride with you.  Fanny is at this moment seated on the table sucking a bone.  Charles stays entirely at the farm, so I hope he is doing well.  It has cleared off now, & the sun is shining, but it is so warm I expect it will rain soon.  I must now close to send the letter to the office.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Greenville, 8 December 1848
Friday night 

My dear husband

		I did not intend writing to you by this Mail because I thought you would leave Columbia tomorrow, but as in your letter tonight you do not say when you will be at home.  I write, for fear if you do not hear, you will be uneasy, & hurry home.  Today I have been visiting.  Mamma & myself went to Dr. Butlers this morning, & Mrs. Henry Thompsons this afternoon.  Mr. Thompson said he would always recollect the interest you had taken in his election as Bursar.  I am surprised you should have voted for Thompson Earle as Messenger, when you were under no obligation to his family, but rather the reverse.  I thought you would have voted for Mr. Black.  I am glad Cousin Isaac is elected Attorney General.  Mrs. Butler said there were such reports about Dr. Griffin when he left Abbeville.  He was the last man she thought would have got an office, particularly that of Treasurer.  I hope you did not have to pay for the printing of Dr. Anderson�s briefs, & I also hope you will do your best, & get him a new trial.  I wish you had mentioned the Decisions in your cases.  Mrs. H� seemed to me a pleasant lady.  I hear Mr. Eddings your friend has taken Dr. Austin�s house.  I suppose hired it.  It is uncertain whether Mr. Bryan will leave or not.  I rather expect Greenville suits him too well, that he will remain.  I am glad you purchased Candlesticks for we need them.  We need some for the Drawing room.  China ones are used, & when we can afford it, I will get a pr.  I wish you to buy for me, �the Carolina Receipt Book,� by Miss Rutledge of Charleston.  The price in Charleston is 1 dollar, Mamma wishes it also, but as we are not certain  how we will like it, only one is enough to get.  You have not mentioned whether you have engaged the Lady�s Book. & whether Graham & that taken together would be got for 5[.]00.  Mamma wished Graham, if it would be got on those terms.  Cork Soles are worn in Shoes now.  Mrs. Arthur got a pr from Charleston.  I wish you would inquire in Columbia, & if they can be got, buy me 1 pair, & if very reasonable 2 pair.  You must bring something for the children, something that will be useful & last, not broken up immediately.  I will send this letter by Mr. Smith who leaves tonight, & get him to put it in the Post Office at Columbia.  Tomorrow I expect to finish my visiting,�8 next week.  Jim will work steadily.  I will not take him off.  I thought it best to visit while you are away, as Jim will work more steadily when you are here.  He has not given me so much trouble in getting the carri[a]ge as usual.  Franks dog is quite well.  The Baptist Convention commenced today, but I do not think many persons have come yet.  The Village looks as quiet as ever.  We will all be happy to see you, but do not come sooner than  your business permits.  I must now conclude so as to send the letter before the bell rings.  Do you not think it would be a good plan to buy you[r] seed in Columbia of Russell, that they are better than those got here, but this is, as you think.  Willie is now studying his lesson.  Fanny is asleep in the Cradle.  Anna & Frank are gone to bed.  I believe I have nothing more to write.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Recollect the pictures for Ann 3 for half a dollar, such as you got before, & something for Vardry, an Ornament such as you have sometimes got for Anna, or some little thing, I do not care what.

Greenville, 11 December [1848]
Monday morning

My dear husband

		I must write to you, so that if you remain in Columbia until Wednesday you may hear from me.  I have been very punctual in writing.  There is a great pleasure in feeling confident, when the Mail arrives, that it will bring a letter.  I judge of you by myself & know that you would rather hear, even if you receive a scold.  I indeed ought to scold you now.  The Crockery & waiters we needed.  Though Columbia being so dear & inconvenient  to get things up from there & also so expensive, I would have preferred getting those things in Charleston.  However we needed them so I wont scold about that.  But the Toys were perfectly useless, a few would have answered.  You put too much money in them.  A little more, would have bought me a Musical Box, which I have so long wished, so now to make friends, you must give me 20 dollars, on your return & I will send it to town & buy a box with most beautiful tunes, which I will listen to all day while at my work.  You have no air for music, cannot realize my fondness for it.  One thing you must do, you must tell the children, I am to choose, what I wish first.  If not, anything you say is theirs, & I wish they will not give up, for already they are quarreling about it.  I wish one of the knives, I have long wished a knife, so tell them as soon as you arrive, that I am to distribute.  I will take what I wish, & then give to�what suits them best.  You know if you had plenty of money I would not [obje]ct to your buying whatever you fancied, but we need too many [necess]aries, to indulge our fancy.  We will have to get a carpet for the Dining [roo]m, our present one is in rags.  The 30 dollars the Legislature gives you [page torn] Couch, except to put up separately in a paper, & give to me on your �turn, to send to town to buy one.  Mrs. Coleman has one [page torn] Room, which I think beautiful.  It is black & red. Does not show dirt, &�[page torn] the Dining roomas we sit in that room in Winter.  She bought it in Charleston at Lambert & Brothers, & gave only 80 cts a yard  for it.  Our room requires 37 yds so the carpet with the Binding would come to just 30 dollars, & we ought to get a Rug to suit, but we could do without the Rug.  If you could get such a Carpet in Columbia, at that price, I would like you to get it, but I do not believe you could get one there so reasonable.  It was a strong carpet, not Venetian, Ingrain I expect.  Carpets are not very reasonable.  Red & Black, or Red & Green are the colours I like.  They are dark & yet bright.  You might inquire the prices of Carpets [page torn] but if you find them like the Buggy�s dear, [do] not get any. 80 cts [page torn] Mrs. Coleman gave for hers.  The waiters that you have bought, must be�I described to you, that she had.  Sometime I would like to give out, that [page torn] are going away, have an auction, sell our furniture high, then change our minds, &�, & buy new.  What do you think of my having made a contract with Mr. Rosemond to put a room in the piazza, for 23 dollars, he furnishing the Lumber.  This is most reasonable, as you may know, from Mr. Croft�s employing him, to build Mrs. Pearsons house.  He will commence the room immediately as you return, unless you prefer instead of the room in the Piazza, an addition put at each side of the house, two rooms on each side.  Four rooms altogether with a little passage like Mr. Poinsetts, & doors to each room, 2 windows to each &c.  He has given me a bill.  He can do it, furnishing the Lumber for 325 dollars.  This is reasonable, & if you would not approve that, one room on each side, would be about half, but if you do not wish this, he will immediately put the room in the Piazza & this Winter we will occupy it.  The other he does not know if [page torn] can do until he has finished Mr. Crofts house.  I told him we had [page torn] boy who during the time we would hire to him, so that Jims [page torn] [w[ill be deducted from what we pay him.  He says for good [page torn] from 18 to 26 dollars a month, that he could not tell how much he would pay for Jim, until he tried him, but at any rate would pay from 12 dollars upward.  Now do you not think I am a manager.  Mr. Beattie yesterday sent me a paper, saying that he had purchased Reuben, & on your return would let you have the choice of purchasing him, on the same terms he had done, provided you purchased him in a month, from that date.  So do you not think  I did well there too.  Mr. Lester paid me a visit today, says he saw you in Columbia, looking as well as he ever saw you.  I received a letter last night from Aunt Harriet McCall.  She says she heard gentlemen regretting you were not in the Legislature.  You know Mrs. Faber has married a third time.  Aunt Harriet says she has married a young man 27 her sons Tutor, that it seemed strange that she could not support her Widow�.  Tom Roper who a little more than a year ago, you saw, has since lost his Wife & Married again, so Matrimony is complimented.  Neither of them had the excuse of a gentleman I read of in the papers, who lost his Wife, was sorry for his little daughter, so married again to give her another Mother.  I hope my husband will never have such sorrow for his children.  Mr. Hooker was here this morning.  He says he heard Mr. Curtis last night at the mansion house, expressing his astonishment at your defeat, & saying how much interest Spartanburgh felt in it.  All these compliments only provoke me the more, to think the Congressional District you live in, & one you asked the favor of, was the only one, that would have refused it.  From any other part of the State, you would have been elected.  You must try your chance again, or I will never be satisfied.  Play your cards better the next time.  Mrs. Theodore Thompson told me Col. Orr was taken up & brought away from a Corn Shucking, dead drunk, that she said at the time, you were not above Shucking Corn, but you were above degrading yourself in that way, that her brother was anxious you should be elected.  You had always been a friend of their family.  She & Mr. Thompson are going to Union to live on a plantation she owns.  She says there Mr. Thompson will have employment [page torn] of the �pation, & said when she saw the page torn] were moral, faithful to their Wives, acted in every respect as they ought, she felt ready to fall down & worship them, & that you were one.  I told her yes you were an exception.  Genl Thompson made quite a mistake in sending Willie a female Dog.  Both are females.  Do tell him of [word obscured] Franks has grown finely, & is the prettiest Dog I ever saw.  Lindy washed it, & it looks white as Snow.  Willie�s has been sick, & at one time [page torn] thought would have died, but it is getting better.  It has not grown like the other.  It has mortified Willie very much.  He has the feeling of a parent to it.  He cannot bear to hear comparisons made between the dogs.  Anna stepped on his this morning & lamed it.  He is afraid it will never get over it.  He does without Milk to give it to his Dog.  I have paid all my visits but one to Mrs. Loveland.  Jim has commenced ploughing the garden.  Charles stays entirely at the farm.  I have had the whole front lot raked & swept, & cut down three old Peach trees.  I am more ready for the house to be painted.  Delia is sick, is in her room.  She is almost entirely useless, & perhaps will not live long.  [word obscured] will be a great loss .  After this spell, I will let her do no [word obscured] work, only mind Fanny.  The least hard work, makes her worse.  Dr. Earle has been over to see her & sent medicine & direction.  The Convention of the Baptists is going on.  I have been too busy [to] go the church to hear the Ministers.  There is no news to write about.  The children long to see their presents, & I long to see you.  Buy me the �Carolina Receipt book�, if you have the funds.  Do not make a mistake.  It is by Miss Rutledge, & buy me �to the married & those contemplating Marriage�.  Each of these books is 1 dollar, & buy me some Cork Soles.  They keep the feet warm.  I have [word obscured] a long letter to Aunt Anna Turnbull, & am going to write to [word obscured] Cunningham.  I am glad Eloisa Martin has sent a bundle.  Give my love to her, & inquire particularly how Sarah Taylor is.  I expect Miss Calhoun would like to marry Col. Manning.  Mr. Calhoun has treated you badly.  He blasted your hopes this last summer, but I hope, you will yet triumph over him.  I woke the servants this morning at 4, & was done myself a little after 6. [page torn] I woke them it was so early.  It was moonlight.  I took [page torn] now.  Ever Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Mr. Lester says Genl Thompson is not your friend & never has been.  He has always considered you a rival & has been the means of injuring your prospects greatly that Mr. Kilgore has no opinion of him.

Friday morning, 11 May [1849]
[Greenville]

My dear husband

		Again I am at my desk writing to you with bad pen, ink & paper, for the deficiencies of which you must make allowances.  I received your letter Wednesday evening, & it gave me much pleasure.  Mrs. Elford sent to know if I had heard, that she had not.  I was glad to be able to inform her of Mr. Elfords safe arrival.  Mr. Bobo was really unfortunate.  I hope your horse will not be ruined like Skylark.  I will not tell you of all that has been done at home.  Tuesday & Wednesday the Mr. Smiths Whitewashed & did it very nicely.  They understand it better than Mr. Wallace.  The dining room they have done lighter than before, so it is now of a beautiful straw colour, the little room the same, but that can never look well, until the leak by the Stovepipe is stopped.  The rooms downstairs  except the Library, are arr� in�, with the exception of the Curtains.  Upstairs is nearly fixed.  Last night I was able to sleep in my own bed, which was quite a treat.  Today the cleaning has been stopped & Minerva & Mary gone to the Spring to wash Curtains, bed clothes &c assisted by a woman of old Mrs. Greens who washes beautifully.  They have more to wash, than I think the 3 will be able to get through with, so next week we will go on washing paint windows &c.  The�of the house will be much�on your return, to judge by the quantities of dirt that has been removed.  If you had seen how much had accumulated under the carpets & in every corner, you would wonder the house should have looked at all neat, or we been able to breathe in it.  A great deal is yet to be done, weeks worth I am afraid.  

		Charles is in the garden.  We have had fine rains.  Yesterday the ground was too wet to plough, but Reuben went to the Farm.  The day before Lindy he said was sick & helped only a little.  Today they have both gone.  Tomorrow Reuben has to go to Mr. Fairs for Corn.  The barrel Mr. Foster sent has given out, & I intend to take the opportunity of Lindys being at home & send for Dr. Crooks to see her.  She is not well.  She has headaches, bleeding at the nose, & she is at a time of life, that she must be attended to, to ensure her health & even life  so I hope Dr. Crooks will put her in a way to have all right.  Mr. Foster sent only 202 pounds of Bacon,  22  peices.  I sent 100 pounds to Mrs. D�Oyley.

		Myself & the children are well. Though I feel fatigued,, from the labours of the few days past.  Scott I expect has got over his lameness.  I have heard nothing more of it, but I was very much afraid it will come on again next Sunday.  Hochel� I hope is getting well.  Yesterday for the first time since the sad change in his fate, he pranced about the orchard as in days of old.  The hogs & pigs I believe are well, & the Cows & Calves.  The poultry escapes every now & then out of the pen, so they are reduced in number without our receiving the benefit.  We churn a little every day, & get one or two Eggs.

		I was walking over the front yard this morning & many of my plants seem flourishing but others are dying from the rude treatment of the Colt trampling  & breaking them down.  A good many Hawthorns are planted & the fence one in bloom.

		Miss M�died Wednesday night, & her funeral took place yesterday morning at Mr. Watsons.  She was buried at her fathers place.  I attended the funeral.  Mr. Arthur performed the services.  She was I believe quite good, �she communicated on her sick bed.  That day for the first time she was told she would not recover.  She said she wished she had been told sooner & she was perfectly resigned & her parents seem so too.  Mr. Bate�s child was buried yesterday afternoon.  Willie says the Clevelands took home their books yesterday from school, that they are going to New Haven to school.  William Choice also, Mr. Jefferson Choice�s son.  

		A letter came for you last mail  from Willis Burket giving an account of the Tugaloo Farm.

		I received a note from Mrs. Sharpe acknowledging the reception of the Shoes & thanking me for them.  Her health she says is better & that they were sorry they missed seeing you, as you passed through Pendleton.  Mr. Croft told me Mr. Pearson was one of the Delegates to the Nashville Convention from Florida, & that he is to pass the summer in Greenville.

		Mamma & Susan walked in yesterday.  They are as usual.  I have been nowhere & seen no one, so have not much to tell you,

		Last Monday Mr. Davis had 5 new scholars, so now he has nearly 50.  He is very anxious Anna should learn�& I would be too, if we could afford it at present.  It would be occupation for her, & prevent her playing at home with servants.  We will talk about it when you return.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  You must not forget to buy some Bird seed of different kinds & send up by Mr. Elford.  If he comes first, Mr. Croft says he does not know when my package will be here.  He does not intend sending down for his Groceries, until freight is lower & the roads better.

		Do not forget Ann�s apple box.  She will think hard of it if you do not get it.  Have the shoes made up.  1 pr is for Ann & she will pay for, & get from the shoemaker the pattern he kept before.  It was a good shoe, & bring back the one you carried this time.		
		You must not let your claims on�be overlooked,�it is what I positively desire for you, & I hope you will be thought of for that office, which you are so well calculated to fill.  

		You will receive this letter Sunday evening.  Before you can get another you may leave, so perhaps this is the last letter I will write to you, for if you are away  only the 2 weeks you expected, you will start for home next Wednesday.  I wish  you would get a new trial for Mr. Gilreath, but I am afraid you cannot.  

		The weather is quite cool.  I must now stop.  I wish to take up some tacks out of the floor in the�chamber.  I took up the matting, & there was an inconceivable quantity of dirt underneath.  I had thought there was none.  The room was so little used. But it is two years since the matting was taken up.  A great deal of dirt had collected.  I have gone through so much fatigue to clean the house for you, you ought to feel obligated to me, the rest of the year, & be very kind & obliging & love me, & never scold me, or give me one unkind word, or make me afraid to ask you for money, or say I am extravagant, & do all I wish you too.  So good bye for the present, & I hope this is my last letter, that this time next Friday you will be on your way home.  Your obedient faithful Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter Wednesday evening, & cannot tell how mortified I am at the useless purchases you have made.  If money was�, or if you were ever out of debt, I would be less grieved, but when you know how much at present you owe, & that you are making less, than you have done for years, I cannot but be surprised, that you should so thoughtlessly spend your money, & show so little judgement, the things we need, you do not get, & what are entirely superfluous, you get, what we have�for an Entry Lamp which is only necessary, where much company is entertained, & a chamber Lamp. what in the name of wonder are we to do with it.  I told you expressly if you bought Lamps, to get them for the Drawing room, for the only one we have in there, is an old fashioned�, out of repair.  I did not think at present you could afford even for the Drawing room, but if you would get them, it ought to have been for that room, & not for our little narrow Entry, where it will not be used more than once in a year.  I must say I am provoked at this purchase & if it is not too late, would wish you to exchange it, for something more useful; then again to give six dollars for Wine glasses, when 2 dollars would have been according to our means, & when we have not even a nice set of Cups & Saucers, to use for company, & 16 dollars to give for Decanters, when 1 pr would have been sufficient, to get two bed�when only one we needed, & so many Pitchers & Basins, when we have not Basin Stands to put them on.  My dear husband, you see how inconsistent your purchases are, so do in future I beg you, learn first from me what we need, before you throw your money away.  I have [page torn] as if the money was lost, & I think how many things we really need, & that I have been denying myself of so long [page torn] would have purchased.  Col. Dunham is good for the money, therefore there was no necessity of laying it out at the agents.  It would have been even better to have had the note gaining interest, & to be of service, in extricating you from debt.  You have certainly forgotten, what you owe, & that the house is to be painted, & will be such an expense.  We ought to save all we can for that, & now Col. Irby�s note is�upon, & that will soon go principle & all.  As long as you are alive, your family will be supported, if your health does not fail you, but even that is uncertain, & when you think of the uncertainty of Life, & how unprovided your family would be if you were taken away, I wonder this thought does not make you�, & determine you to begin before it is too late, & lay up all you possibly can for your helpless family.  In future I beg you to give me 100 dollars a year to supply myself with clothes.  It is 50 dollars less, than you allowed me when we were first married.  I find it is of no use for me to deny myself, actually of necessary clothing, when all that I�is spent so uselessly by you.  You ought to see my petticoats, my night dress, my stockings, actually in rags, & then your Entry Lamp would�, but I could fill sheet after sheet with my reproofs on your want of thought, for I must attribute imprudence to this, so I will stop.  The Wig I am glad you got.  I am always pleased at your providing yourself, with what is necessary to your good appearance.  It is a duty you owe your Wife, to make yourself look as comely as possible.  We should take the same pains with our appearance after marriage as before.  It is more necessary then, for the Leaf gold is then wanting, which each party had thrown over the object of its love.  The Dining Table I am not displeased at your getting, though the freight will�high, but you must now get a Table Cover for it, & I hope as you have been so liberal in buying what we do not need, that you will buy a Transparent Curtain, which we do need for the Library.  When I said we would not purchase Groceries at present, it was to [page torn] my determination to be economical.  I did not think you would argue from it, that the money that ought to have been appropriated to that purpose, you would spend in other ways less useful.  I need clothes, & I am actually letting E� take in Clothes so as to make a little for me, to supply myself with the Clothes.  She is now working with Mrs. Shoolbred at the Mansion house.  I told her she must bring me 50 cts a day, & I am doing the work of all my family.  Our circumstances have pressed upon me lately, for I saw you were making little. & the expenses of our family increasing, for we will wish as our children grow up, to give them every advantage of education, but I do not see how we can, for now you spend more than you make.  You ought to have saved to buy a horse, & I do not know anything that makes a housekeeper so comfortable, as a great supply of Groceries, but we cannot get them now.

		It has rained ever since I wrote to you.  The weather is gloomy & cold.  I have been able to have nothing done in the garden.  The ground continues so wet.  I expect much ploughing has not been done at the farm, but they have been hoeing, but I suppose the rain makes the Oats & Corn grow.  Reuben goes off early & returns late.  Miss Long has had bad weather for her honey�.  I hope Love has made up in warmth, for the loss of the pleasant sunshine.  We have had fire constantly.  It is not raining at this present moment, but it is cold & damp & the wind is blowing.  Frank is quite well.  Willie yesterday was taken with a throwing up, & continued during the day.  Dr. Crooks is away so I sent for Dr. Earle to know what to give him, & he sent him Senna & Salts.  Today he feels pretty well, but I have kept him at home.  I sent to Dr. Earle for something for Fanny, & he sent her two doses of Calomel.  I gave them to her with Oil afterwards, & her operations were dark green stuff.  I think she looks better, so I hope the Calomel has done her good.  The children say you must bring them some Paint boxes.  I suppose Tom Butler [page torn] not sent the money.  I hope not, as I am afraid you would {page torn] it all, & we must spend some now in consequence the purchases you have already made.  We will have to get more Pillows, Pillow cases, Sheets, Basin Stands, Table Cloths for the Dining Table &c & Curtains are needed for the Room we used to sleep in.  & when we can I wish to buy a Carpet for that room. 

		Mr. Edward Earle died before Dr. Earle got there as I mentioned to you.  I have not heard any particulars.

		The old Cow has broken down almost every Orange Tree.  I am so provoked, but feel to her as I do to you, that my vexation can profit nothing, & even any punishment I can inflict cannot restore things, as they were.

		Do supply yourself with all the clothes you need.  I hope you have got a Sack Coat.  I love to see you looking neat & nice.  Judge Evans imagines what his feelings will be for a Wife if he gets another.  I have no thankful feelings, on account of your defeat.

		Eliza Hayne writes me that Mrs. Taylor has been very ill, & the Doctor ordered her to change the air, so she was going to Charleston to pay a visit.

		The children long to see you, so do I, so you may expect & prepare for many scolds, for I assure you I have been worried & even kept awake, thinking how many things we needed could have been purchased with the money you spent for what we did not need.  An Entry Lamp is very little used even in Charleston, & Gas is dangerous; change it I beseech you for Drawing room Lamps or something else useful.  Now I have opened my mind, I hope I will feel easier.  But I have not said half I intended.  But I love you still.  I only grieve you understand your circumstances so little & take [page torn] thought for the future, while it is in your power.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		Mr Elford  has just been here to say he will take this letter to you from me tomorrow, & that he believed he was the only Lawyer going.  I intended of course writing, even before he came.  It seems an age since I saw you.  If you stay away much longer, I will forget I have a husband.  Mrs. Dub� has ben with me a great deal, but still I have missed you.  You are the only one, to whom I tell all my thoughts.  Much as I miss you, I am thankful that you have business to detain you.  You cannot have too much of that, & love must be secondary to business.  We are all well.  Willie & Anna have been going steadily to school.  Frank I have kept at home a few days to rest from his studies &�, but I will send him again on Monday.  Dr. Simons moved to his Farm yesterday & gave the boys holiday, so Willie & Frank went to the Farm to dig Potatoes & earned 5 cts a peice.  The Potatoes now have all been dug.  Amounting to 1 bushel, & Ground nuts about a ? bushels.  The Corn hauled, 12 loads altogether from that field, good loads, Charles says, & the hogs today were turned in.  The rainy spell made it later, than it otherwise would have been.  I must now tell you all I have seen & done since you left.  Last Saturday Mrs. Henry L. Pinckney sent me a newspaper from the Mansion House.  It rained until Monday so I could not go to see her, but Monday afternoon I sent word I would call for herself & Mr. Pinckney to take a ride (it is the only time I�the carri[a]ge).  I did so & found them very [page torn] they enjoyed the ride extremely, were delighted [page torn] �tain scenery, the variety in the foliage &c.  The next morning they paid me a visit.  I showed them your Library, busts, pictures &c.  They admired them, & Mr. Pinckney said I had an Earthly Paradise, & asked if I did not think so.  I told him no.  He said he thought so, no one was contented.  On going away he shook me warmly by the hand, & said I must tell you, when he determined to come to Greenville.  The chief pleasure he promised himself was the seeing & conversing with you.  Mamma carried them to ride Tuesday, & to see Susan & also Ann who was with Susan.  Mr. Pinckney was quite overcome at the meeting.  They all observed it, & Mrs. Pinckney afterwards in Mamma�s presence what had affected him so.  He said �really when he thought to himself, that there before him was Susan Hayne & her children.  It brought the past so vividly to his mind, that it wholly overcame him.�  Mamma used to be intimate with him & his family, & she says the seeing her, no doubt brought his first Wife, to whom he was passionately attached to her through & that affected him.  He seems to have an affectionate heart & this visit of himself & Mrs. Pinckney was a very pleasant one & different from anything we anticipated.  They left Wednesday.  Tuesday morning I sent for Mrs. Dr. Simons to come & go with me to the Mansion House to see some of her relations who were there, some of whom we used to know, Mrs. Keating Simons & Mr. G� Simons daughters.  They returned the visit yesterday.  Mamma met Mr. G� Simon & he told her his Wife who was an old friend of hers had given him express orders to see her, when he came here.  Mrs. Dr. Simons came with the others to see me.  She seems good & I wish for her sake Dr. Simons would do well.  They intend staying at the farm the remainder of this year.  They have no equipage , so she [page torn] expect to come in at all.  Next year if they do not get the [page torn] �tend hiring Mrs. Seviers house,   She only asks�a year.  Mr. Bradshaw had engaged Dr. Austins house & had 60 Scholars pledged to him but lo! Good luck has come to him, he has had an offer from Pickensville Alabama of a school with several hundred scholars & some thousands dollars of Salary, & of course he has accepted.  Mrs. Dub� heard this.  It is well if he goes, for he would have�with the Academy & returned to stay here he said, as long as he chose.  He leaves the 1st of December, & that is before the time we paid him up to for Anna.  Miss Randolph was married Thursday night to a Mr. Jay.   Mr. Memminger is at the Mansion House.  It is pretty full, but a good many may leave on Monday.  Did you know that one of Genl Thompsons black horses was dead.  He drove them to Edgefield too hard, & then they were fed improperly, & one of them died.  How unfortunate!  I dined one day at Susans this week.  Mrs. Dub� is tonight at Mrs. Beatties.  She will return here tomorrow night, & Monday set off for Pickens.  She has staid here the greater part of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have liked of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have likedrt of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have liked, but it has made my expenses greater.  I have had to buy Butter & Eggs constantly at a high price & Fowls &c so I have not been able to make your money hold out as I intended.  I was obliged to buy Shoes for Mary, & pay a dollar for Beef to a man Mr. Wade had sold for & bought a Calico dress for myself  & some Clothes for Willie & other expenses, too numerous to mention, so I borrowed a 5 dollar from Mamma.  Some of these things have been bought a little sooner than I expected, as Eliza was ready to make them.  I thought I had better buy them.  I bought Sugar, Coffee & Tea for Mrs. D�Oyley the day after you left.  I hope you will come back with a purse full.  I also paid Mr. Waddill for making my screen, which I had almost forgot to mention, so you can see I had a great deal to do with my money; bought Frank a coat also, & myself a pr of Gaiterboots.  The weather has been delightful all this week.  Reuben says next week he will build the tops you had out.  [Page torn] the next field has done well.  Our meat has given out.  Monday I must try & get some to last till you return.  Dr. Austins family are still sick, a servant died last Saturday, & a daughter is very ill.  I was disappointed you did not write me longer letters & tell me more.  I thought you would have given me the particulars of the Rail Road Meeting.  I suppose you are reserving something to tell me.  A good many letters have come for you.  I think I will send them to you by Mr. Elford.  They may interest you.  The one from Mr. Bowen was brought this afternoon.  Only one person that I know of, has been to the house to inquire for you, some one when I was away.  Col.  Dunham sent for you tonight.  I suppose there is a meeting of the Trustees.  I have been reading on in Miss P��s Loiuis 14th.  I do not like Madame Maintenon.  She was an artful woman.  Mr. Joe Long is better.  Ann� was at Mrs. Mauldins today  & went up with Betty into his room & saw there a gentleman who told her he saw you this morning, & you were well.  Fanny is as sweet & affectionate as ever.  She sleeps with me, & will not let me turn my face away from her.  She says Pa has gone to buy her Candy.  She calls Mrs. Dub��& Fel�, Delia.  The Village looks quite full.  The Yellow fever has kept the strangers a longer time than usual.  It is said to be on the increase now.  I suppose you are anxious to get home & have a little time to stay when you do come.  I believe the Dr. Crofts with their families have left.  Mr. Poinsetts & Mrs. Lowndes families are still here.  Mrs. Dub� told me she heard, Mr. Watson had decided against Miss Green in the Will case.  I hope this is so.  You must write me by every Lawyer returning from Pickens to Greenville.  The household are well, including horses, Hogs &c.  I long to ride on Horseback again & in the Buggy.  The Ladies of the Wor� Society were to meet today to determine what to do with their surplus money.  Mrs. Alston wishes it given to Mrs. Carruth  & Mary Bradshaw.  I did not attend the meeting [page torn] busy at home.  I sent word to Miss Crittenden to vote for me.  I heard she [page torn] to Mary Bradshaw.  I have finished my sheet & remain Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I suppose you will expect to hear from me tomorrow when the mail reaches Laurens, so I must write to you now.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  No letter came Sunday night.  If any arrive tonight, it will be too late to send them by the Mail that carries this letter.  I will begin as usual & tell all that has occurred  since the moment you left.  Sunday morning we went to church.  Mr. Pinckney preached & gave us a very fine sermon.  He & his son only came down this way, & were to meet the rest of the family at Mr. Andersons.  Mr. Stuart played very finely on the Organ.  In the afternoon Mr. Arthur preached not one of his best.  In comparing the Union of Church & his people, to the Union between Husband & Wife, he always knows my delicacy, for it was an old sermon.  Mr. Croft spoke to me after church.  He says Mr. Moore has married a poor lady.  On Monday morning Mr. Pinckney made me a pleasant visit.  He says he did not speak against Greenville to Mr. Shoolbred, but if he had been asked on the subject, he would have said, that he was perfectly disgusted at the open manner in which the gentlemen drank when he was here last, showing no shame whatever.  In the afternoon he went to see Mamma, & told her, I seemed so well.  The next morning he left.  Charlie also came to see Willie.  He is very much grown.  Monday afternoon the Mother & Wife of Mr. Hopkins returned my visit.  They are both, particularly the Wife very pleasant ladies.  Yesterday morning Dr. Simons called to see you.  Sarah asked him in, so I went down & saw  him.  He commenced by reading me a note he had addressed to the Trustees requesting them to meet him somewhere, that he might explain to them his reasons for having sent in his letter of resignation, on hearing of his not being elected to the Female Academy.  He says he has no mortified feelings whatever, but considers himself as very badly treated by some members of the Board; that he was persuaded by some of them to accept of his situation as assisting in the Male Academy, on the express  condition, that he should be elected to the Female; that he asked the few who spoke to him, if they spoke authoritatively in the name of the Board & they told him yes, & when he became dissatisfied & wished to give up, one of them told him to consider well,  for he would certainly be elected Principal of the Female Academy; so he considered himself as elected, & afterwards those very ones had shifted their grounds, & quite forgotten what they had formerly said.  He said you & several others had never said a word to him on the subject, so he exculpated you, & did not even ask how you voted, & I must tell you he wished the private relations formerly subsisting between you to continue just the same.  He says though he sent in his resignation, as the time for his engagement had expired, which was until the Election took place, he would continue to assist Mr. Leary until the vacation, but it would be a Jubilee to him when he gave up; for the boys were so bad. I would be shocked if I took a peep in at them; & he himself would never send a son to the Academy, where there was such a mixture that one boy came into his presence smoking a Cigar, one of them wrote a most insulting composition, & if he whipped the parent complained & if he did not they complained.  He will commence a school on his own account.  He did not know how he would succeed.  I listened very patiently.  I thought I might easily have explained his disappointment, by telling him, those very Trustees who had promised him the Female Academy had since found he was incompetent to the chrnge & therefore would not vote for him.   

		Last evening Susan Hoke came over & spent with me.  This morning Mrs. Pearson paid me a visit.  She says she wishes to see you as soon as you return, that she has received a letter from Florida, & wishes you to attend to, or look over some papers.  She says Dr. Simons met her Father & spoke to him about his treatment & abused Mr. Beattie a great deal.  She says Mr. Moore was boarding at the house where Miss Trott was, with her Grandmother. & the Grandmother was always telling him, he had talents that would not be appreciated in the Country.  He ought to live in the City, & so he thought he would marry the Granddaughter & live in the City & let the Grandmother support him.  Mr. Bradshaw she says is certainly going.  Since you left I had heard Mr. Waddil would not let him.  Mr. Smith who applied for this school, had also applied for the one Mr. Bradshaw is now going to take charge of, & he says it is one of the most desirable in the Southern Country; that the Music Teacher is paid one thousand dollars a year.  Mr. Bradshaw will have a good opportunity of pocketing there.  He says he will pay the money he owes the church in 6 months after he leaves here.

		Reuben & Charles are sowing the Wheat.  Mr. Moore was here a little while ago, & says he has brought the Wheat to the Mill.  Mr. Slatton engaged you, & kindly is now cleaning two barrels to carry down for it.  Mrs. Pearson says it is scarce & dear.  Except to church, I have not been out I was going to say, but I forgot, Monday morning only I went to the Genl to see Mrs. McConnell & Miss Goodlett & went to see Mrs. Westfield & Mrs. Watson.  The latter lady told me she heard Mrs. Dr. Butler had lost her young daughter, but I think this must be a mistake.  Lucinda got a letter from Bob Sunday night.  He said he could not endure the treatment of his owners, so he left them & 4 days after he was taken by a gentleman, to whom he now belonged & liked very much, & he expected now to get a letter from Dr. Butler, so I suppose the gentleman has offered to purchase him, but I expect Mrs. Butler  will wish to get possession of him to vent her anger on him, but I hope not.  We have been reading a little book of Mamma�s called �Home� by Mrs. Sedgewick.  It is most excellent.  I wish I would be such a Mother & Wife as is there described.  I would like you to read it.  Mrs. Daniel Ravenel gave it to Mamma.  I have written in a great hurry, have no time or room at�to tell you how much I love you, & miss you.  I hope you will come back with some notes.  I do not care for money which is soon spent.  I wish you to accumulate notes for our future benefit.  The children are well.  The weather pleasant.  A Miss Wynn came over yesterday to see me with Caroline Horton. She lives 12 miles from here is Anderson District, & says her Father is a great friend of yours. She had heard so much of my house, she wished to see it.  Mrs. Pearson says all who come to see me speak in praise of the house.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

		Mr. Elford called this afternoon, to say he was to leave tomorrow for Columbia, & would take any letter or package I had for you.  I avail myself of the opportunity to send both, for I have a pr ofto, you had better get him some new ones to you, so I send them now, with a Shoe to have them made the size of.  1.25 is what they used to ask, even for yours, which are so large.  Perhaps the men will make them for less.  I am very fond of these kind of Shoes, & I have just worn out a pr, & wish these to supply their place.

		I am writing sooner than I expected to, & had not supplied myself with writing materials.  This accounts for my blotted paper, the only sheet in the desk, & there is hardly any ink in the inkstand.  I have thought of Willie & yourself constantly since yesterday morning.  In the afternoon Anna went home with Fanny Town[e]s, so I have been unusually quiet & lonely.  Tomorrow afternoon Instead of going to church I will go for Anna.  She was delighted to go.  She is of a very social disposition.  Frank seems lost by himself.  He liked the girls school better than he expected, & went off willingly yesterday afternoon.  Fanny is very merry &�.  Last night I invited Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon to take tea.  They had told me they would come over one evening socially, & I thought I had better invite them at once.  We spent quite a pleasant evening, conversing, & looking at pictures & books.  Fanny was the life of the evening & very entertaining.  This morning Mamma Susan & Ann came in to shop & pay me a visit.  Mamma brought a kind letter she had received from Miss Drayton.  In it she mentioned that Paul Hayne had received  the Gold Medal as a reward for Elocution, & that she heard him speak, & he well deserved it.  I saw also by last nights paper that he had received it.  I am glad, as it has gratified his Mother, I am sure & will be encouragement to him   Miss Drayton mentioned that Dr. Tiddyman had sent up trimmings for the altar & pulpit of the Episcopal Church, & wished to know if they had been received.  Said he was soon to cross the Atlantic.  She mentioned that her nephew & our cousin Wm Ford, had by collecting money for the Library society & in other ways doing business more efficient to reenter College himself.  He was a young man of talent, & highly thought of.  �his Uncle Tiddyman without denying himself in the least have given him the money & educated him.  Some abound with money, others have to struggle for it, even to get an education.  

		I asked Mrs. Town[e]s to take tea with me this evening socially, but her baby was not well enough for her to come.  Reuben & Charles have been ploughing, & this afternoon Reuben cleaned the carri[a]ge.

		A man yesterday brought me your Office key, which I was very glad you sent.  I looked in the Drawer after you left, & not seeing it, knew you had carried it with you, & intended requesting you to send it back by some one, that I might have your office well cleaned.

		A letter came last night from Mr. Taylor, saying your writing to Nancy Saterfield had done good, for she had since called on him & promised to pay what she owed him, that if she did not he would let you know.  

		Mrs. Kingsland has just sent me a Pumpkin pie & said if it was not Saturday night, she would come down & sit with me, & she sent word Mrs. Arthur had received the trimmings, & they would keep it for the new Church.

		You have now been two days in Columbia & seen of course a great many people.  I  am anxious to know how Willie gets on, whether he enjoys himself & whether you are able to manage his dressing, so as to make him appear to the greatest advantage, the little minutia of combing & curling his hair well, turning down his Collar & Waistband neatly, arranging his Cravat, for by this time he has one.  All these little things are so important to the making a neat appearance, & a Father overlooks, but a Mother attends to with particularity.  I wish Willie to look his best now, for so many will see him, who know me, & I wish him to do credit to me & what is more important, he must behave himself so as to do credit to his parents; behave as his did on his first visit to town,  when his fiends said , he committed not one impropriety.  I hope to see him return improved in every respect, in character manners & appearance.  He is where he can profit more than here, running about the streets, & playing marbles with the W�, V� &c, & it was to avoid the bad habits & manners contracted in such company that I wished him to go with you.  The more he can be with you, the better it will be for him.  If he is tired or gives you trouble, he can return with someone. But I hope you have found it pleasant to have him, & that he enjoys himself.  You have of course�your appearance before this.  I expect I would hardly know you if I were to see you now.  You were indeed getting quite shabby when you left.  If you can find clothes to fit Willie, you had better get him some new ones.  Except his Boston suit, he has never had any yet to set well on him.  In future I expect a Tailor will have to cut for him.  He will be obliged to get a cap or hat when he returns, so if you see pretty & reasonable ones supply him with that article at least, & get some fashionable covering for Franks head.  With regard to my present, I wish to impress it on you, that I am not so anxious for something warm, that you should get it, whether expensive pretty or not.  Miss Drayton & others say, that Charleston is overflowing with pretty & reasonable of every description.  I would much rather always get what I wish in Charleston where there is a greater choice.  So if you do not see a Shawl�Mantilla or little Cloak or whatever is worn both reasonable & pretty in Columbia, I beg you to get nothing for me.  I will wait until you return, & then send to Charleston for something.  I wish something very pretty & reasonable too, & I am afraid, such cannot be got in Columbia, a place not calculated for either fashion or cheapness.  Write me when you can, & when you cannot, tell Willie to, but his letters must not be too short.  Frank said I must be sure & tell you to buy him a drum or trumpet & ball & I don�t know what all.  Fanny talks of the Cocoa nut cake.  You supplied me so well with money, if yours gives out, you must write to me for some.  Tell Willie I hope to hear he has been a good boy.  Perhaps I may not write again until I hear from you.  Yours, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I write to you by Mr. Elford who left yesterday so I did not intend writing by tonights Mail, but I heard something today that worries me & until I communicate it to you I will not feel at ease, so I will send my letter by someone who is going in the Stage tonight.  Yesterday at the Church door, Mr. E� Jones handed me out of the carri[a]ge, & he said he was obliged to go to Columbia, & was sorry he had not gone before the weather became bad.  Ann today said he was Candidate for Solicitor in place of Genl Whitner.  I hardly think he has the presumption to oppose Genl Whitner, so the thought has struck me perhaps Genl Whitner is going to resign.  If so, you are the one to take his place.  You once said Mr. Young would, but I wish you to think of it, if Genl Whitner is not a Candidate, for you deserve the place, & it is a stepping stone to a seat on the bench, so if there are to be new Candidates, do you think of it,  for as you are so well known to the Members you would stand a good chance; so I have now relieved myself, & if I had not I would not have slept well tonight, if I was worried & you are not here to console me, I am kept awake to recollect if Genl Whitner is going to give up, as I think he must be, do you offer, if you think you would be elected, & I know you would be.  I believe the Legislature would elect you to anything you offered.  It is only the ignorant people that will not.  I long to hear how Willie is coming on.  I went for Anna yesterday at Mrs. Town[e]s.  She had spent her time quite pleasantly.  Mr. Town[e]s is going to spend the winter in Florida, & if his prospects are good, come back to his family in the Spring.  Mrs. Town[e]s says she is very lonely.  I went this evening with Mrs. Dr. Williams to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Anna Williams goes to Columbia in the Stage tonight, to take in work, & improve herself, as a Mantua Maker.  She says she is poor, & has her children to support & educate, & must do something to enable her to.  Dr. Irvine also goes, by whom I will send this letter.  Mamma Susan & Ann paid me a visit today.  I expect they will dine with me Wednesday.  The horses will go on ploughing tomorrow.  It rained yesterday afternoon & last night.  The household are all well.  Miss Vance is to be married Thursday night.  I repeat if you do not see anything you think I will like as a warm covering for the Winter as a Shawl�or so forth, do not get me anything.  Frank goes to school & makes no objection.  No letters came for you last night.  Tell Willie I hope he has been a good boy, & I am anxiously waiting for a letter from him.  I wrote today to Eliza & told her Willie had gone with you.  I must now close so as to send my letter to Dr. Jones before he goes to bed.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
P.S. Get Willie all that is necessary to make him look genteel.  I expect to see you quite renovated.  I always wished you to be Solicitor, when Genl Whitner gave up.  You deserve it, & then the salary the Solicitor gets every year, for going to Columbia is somet[h]ing, & now Law business is getting scarce, you ought to think of something  to add to your income.  I think there must be some mistake, if Genl. Whitner has no intention of giving up, but if he has, no doubt Mr. Jones would be a Candidate.

My dear husband

	I expect mamma, Susan & Ann to dine here today.  I have got everything ready for them, & until they come will employ my time writing to you.  I may not be able to write a long  letter.  I am anxiously looking forward to the Mails arrival tonight, bringing me a letter.  Today is rather cold, so as a good many persons are killing hogs.  Reuben & Charles have killed 5.  They intended killing all, but I think it is not cold enough at all.  Mr. Hoke is not killing & came over yesterday to say we had better not; afterwards Reuben said, he told him he might. But I know from his not killing himself, he does not think it cold enough so after killing five, I told Charles he had better not kill any more, but as soon as the weather gets a little colder, they will finish with the others, for it is better not to run a risk with all.  I would have preferred not killing at all today, because it is not as cold weather as we generally kill in, but the servants were so anxious to kill, that they would not wait.
	I was trying to pass my time pleasantly in your absence, so last night I invited Mrs. Kingsland & her Sister & the family generally to take tea with me.  Mrs. Kingsland her Sister & the children came & we spent a very pleasant evening.  Mr. Kingsland came for them, & was quite agreeable.  We looked at the books, pictures, &c.  

	Fanny Town[e]s slept with Anna last night.  Fanny this morning after she was dressed sat on the floor, & after looking quite sad, said, �I wasn�t to see Pa, Ma.�  She talks often of you & if anyone offends her, says I wont give you any cake Pa brings me.  She is now in the Piazza talking to herself, is playing with the Waiters I think, & every now & then saying �you wont do so any more?�  She can amuse herself with any thing.  I hear her now carrying on a conversation, with whatever she is playing with.
	No more letters have come for you.  I suppose persons know you are away.  Only the Charleston paper came last night.  Jim is a shabby fellow.  I sent word to Betsey his Wife, to tell him to come to me.  She sent word she did not expect to see him.  He did not come near her.  He has not been to see her since she returned, & last Sunday told Mr. Arthurs servant, who works at Mr. Rosemonds to stop for 25 cts I owed him; said he had hurt his feet, & could not come in.  I expect he supplied Betseys place, while she was away, & does not care now to see her.  
	Anna & Frank are at school.  Frank likes going very well.  I am wondering how Willie is coming on, & whether he passes his time pleasantly.  It is certainly more improving than to be at home running about the streets.  He will be more manly going about with you.  I hope he is a good boy.  You were wondering who Mr. Hopkins purchased his place from.  It was one of Pink Hawkins� places, called the Dozier place.  He gave I believe 800 dollars for it.  Mr. Beattie purchased the McClanahan place & Mr. Farr the home place.  Mrs. Hopkins Father wishes to purchase a place also, would like the place Mr. Beattie bought, as it joins Mr. Hopkins.  Dr. Simons I have not heard anything of lately.  I�say his school will succeed at first, as a new thing is apt to up here, but as he himself is so unsteady, I hope it will not last, & Mr. Stuart must not be discouraged, if Dr. Simons does for a while get a good many scholars.  Mr. Erwin wishes to rent Dr. Austins house & take boarders as well as assist Mr. Leary. 
        Before this I suppose you have seen Mr. Jones.  I am anxious to know, whether he is a candidate for Solicitor.  I expect next year he will be Candidate for Governor, & in three years for President.  If Genl Whitner is going to give up his Office, you must think of it.  You are more entitled to it, than any other Lawyer on the Circuit, & whenever he does give up, you must take the place.  He has seemed for some time to be so unwell, & take so little interest in his profession, that it seems likely he intends to resign, & Mr. Jones is aware of it.  It is really�to think of being Solicitor, when he cannot issue a Writ; he certainly is ignorant of his real worth.  He is like the ignorant man, Mr. Arthur mentioned in his last sermon, who knew so little, but his ignorance made him think he knew everything, whereas the wise man, knowing how much in reality he was ignorant of, felt humble & diffident.  I am anxious to know if Mr. Jones really is a Candidate for Solicitor, it must be a mistake.
	Our household are well.  I have very little to write you about.  I will try & go see Evel� Foster , who was married last night, if she does not leave too soon.  
	I must now close, with love to Willie & yourself.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
P.S. You must try & get the place for Mr. Markleys son.
Since finishing my letter I have seen Charles & he says he has killed all the hogs.  Susan is now here, & says Mr. Luther says it is the right weather to kill, that his Father & a great many are killing today, that though it is not very cold still this kind of weather will continue.

My dear husband

	I ought not to write to you today, for I have now written you three letters, & received not one from you.  I have always said if I was neglected by my husband, I would not bear it calmly & submissively, as some poor, weak spirited Wives do.  You will think now I am not putting my Theory into practice.  I assure you I only write because I am certain tonight I will hear, a most justifiable excuse.  You are always so attentive in writing, that when I do not hear, I am sure it is business prevents you, & I am always pleased you should have just as much business as possible to occupy you.  I mentioned in my last that Mamma, Susan, Ann & the children were to dine with me that day.  Mr. McBee I invited but he was busy assisting in the Hog killing at his fathers, so did not come.  We spent a pleasant day.  Yesterday after breakfast, I was surprised by a visit from Clarke & Harriet Perry.  They came to Eveline Fosters wedding.  They dined here.  I asked them to pass the night, but they said they had promised to return to Mr. Fosters, & were to leave for home this morning by the way of Mr. Hunts, where they would sleep tonight.  Clarke regretted you were not at home.  He walked to the Mill, & the Village & Harriet walked over the house, & I entertained her as well as I could.  I thought they were going to pass the night & ordered the carri[a]ge to carry her to ride, but they said they could not stay.  So I carried Mrs. Forbes to Mr. Colemans place.  Mr. Powell is painting the house Straw colour, & it looks much prettier than ours.  The colour of our house is entirely too deep.  I am longing for it to fade.  Eveline left for Abbeville yesterday.  She had a small wedding. Principally the family, & the persons Dr. Cox brought with him from Abbeville.  She is just 15, he about 21.  Miss Vance was married last night; only the connexions of the parties were invited.  Mrs. Dr. Williams says Mr. Dubose came here last summer in search of a Wife; at Mrs. Brooks he saw Miss Vance.  Miss Ann Anderson came to see me yesterday.  She says Mrs. Stuart the Wife of the Teacher of the Academy, is a very plane lady in appearance quite a contrast to her husband, & quiet in manners, that they have been married several years, & lost one child, that Mr. Stuart has taught in her brothers family. & was once private Tutor in the Rutledge family in Statesburg, & gave private lessons to young ladies, at the same time that he kept a school for boys.  Dr. Simons has five borders engaged to him & some scholars I am afraid his�will take, particularly from his saying he would be cheaper than any other.

	I gave you wrong information about your Hogs.  First I said they had killed only 5, & afterwards said they had killed all.  I misunderstood, Reuben says they killed 9, & left 4 which had been injured by fighting &c to be killed at a future time.  The weather still continues cold enough to be safe.  They are going on with the ploughing today.  It does seem a pity to put such fine horses in the plough.  You must get a Mule.  I have heard Mrs. Sam Earle was coming on with Mr. Earle to be with Dr. T� in her confinement.  

	Mamma paid a visit to Mrs. Rowland lately & heard the other side of the quarrel, & it really seems from Mrs. Rowlands representation that she is not at all to blame.  She says she is not as well off as persons think, & her son John left his property to her on that account, & on his death bed wished he had more to leave her; that at her death, she intended leaving it to his Sisters, but that Mr. Beattie & themselves made so much fuss about it,  that her son Tom & Mrs. Henry Earle begged her to give it up at once to them, & they would return her what she had given them; that she had given it up now, & was so straightened, she intended to sell her place, & move to another place she owned 20 miles in the Country, that she had worked hard to give her children a good education & a start in life, & this was her return, that�Speers she always liked, but Mrs. Speers would not let her give anything.  What she gave Mrs. Speers had settled on herself.  She said a good deal more, & cried bitterly, & said the ungrateful conduct of her children was the greatest affliction she had ever met with.

	Ann received by the last Mail a pleasant letter from Paul.  In it he says that he had that morning seen Alston Hayne, who had lately returned from Philadelphia, that Alston inquired particularly about us all, & had a high opinion of your abilities, & regretted your non election to Congress, (& which I will never cease to regret)[.]

	We are all well.  Anna & Frank are at school.  I think Frank finds it much pleasanter at Mr. Beads�, than he did at Dr. Simons school.  He had no dread of�now.  Fanny is playing about, & still talks about you, & Billy in Lumbia.  She is as�as ever & as interesting.  Since sleeping at Fanny Town[e]s & bringing her home to sleep with her, the very next day when she came from school, said Fanny Town[e]s had quarreled with her.  Anna had taken a tuck out of her dress, which made it quite long , & Fanny Town[e]s told her, her dress was too long.  Anna replied, that she dressed as her Mamma wished her, & so Fanny got miffed & left her seat at the desk with Anna, & would not speak to her, & Mary Croft who had quarreled with her companion, left her desk & came & sat with Anna.  I have not asked whether the quarrel was made up yet.  

	Yesterday as I was riding, I saw Judge Moore walking with a lady.  I could not see the ladys face well as she had on a sun bonnet.

	Our dining room now looks very comfortable.  I have shut up one of the doors by the Sideboard
 & removed the Table in that direction, & a little in front of where the Table was, put the Sofa, the one Jim made.  Mamma & my Sisters think it the sweetest little Sofa they ever saw, & now that E� has altered the Cover, & made it right, it does look very comfortable.  Mr. Rosemond came here yesterday. He measured the distance for the Fence, & will send a bill of what it will cost.  I believe I have nothing more to tell you.  Mamma desired their love to you when I wrote.  Mrs. Hokes family are to take tea with me this evening.  Tell Willie he does not know how anxious I am to know how he is getting on.  I hope to hear a good account of him, & that he will return quite a man, & never quarrel with his brother & sisters again.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. I have a shocking pen, & do not want to trouble Mr. N� very often to mend it.

My dear husband

	I have just finished reading Willie�s letter; yours to me, & yours to Mr. Wells, the letter Mr. Wells I am sure will think entirely too long.  It is now 8 oclock, too late to commence writing, but I am more at leisure now, than I will be tomorrow.  Tell Willie his letter is a very pretty one, & I value it, because it was written entirely by himself.  You must make him write me a little every day, telling all that he has seen & done, & in this way, have a long letter to send me by each Mail, & your must also write, for never mind how much business you have in the day, at night before retiring to bed, you can write me a letter, you write so quickly.  I look forward anxiously to the arrival of this Mail, & you cannot imagine my disappointment, if I do not have.  I was very much provoked Friday night when Mrs. Irvine�me my letter.  Dr. Irvine had written to tell her where it was.  The reason of my writing by him was this.  As I had written by Mr. Elford, I did not intend writing by the next Mail, which would arrive on the evening after him, but I heard some news about Mr. Jones which worried me, & to relieve my mind, I wished instantly to impart it to you.  The Mail had closed so I sent to the Stage Office to inquire who was going.  They sent word Dr. Irvine & Mrs. Anna Williams, so I sent my letter to Dr. Irvine.  I will send it along with this one.  I have not read it over, but I wish you to know why I wrote about Mr. Jones, which will explain what I alluded to  in my next letter.  I was sorry & provoked at what you told me of Isaac Hayne as it showed such a mean spirit.  He no doubt has not got over the prejudice he contracted against you  during political times, though self interest made him forget it last winter, & though you have married into the Hayne family, his branch is not nearly connected with ours, & it was only our being brought up with his Sisters that made us intimate.  He is a Stranger to me, & therefore he feels no interest, (though perhaps he ought to) in you on my account; & I must say that all of Uncle Haynes first children as they have grown up & settled in life, have proved themselves utterly  selfish & ungrateful & indifferent to all but themselves & families.  They were indebted to Mamma for a home, when they needed one, & no one else offered.  Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor & ourselves were like Sisters, but now the only times I have seen them for years, they have been so cold & selfish & indifferent, that I have lost all respect for them, & would expect more from a Stranger than from them.  Isaac Hayne I suppose is just like them, & he can hardly have lived with his Wife without having contracted her bad qualities.  She is proud, sarcastic, selfish in the extreme, the spoiled favorite of her Mother, & never regarded anyone of importance but herself, & now only those nearly connected with her.  But in spite of all of this, I was going to say, that perhaps your manner towards Isaac Hayne was not cordial, & he may have perceived it, & made his less so, for you have though unconscious to yourself, often a cold forbidding manner, not sociable enough, & you know in your Elections your manner has always been objected to , & has made you enemies.  I am glad in your last letter, that you say Mr. Haynes manner is more cordial, for if possible, I wish you to be friends, & persons often dislike one another from not knowing each other personally, & if they would be�to be familiar & pleasant towards each other, would respect & like each other, so do you in your manner be cordial when you meet.  You can soon see whether he reciprocates.  What you mentioned about your being thought of as Governor, I know you meant only as a joke.  I am certain the legislature would give you any Office you applied for, & though you are not lowered in my opinion by your late defeat, in the eyes of others you are.  A defeated man seems like a fallen man, until he is elected to some equally honorable station as the one he strived for.  So I say my dear husband, let your friends or do you get some friend to bring your name forward for Governor.  The Upper Country ought to have the next one, & if you come forward in time, you will be sure to be elected, & then I will be reconciled to my late great disappointment, but until you succeed  in gaining some distinction of this kind, I never will get over it.  I am surprised at so many Upper Country members going for the Bank.  I thought you had the popular view, & felt easy.  I am afraid now you are on the unpopular; not that I wish you to change, but I had felt so�on the subject, thinking the Majority were with you.  I am sorry you have so little money.  You ought not to have changed your pencil, & given with an exorbitant boot, for your pencil was a superior one.  You ought to have given it to me, & changed mine.  After getting me something warm, only get some Cocoa nut cakes for the children, that will please them as much as anything.  Toys they instantly break.  I will send by this Mail a letter Anna wrote you this morning, her first letter & she is just 8.  From the way she holds her pen & forms her letters, I can tell that she has been carelessly instructed in writing.  Indeed the Academys have had poor Teachers.  I am so vexed with Dr. Simons.  I wish he would be�, does not you quick sense tell you that Mr. Stuart has seen his extravagant puff, & it is this that has made his resign.  He is a gentleman & does not wish to be involved in squabbles with opposition schools.  You know he said that he would not apply for the Academy, if Mr. Bradshaw intended remaining & setting up a school in opposition.  His wifes health is only an excuse.  It was expressly on account of health he was coming here.  I would not be surprised if Dr. Simons in his mean]n]ess had written to tell him, he himself expected to have a flourishing school.  I am sure he has injured Greenville enough already, deprived the Academy of a fine Teacher, & the Church of a delightful Organist.  I anticipated much pleasure hearing Mrs. Stuart play.  I wish you to write to him, & persuade him to accept. If his Wife is in bad health, Greenville is the very place to come to.  You may be sure that is not the reason at all.  Dr.  Simons is.  You know what Machivelli says.  It has been raining all day & I was afraid it was getting too warm for our meat, but it is now getting very cold.  The Shelter for the Cows fell down yesterday, & for fear the Stable might follow suit, Reuben at present has our horses in Mr. Goodletts Stable.  They are locked up carefully.  In this wet weather, he says there is more danger of the Stable falling than in dry.  Jim was here last night, &�he did not know where his Wife was staying, said he knew what had occurred between them, & it was best for him to keep away.  He says Mr. Rosemond will have some large jobs next year, & he thinks finds him so useful, will give good wages for him  I think he will for Jim is a good carpenter & must be great help.  I have been reading today Lectures on Bunyan & the Pilgrims Progress, lent me by Mrs. Pearson, a very good work, though severe against Churchmen.  It is written I think by a Presbyterian.  Bunyan was an open Communion Baptist, & was imprisoned 12 years during Charles 2d reign on account of his non conformity to the established Church, & in prison wrote the Pilgrims Progress.  I have read also to Anna & Frank, & Fanny took up a book & thought she was reading too.  She is the smartest & most interesting child I ever saw.  Tell Willie I am very much pleased at his letter, & would write to him by this Mail, if it was not that 3 letters are ready to go.  Do send me your letters to read first, that are written for the Mountaineer.  I enjoy them more, than when I see them in the paper.  The last paper I have not even sent for, but will tomorrow, when I send your letter.  You must write good letters, & not get into trouble by them.  The one tonight I liked, but I think you might have condensed it more.  You must think of some honor to gain from the Legislature.  In Mr. Calhouns Congressional District I am afraid you can never gain anything.  I [am] thankful at any rate you are in the Legislature, some field for your talents. I see Mr. Whitt� compliments you.  You must subscribe for his Wifes poetry.  You must continue in the Legislature if you cannot do anything more, but you must think of being Governor.

Dear Willie


	I wrote to Papa last night, & have sent the letter to the Post office, along with the one Dr. Irvine ought to have carried & also one Anna wrote yesterday.  As so many letters were going by this Mail, I thought I would write to you by the next, but today I find I have so much to say, I feel I must write.  I am so much alone, I get thinking, & having no one to express my thoughts to. I am obliged to write.  I was very glad to receive your letter.  You must write often & tell me everything you see & what persons you see, & how you enjoy yourself.  I think you must be passing your time quite pleasantly.  You have set the fashion for little boys going with their Fathers to Columbia.  It will be followed.  Ann� says Mr. Jones perhaps will take his son & Col. Town[e]s Alex the next time.  I would not send a son younger than you are.  You are just old enough to take care of yourself, & notice things & improve from associating with gentlemen.  I am glad you have new clothes.  I have always preferred a round Jacket to a Frock coat.  I have never seen you in a Coat, so cannot imagine how you look.  You must be a good boy.  Papa has done so much for you to make you happy.  Anna says she wishes to read your books.  Papa must not  bring many presents to the Children, for he will need all his money to pay your board, & to give you to spend in other ways.  12 numbers of the Lady�s book for 1849 have come.  Mr. Godey wrote word those were all he had, that he would get two bound volumes of the years previous at a high price 5 dollars a peice, & if Papa wanted them, he would have to send 5 dollars more.  Frank & Anna carried their dinner today.  It is so wet, so I have only Fanny at home.  Frank dreams of you every night; says he dreamt last night you had grown so big.  I expect he saw you in your new suit.  Have you new pantaloons & waistcoat? as well as Coat.  I hope you read in your little Testament every day, & say your prayers, & that you clean your teeth. & have your face & hands washed very nicely.  I am glad you behave like a little man.  Today I suppose you are at the College Commencement.  When you are graduating, I will go to Columbia to hear you speak.  Perhaps Papa will carry Frank next Spring.  I sent word to Poinsett Wells that you had bought him a knife.  I send in this letter a 2 dollar bill, which Papa must keep, & out of it pay 1 dollar or 1.25 for my shoes.  I send it because as Papa has not much money I would rather pay for the Shoes out of what he left me.  Mr. Leary I believe  gives holiday next week.  I am so sorry Mr. Stuart is not coming.  I am certain Dr. Simons having set up an opposition school is the cause of his resigning.  Mr. Arthur has moved back to the Parsonage.  I have no news to tell you.  Grandma says she can never love any grandchild as well as you, for she helped to take care of you, when you were a baby.  I wish you would pay a visit to Charleston.  You would stay with Aunt Eliza, but I expect Papa would hardly have the money now to let you go.  You have travelled a good deal for a little fellow like you.  Fanny talks often of Billy, & thought your letter was written to her.  She has put it away in a corner, & will not let me have it.  Your affectionate Mama, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	You will think I am in a writing humour, but really having no one to talk to, it is a relief to write, having written so much by this Mail.  Unless I have any particular thing to relate, I may not write by the next Mail.  I sent your letter this morning to Mr. Wells.  If you continue to write, be careful in all you say, & not get into any trouble, & write good letters.  I am quite worried about the Bank question.  You say it is such an important question.  I hope you understand it well & are on the right side.  I am staggered when I hear of Col. Irby, Mr. Henry, & so many intelligent upcountry gentlemen going for it, & am surprised that 3 members from Greenville should.  I had thought the very name of B� was odious to the Upper Country, but it seems so many of them are in favour of it, as in the Lower.  So examine the subject & be sure you are right.  You cannot think how sorry I am at Mr. Stuarts resignation, & am particularly provoked  with Dr. Simons, who I feel certain is the cause, & to think such an Organist we have lost.  I wish you would write to him & tell him his Wifes health would improve in Greenville.  I am very sorry you did not carry my pencil case down, & exchange it instead of yours.  I suppose you could have exchanged it on the same terms, & yours was a superior English one, which I would like to have had.  You blame others for fickleness, & liking to change, but you are very fond of changing all you have yourself.  Some of the servants say, they hear Mr. & Mrs. Sam Earle are here.  I do not know but as tomorrow is the Sale, suppose he at least is.  Mr. Moore was here, not his Wife, the lady with him was Miss Thurston.

	Send your letters to me to read, if you write any to Mr. Wells, I have not looked at the last Mountaineer yet.  I would rather read your letters in manuscript.  They give me more pleasure there.    The B� Office Reports, & a book on Mexico & California with a map.  I have written Willie about the Lady�s books.  There are two or three pretty pictures in each number.  The rest are woodcuts.  I believe I have said all I had to say.  I only feel�that the majority of the people are for the Bank, & I am sorry if you are on the unpopular side, & as Mr. Elmore thinks it is so important that you should go for the Bank so�to us, you ought to examine the subject well.  I do not mean to interfere.  I only tell  my thoughts.  You must speak well & distinguish yourself as you have hitherto done.  I wish I could be seated in the Gallery by Willie listening to you.  Before next winter we will perhaps get a new carri[a]ge, & I can go down for part of the Session, & hear you, if you are still in the Legislature, but I believe it is so cold now, I will prefer going in the Spring, if ever I do go.  I will go to see you inaugurated.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Col. Ware is so politic.  What makes him go for the bank.  He keeps very quiet.  He does not distinguish himself, but he gets along easily with all parties, & so finds no difficulty in being elected.  If nothing better offers, in two years, you must have your place back again, that he now has.

		Though I have nothing very particular to write about, as you may be disappointed if you do not hear, I will write you again.  I expect you were surprised by the last Mail.  I have just returned from carrying Mrs. Forbes to ride to Mr. Lowndes.  The view is prettier than I ever saw it.  The whole village & all the settlements about can be seen.  I told Mrs. Forbes Mr. Stuart had resigned, & she said; so Mrs. Durb� said, & with what spirit he had acted; that she understood when he went home. & began to consider the manner in which he had been elected, & how badly Dr. Simons had been treated by the Trustees, particularly how a Committee had acted, he determined to resign.  Did you ever hear such a story, & yet there may be truth in it.  You may depend on it.  Dr. Simons has had some understanding with him.  He has written to him & given him a Statement of his treatment.  Mrs. Forbes said she heard Mr. Stuart was elected on account of his being rich, that he had plenty of negroes to bring along with him.  All this I suppose has come from Dr. Simons, & if he has not written to Mr. Stuart, at any rate these are the reasons he gives for Mr. Stuarts resignation.  I begin to think it strange in Mr. Stuart to have resigned.  He had no right to, & it was no reason to give; his Wifes ill health, for I always understood he came here on account of health, that where he had been living was sickly.  Perhaps it will all be for the best; though on account of the Organ I will also regret his not coming.  Mr. Davis has been elected.  I hope he will be a good Teacher, for the children have been sadly neglected.  Dr. Simons acted outrageously.  I think Willie learned nothing with him.  Charlotte Smith told Miss Stuart; in Charleston he is thought half cracked.  Yesterday was a gloomy day;  I sat down quite easy, though I would see no one all day.  Minerva & Mary had gone to the Spring to wash. Eliza was sick in bed, & Lindy was to be our Cook.  At 11 I heard a wrap at the door & to my surprise Miss Stuart & little Henry Thompson were there.  Miss Stuart said she was obliged to shop, & had come to my home as being more convenient to shop from, than Genl Thompsons.  I told her I was glad to have her, but she never would have found me more unprepared to entertain her well.  So she went to shop & I laid the table nicely & Lindy killed a fowl & fixed it, & we had a Fist, & with the help of raisons, Almonds, & sweetmeats, we did quite well.

		Poor Mr. Kinloch died this morning.  He has been ill a long time.  His Mother & his sister Mrs. Singleton, passed down some time ago from Flat Rock.  His cousin Mr. Middleton, Mrs. William Lowndes both staid with him to nurse him.  It seems so strange his mother did not come up to him.  He is an only son.  His parents have been separated for a long time.  When he was a little boy we used to see him in New Haven where he was going to school.  Mrs, Forbes says she has heard he was sent there to be away from his Father & as soon as he had finished school, was put in the Navy, & when he found out how his Father had been treated, & that he had been purposely kept away from him, he had a difference with his Mother on account of it.  So I suppose this is the reason his Mother has not been with him.  I expect he had great feeling.  He died of an affection of the heart.  The funeral takes place tomorrow morning at the Mansion House.  The father I believe is in the Asylum at Columbia.  His Mother is a sister of Mrs. Aiken.  I sent to Mrs. Hoke to know who bought Mr. Ed Earles place, thinking you would wish to know, & she sent word Mr. Sam Earle, & that he gave 12,100 dollars for it.  I believe it is a mistake, Mrs. Sam Earle being here.  I have not heard anything about him except that he was here.  

		We have cold weather, so the hogs were killed at a very good time.  We are all well except Eliza, who has been in bed for 3 days with pain in her side,  She is better & thinks she will be up tomorrow.

		I hope to hear tonight from you.  It is a great disappointment when I do not hear.

		Tomorrow night there is to be a Cotillion party given as a farewell compliment to Mary Bradshaw & her sister.  Frank goes cheerfully to school, & is learning to read.  Fanny is my little companion, & all I can say of her is, she is as sweet & amusing as ever.

		I paid Mr. Miller for the Potatoes & bought some more.  Reuben & Charles ploughed yesterday, & are to plough this afternoon.  I hope soon to get a long letter from Willie, & to hear good accounts of him.  He attended Commencement I suppose, & perhaps Commencement Ball.  I will now bid you adieu with love to Willie.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. Willie said Aunt Eliza wrote a note to you asking you to send him to town.  Did you answer it.  I wish he could go.

My dear husband
		I received a letter from you the last Mail & it gave me great pleasure.  I am glad cousin Isaac Hayne is more cordial.  I expect his coldness at first was owing to your manner, & as I wish you to be on good terms, you must return his visit & take Willie with you.  Mr. Heyward, is Nat Heyward, who we were intimate with at New Haven, & who liked me particularly.  He is a cousin of ours.  His Mother was a Miss Barnwell.  You must be very polite to him, for our sake.  I am gratified to hear how well Willie behaves.  Mamma is afraid he looks too much like a man with his frock coat & cravat.  I hope his coat is a Sack.  I am glad you have fitted up yourself well in Clothes, for you needed them, & it gives me pleasure  to see you well dressed.  I think married persons ought to dress better after marriage than they did before,  They ought to appear as comely as possible to each other.  They have then one person at least to please, before they had no one in particular.  Susan now tells me that Mr. Jones mentioned she thinks in his correspondence to Mr. McBee, that probably in two years he will be Candidate for Solicitor, that Genl Whitner perhaps will not wish to be reelected & Mr. McBee mentioned it to her, as showing how conceited he was.  I heard it in this manner.  I said to Ann, Mr. Jones is going to Columbia, & she said yes.  He is a Candidate for Solicitor the office Genl Whitner has.  I felt certain Genl Whitner was going to resign so in two years, if you have been elected to nothing more lucrative or honorable you must think of it, but in earnest I hope someone will bring you forward as Mr. Seabrook�s successor.  All have to convince themselves & do for themselves & if you give a hint to some friend, to propose you, you will be elected, for the Legislature can appreciate you more  than the people did, & of course give you whatever you asked for, & the Upper Country ought to share the honours equally with the Lower, & Greenville has not yet had that honour bestowed on her. 

		Dr. Tiddyman has written word that the Rail Road shall not pass through his land, but that he wil sell them his place at 10,000 dollars, & you know he thought he was cheated when he gave 7000 for it.  What is the Law on the subject; cannot they have the right of way, whether he gives it or not?  How illiberal he is.  I think he is a mean old man.  Mr. Cox who gave a high price for his place, I think it was 25,000 dollars, says he will sell his place for a Depot, for 8000 dollars. 

		We attended Mr. Kinloch�s funeral yesterday at the Episcopal Church.  It was a sad funeral, only 20 persons at it, & his cousin & servant chef mourners.  I should think his Mother would never forgive herself, for not having been with her only son, the best of his name in his dying moments.  I hear he was a handsome, accomplished young man.  Every vehicle that stopped at the door, he would ask if his friends had come.  They were written for.  He afterwards felt better & came down into the Bar room, & so countermanded the order.  He rode out to try his strength, to see if he would bear the journey down, but found he could not, & became so much worse, that his friends were written for again, the�weeks he�down stairs, he was brought down a�; if he was sick enough to remain up here & his cousin obliged to remain with him, it shows that he needed his Mother, & if she had loved him she would have been with him.  Mrs. Forbes says she has heard, he was indignant at the treatment of his Father.  Mr. Croft says his Father is not in the Asylum.  He saw him in Charleston when he was last there.  It is singular that at New Haven, we should meet with the little boy he was then, every day going to school. & here in Greenville, we should be brought in contact with him again but in so sad a way,

		Mrs. Sam Jones is in the Village today, so I invited her & Mrs. Town[e]s to come & take tea with me this evening, & invited Mrs. Elford also.  They are coming,  Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon are going to spend the afternoon with me.  They are afraid to be out after dark, on account of the cold.  I have made some nice Jelly, & some Custard for them, & have sent to ask Mamma & Susan, family to come.  Anna last night took tea  with Fanny Town[e]s next door.  They are good friends again.  Miss McBee told Susan the other day, she was anxious to see her to tell what Mr. Bradshaw said of Anna.  He says, Anna is the brightest genius in his school.  She ought to be smart, if she takes after you, as you daughters do after Fathers.  I am willing all should be like you.  Miss Stuart says Fannys face from her nose down is the express image of yours.

		Ann begs me to request you, to buy for her, a large box representing an Apple such as you bought for her before.  You recollect it I suppose.  She will return the money.  As you are Vardry�s Godfather you must bring him some little present to show you think of him.  If you see nothing suitable or pretty or reasonable to buy for me, to wear this winter, I will wait until you come back, & what money you can spare, send to town  & buy something there.  In Charleston they have a great variety & you can get an article for almost any price you choose.  In Columbia everything is dear & not such a variety as in Charleston.  So if you can get nothing for me you like I prefer waiting & sending to Charleston, when I am certain I can get something pretty & reasonable.

		I wish you to do one thing in the Legislature, & that is make an alteration in the Court of Appeals.  Introduce a law to make the lower country Lawyers try their Appeal cases in Charleston, when the Court sits there, & the Upper country Lawyers try their cases only in Columbia.  As it is now, the Lower Country has more than she is entitled to, & the Upper Country entirely overlooked & unjustly treated,

		The weather continues cold, so our meat is safe.  I see Dr. Irvine has returned.  What 3 votes did Mr. Walker get?  Perhaps it would have been best for you to have voted for him, to have gained his kind feelings.  You had best be polite to Mr. Jones  Though he is so vain, how much happier he is, than if he was conscious of his real value.  I have no news to tell you.  Mrs. Turpin came to see me yesterday.  Miss Vance is married & gone.  We are all well.  Reuben & Charles are ploughing.  I paid Mr. Slatton yesterday for Flour.  He says they marked it at the Mill, Superior.  Send pamphlets home to your constituents, such as Dr. Crook who once said you did not.  You must answer Aunt Eliza�s letter, & thank her for inviting Willie.  I wish he would go down & see his friends.  Has Judge Dunkin given you the money for Mrs. D�Oyley.   Col. Irv� has gone to the West to sell a Drove of negroes, & while he is absent his Wife has gone home.  Caroline Earle went with her.  What an uninteresting employment he has.  Examine all subjects brought before the Legislature well, always be sure you are on the right side, & I hope it will happen aways to be on the popular side.  Give our love to Willie.  Grandma & all send love.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Sunday night, 9 December 1849
Greenville

My dear husband 

		It is just 8 oclock, so I will spend one hour in writing to you.  I have read your letters to Anna & myself, & Willies letter to me, all of which have given me great pleasure.  This has been a rainy day, so we have not been to church.  I finished reading Lectures on the Pilgrims Progress lent me by Mrs. Pearson, & it is so interesting.  I wish you  to read it when you return.  I read this morning in the Bible to Mary, Lindy, Charlotte, Sarah & the children,  & tonight until the Mail came I began the Pilgrims Progress to Mary & Lindy, explaining it as I read.  I am surprised you did not send a letter to Mr. Wells, for you would have had more to write about now, than at first, & the people like news & business matters, more than sketches of character, which you[r] first letter consisted of.  I received the first letter you wrote to come by Mr. Keith Friday night.  He paid me a visit last night, said that he had just arrived, that he was not able to leave Columbia the day he expected, & put your letter in the Post Office.  He went on today to Pickens.  Unless your compliments amount to something in reality, it only provokes me.  What makes me unhappy, is my aspirations for you, & that they are not realized.  It is only your being elected to something honorable that can make me forget your late defeat, so you must embrace the first chance that offers.  I am vexed that you should have declined Genl Adams suggestion , for it is an honour to be a Candidate for Governor.  Even if not elected, you must consent to any proposal made you, & whatever it is, do not think it will interfere with your private interests.  I can attend to them, & I am willing to stay in Greenville, & live economically, so you are honoured, & if you wish to remove to any place, you can sell your property here to advantage, now, property has risen so.  To have a good chance for Governor  you must be �get out soon, so if anything more is said to you, do you consent, for the Salary is good, & for only 2 years will not interfere with your other business, for you have partners, & can have more during that time.  As regards being President of the Bank, I was willing for it, if you are.  It is from the State that with Mr. Elmore, & ever since has been a flaming Bank man.  I was glad to find Mr. Keith was against the Bank, & he says the majority of the people of Pickens & Greenville are.  I had begun to be uneasy about you, fearing you were as usual in a small minority.  I hope you will make an able speech on the subject.  You ought certainly to have dined with the Governor.  I hope you will be appointed Trustee of the College again, that is such a dignified office.  I am glad you are one of the Board of Visitors, & that you think you will be appointed a delegate to the Southern Convention.  Mr. Keith says some alteration ought to be made in the Court of Appeals that the  Charleston Lawyers shall not try their cases there in Columbia so you must attend to this as I wrote you.  Commissioner of Equity ought to be given to the people, but not Attorney General, Controller &c. to the Governor or people.  It would be giving him too much power.  He would favour his friends.  I see you introduced a bill of that kind.  Tom Butler knew not whether we were sick or well.  I heard he arrived one evening, & left that very night again for Columbia.  Now that I think of it, you must get the Sum allowed last Session for the Electors, & which you have never got.  There is one book which I wish you to buy me, & that is, �the Lady Alice or the new Una.�  Mr. Brown said it was one of the best books he had read for a long time, so do not forget it, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers, by Bulwer.  You have the second part called Alice, so ought to have the first.  In Anna�s letter you Say you have bought my Shawl.  I thank you.  I was going to quarrel with you for getting White, which was expressly what I told you not to get, but as the Shawl is so reasonable I cannot object.  I am afraid it will not suit my other clothes.  I ought now to have a  Winter �.  If you see a reasonable one you might get me one, a dark Silk or velvet.  About the Canary birds, I do not know what to say.  Anna is asleep & has not read your letter.  If you could afford it I would like them; perhaps it is the only chance we may ever have of getting them & four dollars for a p[ai]r including the Cage is reasonable, & you can have the Cage fixed in some part of your Buggy, & must bring up seed, & we can raise the birds.  Aunt Mary Hayne�them, &  can give me directions, so my advice is, if you have the money to get them.  I am glad you are so much pleased with Anna�s letter.  You do injustice to Frank.  Dr. Simons taught him nothing.  The short time he  has been going to Mr. Bradshaws, Mr. Burnham the assistant has taught him to read.  Today he has been reading in a religious Primer, Aunt Eliza sent him some time ago.  When you come back, he will be able to read it through to you, & he loves to read, as soon as a child can read he takes great interest in it.  He said yesterday he wished to write to you, that he would hold the pen, & I must move it for him, & you would think he wrote it.  Frank has too fine a face not to be more than ordinary.  Aunt Eliza was selfish in her kindness to Willie.  Self interest governs her.  Mrs. Isaac Hayne used to be very pretty, though with some defects, a long chin, & bad figure & walk.  I had heard she was faded, but have not seen her for years.  I am glad Col. Hayne & yourself are better friends.  Fanny yesterday morning when she woke up, said, �Ma, Pa sleep here.�  I said �no, Pa is in Lumbia.�  She said, �I want Pa to come soon, I want Pa to come now.�  We all would be very glad to see Willie & yourself, but all I think of is your happiness, & Greenville is so dull now, I am glad you are in Columbia among congenial spirits.  I am surprised you did not write to Mr. Wells.  I sent to him just now to know if he had received a letter from you, & he sends word no.  When you write again, enclose the letter to me, as I like to read it in manuscript.  I have not seen the last Mountaineer.  I put them when I send for them in the Library, without opening them.  The two Mrs. Town[e]s & Mrs. Elford took tea with me Friday evening, & we had a pleasant sociable time.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s makes any place pleasant. She seems so free from envy, & bad feelings towards others.  Mr. Mauldin says Dr. Simons rejoices now he was not elected, says he was disappointed at first, but he would not be in the power of such a set of men as the Trustees on any account.  He has published a Circular, in which he says, his table will be furnished with the best of the Land, fresh & good from his Farm.  He is looking out for some white man to live on his Farm, & cultivate it on shares with him.  He dined at the Mansion House lately, & Mrs. Forbes says made his story out quite clear, that says the Board of Trustees consists of 10, that 7 form a quorum, that he got 4 votes, & besides Mr. B� wrote a note, saying he must get his & Mr. Roberts who was absent wished him to have his, & yet the Trustees say Mr. Stuart was elected unanimously, that he heard Mr. Stuart�s resignation was attributed to him, but he had no doubt, Mr. Stuart staid here long enough to see what kind of men the Trustees were.  Said you troubled yourself very little about who was elected.  He considers Mr. Stuarts resignation quite a feather in his cap.  Susan Hoke says she heard that a lady who went down in the Stage with Mr. Stuart says, he said he had amused himself with the people of Greenville, but I think this must be false.  He has however acted I think dishonourably & unjustifiably, accepting the place  & then resigning it,when it was not of the power of the Trustees to elect those they might have chosen  & had in their power, if he had not accepted, for Mr. D� who I hear was the second choice, & has been written to, has had a situation now offered him in Columbia, & therefore may decline this.  Mr. Smith also has a place, so Mr. Stuart has prevented the Academy having a good teacher.  His Wifes ill health is foolishness, for it must be the same now, as a few weeks ago, when he accepted.  I would like you to have voted for Arthus Simkins, on account of old associations.  Mr. Keith says Mr. Jones is a candidate for two Offices, neither of which are vacant, Solicitor & Brigadier General.  Genl G� it is thought, may resign.  He is�to be in time.

		Yesterday was very cold, today it has been raining & is warmer, but if it is cold tomorrow, Reuben & Charles will kill the 4 remaining hogs, & so save the Corn.  I have had the Gutters cleaned out.  You had better vote Richard Stone for a Director of the Bank, on account of Tom Butler who has generally been your friend, & Mrs. Stone who is mine. Mr. Keith says he thinks there are more members against the Bank than for it, that the vote that was taken on the subject of the special Committee in which there was a tie, some who were against the Bank, voted on that question with the friends of the Bank.  It is now getting late.  I will finish my letter tomorrow.  When I go to bed tonight, before I go to sleep, many things will occur to my mind, that I wish to mention to you, one sheet will not hold half I have to say,

Monday morning.  I have a good pen & will now my dear finish my letter.  Anna the first thing this morning when she woke looked under her pillow to feel for your letter.  I told her when she went to bed, if one came, I would put it there, but I had forgot to.  She dressed & came downstairs & I read it to her & it pleased her very much.  She sat down & answered it, but only had a short time before School, so hurried & did not write it as well as the last.  She is quite pleased at the idea of the Birds.  Frank is surprised you do not say what you will bring him, & while we were talking about your letter, Fanny said you must write to her.  She had a book a little while ago, & said she was going to play school.  She was to be little Sis, �(Sarah) big Sis, & C� was to be Mother.  Frank is now sitting down reading his book.  He wont let me tell him the words, says he knows, so it is amusing to hear him, but he manages to find out a great many.  Tell Willie I will soon write to him, & Anna says she will write after he has written to her.  I think his letters do quite well, when you think he has never written  but one or two before in his life.  I hope this visit will be of lasting benefit to him.  The other parents had better leave their children at home.  They are not equal to Willie.  It is a damp drizzly day, so the hogs are not to be killed, but as soon as it becomes cold again, they will be.  Anna has gone to school.  She will have holiday the middle of this week.  Wha Office is Dr.St� a Candidate for?  I hope Mr. Burt will not be elected Secretary of State.  He is a malignant creature.  Mr. Keith says you have often nonsuited him in court which is one reason of his dislike to you.

		You seem to make no complaint of want of money, & say you would have given even 15 dollars for my Shawl.  As the Shawl is so pretty & yet reasonable, you must spend the remainder of the 10 dollars which is what you were to give for the Shawl, in a bonnet for me 6 dollars or less could buy a pretty winter bonnet,�Silks or any kind that is fashionable.  I will need one now to wear with my Shawl.  I had intended wearing a Straw bonnet trimmed with Blue, that I wore in the summer, for a bonnet cannot even be trimmed well here.  But as the Shawl has cost so little, you must spend the remainder of the money allowed for it, in a bonnet whatever kind is fashionable.  I think you can get one for less than 6 dollars, & buy me the books I have mentioned �The lady Alice, or the new Una.�  Mr. Brown said it was a superior work, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers by Bulwer.  It is the first part of Alice which you bought at Mr. Earles sale.  If you have still money enough, buy Miss Pardoe�s [�] Francis the First.�  Of course if you have not the money you must not think of getting these things.  You must get your money due you as an Elector.  I wish you would send me the Telegraph, that contains all the news I believe.  I should think you might give up the Banner edited by Mr. Morgan, the Carolinian is sufficient.  I suppose you are beginning to have gloomy weather in Columbia as we have here.  Stay until the very end of the Session.  I will be delighted if you are elected President of the Bank, or Governor or any honourable Office.  Genl Adams seems a good sincere friend.  I have just asked Fanny what I shall tell you.  She says you must bring her Cocoa nut cakes & she wants you to come home.  She laughed aloud at Willie�s message that he longed to see her.

Monday afternoon.  I will not conclude my journal.  Anna came home early this moprning, said Mr. Bradshaw had dismissed the School, that he cried, & the scholars cried. That he is to go away next week.  Mr. Erwin is to live where Mrs. S�don did.  Old Mrs. McBee has bought the house from Mr. Waddil.  If there are not prettier ladies in Columbia, than Miss Pickens & Miss Thompson, the attention of the members will not often be diverted from the members of the house.  If you get the birds, you must have the cage fastened on top of your trunk behind the Buggy, & if you get me a bonnet, you must have it put in a small box, & fastened alongside of the Cage on the trunk.  It is giving so little for the Shawl & its being so pretty has made me think of the bonnet, & I really need one.  Ann says you must get her the box in the shape of the Apple so do not forget it.  I wish you could get her some birds, but of course you have not the money.  You must buy Vardry a little present.  Willie is well supplied with books.  You ought to borrow from the Bookseller for him.  The weather continues gloomy.  Reuben is cleaning the Carri[a]ge today.  Eliza has gone to Mamma�s to work.  There is no news to tell.  I wish you to write Mr. � so the people may hear of your deeds, otherwise they will hear nothing of you, for I expect Col. Town[e]s does not mention you but enclose the letters to me.  I suppose your being�prevented your writing & you must write or not as you wish.  If you have money enough bring Ann some birds, & some gentleman coming up can bring them for you, but only [if] you have more than the 40 dollars you mentioned.  I am sure you will not be able to.  You must be tired of this letter.  You must send it attentively�&�all I say.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

If you are made President you can afterwards practice Law in Charleston.  If you are not you must be Gov.
I hope you will be appointed a Delegate to Nashville.  It will be a pleasant experience.  You must get yourself appointed.  If you are elected President of the Bank I will like it, or Gov.

Wednesday morning, December 12, 1849
Greenville

Dear Willie


		As I answered your Papa�s letter by the last Mail, I will now answer yours.  I was very much pleased with both of your letters & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself.  Anna thanks you for thinking of her when you saw the birds.  It showed you loved her, & though absent, had not forgotten her.  Fanny was very much pleased at your message.  Almost every day, she says she wants Billy to come home.  Anna this morning before breakfast wrote a letter to Aunt Mary Hayne, told her you were going to bring her some birds, & asked her to write & tell her, how to take care of them & when she must make nests for them to lay the Eggs in.  I hope the Cage is pretty.  I have seen very pretty wire ones painted green.  Fanny Townes wrote a note to Anna yesterday to ask her to get her Slate & pen from school, so Anna has gone to get them & to carry Mr. Bradshaw a book mark she worked with �Think of me� on it.  Fanny said  to go too, so I suggested she go warm & she has gone too.  Frank reads quite well now, & is very fond of it.  If he had gone to school to Mr. Burnham for the past year, he would have improved a great deal.  He even learned to write on the Slate, & wrote so well, Mr. Burnham told me he did not believe he made the letters himself.  Mr. Burnham has gone away now, & Mr. Bradshaw has broken up school, & is going away next week.  This is the coldest day we have had.  The Thermometer when I came down this morning was at 24, 6 degrees below freezing point.  It continues cold.  Reuben & Charles are killing the 4 remaining hogs.  Frank read his lesson & then ran out to see them.  If you were here, you would be with them too.  How much better it is to believe you are improving I hope in every respect.  I am glad the hogs are killed, so our Corn may be saved, but you will miss Sausage meat when you come back.  I suppose you have plenty of Sausages in Columbia.  When Papa comes back he must send for some Buckwheat Flour, & then you will have Buckwheat cakes which you like so much.  Frank soon after he had his ball worked to make a hole in it.  I told him not to.  One day he brought it from school with a hole he said the boys made while throwing it.  He would fill the ball with water & squeeze it out, & in so doing has made the hole so large that he has ruined the ball. So you had better bring him one, or he will be borrowing yours.  I hope to get letters tonight from Papa & yourself.  Anna says you must write to her, & then she will write to you.  She has worked a pretty pincushion, or little ottoman she may call it.  I made it up for her, & it will astonish her Papa as much as her letter.  She has been so busy at it, she has been quite happy, for she is always happy when she is employed.  I am wondering who will be her Teacher.  Mr. Stuart ought not to have acted as he has done, for the Teacher the Trustees would have got when they selected him, are now engaged to other places.  Dr. Simons taught you nothing at all.  Frank would have learnt so much more at the other school.  The money spent on you was thrown away.  You must write me the name of the books you have bought.  I think you have enough.  Frank has no cap to wear to church.  You must buy him whatever kind the boys wear.  You are well supplied with clothes.  I have only been to church once since you left.  The two last Sundays, the weather has been bad.  You must tell Papa he must not forget to interest himself in getting a place in the Military Academy for Mr. Markley�s son.  He is one of a large family, & entitled to a place there.  Perhaps one of these days you will be going to school in that place.  I have seen no little boys since you left & do not know how they are spending the holidays.  Last night the boys gave a party to the girls.  It was so cold I hardly think many went.  I had no thought of Anna�s going.  Last week the young men gave one to the Beachams.  Your Grandmama is very much pleased you behave so well in Columbia.  She gave me some small change to keep for you, & it was money left from what she gave me to buy butter for her.  Vardry fell on a kettle or over I do not know which in the kitchen, & burnt his hand very badly.  About the same time, at night when Fanny was undressing to go to bed & was standing before the fire, a spark popped out, & burnt her behind her ear.  It must have rested on the collar of her night dress.  It was only a little burn, & is now quite well.  Fanny is still very lively & affectionate.  She sleeps with me at night, & she hugs me, & if I turn away, she says �turn over Ma.�  Anna & Fanny have come back now.  They are making so much noise, I must finish my letter to you, & will write a few lines on the other side to Papa.  Mr. Bradshaw (Anna says,) is selling his furniture today.  The two oldest boys are to stay with Mr. Erwin to go to school to him.  Mr. Keith told me he offered to bring you home, but you preferred staying until you Papa came.  Fanny says I must tell you howdy.  Anna that you must write.  Frank is not here to send any message.  So Good bye,  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

My dear husband, As I had nothing particular to write to you today, I thought it best to answer Willie�s letter.  I will now however express a few thoughts to you.  I saw the Courier last night.  I approve of your recommendation about the Penitentiary.  The other motion you made partly I approve.  The election of Commissioner in Equity ought to be given to the people, but the Attorney General, Solicitor, Controller &c ought to be left as it is.  I suppose by this time you have spoken on the Bank.  I hope you did credit to yourself, acquitted yourself better than Mr. Reed.  Have you done anything for Mr. Markley�s son?  You must not forget him.  I hope your prospects as regards the Executive & the Bank are progressing, now that Law is�, you ought to think of something else.  You must do something in advancing your own interests, not�leave it to friends, & I hope you will tell me your prospects are good, for one or the other of these offices.  I think if your name was only suggested for the future Governor, it would take immediately, for you are respected throughout the State.  So if you are not elected to the Bank. You must think of the other.  You can have a partner here to attend to your business for [word obscured].  My directions about getting me a bonnet are not a joke.  10 dollars was what I allowed you for the Shawl, & as you only gave 4 dollars, the remaining 6 spend for me in a suitable winter bonnet.  You have much good taste.  Whatever you get will be pretty, & it gives me pleasure to wear anything you buy.  These are the only things I care to buy this winter.  I do not expect to buy a dress.  What I have I will make do.  When I tell you to buy me anything, it is always of course meaning if you have the money.  If you had the money I would like a dress too but I know you have not.  From your being able to do all you have done, you mst have been supplied from some source I know not of.

		We are all well.  The weather is very cold.  We have fine weather for our meat.  I wrote Willie all I could think of, having received no letter since I last wrote.  I have less than usual to write about.  Your letters give me great pleasure.  If it were not for the cold I would like to be with you.  I am really glad Willie does so well.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.

 My dear husband

		I will write to you tonight, because I have quiet.  In the day I am so much interrupted , my ideas get confused.  I am sorry I have such a bad pen.  It is the only one I have given me by Mr. Dill, & every now & then he mends it for me, but I do not like to trouble him very often.  You must leave me better supplied another time.  I have had to buy paper twice.  I received your letter last night, & also Mr. Wells, which I sent to him after reading it.  As you had Sunday to write to me. I was in hopes you would have written me a long letter, of one or two sheets of foolscap, & thought Willie would have written too.  He I can see is not fond of his pen.  We had a rainy Sunday here too.  Yesterday it was very cold.  Our hogs are now all killed.  Last night I made custard thinking it would freeze, but it did not.  Still it has been quite cold, & all day raining & freezing, so the trees are covered with icicles, & some of the Cedars & Oranges bent to the ground, & I am afraid are broken.  It is very much such a day as we had 3 years ago when we were on our way from Columbia, in the stage, & had Maj. Earle as our companion; one of the most unpleasant days in my life, as any day would be spent in his company, even without Sleet & Ice. 
Reuben & Charles helped Mr. Goodlet[t] kill his hogs, which they ought to have done, as he was so good as to let our horses stay in his Stable.  At the farm they have ploughed when they could & cut up wood when  they could not.  The wood when they cut it, is just under the piazza & gets dry, so we have good fires.  I only wrote to you yesterday, so have not much to say now.  Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon came to see me yesterday afternoon. They thought it a delightful day, do not mind the cold at all.  They will go down shortly.

		Mrs. Hayne you say looks dowdyish.  She always looked so.  She had pretty eyes & complexion, & was very lively in her manners, but she had a long face, sunk mouth, long chin, bad figure, tall & high shoulders, & her head stooping forward, & a�awkward walk.  Her eyes & her complexion were so good, that she passed for being very pretty.  She dressed badly always.  I suppose she looks pretty much the same as she did.  I would like to know if you heard anything in particular of Ann Williams.  Her Mill� was all an excuse to get to a gay place like Columbia, & perhaps make a conquest.  She was not one, who would mind being a burden on her Grandmother.  She would have assisted her Mother in taking in work in�.  Tom Butler I expect is such a successful Gambler that he always has money at�, & I suppose Richard Stone being a Bank Director can help him.  He told Mr. McBee, he saw his way clear, knew how much he owed, & could pay every cent without touching his property.  His wife seems such a contrast to himself, & the last lady he would have chosen.  Mrs. Stone made that match.  How wives deceive themselves.  I suppose the same Mail that brought me a letter, brought Mrs. Butler & Mrs. Jones most affectionate ones from their husbands, most affectionate perhaps even than mine, because not coming from the heart.  I wish Mrs. Jones could hear of her husbands conduct.  It would pull down some of her vanity, & make her less egotistic.  I will not mention it, but it ought to be known, & I hope it will get to the ears of the wives.  If a wife were even to seem pleased with the attention of a gentleman how angry the hunband would be, but the husbands are to do just as they choose.  I do not think Mrs. Butler or Mrs. Jones lack any of the comforts of life.  Their husbands must be better off than the world thinks.  I am sorry that you did not go to the Fair, that they might have seen, that you at least saw them.

		You ought to have dined with Col. John Preston.  All such invitations you ought to accept, & in future must.  They do not come so often as to inconvenience you.  You should arrange it, so that all of your shirts should not be in the wash at a time, & I thought Willie was such a little man, he had learned to attend to himself, & not oblige you to stay with him.  You were wrong not to accept the Governors invitation.  It is for your interest to mingle in such society.  I wish you had a little more of the spirit of�Butler & Jones.  You go to the other extreme & are not social; enough.   I mentioned in my last letter that you had better not buy the birds.  For fear of the cold climate, you must ascertain whether there would be any risk.  If there were not, I would like to have them, but do not bring any to Ann, as I suggested, she says she would not take care of them.   I also mentioned that Susan wished a Straw Chair such as a child uses, & you bought for Willie once.  I think the price is 1.50.  You will have to send it up by the Stage directed to Mr. McBee.  Susan will return to me whatever expenses you are at in buying & sending it up.  If you are straightened for money of course you cannot get it.

		If the Legislature adjourns next Tuesday the 18th as you think, this will be my last letter to you.  So I will mention all I wish you to get, promising that you must only get what I mention in case you have money.  Dr. Teague I believe was to pay you some & as you do not mention a scarcity, I think you must have been supplied.  If you are in funds, get for Anna the birds, if there is no risk of cold weather killing them, for Frank a trumpet or ball or some toy for Fanny & all included Cocoanut cakes; for Ann the box resembling an apple, for Vardry a little present of some kind, for me to wear with my Shawl, a bonnet costing not more than 5 or 6 dollars, if you see a pretty one, but if not, [do] not get any, & also if you see a pretty dress, worsted, at 25 or 37 1/2 cts a yd, get me enough to make dress & cape, & fringe & buttons, or any other�used.  A dress can be got here at the prices mentioned, but I would rather have one from Columbia, but not on any account with a price higher than this, at 25 or 37 ?.  All my dresses are light coloured�& thin Silks, so I used a new one to wear with my Shawl, though if you are straightened, I will do without it.  I got no new one last year.  All of my present ones except the light Cashmere, suitable only for Spring, are very shabby.  In the way of books get me �The Lady Alice or the new Una,� [�] Ernest Maltreves,� & �the Carolina Receipt book� by a Charleston lady, the price�dollars, & if you have it not to spend, I will wait for the books another time.  I expect you think I have written demands enough.  I will now close.   If tomorrow I have anything more to write I will inflict another sheet on you.  On the reception of our letters our exclamations are reversed.  I of yours, �how short,� yours  of mine, �how long�!  We are all well.  Frank says he has almost forgotten how Willie looks.  Fanny today when she was troubling me, & I said I was busy said �is Pa busy.�  She takes up a book & reads, �B.F. Perry turn into Court.�  She has not forgotten Mr. Montgomery�s call.  You must be patient, & not feel too anxious to come home.  You will have a long time to stay, & will get tired before the Circuit commences again.  So enjoy yourself now among congenial spirits.  The children are all asleep.  Good night, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I will write  you a few lines, as it may be a comfort to hear from home tomorrow if you are�that long at Laurens perhaps I ought not to write,  You may not care to hear so often, but I judge of you by myself, & when absent from you, my only comfort is your letters.  Mary I am sorry to say is sick, but I expect not seriously.  She complained yesterday of pain in her stomach, so could do not any work.  I gave her castor oil, & pepper tea & put on mustard plasters.  Today she said she felt no better, so I sent for Dr. Crook.  Think it safer a Doctor should see her, & he says she has cold & must take Parsley root tea with Nitre in it, & iron herself with a warm iron, so I hope & suppose she will soon be well.  It puts me to great inconvenience having her sick, & Minerva on finding she had to do some of her work, was most impertinent, but I need not dwell on this subject, for you know I have never had your sympathy or aid in helping me in these domestic things & I always look to others for sympathy.

		Mrs. Kingsland & her youngest sister came to see me yesterday.  These are all I have seen since I wrote, & I have not been out.

		I am almost sorry Dr. Teague paid you.  I so prefer your having a note, drawing Interest, & if associates children  take part of your Rail Road Stock, you will not have so very much to pay.  You had better keep only one thousand or 1500 yourself, & they take the rest, even if Mr. Foster takes some. 

		The children & myself are well.  Fanny sweeter than ever.  Last night at support Anna said something about your drinking hot water tea when you were a little boy.  Fanny got quite offended, & said to me almost crying �Tanner calls Pa a boy, Pa aint a boy,� I said �what is he, is he not a gentleman,� she said, ��no. Pa is Pappy.  Pa is Pappy.�  She is always saying something sweet & affectionate.  The children go regularly to school.   Dr. Simons seems kinder since his disappointment, than he was before.  I hear that Mr. Leary has asked Mr. Erwin, who teaches at Spartanburg to assist him, perhaps Mr. Stevens declined coming.

		I hope Mr. Farleys business will be profitable to you.  The woman who murdered her husbands mistress, sa�ied her revenge for, she ought to have shown her contempt for her & him by leaving him, to the enjoyment of one he preferred to her.

		I hope to hear from you tonight.  You need not be uneasy about Mary.  When you return Sunday, I dare say she will be up, at her work.  Dr. Crook said he wished to see you about his Turnpike road, that he expected he would not be able to go to Columbia himself.  

		Mrs. Durbec sent me word a few days ago, that she had received a letter from Mrs. Blake, who sent her love to me, & said she had written to me, & wished to know if I had received the letter.

		Mr. Sam Town[e]s left for Florida a day or two ago.  We have still pleasant weather.  I am glad negroes are rising though perhaps it is no advantage to us, who have, except Jim, none to dispose of, & I expect you have not determined to dispose of him.  If ordinary men servants sell for one thousand, he with his trade, ought to sell for 1500.  I will be willing to sell him when you can get that.  You know Sheriff a common negro & a rogue into the bargain sold for 1200.  Betsy, Jims wife has returned from the Limestone Springs.  I expect Jim has forgotten her.

		We will all be very glad to see you Sunday & you no doubt glad to see us.  I have nothing of interest to write about.  I am sorry Miss Dillard cannot have her case tried.  She is quite unfortunate.  I expect she will often be inconvenienced in the same way.  If her mother is good for the note, no matter if she does not pay it now, though I would rather have her money & Dr. Teagues note.

		Believe me my dear husband as I ever have & ever will be your attached, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry    


Saturday night, 30 March 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		As you will be disappointed if you do not have a letter from me tomorrow I will write you a few lines, but I have a shocking pen, & am very tired.  I invited some company for the children here today, Mrs. Pearson & a few others.  I have been on my feet all day, as I always have so much to do myself when I have company, & as usual it has fatigued me.  I have written a few lines to Mrs. Sharpe to send along with the shoes., & if I have time I wish to write to Mrs. Duboc.  

		I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, but I am sorry you made no mention of having received money from Mr. Norris, & nothing of Mr. Dickey�s case.  I expect as you have left it to Mr. Norris� generosity to give you what he thinks right, he will give you nothing more.  I am afraid there is no chance of your being appointed a Delegate to the Nashville Convention.  I would have like that  you should even if you had declined going in case the first nominated declined going, would have gone in your stead, but you have no ambition.  That is your failing & in that lies your bad success.  When a man wishes, & is determined to gain what he wishes, he is certain to succeed but you are too lazy sometimes for exertion, but I will not dwell on your faults.  

		Reuben & Charles have ploughed every day since you left, & will finish the Oats sometime next week.  The fence is you mention being down is up now & Reuben does not know who would have taken it down.  He did not see it down.  Charles has finished the Stable & has been cleaning the yard.  Jim has made the Arbor in front of the house in the garden, has finished the Chicken pen, & made the fence by the Stable.  Next week if there is Lumber enough he will make the pig pen & Cow Stalls.  He says Mr. Hooker has hired two hands, & said nothing more to him, but I hope when he has finished here, Mr. Hooker  or someone will hire him, but when you can, you had better sell him, for it is very troublesome to keep servants to hire.  In your travels you ought to look out for a purchase for him.  900 I should think you would get, at any rate 850.  I would be glad for you to have a note for that amount.  Jim has made a step to Anna�s house & a fence would�separating it from the servants yard..

		Eliza is sick in bed today with pain in her back & side.  Monday I will go in the garden & direct Charles what to do there.  The garden needs some attention now.  Wednesday night we had a heavy Snow, & I am afraid the fruit is all killed.  One of my large wild oranges was broken down.  We have cold weather & cold nights now; it is unfortunate, our winters are mild, & our Springs cold.    

		Yesterday was Good Friday, & Mamma & myself Willie & Frank went to church.  Mr. Leary gave Holiday.  There was service again today, but I did not go.  Mr. Arthur for several mornings has had Sunrise meetings, to stir up his congregation, but I believe he has not stirred up many out of their beds.  Even Mr. Leary said he would not go, & Mrs. Pearson said she went with the greatest exertion.  I am sure if I was to go, my household would be put in entire confusion. 

		The Ware�s dined here today, & Sally Crook.  Sally says Mr. Davis says, he has enough to support him without teaching that he teaches because he likes it.  I am glad to hear that Susan has given Anna a pretty doll, which has made her very happy.  I have been dressing it for her, & it will teach her to work.  Ann has been suffering from Calomel.  She took rather too much & not enough medicine after it, & is salivated & Mamma says her head feels as yours did.  Her mouth is sore & bleeds.

		Edward says Mrs. Mooney sold his home because he is in debt, that himself & Mr. Dyer get very little work to do, are sometimes weeks without any, but they manage to keep him employed, but Edward is not infallible authority, so I would not mention what he says.  		

		Mr. Cox & Mr. Griffin are exchanging homes.  I know of no news to tell you, except to church I have not been & at home have only�.  The children are well.  Willie rode on his colt today & it did pretty well, did not throw him.  Fanny talks about you, & what she will buy with the money you will bring her.  Anna has gone regularly to school.  Willie & Frank Wednesday staid at home because it rained & they have colds.  I hope Mamma will dine with me tomorrow.  I thought I would have had things left today, but all was eaten.  I am glad you sleep well, for that contributes a great deal to ones feeling well.  I hope your face when you return will be of its�.  At Pendleton last summer I saw some Smiths related to Mrs. North.  One of them lives with her.  Perhaps it was one of them that inquired about me of you.  Judge Withers I think must be quite trifling.  He seems to be a great talker & I thought�in his remarks the evening he spent here.  Susan told me Mary Creyton was trying for Mr. Campbell.

		I will send your letters & papers along with this letter, such papers as you have not seen, only one letter has come.  I hope you will come back with plenty of money, at any rate enough of the Tugaloo	 estate to pay you what it owes you, & you to pay all the Rail Road then after that.  I wish you to send for Groceries, which we now greatly need, then get a new carri[a]ge for me  to ride more comfortably in, & then get a Piano, & furnish me with a generous supply for�, so you have a good deal to do.  Write by someone coming back before you leave.   I expect he now has been as ill as said in the papers.  I was never uneasy about him.  I can�letter up.  It wont do to be bound.  It is written too badly for Mrs. P� & Mrs. Williams to read.  Hetty D�Oyley has gone to Aiken to Mrs. Theodore Crofts who has been very ill.  Your�, E.F.P.

Though I forget to tell you, you must not leave Pickens until all your business is finished.

My dear husband

		I have time to write only a few lines.  We are all well.  I send a Carolinian.  You will see Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore is appointed Senator.  The Governor has been cunning.  He says he need not serve more than this Session.  Next winter he can return to the Bank, & I suppose he himself take his place.  I send a receipt for money Mr. Dill begged me to give you, to collect money for Mr. Farr.

		Mr. Arthur has a daughter, born only 2 hours after Mrs. Thomas arrived Saturday evening.

		 I went to church morning & afternoon yesterday.  Mr. Arthur preached on the love of the world, going to Theaters Balls &c.  I am sure in Greenville, there is no theater to go to, & so few Balls, one is not tempted to show their love of the world in that way.  I think Mr. Arthur loves the world as well as anyone.

		I called in Edward & told him about the flower.  His behavior I will tell you of when you return.  I hope you will gain Dr. Andersons case.  Miss Greens was certainly the most unjust decision I ever heard of. 

		You must think of what I said about offering for the Legislature.  You certainly ought to be there next winter when the important Banks question will be discussed.  Do not wait to be asked; come forward yourself.  People are too selfish to think of you, if you do not yourself.  I promise you not to worry you on the subject.  I think you will if in the Legislature be elected Speaker, & then I will be gratified.  

		Jim is building the low�.  I long to see you.  I was prevented writing this morning, & now the Mail is about closing.  I will  have to stop.  


		Only one letter came last night from Mr. Squier, asking you to collect Tom Butlers & Butler Thompsons money due him.

		I will write a longer letter next time.  Adieu.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		To prevent your being disappointed I must write, but I really have nothing interesting to write about, but I must try & think of something.  Today it is raining so not much can be done at the Farm.  They intended planting Corn today, but the weather being bad, Reuben is hauling Manure.  I told Charles to cut�for the Peas, but I do not know whether he will.

		Jim has been working at the pig pen & cow stalls ever since you left.  He has not finished them, says he has not enough to cover them with.

		I do not like to dictate to you, but it seems to me when you can get what you think his value & a good price it would be well to sell him.  I think he is worth a great deal, for he is so smart & capable that will a strict owner, he would be invaluable, though to you he has been of little service, but I am willing to take 800 though would be glad to get more.  The interest of the money added to the principal would be more than he makes for you, deducting his expenses, risk of losing him, & his unsteady way, but I wish you to act for yourself

		Monday I dined at Mamma�s.  She walked in to see me.  Fanny & myself walked back with her.  I spent a pleasant day.  Yesterday we all dined at Susans.  Willie & Frank came out after morning school.  I spent a very pleasant day.  Speaking of Mr. Erwin Jones, Mr. McBee said if he ran for the Legislature, he would not run far, & as for being Solicitor he stood no chance for the Greenville Delegation even would not vote for him, that you he knew would not, nor Col. Town[e]s &c; said if you ran for the Legislature, which he seemed to think was a thing of course, you would be elected.  I expect it is thought such a settled matter that no one has thought it worthwhile to ask you.  Frank is still head.  Fanny talks as usual of you, & we all long to see you.  I hope gain or not, Dr. Anderson will pay you some of the fee you charge that you will come home with a purse full.  I know of no news to tell you.  The rain will I hope make our seed come up, & perhaps tomorrow it will clear, & the Corn can be planted.  I wish a good deal planted as you will have 3 hands & 3 horses all summer.

		I hope to hear from you tonight, & now having said all I possibly can say except that one letter came for you last night, from a Mr. Fisher or some such name from Augusta which does not seem of much importance.  I remain your attached, dutiful wife. E.F.P.

P.S. If Dr. Anderson does not pay you, be sure & make him give you his note, which will be as well, perhaps better.

I do not wish Col. Irby to pay you, so if he offers to, decline.  I wish his note to accumulate for years as it is such a good Compound Interest�him keep it as long as he will.

Sunday night, 5 May [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I hope you are now safe in Columbia, & resting after your journey.  According to promise I must write & tell you all that has occurred  since the moment you left, but very little of importance have I to tell you.  Friday afternoon Mr. Richardson called & said he was just from the Mill, & Mr. Taft said your wheat only turned out 183 pounds, that I must send a bag to the Mill & get 17 pounds more.  I told him you said he was celebrated for good wheat.  He said what he had just brought was good.  That wheat you got, Mr. Taft said was not secured enough, that the wet weather had given him no chance of securing it, so from this I expect the Flour is not very good, & I observe the Biscuits look black & do not rise well.  I sent the bag & got the 17 pounds.

		Friday Charles came in & planted the ground nuts, & prepared the ground for potatoes.  The slips we will have to buy.  Yesterday he planted his�, & we had in the afternoon a good rain, & last night it rained hard & with this morning, vegetation looks revived.

		Jim came home a little while last evening I expect for his tolls.  He thought he would do some mischief, so he set in the Cows to the Calves, so we got very little Milk.

		Yesterday afternoon I walked to see Mrs. Tom Gower.  She was out, then to see Mrs. Norton, who has been sick a long time, & then on to Mamma�s.  White at Mamma�s it rained hard so she had to send me home in the carri[a]ge.  This morning the children & myself went to church.  As it was damp, I called for Mrs. Walker.  Mr. Arthur gave us an old sermon on regeneration, to a very small congregation.  This afternoon there was no service.  The children were catechized.  Willie & Anna went, & afterwards we all went out to Mamma�s & took tea.

		At church Mr. Croft asked me if I would be home tomorrow at 9 oclock.  He wished to see me on a little business.  I told him yes, so I am quite anxious to know what it is about.  This afternoon I intended going to see Mr. Sam Town[e]s, but Reuben said Scott was lame.  At the church door when I was getting in the carri[a]ge he said the horse was so lame it could hardly walk, but I thought it only seemed a little lame, & that Reuben was afraid I was going to employ him this afternoon.  He said , it either sprained its awful kicking against the stable or had run a nail into its foot, in walking over the old planks in the stable yard, & said if I needed it this afternoon it might be lamed for life, so I told him to attend to Scott, & see that he got well soon.  Reuben loves to exaggerate.  

		It is raining now.  The servants have gone to church.  The children are upstairs in bed.  I am downstairs.  Charlotte told�little while ago, that today Mary joined the Methodist church.  It is no wonder they are turned out so soon, if they join with so little thought as I am sure she has�the dreadful accident happened on Mr. Arthurs R[ail] Road�yesterday while digging the earth & rocks fell on a servant of Mr. Arthur�s named Bob, & Mr. Walkers Joe, & killed them.  Mr. Walker says an easy way of digging is, to dig the earth [word obscured] the bottom far under & then the earth on the top falls down, that the men were digging in this way, & after digging far under the earth did not fall, so Joe & Bob were told to dig a little more.  They began, & in a few moments, the earth & rocks came tumbling down on them & killed them.  She seems to bear it well, but it must be a great trial.  Mr. Arthur seemed the same as usual today, but I am sure he must be distressed at it.  It was owing to carelessness of the Overseer I believe.  Mr. Arthur seems to have been unfortunate with negroes.  Your different papers have come, & 3 letters, one from Dr. Holland about a bill the Tugaloo estate owes him, one from Mr. Christie from Edgefield a few lines�Mr. Deans paper, & one from Peirce Earle to his Wife.  It is directed to you.  Ann says you must not forget to buy her the apple box.  Mrs. Arthur gave her a cap, & she thought she ought to make a return, & told her she would give her  one of those Apple boxes.  With regard to going to town my dear you must do just as you please.  I objected because I thought the expense was great, & the pleasure would not equal it, & if I was with you, it would be pleasant visiting my relations, but alone, you might not find it so, & that next year I hoped to go with you, & introduce you to them all, for some of the pleasantest, such as Aunt Mary McCall & Mrs. Susan Hayne, you have never even seen, & do everything you think proper as regards bank Stock.  If there is any risk, you might sell only half of the Stock.  Aunt Turnbull you saw in Greenville, so if you did not object, I would like you to call on her.  The Hayne family, most of them have treated us so  �gently, they have no claims on your politeness so I do not tell you to call on them, but Aunt Ann Turnbull & my Aunts there I would like you to see.  I feel nearer to them, & they have always been kinder to us, than my mothers sisters.  Tomorrow the Whitewashing will be commenced which is the reason I write tonight.  The home will be in confusion.  This is the only sheet of letter paper in the�.  It is blotted, but you must excuse it, you left me badly off.  I will leave room to add a few lines tomorrow, telling what Mr. Croft wishes to see me for.  Mamma says Mr. McBee told Susan Anna was the admiration of all at Mrs. Cannons Mayday.  Frank is still head.  Willie�s colt is doing quite well.  Fanny talks about Papa, & wished you home the day you left.  I hope your horse held out, & that you did not get wet.  My pen is so bad, I am afraid you cannot make out my letter.  Mr. Croft says he has not sent down yet for his groceries, that it will be a month at least before they are here.  The�will be out of seed, so if you can buy them in Columbia, you must buy some & send by Mr. Elford or the first person coming.  If you can get a cage, you must buy one.  The female has lately had some more feathers plucked out, & the male does not sing at all, so they ought to be separated before they kill each other.

		Monday.  My dear husband, I will now finish my letter.  Mr.Croft has paid his visit.  He wished to know my opinion how it would do for him to ask Mrs. Blake to stay at his house & she in return teach all his grandchildren to dance 7 or 8 of them.  Her�would cost him nothing, & her teaching his Grandchildren save him 60, 70, or 80 dollars.  It would really be a bargain on his part.  He wishes me to propose it to Mrs. Blake on her arrival.  He says she will have a good school.  He does not know when his Groceries will be here, not until freight is lower, so you must be sure & buy some seed & bring with you or the birds will perish.

		Mr. Arthur only bought last week the servant who has been killed.  Paid 600 dollars for him, from Mr. Garrison.

		This is sale day, & Mr. Griggs has had his whipping, as great a crowd went to Jail for him, as if he was to be hung.

		The children are at school.  The horse sprained its ankle.  Mr. Westfield says there is no nail in it. Reuben is not using it today.  Mr. Smith will commence whitewashing tomorrow.  I hope to hear from you Wednesday & long to see you.  Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P.

There are a great many People in the village today.

My dear husband

		I have stopped in the midst of my housecleaning to write to you. but I am in such confusion, I cannot collect my ideas sufficiently to write an interesting letter.  I have had the whole house whitewashed.  When the carpet & furniture was moved out of the Dining room, the walls looked so dirty, I thought it best as I was obliged to buy yellow wash for the little dining room, to have another coat given to the big one, so it has been done.  Mr. Smith is here with his brother & will finish today.  They commenced the house yesterday & having to dismantle the whole of it  you cannot conceive the disorder it is in, but I am willing for it, for the sake of cleanliness that follows & when you see the quantity of dirt swept under the Carpet, Furniture & corners you would wonder how we could have existed.  It is well you are away.  You would have to leave on three occasions, whether business called you away or not.  Last night Anna, Fanny & myself slept in Anna�s bed.

		It is now raining a little.  Reuben & Lindy have gone regularly to the Farm.  Scott�s lameness is better.  Hochelago, yesterday laid down a good deal, & I was afraid was sick.  Charles brought Mr. Longs Dudley down who said nothing seemed the matter with him.  He expected he was suffering from the operation he had gone through.  I do not think he will ever get over that.  He seems so sad & dispirited.  It has certainly lamed him.  I  hope to hear from you tonight.  Mr. D��s came here yesterday afternoon to say a Piano had arrived, & you should have the refusal of it;  that it was a very fine instrument & Anna�s mind was capable of learning more than she did at present, & he was anxious she should commence with a class now forming.  The price of the Piano frieght  included 300 & you pay at your convenience.  Mama, Susan & myself went up to hear the Piano.  As well as we could judge it seemed a fine one.  Mr. D� sent me yesterday a letter to you, which he requested I enclose to you at Columbia, speaking of the Piano & advising Anna to learn.  I do not send it, because you will be at home so soon, you can then decide on the matter.  If you could pay for the Piano, I would like to get one, but I cannot say I wish you to go in debt for it, so we will speak on the subject when you return.  That is time enough.  He expects other Pianos which will be more reasonable, though perhaps not as good, so it is no�to determine at once.  If anyone wishes this Piano that has arrived I will call Mr. D� to let them have it.  When you return we can decide whether it is best Anna should commence at once, whether this year we can afford it.

		Mrs. Tom Rowland has a Son, & Mrs. Charles Rabb has lost hers.  You know she brought one with her from Louisiana.  It died yesterday.  Miss Markley is not expected to live long.  Mr. Choice is going soon to send the boys, under his charge to Princeton, so Mrs. Blake will lose them as scholars.  Mr. Beattie says he knows she will have a good school, but several think her terms too high.  Do you not think Mr. Croft�s plan a cunning one.  The Dr. Crofts can afford better than most to pay for their children dancing.  Old Mr. Croft can pay for Mrs. Pearsons, & yet he would wish Mrs. Blake to stay with him, save her about 30 dollars, & give his grandchildren 80 dollars worth of dancing, & speaks as if he was quite kind in making the proposal; says he would be the means of putting hundreds in her pocket, that if she makes it she shall have her glass of wine every day, as if that was really extraordinary.

		Mamma saw Mr. Arthur lately in the streets.  He seems to bear his loss well, as I said, only the week before he bought the boy for 600 dollars.  Mrs. Arthur has had headaches lately, but has not yet been in the state she usually is after her confinements.  Mrs. Thomas I believe is still suffering with her knee.  Saturday I went to see her, & she was then not able to put it to the ground.

		We are all well.  I would write more to you, if I had received a letter from you.  I hope you will get a new trial in Miss Green�s case.  Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma that E� had received my letter about the bonnet, & would purchase it, that if I had written the age of the young lady it would have been a guide but as it was she would try & do her best.  I am certain it will be a pretty bonnet, at any rate prettier than could be got here.  I will never get a bonnet in Greenville.  They are always old fashioned.

		The Drawing room is fixed, & Minerva & Mary are now fixing the Entry.  Upstairs is whitewashed but nothing else done yet.  The little dining room now is to be yellow washed.  I wish every part of the establishment just in order, but it will take a long time.  Charles is working in the garden, but is called off very often to move furniture.  I must now stop.  I went to your Office yesterday to look for writing paper but could find only this coarse kind & saw no ink.  I am badly off for all materials for writing, so you must make excuses.  I would not write today I am so busy, but you may be uneasy if you do not hear. So I write.

		I long to see you.  I forgot to send last night to the Post office, so do not know if any letters have come.  Adieu, Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I will this afternoon write you a few lines as you told me to though I am very busy.  After the Mail comes in tonight, if any letter comes for you, I will add a few lines & tell you.  I intended writing tonight instead of this afternoon, but Anna tells me Susan Hoke is coming over to sleep.  Her father is away.  If so I will be engaged with her & would only write a line or so.

		Willie & Anna commenced Dancing yesterday afternoon.  They have gone again this afternoon.  I expect Mrs. Blake will give lessons every afternoon, so she will make a good deal in a short time.  She had yesterday 19 scholars, but many who intend learning, either did not know of it, or were not prepared, so her school will encrease.  I have not seen her since Sunday.  Then she said she would be willing to stay at Mr. Crofts & teach for nothing as many children as paid her board.  All over Mr. Croft ought to pay for.  I sent a message to her today, & she was there at Mr. Crofts.  He has sent down his carriage for her, so I would not be surprised if an agreement is made between them.  Mrs. Pearson is so anxious her children should learn.  I carried Mrs. Blake to church Sunday morning & afternoon.  Mr. Arthur gave us long sermons, in the afternoon an old one.  Susans Alexander was baptized, & Mrs. Arthurs baby.  Alexander behaved well, but Mrs. Arthur�s baby screamed from beginning to end & seemed to agitate her.  Miss Lewis came this morning before we had done breakfast to practice.  She says they have heard from Mrs. Thomas lately & she still is obliged to use a crutch.  Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett paid me a visit this morning, said they would come again, when you were at home.  They say they have not half read the House of Orleans, & asked if we were in a hurry for it.  I told them no, they could keep it as long as they pleased.  Mrs. Poinsett had been to Mr. Arthurs, & she says his negroes have again run away, that 3 of them are in the Charleston Jail.  I suppose they are from the Contract in Newberry, but I do not know.  He has trouble enough with his negroes.  He today has gone to his contract in Anderson.  I wonder he has time to write such long sermons.  I carried Fanny to church Sunday afternoon, but she behaved very badly.  I hope Frank is behaving well.  Tomorrow the 19th is his Birth Day.  He will be 7 years old.  Willie says that he misses him, & the house is so much quieter. As I have so much less trouble that I miss him in a very agreeable way.  �I hope travelling will so much improve him, that he will behave well when he comes back.

		Two letters came for you Sunday night, one from Mr. Jamison saying he had received the half of the bills you had sent & begging you to send on the other half.  The other letter from Eutaw from Mr. Coleman saying the Court had allowed Washington Foster until October to settle his accounts with the Estate, the reason given, that the money was loaned out & had to be sued for & would not be collected until that time.

		We have had no rain.  Charles came in last night, & said they were getting the Farm in good order.  On Sunday while cutting wood, Reuben hurt his knee with the axe, & told Willie he could hardly walk.  I saw he walked lame, but he said nothing to me about it.  This afternoon he has returned early from the farm, & Charlotte told me he said he had come because his knee hurt him.  He left Lindy to hoe I suppose.  I have not seen him to ask about it, but will this evening when he brings me the keys.

		I have no news to tell you.  I have not been out except to church, & have seen only those who I told you came today & Susan Hoke & Mrs. Blake.  The walking in this dirty weather is so disagreeable I do not like to go out.  I have been busy working hardly had time to practice.  Anna says Mrs. Davis is sick in bed with Rheumatism   The pianos Mrs. Davids said were on there way, some of them actually in Hamburg, have taken so long to come, that I rather think he deceived us, & that he never wrote on for any more, until we took the one that came, for if the others had been on the way as he said  they would have been here before this.  I think ours a fine Piano.  I played for Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett, & they both thought it a very fine one, & not expensive.  I like it too, but still as some others might come I would prefer, I do not intend to decide yet until I see them, & whether you pay or not will make no difference.  I will still be at liberty to exchange this if I see proper.  I wish to feel perfectly satisfied with my bargain.  If I prefer this to any that come I will keep it, & if I do not I will exchange it for the one I like better.

		The household are well, including horses hogs &c except Reuben�s knee being hurt, which I suppose will not prevent his working tomorrow.  We are well.  Charles last night said when he went to bed at night  he was in pain all over.  I suppose old age & infirmities.  I am afraid he will not be able to work much longer.  I will stop & add something tonight.

Tuesday [Wednesday] morning.  Last night Mrs. Blake was here, so I could not finish my letter.  She said she would stay at Mr. Crofts, if he would send her down in his carriage every evening, that the walk was too long in the hot sun & would fatigue her, & that she wished a room on an upper story.  The one they intended giving her, is on the first floor just back from the Drawing room; said she would write a note to him today, & tell him.    I will now send my letter to Col. Town[e]s.  I have not time to read it over.  Tell Frank this is his birth day, 7 years old.  If he behaves well while with you, I will on his return make him a present.  Reuben is going to the Farm today, though his knee hurts he can work.  

Write to me by someone returning before you do.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Saturday night, 24 November [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		You only left this morning, & yet you see I am already writing to you.  I intended writing tomorrow evening but as it will be Sunday, I will wish to send to Mary & Lindy.  I thought it best to write some this evening.  I will as usual tell all that has occurred since you left.  Fanny did not cry very long. & was quieted by sitting in my lap & eating an apple, & tonight is made happy by being put in my bed to sleep.

		Mr. Moore came this morning to sell Eggs, & I told him of your paper & that he must take it.  I did not give him a Prospectus, because I was afraid he would not understand it, & I would rather give them when I have the peice you wrote afterwards, to give along with it, for the Prospectus needs an explanation.  It has been so unrepresented.  I sent all of the letters you left to the Post office.  The boy sent word that the postage would amount to $1.35, & you can charge it to the Printing office.  The Columbia mail brought your newspapers, & a letter from Mr. Pettigru in answer to the one you wrote him, when Mr. Elford was in the desponding humour.  He said he hopes you will go on with the paper; that one established now on Constitutional principles he knows will succeed, & will deserve the gratitude of the rising generation; that he thinks the Disunion spirit is already lessening , but it would be better if the State did commit some folly & get into a scrape such as separate State action, for it would bring her to sense of her ill conduct, though it would be mortifying to be laughed at by everybody; that it is vanity more than any other feeling that influences South Carolina, so he think it will soon pass away. He says he will see you in Columbia, so as this is the case it will not be worthwhile to send you his letter, & I can make good use of it here.  Mr. Pickerell came this afternoon to fix the Clock, & we had a political talk.  He agrees with you, & I told him of Mr. O�Hanlon�s & Mr. Petttigru�s opinions, & he said he knew them both by reputation, so I offered to loan him the letters to read, at which he seemed pleased, so I lent them.  He said he went to the Mansion House the other evening to see the Phrenologist, who is a very intelligent person, & Dr. Simons came in & turned the conversation on politics, & said he went for Disunion, & they ought to ask Congress for something  she could not grant, & then we would have Disunion.  Mr. Pickerell said someone went to his shop the other day, & asked him if as a Chemist he could explain how it was that you & Genl Thompson had got together; that he told him you were where you had always been, & could not help it if Genl Thompson came over to you.  All who wish to know ought to ask Genl Thompson to explain it.

		I see by the Courier the Nashville Convention has adjourned & propose a Southern Congress, & see the death of Mr. Daniel Webster who died suddenly in church.

		This afternoon I went to see the Miss Anderson�s & I explained the State of the country to them.  They say if you go for the Union they will certainly take your paper.  They agree entirely with you in Politics.  They say they had heard nothing of the Meeting & Mr. Memminger until Mr. Cox paid them a visit, & they asked him what he thought of matters, & he said it was generally thought now the time had come to Secede & judging from the Demonstrations in honor of Mr. Memminger that was the popular feeling here & begged him to let him request Mr.  Cam[p]bell to send his paper to them, so you were either mistaken in thinking Mr. Cox agreed with you; or he has changed; or he is on both sides; but the people are so deceived; it is no wonder they think as they do.  I look for your paper to enlighten them.  Until that comes out they will remain in ignorance.  Miss Anderson says you will�with justice, if not now, in years to come; when the children of those now who are opposed to you, will be disgraced on account of the conduct of their fathers.  So my dear husband, act as your Duty dictates; bring forward a resolution for a Southern Convention; make a noble speech on the subject; that will be handed down to posterity; be sure that you say everything that is true & right & consistent with a Patriot & have it published in the Carolinian.   You have been�now as much as you can be.  I think the Editors are tired now they have vented their spleen & cannot find any words stronger to express it.  Do not vote for Mr. Memminger, Mr. Burt. Mr. Rion, & you know who. I hope you had a pleasant journey down, that the horses did not give out, & Willie & Frank are behaving well.  As you went off Charles said Scott would give out; that he had a strain in his back; that he was injured before you bought him; that you were cheated by the Drover.  I hope he is not correct in his opinion.  Tomorrow night I will finish my letter & tell you of everything else that occurs.  If it were not for want of space, I would write all�longer, but I must leave room for what may occur tomorrow.  Do not forget Susan Hokes Music, �Roll on Silver Moon.�  Miss Anderson tells me she heard Dr. Simons & Mrs. Temple had quarreled.  I do not know if true or not�.

Sunday night.  My dear husband, I will now finish my letter.  I went to church this morning, & heard an old sermon from Mr. Arthur in praise of the Liturgy, which I expect was not interesting to Col Town[e]s & some other Baptists that were there.  Mr. Arthur attends to his worldly business all the week, & then Sunday gives us an old sermon.  This afternoon Mamma sent for me to go & see Susan�s baby which was not well, but it is better than it was this morning, & after paying Susan a visit, Mamma & myself rode up the Anderson road  & stopped at Mr. Tom Butlers house & went over it, & then stopped at Mr. Saxons house where Mr. M� staid & went into that.  Mrs. Carson is to live there, & they are now preparing to plaster it. so Mr. Carson & Mr. Butler will be near neighbors.  The day has been so cold.  I thought tomorrow Charles with Marys assistance had better kill some of the smallest hogs, but he says he has to haul more wood first, & tomorrow he will borrow Mr. Goodletts horse, & put with Selim, & haul a load of wood, & if the next day is cold he will kill some of the hogs.  A good many persons have killed.

		I see in the Chronicle & Sentinel Mr. Kings & Mr. Clemens Senators from Alabama expressing the same views you do.  You must while in Columbia do all you can for the paper.  Get Mr. Pettigru, Mr. O�Hanlon, Mr. Yeadon & all your friends who agree with you to interest themselves in sustaining it.  They ought all to get subscribers for it, for never has a paper been more traduced or have more to encounter than yours has.  The State is so provoked that after buying up the Mountaineer & get that in the proper training, another should be started in the very place, that they know is above a�& may spoil their game.  

		Write me every Mail, tell me everything, & tell Willie to write.  I hope Frank & himself are doing well, & will return improved & do credit to you.  Tell them from me, they must be good boys.  They must keep themselves neat & clean, & they must read in the prayer book every morning & night.  And my dear husband you must act judiciously & wisely.  I do wish you could have been elected Judge or some honorable Office that the world might see you had at least met with your reward for people are apt to think until persons are rewarded, that they do not deserve i, & my ambition is you should be appreciated by others, & you seem further from it now than ever, but I must be resigned & hope that even you will meet with your reward & I believe if you were more anxious for it, you would.  Adieu, your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		Reuben returned this evening, but brought no letter from you, for which I was very sorry; but  I hope you were so busy talking to Col. Brockman enlightening him & others that it left you no time to write to me.  I am glad you reached Mr. Felkes in safety, & that the horses did not give out as Charles predicted.  Reuben says they are well, only tired, so they shall rest awhile.

		You are now in Columbia in the midst of the excitement.  The papers that came today, I see are full of Judge Cheves speech, but I do not intend to read it, as I have not you to do away any impression it might make on me.  I thought I would try & enlighten someone, so I sent some papers last night to Mr. Nicol to read, the Chronicle & Sentinel containing Mr. King & Mr. Clemens� speeches, & another with Judge Nes� letter, & he said he would read anything I sent him.  A letter today came from Mr. Thomas McLure of Chester C.H. begging you to send him the first number of your paper & mentioning a gentleman  to whom you must also send it, as he thought they would like to subscribe for it.  The names of the gentlemen were John Rosborough Esqr, Chester C.H.; Peter Wylie, Do; Dr. A.P. Wylie, Do; James Drennan Esqr., Chesnut Grove; Danl. G. Stenson Esqr, Cedar Shoal; William Heath, [Do]; William Moffat, Lewisville, Chester District; William A. Rosborough, [Do]; James Hemphill, Esqr, Chester C.H.

		I went to see the Miss Andersons yesterday afternoon to carry them some books & papers.  Miss Anderson told me Mr. Cox told her, that Slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia, so either he is very ignorant, or he says, what he knows is not so.  I almost wish the State would secede this winter, get into a scrape as Mr. Pettigru says, & then perhaps she would be brought to her senses.  

		Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.  I did not say anything wrong that you would have disapproved, but I expressed the state of matters to him & how the paper originated &c, & he was very mild, & agreed with me in all I said about Politics &c; said Mr. Watson presented the Southern Association paper to him to sign it.  He told him before he was a Minister he was a Democrat, but now he had done with Politics.  So now I have seen Mr. Arthur & talked to him.  I have better feelings towards him than I had.  I think I gave him a great deal of information.  But I think the Episcopal Church on account of the Members, it is composed of, it is really high time now for me to leave.  Who do you think has joined it?  Why Mrs. Choice that vindictive ill tempered woman.  She is still a Baptist in heart. So she was not satisfied with sprinkling, or she thought that not sufficient to wash away her sins, so yesterday she was emersed by Mr. Arthur, & next Sunday is Communion Sunday, so I suppose she will commune.  Mrs. Joe Powel who I met at the Miss Andersons told me that when she was ill, she heard Mr. Arthur administered the Sacrament to her; so if so, it was after taking that solemn ordinance, she went to Mr. Nicol so infuriated because she had voted for you so it had certainly not changed her heart, or improved her temper.  The Lords Supper is a feast of Love, & when I think of Mrs. Jones who said she hated me; Mrs. Choice & Mrs. Walker who hate you, Mrs. Rowland who has always seemed so unfriendly to us both, Dr. Crittenden who is so violent against you; Dr. Irvine who is ready now to see his count[r]y in war & bloodshed; I cannot but think it is sacrilegious  to unite with such; so next Sunday I do not think I can feel it my duty to go to the Episcopal church.  I am afraid I will commit a greater sin in going than staying away.

		 Tonight a letter has come from Mr. W.M.D. Crowder, Due West, asking for a place in the office of the Southern Patriot.  He says he can work either at the Case or Press, & the terms whatever is usually paid to Journeymen in the upcountry offices; says he can give you references as to attention to Duty.  Two Chronicles & Sentinels have come, & that is all.

		Last Saturday night a Mr. Campbell from Anderson came to see you on business, but he said the business was not important.

		The children & myself are well.  When Fanny was saying her prayers, I told her to pray that Papa, Willie & Frank might come safe home, & she said �bring Papa, Mr. Duncan Willie & Frank safe home.�

		Eliza & Minerva as usual are complaining.  I never knew so much cramp in the stomach as they have.  Minerva sent in this morning for some Brandy, because she had cramp in the stomach, & then sent word to say she could not work, & she has been in her room all day.  When she sends for Brandy again, I will send her pepper or pepper tea, for as the spirits do not cure her, it is no use to waste it.  If all persons made as much fuss as she & Eliza do, in their situations, it would really be dreadful.  Theye not delicate creatures indeed.  I hope Willie & Frank have behaved well, & given you no trouble.  I long to hear from you.  I have very little to write about.  I hope though in the minority, you will have a pleasant time in Columbia. 

		Dr. Simons scholars are to speak in the Methodist church next Friday morning, & receive Diplomas; young ladies, mind Susan Hoke says in his advertisement he says his school has been most flourishing, consisting of a majority of the respectable families in Greenville, that it is entirely a Southern Institution; & he hopes that parents will send to him, instead of sending to Philadelphia & New York, that he will assist in establishing that non intercourse with the North, so desirable at the present time. Mrs. Temple is going away, so I dare say, she & Dr. Simons did have a quarrel.  He has angered  another teacher an English lady I heard, & yet he says his institution is all Southern.  Any humbug can succeed, after him.  I was at Susan�s this afternoon, her baby is well now.  Send Susan Hoke�s Music by Mail.  It is �Roll on Silver Moon.�  It is now time to stop.  I will have more to write about when I hear from you.  As soon as the weather gets cold, the hogs shall be killed.  Charles killed the smallest one  yesterday, was to give us some fresh meat.  Good night, your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Thursday night, 28 November 1859
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.  You must write me every Mail.  I live on your letters & think on the contents of one, until I get another.  Your news as regards Politics is cheering, but I am afraid you are mistaken.  It is a bad idea for Judge Cheves to be thought of as Governor, & I think would be unpropitious  for the State.  Mr. Memminger with his usual hypocrisy, begins with appealing to the Most High, & re commencing a Fast.  He thinks after this, his sincerity cannot be doubted & he will certainly be made Chancellor.  Do you vote against him, & do all you can against him.  He has done more to cause the excitement, at any rate in Greenville, than any other man.  He has deceived the people, & told absolute falsehoods to gain his worldly ends, & then at the same time, pretends he is such a Christian.  He uses both worlds.

		As for Mr. Jones, he is as contemptible & mean a man as ever lived.  He occasions me more vexation than anyone else, for he is constantly doing something so mean.  He gets what he can from the Anti Bank men, & then what he can from the Bank men.  It seems as if he pursues the course to get along, for instead of being treated with the contempt he deserves, he is rewarded.  By treachery he gats into the Legislature, & now by Treachery, he will be elected Solicitor, for it only requires electioneering to succeed.  Court both parties, & he will get what he wishes.  If he is elected Solicitor, I will never get over it.  It will be too provoking to think of, & I have no doubt he will, for he is a better Electioneerer  than Mr. Young.  He is a Member which is an advantage, & he will by his vanity & conceit make the impression that he is a very important man at home.  He is no better than Joe P�.  It is strange he should ever have been tolerated in Greenville, but it seems as if he can act just as mean as he chooses, & yet he is thought not the less of.  I hope Mr. Duncan is now convinced of his true character.

		Mr. Burt�s deceit equals his malice. He has injured you as much as he possibly could  killed your paper in Pendleton as Mr. Keith said, & now to gain your vote, tells a falsehood, & says he ordered your peice to be published.  He did no such thing, & he must think you a Simpleton, to try to deceive you so�.  I hope you have more sense & spirit than to be taken in by him.  Tell him from me, that you have my orders not to vote for him, that if you vote for him, I will never forgive you.  I look upon him, as having helped, more than anyone else, to defeat you for Congress, & you are not to turn round & help him to what he wishes.  With the exception of Mr. Jones, he is one of your greatest enemies, insignificant men, those even you have a contempt for can injure & ruin you.  The�in Cuba can undermine & destroy the strongest foundations.  Mr. Burt need not trouble himself about amusing Willie & Frank.  He shows his interested motive too plainly.

		I am glad Willie & Frank have behaved well.  You must be particular in making them keep themselves clean, have their boots cleaned, their hair parted nicely & smooth, & combed every night with a fine tooth comb.  They must clean their teeth, wear their gloves when they go out, & keep their clothes brushed, & then behave like little gentlemen.  Tell them I hope to hear constantly good accounts of them.  You must get a good supply of clothes for yourself, everything you need.

		I am glad Col. Brockman is right in Politics.  I was fearful not seeing the right side of the question he might go wrong.  I am pleased also that the prospects for your paper are encouraging.  Mr. Elford ought to act for awhile as agent in Charleston.  Miss Anderson told me she wished she had thousands to assist in sustaining the paper, that she would take it of course, & you would find persons springing up in every direction  who would take it.  Now you are in Columbia & see persons from every part of the State.  You must not be backwards in asking them to subscribe & do all they can for it.  Do not forget to stop the Palmetto Banner.  I saw Mr. S�ham the other evening & gave him Mr. O�Hanlon, Mr. Pettigrus, & Mr. McLures letters to read to encourage him.  Mr. Nicol today sent to ask me  if I had heard any interesting new[s] from Columbia to let him know the items.  You must tell me all the news, so I may tell others.  I wish the Mountaineer would let you write for it.  You can tell the people in that way so much, & influence them right.  Anything written for that paper now, by the other party will be entirely false.  Mr. Jones� treachery ought to be known.  He�ll not tell it, but I dare say he will gain by it. In future,  instead of being treated with the contempt he deserves, he will get both Bank & Anti Bank votes.  I always knew he was for the bank, for I dare say he is indebted to it in some way. Either borrowed, or other borrowed for him.

		Minerva has now been 3 days in her room doing nothing, says she cant come out to lift pots & pans.  I tell her she can have Charotte to help her, but she is not satisfied with that.  She wishes Mary & Lindy, & with the small family I now have, & so little cooking, it is not necessary to have a grown woman & herself to cook, so she stays in her room.  I try Bakers bread, & have tea & toast & Eggs & Charlotte looks after the servants.  She makes more fuss than Mrs. Sharpe with her delicate health.  Eliza is up now & sewing.  Reuben instead of wearing his own hat to travel, borrowed a new one of Charles & returned  a different one to Charles from the one he sent him.  Reuben says it must have got changed.  Charles says he knows he sold it, & pocketed the money.  He was in a great passion, when he found it out, but now he is calm & says you will make Reuben pay him.  The horses have rested now, & today Reuben hauled Mr. D� a load of wood  & brought me 50 cts.  It has been raining all day, so he hauled only 1 load.  Mr. Davis went somewhere today on business, so Anna has holiday until Monday.  Tomorrow Dr. Simons scholars speak in the Methodist church.  He has but 2 boarders, but his school breaks up for the holidays this week,

		Miss Anderson was here this morning to borrow books.  She says she hopes you will buy the 3d vol of McCaulay�s history of England in Columbia.  She is anxious to see it.  If you can get the continuation of �Laneton Parsonage,� I would like it.  I have the first one & a second & a third I think have been published.  Also the�Daughter by the same author, & there is a Book called �the lady Alice or the new Una,� which Mr. Brown mentioned as being very fine, I would like, but I only mention in case you have a Book mania  as usual.  Whatever you get, must be something pretty.  

		Mamma wrote today to know if I had heard from you.  She is as much interested in your interests as I am.  The Chronicle & Sentinel has two speeches by Mr. King & Clemens of Alabama, which are very good.  You must get the paper & read them.  If you make a speech, you will find them of service.  I would send you the paper, but I make great use of them.  Mr. Arthur has them now.  Mr. Clemens says from Maryland, N. Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky & Texas & Delaware some of their men have voted for the admission of California, so we must secede from them too.  Mr. Jones goes to Columbia tomorrow, no letters but what I have mentioned have come.  Good night, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received Willie�s & your letters today & was very much pleased with them.   I wish you would write me two or three letters every Mail in your absence.  They are my only comfort.  Mail days I watch for the hour hand to point to 12.  Tell Willie his was a pretty letter, & he must write me a longer one.  If you buy him so many books, you must buy such as I would like, any works by Mrs. Howitt is good, buy Mrs. Sherwoods works, Mrs. O��s, Miss Sewel�s.  There was a work called Evenings at Donaldson Manor, mentioned lately in the Carolinian, if it is not too expensive get, but it was mentioned as being nicely bound & handsomely illustrated, so I expect it is too expensive, & you will have plenty of use for your money, in other ways.  I do wish you could be elected Chancellor.  The very thought thrills me.  You might have let Col. Dudley nominate you & felt your prospects, even if you did not run.  It is well to be thought of for it, if not now, it will do you good for the future.  I see Col. B.G. Alston nominated for Governor, & yet I am sure he is not going to run, but it is a compliment for him to be spoken of. Do my dear husband if you think there is a chance of you being elected Judge or Chancellor, or running tolerably well, now, it may be of service to you.  Genl Whitner who has been beaten so often, perhaps now will be elected.  Her seems now to have a claim to it, from having been a Candidate so long, but 
You must not vote for Genl Whitner.  He has beaten you too badly.  I hope he will be obliged to continue Solicitor & then that aspirant for Solicitor will be disappointed and otherwise he may not be.  Mr. Memminger I suppose is conscious how interested his motive was in changing in Politics so he feels compelled to give up the Chancellorship.  I wish you could be elected.  It would be wise to let your friends find out for you, how many votes you would be likely to get.  You could ascertain I should think, beforehand  how many votes you would get.  When you ran for President of the Bank, you knew at first you would be beaten, & therefore you ought not to have run.  You always decline too soon.  You ought to let your friends find out, before you decline, what your prospects are, & if they find out they are not good, then it is time to decline.  I am glad Col. Hayne met you kindly.  I heard he was �lent in Politics, so I thought he would look on you as a Traitor & not speak to you.  I dare say you will see nothing of Mr. Taylor & Mr. Martin�s family.  They are very selfish, & even now to have no regard for us, whose house was once offered to them when they were in reduced circumstances  & had no home.  Mamma was like a Mother to Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin, & we were intimate with them�of our own cousins, but I now look upon them as less than strangers,  Eloisa & Sarah are now as cold & selfish as possible.  I am pleased at you fitting out yourself with new clothes.  If sack dress coats had been worn, I would have preferred one to a Frock Coat.  You must get Susan Hokes Music at once, �Roll on Silver Moon,[�] & send it by Mail, that is if it can be got.  I am sorry to tell you that Eliza�s child did not live a day.  It was 5 weeks or more too soon, & owing to her falls I suppose. was outwardly bruised & inwardly hurt, & also Mom Phillis not being here in time, might have been bad for it.  From the fact of its being born alive, I wrote to you in good spirits, thinking it would live, for Mary�s that was so delicate lived 5 or 6 weeks, & perhaps longer if she had been careful, but N� came to see Eliza a few hours after, & as soon as she saw it, said she did not think it would live.  Minerva came out of her room today but has done very little, & I will not give her more to do; let her do as she pleases, but I expect it will�with her as it did before; for I have never known two persons complain as she & Eliza have done.

		Mrs.. Arthur & Miss Lewis paid me a visit this morning. Miss Lewis had on a white Straw bonnet, & did not look near as well as in black.  She talks very little, if no more to Mr. Campbell she will not trouble him much, but I am glad they continue friendly.  I feared the paper & Mr. Campbell to be connected with them might have cooled them.

		Mary has just brought from the office a letter from Mr. George Gordon of Savannah.  He says he has a Mortgage on the Property lately occupied by Mr. Service, that he contemplated foreclosing & you will be so good as to inform him what time is necessary for the Legal proceedings in this State, & how long a Sale may be postponed after obtaining a decree.  He says he does not contemplate a public Sale until September, & not then at any�& positive sacrifice, rather than this he would desire you at the proper time to bid it in for him, & for your general services in the matter, please state the probable cost of proceedings &c.  This is all that is in the letter, so perhaps you had better answer it at once.

		It was suggested to Dr. Simons that it would not be proper for young ladies to speak in a public church, so he is to read the Essays himself.  It rained so yesterday, he postponed his exhibition as he calls it until Monday.  He is to confer Degrees.  He is certainly a great Humbug.  I am glad Mr. Fuller found him out, but there are many here, who would patronize him, just to show opposition to the Academy.  Mr. Brooks children now have left Mr. Davis .  Two of them go to Mr. Burnham.

		It would be bad for the State for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor, as he goes for Disunion, so you had better try & get a more reasonable man than he is.  I dare say his address will have a great effect, in making the State go for Disunion.  I have no news to tell you.  If tomorrow I can think of anything more I will begin another sheet.  I have a shocking pen.  Tell Willie I will write to him & Anna will too.  If you can buy a Male Canary bird bring it to me as my present.  It will be company for me when I am alone, & the cage ought to be used.  The Male bird sings.

		Mr. Rion I suppose was disappointed.  Because he was a prot�g� of Mr. Calhoun he thought he would be elected I expect.  Mr. Calhoun really is to cost the State a good deal.  He would be satisfied if he knew how he was remembered.  You must write to Mr. S� & others here & inform him & them of Politics &c as you have no other way of informing.  I am glad Frank is behaving pretty well.  Tell Willie he must not read books so fast.  He must borrow them from the Book�.  Good night, E.F.P.  Mamma is glad to hear all the news.

Sunday.  I will add a little more now, though not of much importance.  I read the services at home this morning, & sent Anna & Frank to church.  This afternoon we rode to Susans.  She is quite well.  The baby suffers a good deal with cholic.

		Charles tells me that Col. Irvine has sold Jim as a first rate Carpenter for 900 dollars, to someone in Aiken.  He forgot when he was selling him for himself of that protuberance, which would always prevent his being a Saleable negro, and he forgot he bought him from you as a learner in his trade.  How Drovers do deceive they live by cheating.

		Mr. Ford is Mamma�S first cousin.  He is very wor�, is poor, & has a large family, so vote for him, & get Mr. Duncan & Col. Brockman, & as many others as you can influence Col. Dudley & Mr. Goodwin &c.  The two Heywards who are members, are also our cousins.  If you come in contact with them, be polite.  Indeed you ought to be friendly & polite to all the Members & it will make them kindly disposed to you.

		I am afraid you will spend too much money in buying books for Willie.  I would like him gratified, but you will have need for money when you come home in paying Anna�s school bills which will be large, your Doctors bills &c.

		I forgot to tell you that Miss Anderson does not wish what Mr. Cox told her repeated.  She says he spoke rather in confidence.  Her objection to Mr. Arthur is that he leans to P�terism, but this also they told me as a great secret, so you must not repeat it.

		I am glad Col. Preston has been elected to the College, & hope Mr. Barnwell will be reelected Senator.  Mr. Rhett has tried too hard.  Mr. Barnwell is better than either himself or Mr. Hammond.  It would be very bad for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor now, as he goes so for Disunion.  

		As regards the Chancellorship, you know I would rather you be Chancellor or Judge than anything else, so when you think there is a chance of you being elected, you must for my sake, try.  I think when your friends propose it to you, you are wrong to decline, you ought to let them electioneer for you, & ascertain what your strength is, & then if you find your prospect not good, it is time enough to decline.  What I blame you for is refusing too soon, so in future act more wisely.  Others know better how you would run than you do yourself, so  you ought to let them ascertain, & then determine.  I am sure you are superior to the other Candidates, & the Upper Country needs a Chancellor.  The other two Candidates being from the lower country would divide the votes, so perhaps one from the Upper Country would run well.  Col. Dawkins & Whitner have no claims as Judge I am sure,  for they are�of them are superior.  You know how things are better than I do.  All I say is, you must not decline what honors are offered to you too soon; by waiting awhile, you might find things in your favor.  Genl Whitner did not vote for you for Congress.  It is raining now.  All day has been damp & drizzly.  The winter continues so warm, there is no prospect of killing hogs now.  I am sorry I have so bad a pen.  I dislike sending so shabby a letter.  I wish you would write me several sheets every Mail.  I long for the time when I will hear every day.  Tell Willie & Frank Howdy & to behave well.  Fanny was looking at my picture the other day, & she said, �this is Fanny�s Mother.�  Good night, your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, written last Saturday.  I was very glad to hear from you.  The next winter when you go to Columbia you must leave the children at home, & carry me instead.  I hope you spent a pleasant day at Col. O�Hanlons, but would rather if possible, you should have gone to church, & spent fast day with�.  I think it very hypocritical to appoint a fast day, to pray to the Almighty to help out of difficulties, that the State has brought on herself & wishes to bring.  I for one cannot help it.  I see in your resolutions you speak of the aggressions of the North.  I have always argued that the North has not aggressed, but on the contrary as Judge Nesbit said, done more for the South lately than she has done for the last fourteen years, that California had a right to exclude Slavery, & Congress a right to admit her a State, that the Wilmot Proviso had been abandoned.  The Fugitive Slave law passed, & Slavery trade being abolished in the District of Columbia was what many Southerners approved of, & I thought you argued in the same way, so where are the aggressions of the North?  Mr. Clemens says many Southerners voted for the admission of California.  The Southern States that are satisfied ought not to be made to take a part even in a Southern Convention.  If they are satisfied, let them remain so.  South Carolina only thinks herself ill treated, so let her fight it out herself, so I hope she will get well beat, & be taught a lesson she will never forget, only you, have not helped to bring on the difficulty, shall not help them out of it.  Dr. Crook & Col. Town[e]s & others may be the first to fight.  Mr. Memminger has done more than anyone to bring on the difficulty, & wishes it & then appoints a fast Day to pray for help & direction &c.  You have not mentioned Mr. B�ly.  He seemed so friendly to you.  I suppose you will see him, unless Politics may have made a change in his feelings.  I am glad Dr. Lieber & Mr. Williams are Union men.  I can sympathize with Dr. Liebers finding it a treat to have one like you to talk to, for I find it a treat to go to see the Miss Andersons, who are warm for the Union.  You must interest yourself in getting subscribers for the Southern Patriot.  I hope Mr. Frederick Ford has been elected & that you voted for him, for he is needy.  I see in the paper, the first ballot he was 2 votes behind.

		In the legislature they seem to be getting warm, from their resolutions I suppose it is all for effect.  It is strange after Mr. Memminger changed his Politics to be made Chancellor, that he should decline running.  I suppose of course he would  have been elected.  If you find there is a prospect of your being elected, you must try your chance.  You ought to let your friends electioneer for you, & inform you, what they think.

		You must be on your guard against Pickpockets, even if you have but little in your pocket.  I yesterday paid Mr. Payne�s beef bill, & today Mr. Randolph sent his, but I declined paying it.  I have bought Tea & Turkeys & do not wish to be quite out of funds so I leave it for you to pay; so recollect you will need money when you come home.  Willie mentioned you have bought me a pencil & pen, but I am sorry you have, for I have a pencil now & a quill pen I prefer to any other, because it has a finer nib, & I told you expressly to bring me no present, if you�I would always rather fix upon something I really want.  I sent your letter to Col. Town[e]s to read, because I wanted him to see what kind of person Mr. Jones was, who I dare say he had begun to think highly of, merely because on the Southern question he pretended to agree with him, & there was nothing in your letter to prevent my showing it to him, except that Genl Thompson had written you in connection with the paper, & as I knew there was such a prejudice against him, I saved a�paper on that fact so he could not read it.  There was nothing else in the letter but what could with propriety be published to the world.  There was no domestic matter discussed, nothing that would have been indelicate to show.

		It is raining now & has been all day.  It puts a stop to the servants doing any work.  The clothes are not even dry enough to iron.  The roads are too muddy to haul wood.  Our groundnuts cannot be dried.  Eliza is doing pretty well.  Minerva is out of her room but I gave her very little to do.

		Dr. Simons exhibition took place yesterday at the Methodist church.  Susan Hoke attended & gave me an account of it.  He himself made a long speech & praised himself greatly for having performed his part so conscientiously to his scholars.  He read the Essays of the young ladies.  One of them was on the impropriety educating children at the North & using the�of their imbibing Northern principles, that at the North they received but a superficial education; encouraging Northern Teachers at the South ought also to have been treated of, but of course that was understood.  Dr. Simons gave the Degrees to four young ladies, to each of whom he made a speech in Latin. & strange to say those very young ladies are coming back to his school next year, & yet are called the graduating class, rather different from colleges in general.

		Tonight two letters have come from the Post Office, one from Mr. G.W.P. Pool, Dekalb Kemper County Mississippi.  He says he is a native of this District.  He understands  you have established a paper for the purpose of advocating the principles of the Union party, not only in your State, but in the South generally.  He knows you by reputation, & is satisfied the principles of any party, will not suffer in such hands.  He knows nothing of the terms, or even the name of your paper, but you will please send it to him, & he will remit the amount of subscription as soon as he knows the amount due.

		The other letter is dated Harrisburg, S.C.  The name I cannot decipher, but I will write it as he has, & perhaps you will find it out.  It is signed D.W.C. L�son.  The letter says Mr. Isaac Kennedy wishes you to send him the prospectus of the Southern Patriot & he will try & get subscribers for you.  The person who writes the letter is the Post Master at Harrisburg, S.C. 

		So as Miss Anderson said, subscribers are springing up, one place & another.  I think you have received encouragement already.  I am thinking, suppose a Southern Convention does assemble & determines to go for a Dissolution of the Union, you will be�the very thing you wish to avoid, whereas letting the other States alone, South Caroline will find it impossible to dissolve the Union herself & therefore will have to give it up so do you not think it best to let her take her own course, & see what she is going to do.  Of course you not assisting her but maintaining your position, disapproving of separate State action 7c.  But you know not.  I merely tell my thoughts.  But I wish you would be quietly enrolled among Chancellors & Judges, one of whom I hope to see you, if not now, at another time.  Do you really think now, if you tried for it, that you would be elected; you ought to let Col. Dudley find out for you.  I am�Willie & Frank are doing well.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter this morning.  I carried Mamma to see Mrs. Senious, & on our way back stopped at the Post Office & saw a good many gentlemen there.  Butler Thompson came to the carri[a]ge & spoke to us.  He looks badly, his face thin & his eyes red.  If he were not a Son of Temperance, I would think he had been indulging freely.  He says he hardly thinks he will be able to move in all winter, the roads are so shockingly bad.  He says he is glad his father is married, & he knows his sister has good sense enough  to be reconciled too.  He thinks that in 6 months the Union party in this State will be in the ascendancy, that all the firey resolutions are introduced by young men of no influence, & I thoroughly agree with him, but since your letter I think differently, as you say it is a fixed & settled purpose among the Politicians to dissolve the Union.  I think now they will go on, & that things look very gloomy.  Mamma is uneasy, for fear her little income even, may suffer in the general desolation, that the bank questions will be disturbed.  What do you think, tell me, so I can relieve her.

		So Genl Whitner is at last elected Judge.  His wishes are at length gratified & how little did he deserve it, when he is not even a superior lawyer, but perseverance will gain anything, & ambition with it, & you are wanting certainly in the latter.  So you will never be, I am afraid more�than you are now, but I do hope you will try to be on the bench the first vacancy.  I am glad the children have dined at Mr. Taylors, for I would have felt very much provoked if they had not noticed them, & thought Mrs. Taylor wanting in every feeling of kindness & gratitude.  You must do as you think best about sending Frank home, but if he is behaving well, you had better keep him as a companion for Willie, who would be entirely dependent on you, if Frank leaves, & you will feel less at liberty to go where you please.  The next winter if nothing unforeseen occurs, I will go with you, & leave the children at home.  Mamma says she will come in & take care of them.  Susan is glad to hear of Mr. McBee.  He has not written once, since he left; it is out of his way to write.  In your next, if he has not left, tell what time he will set off.  Old Mrs. Turpin is dead.  I heard it today, so if Mr. Felder wishes the land, he will have to apply to some of the family.  The old Man has been ill some time.  Miss Lewis, if is said. Is to be married the 12th of this month tonight week. She & Mr. Campbell have made quick work of it, & will get acquainted after they are married.

		We went to see Mrs. Simons this morning.  She seems in good spirits.  She says next year their boarders will be entirely a new set.  I thought to myself she would always find that the case.  Mrs. Temple she says is an old Sharper, that she sent in such extravagant bills to the Music scholars.  Dr. Simons had to interfere, that for instruction books that would get at Mr. Rowands for 50 cts, she bought at that price & charged�scholars for the Music they took.  She would charge at 5 dollars worth, when they had only taken 2 dollars worth &c, so in this instance I suppose Dr. Simons for a�was not to blame. Mrs. Choice asked Mrs. Temple to stay with her for a few days, & she took up her abode, so Mrs. Simons says, but I think Mrs. Choice could have gotr rid of her if she needed it.  She ertainly must have liked her company.

		Anna wrote a letter last night to Willie, which I enclose.  I hope you will think she has improved in penmanship.  

		Mamma got lately a letter from Aunt Eliza.  She alludes to Politics.  She forgets we were at the North during the Nullification excitement & therefore had not our feelings enlisted then as she had, & most probably we would also, having but one side, & that we are at liberty now to think for ourselves, & she is so afraid Mamma will be influenced by you & think contrary to Uncle Robert�s old sentiments, who of course none of the family ought to be presumptuous enough to differ from, that she says, �I think of those who are gone, whose feelings & efforts would have been with us at this time, & by whose�& sentiments mine were formed.  Our leading men will find it hard  to restrain the people, for they are ready every where to peril every thing rather than submit to their oppressors & the evil must be met at some time.  I know not , nor can anyone now what this lessor with bring forth.�  This is her great wisdom.  I would like to ask her one question, if the South is so oppressed why not the other Southern States feel it besides South Carolina.  They are really insensible to the great oppression they are labouring under, & are obliged to be told of it by South Carolina, but I suppose the Patriotism of the South has been monopolized so by this State, there is none left for the others.  If you make a speech in favour of your resolutions, do make a noble effort, one that will carry conviction to every mind.  As you have espoused the unpopular side, you must sustain yourself by unanswerable arguments.  The minority are not even given credit for disinterestedness, which they certainly deserve, for they lose all hopes of advancement to honour & distinction, & gain only ill will.  I am sorry now Col. Preston was reelected to the College, as he has such Disunion sentiments.  Genl Thompson is about the only Nullifier that has changed, & I wish he had not, for he has injured the cause, & I expect after all his change is from an interested motive.  I am sorry he subscribed for the paper.  Mr. Jones is not of as much importance as he thinks.  I hope Mr. Duncan will never have confidence in him again.  He ought to have had sense enough to have known before this what he was.  I suppose he will comfort himself with the idea, that if he had run, he would have been elected.  There are some persons so conceited, nothing pulls down their vanity.  I suppose he thought the head of the ticket would aspire to anything.

		I hope you dined at Col. Hamptons, that Willie did not prevent your accepting invitations, as he did last Session.	  I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to buy me a sack or Polled�warm for the winter.  It will not amount to even 10 dollars & the shawl you bought me is too thin for the coolest weather.  I expect to pay for it out of some of the money you left me & what Reuben makes for hauling wood, so you may not feel the effects of it, & it is the only thing I am going to get this winter.  I have 3 dollars now independent of what you gave me, & I hope to make more.  Charles brought me 1 dollar for building a chimney, & Reuben 2 dollars. I wrote Aunt Mary to send it by someone going to Columbia, but if she could find no one to take it, to send it on the Rail Road to the Depository in Columbia directed to you.  She will send it I suppose the beginning of next week.  From Monday you must look in the Newspaper. Where I believe all things sent to the Depository are advertised.  The names of the persons to whom the things are sent, I believe are always mentioned, so you must be on the look out from Monday & by the first opportunity send it to me, before you know if anyone can bring it but do not trust it , except by some person sent otherwise I am afraid  it might get lost.

		Mamma wants you to inquire for her the price of nice writing desks.  Mention the different kinds you see that are very nice & the prices from 3 to 5 dollars.  She wishes to buy one, & she wishes you to buy her some Clover& Blue Grass seed, enough to plant her lawn.  You must buy me nothing at all.  I am sorry you bought me the pen & pencil.  You know I have a pencil & I do not need a pen, & I would rather you have saved your money.  I wish the men would take it back.  Tell Willie & Frank to behave well & keep themselves neat & do credit to me.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, & as usual was very much pleased to hear from you.  In the Courier that came today, I read a letter of Mr. Poinsetts.  I am delighted he is still for the Union.  That among the changes he is still the same.  How well he explains the position the State w� to assume, like a person throwing himself from a precipice with the expectation of hurting his enemy.  I sent it up tonight to Mr. Arthur to read, sent him word.  I knew he would like to read anything Mr. Poinsett wrote, & it was so good I could not keep it to myself.  He sent word he would be very glad to read it.  I carried it this afternoon to the Miss Andersons to read.  On the way I met Dr. Crook & told him I had just read a letter of Mr. Poinsett�s.  He asked on what subject.  I said the state of the times.  I wanted to add, that I was glad he was one who had remained firm, but I thought he would make me some pat answer, & the wind was blowing, & I had no time to argue.   I know he has changed thinking he is now in the majority & will be elected to the Legislature now, & while he as a Union man he was not.

		I do long for your paper to begin, to publish Mr. Poinsetts letter & other good things, that if the people would only see would prevent their going astray from the old Union way.  Old Mr. Miller was here today.  He took a Prospectus & says he is trying to make up a club, says he will certainly take the paper.  Mr. Pickerell had showed him your prospectus.  Do try & get a great many subscribers.  Do as much as you can for the paper, as you say in Greenville not many take a paper.  I am sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.  You ought for once to have omitted going to the Board of Trustees.

		I cannot help feeling sorry for Mr. Burt, & after you told me he was defeated, felt glad when you told me, you had voted for him, & if you had not. & he had been beaten only by two votes, he would have felt that you were almost the cause of his defeat, that your vote might have influenced another vote, & elected him.  I dare say if he had been elected, I would have still felt vexed with him, but now I feel very sorry for him, with his large family, but he certainly in future ought to treat you better.  Frank is wise, he ought not to fast so long between dinner & breakfast.  He is right to take his lunch at ? past 1.  I hope he will get fat.  He is determined to take the worth of his board.  I am glad you have not sent him home.  He will run in the yard with John, & get ruined, & without him Willie would be lonely, & cling so to you, you could not go where you chose.  I am afraid he is a favorite with the Members.   The Ch�  Doll I expect may be for someone here, directed to me, but I do not know.  

		I am provoked you will buy so many books.  I wish several but do not get them, for fear you cannot afford it, but you buy any kind of books, you have such a�on the subject & your books are not suited for the children.  They are too deep, so in future divide the money in half, & let me select some  for myself.   I wish Mrs. Opie�s works, Mrs. Sherwood, Mrs. Howitt, Miss jewett�s Miss Bremer�s & many others.  I am saving as much as possible, to buy something warm to wear, & without any thought you lavish your money on books, half of which you do not read.  It is too provoking.

		When you come back you have Anna�s schooling to pay, which will be a very large bill.  You have butchers bills to pay.  Mr. Randolph sent in one of 5 dollars the other day.  I did not pay it.  You have Saddlers & Blacksmiths bills, Doctors bills 200 for the paper, Rail Installments 100 dollars to Mr. Rosemond.  Think of all this & wonder where the money is coming from & then perhaps you will be more prescient.  I will go with you next winter to keep your purse.

		It was just as well for you not to speak to Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.  They do not deserve it, for any attention they have ever paid you. Mrs. Taylor has slighted you always, & if I were to go to Columbia, I would take care to see very little of her myself.  When you speak on the Southern question, make a good speech, one that will do you credit. Filled with �table arguments that will settle the question at once.  Mr. Poinsett thinks the North has not augg�, even in prohibiting the Slave trade in the District of Columbia.  That is what I think.  I think there is no cause for a Southern Convention even.  Nothing has occurred as yet to call for one.  This State seems to think herself so important that it is really an honor for her to remain in the Union.  I see she is backing out.  The resolutions say, �South Carolina only remains at present in the Union, &c &c.  I feel vexed with the State, as I do with a person.  She is self conceited & vain & foolish, like one of your colleagues.  I think what Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma about politics, was very�, knowing that you, who were so nearly connected with her, differed entirely from her.  She speaks as if of course her party was right.  I was so afraid she might think, my family always having been on the other side, that I felt mortified at your acting differently, that I wrote to Aunt Harriett McCall my views on the subject.  She has no politicians in her family, & I knew would sisters patient�, & I told her I approved of your course.  I agreed with you entirely, & if she heard anyone mention your name, to say I was with you heart & soul, & I was not ashamed of my sentiments.  I wrote her a long letter, & I wish she would show it to Aunt Eliza.  I do not wish her to think that I differ with you, & have any sympathy with her.  The North ought to make S. Carolina leave the Union, & be glad to get rid of her, important as she thinks herself.  Mr. Moses is really ready for War, talking of defending with swords, & appealing to the god of battle, & the almighty smiling on such a good cause.

		I want you to buy me some Hops in Columbia, or soon I will not be able to have bread.  Mamma & myself both wish some.  I do not see Mr. Thurston�s name mentioned as being admitted to practice Law.

		Old M� Turpin was buried yesterday afternoon in the midst of a hard rain.  The weather is now clear, the wind blowing, & it is getting cold.  Monday I hope we can kill hogs.  You must watch for my bundle, for I dare say it will be sent to the Depository, & send it to me the first chance.  A great many papers are sent now to you directed  to the Southern Baptist, some today from Louisville, the Washington Republican.  Thank Willie for his letters.  You will receive Anna�s tonight to him.  If I have anything more to add tomorrow    I will begin another sheet.  Mr. Arthur gave out, there would be service Fast day, but he had none.  I did not intend going.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter today , & Anna Willie�s, for both of which we thank you.  I am glad to hear so many are opposed to Separate State action, but from the preparations the State is making for arms & Navies, she seems serious.  Tomorrow you think you will make your speech.  I hope it will be a good one, & that your resolutions for a Southern Convention will be carried.  You must have your speech published either in one of the Columbia papers or in pamphlet form, & send it all over the District.  It is the only way the people can know your views, for in the Mountaineer they will not publish that or anything in your favour.  I am afraid it will be a long time yet, before the Southern Patriot makes its appearance, for Mr. Elford has not even come yet.  I suppose Mr. Jones wished to make a speech, so as to turn the attention of the Legislature towards himself, & see how great a man he is, & in consequence elect him Solicitor.  He will do all Electioneering can do, to gain his ends, but I do hope he will not succeed.  He also wishes his speech published in the Mountaineer, which strange to say a vain fool like himself now rules, & Mr. Campbell to allude to it as follows, �We publish today the able & patriotic speech of our distinguished representative, who stood at the head of the ticket.�  Yesterday the invitations for Miss Lewis� wedding were sent out.  We received one.  Mamma & Ann & all of the McBee family except Susan & Mr. Luther.  They certainly seem to have slighted them intentionally, & how a Minister & his family should act so, is most unchristian like, & though of itself, it is but a little matter, still the motive is not.  They are evidently vexed with Susan & have taken this opportunity of resenting it, & she could not attend a church with pleasure, whose Minister has unjustly treated her.  At the time of the baptism as I told you Mrs. Arthur was vexed without any cause, but since then they have taken tea at Mamma�s, been invited to Susan�s, & they seemed friendly.  Mamma attributes it to Mrs. Jones, who does not speak to Mr. Luther now, because he did not vote for Mr. Jones, & Mr. Luther also (Mr. Campbell I dare say knows) has encouraged the new paper; so Mamma thinks Mrs. Jones told Mr. Campbell to tell Miss Lewis  not to invite Mr. McBee & Susan.  But it is all conjecture.  We only know from whatever came, it is unchristian like to show resentment.  A great many persons are invited.  It will be a very large wedding, & to be at home, not at church.  I never had any thoughts of going.  I have a contemptible opinion of Mr. Campbell.  He looks so vain & trifling, always laughing�.  The hogs are at Last killed.  10 were killed yesterday, & 5 today.  2 of them were so bruised & injured by the other hogs, that Charles has let them out of the pen, one small one we killed soon after you left.  I am glad now your Corn will be saved.  Mr. Foster has sent it several times.  I do not know how much.  Mr. Davis wrote a letter to you today & got Anna to put it in the Post office, about the time the examination is to take place I believe.  Susan Hoke was here last night, & she said her Father had written to you.  I hope that is a good sign, & that he has come out on your side, & it is important to gain him.  You must write to him, on the subject of Politics in general.  I sent him Mr. Poinsett�s letter to read.  I have not seen Genl Hamilton�s.  I think you say he has written one.  I thought you were going to elect Mr. Barnwell again to the Senate.  I now much prefer him to Mr. Rhett.  Mr. Rhett is too ambitious, would ruin his county to attain his object, & is too violent a Disunionist to send as Senator.  I thought also Mr. Pickens had�his claims for Governor.

		   No letters have come for you since I wrote, unless some come tonight by the Augusta Mail.  I hope you will avail yourself of the opportunity of seeing people from so many different places, & get them to interest themselves for the Southern Patriot.  Keep a list & put down the names of all the subscribers.

		You must buy some Hops for Mamma & myself, 1 dollars worth between us, if they are to be got in Columbia, also try blue grass & Clover seed for Mamma to sow her lawn, & mention the prices of writing Desks for Mamma, & buy a toy for Vardry.  As he is you Godson, you ought to remember him sometimes, and it is not the value of the present but the remembrance that Susan likes.  Susan today has dreadful headache, & her baby is sick constantly, & screams & fatigues her so.  If Mrs. Arthur knew her every trials, it would give her no pleasure to slight & mortify her, how unchristian like.  Even I felt sorry for Mr. Burt, who has for years only injured you, & you returned good for evil, so I say if Susan had offended in any way, they ought to forgive, & though it is no great thing to be invited to a wedding, still the not inviting in this instance shows a bad feeling.  The whole congregation are invited but her, even some of the children of the village, Mr. & Mrs. Davis, & young ladies, Mrs. Arthur dews not even know.  I thought on account of Mrs. Arthurs ill health, her Mother having died so recently, & in a Ministers family the wedding taking place, it would have been in church & private, but the motive in having so large a one is to make friends for Mr. Campbell.

		I am glad you were pleased with Anna�s letter.  I expect Mr. David takes more pain with her, than Mr. Irvin does with Willie, but Mr. Davis� account I know will be enormous�says Sally Crooks was more than 90 dollars, so think of this when you are buying books.  Our children are not worse I suppose than others. I wish I could bring them up well, & counteract what failings they have.  Their chief fault is quarreling with each other, so they appear worse when together, & better when separate, but this visit to Columbia will improve Willie & Frank so much, that when they return home, they will never quarrel again.  Charles says he will attend to H�, who I have no doubt will be very glad to see Willie.  I have not caught a glimpse of him since you left.  

		You must inquire for my bundle, that Aunt Mary McCall is to send me, if not by a private opportunity,  then to the Depository directed to you, so inquire at the Depository every day, unless you see the advertisement in the paper, of a bundle directed to your care.  I think they used to put them in the paper, but I am not certain.  You can send Willie & Frank to the Depository every evening.

		A letter has come tonight from Mr. Burket.  He says he has now 3 cribs full of Corn, which he thinks is 400 barrels.  He has sown his wheat, & had a fine season for it.  He has got the Cotton, & ginned 32 thousand pounds of it.  He has got up 50 head of hogs.  They are fat now, & he is going to slaughter some of them now.  He is getting timber for the Cotton screw & will try to have it done by Christmas.  He would like to buy some Pork from you & would like to know at what price.  The negroes are well, the Stocks are well; this is all the news.

		Monday [Wednesday].  The weather is still cold.  Russel Middleton used to be a particular friend of Mamma�s.  His Mother & his Aunt Mrs. Dehon were both intimate friends of Mamma�s.  We staid in the country at his Fathers once, & he was from a child good & pious.  Mr. Hutson is some kind of cousin of ours, related to the Colcocks.  Mr. Burnett we knew at N. Haven, also Nat Heyward we knew there.  He & his mother are our cousins.  I am very sorry cousin Frederick Ford was defeated.  He is good & poor.  There is not a particle of news to tell you beyond Miss Lewis wedding.  I�, even the Mrs. Gowers, who Mrs. Arthur does not visit which makes it more accountable Susan�s not being; from this time we will all certainly have very little to do with them.  Christians so calling themselves have certainly less of kindness, charity & love than any others, but they are not Christians & have no right to the cause.  Today I suppose you will speak, & I pray may have some effect & present your state�herself.  I hope your resolutions will be adopted.  E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today.  I was sorry you had not made your speech, & so been able to give me an account of it.  I hope they will not cut you out, as Mr. Memminger was last year.  I see by Mr. Jones remarks he also goes for a Southern Congress, but then adds he is ready to go with the State, & can answer for his constituents.  Of course as he was head of the ticket, he does not oppose you, & as usual goes with both sides.  That is the politic way.  He always manages to keep with you, gain your friends, & have his own friends, & the other side too.  I wonder his vanity did not make him run for Solicitor.  You say the majority agree with you in reality.  It seems�then,  You should be the only one abused.  You ought then to pursue the course they do.  But what made so much opposition to you in Greenville, was your siding with Genl Thompson, & as he is here so little it is a pity, you should be injured by him, but in truth I do dislike him. & think not one of the name to be trusted.  I hope he will never pay more than 200 towards the paper, & that you will return to him as soon as possible.

		I am really sorry you will throw away your money as you do.  It gives me no pleasure to hear of your useless purchases.  A pistol you should have no use for.  The plaster of Paris ornaments we have no place in the Drawing room for. We have so many little ornaments there now, we have no use for more.  Two or three books would have been quite enough.  You never get the kind I like, & you do not read half of them yourself.  We have much need for money.  It distresses me to see you fling it away actually as you do.  I have been living with the greatest economy to enable me to save 10 dollars to buy something warm to wear when I go out this winter, & without thought you spend dollar after dollar for the most useless things.  If you were rich you might indulge your taste for books but you are not rich, & your family get more expensive every year.  But I may as well stop.  If I preached until Doomsday, it would not make you prudent & economical.  Perhaps tel[l]ing you of facts that will ere long make you feel the want of money may have some effect so listen.

		Poor Scott is in a very bad way.  Reuben says at Laurens on his return, Scott in the morning found it difficult to get up.  So when he got home he rested, & has been used I believe but once since he seems to be weak in the loins.  There is a particular spot in the small of the back, that when you touch, he winces & grunts.  Reuben washes it with salt & water, & is doing all he can for it, but he has been sick so long in this way, that I should rather think, he will not be well again, & am afraid even his days are numbered.  One morning Reuben thought he had�himself against the Stable in getting up.  His leg seemed sprained but I do not know if it was so, but I think your Stable is too small, & that may be one reason your horses are so often lame.  Often I hear them knocking against the stable.  You had better have the partition between the Stable & the cutting room taken down.  I hope Scott will get well, but it is best to prepare for the worst, & then where will be the money to get another horse.  How much better to save what you can for such emergencies.  I believe if Col. Irby were to pay you the 1100 which I hope & pray for many a long day he will not.  In a few weeks you would spend every dollar of it, & with no capital yielding interest what in future would your wife & children do, if left without you.

		As Scott is sick, Selim & Byron will have to go for you.  Reuben says they are quite well.  He thinks the journey is too long to be made in two days.  The days are short; the roads perhaps bad so that three days Reuben thinks it will take.  He thinks it was such long days rides that has made Scott so much worse.  Write me what you think.  Reuben shall go for you with Selim & Byron & if the journey shall be made in two or three days going & coming.  You will get this letter Saturday, answer it Sunday, & I will get your answer Tuesday in time to send Reuben Wednesday or Thursday whichever you say.  If I were not to hear from you, I will send him one of those days, whichever he thinks, so as to meet you at Fulkes Friday night.  Tonight Mr. Campbell & Miss Lewis are married.  I suppose by this time they are man & wife.  I had no inclination to go to the wedding, having no looking for him, or to a crowd either.  I believe they leave tomorrow for Augusta or somewhere.  I must not forget to tell you, that Susan was invited to the wedding.  The invitation was sent to old Mrs. McBee�s, & she neglected sending it to Susan, so there is an end to what would always have been a mystery to me.  When Mamma first told me of the slight I told her, she might depend upon it, it was a mistake.  The invitation had been written, & in some way mislaid,, for otherwise there was no accounting for the neglect, for Mr. Arthur would hardly be so unchristian like, as to resent a little mistake, as the Baptism was in this way, after for so long a time being friendly, & if it had been Mrs. Jones she would have influenced against you & me as well as Susan & Mr. McBee, & she is too cat like& stealthy to revenge herself openly, so I am glad it has turned out, as I first thought.

		Anna Williams has lost her oldest child her daughter.  It died yesterday.  The funeral took place this afternoon, so Mr. Arthur attended two very different ceremonies  the same evening.  Last Sunday Mrs. D� who I carried home, told me the little girl was sick with putrid sore throat.  She had the worse throat she ever saw,  In the afternoon Mrs. Williams was at church, so I thought it must be better, but yesterday it died & I dare say it is better for it.  Mrs. Williams has now only one little boy left.

		You must try & enjoy yourself the rest of the Session & it has not been as stormy for you as I supposed it would be.  Stay until the Legislature adjourns.  Do not come a moment sooner, & I will have a good Christmas dinner ready for you.  You know best how long you ought to take to travel home.  Reuben says the two horses Byron & Selim are well, so if you think so, you can come in two days.  I only thought I would tell you Reubens opinion.  We will be very glad to see you all.  Ann begs me to ask you to buy her a viol of Otto of Rose 50 cts, such as you once bought me.  I think you bought it at the Confectioners.  I hope you have looked at the Desks for Mamma, & that you will get my bundle safely Aunt Mary McCall is to send, either by private opportunity or to the Depository directed to you.

		No ploughing has been done yet.  Until this week it has rained incessantly.  Killing the hogs, cutting them up, making Sausage meat &c has taken until today.  Charles, Mary & Lindy are even now, cleaning the feet, & Scott has required attention, so I thought the rest of this week Reuben had better haul wood for us, & a few persons who had asked for it.  Then as next week, he goes for you, it is not worthwhile for so few days ploughing, so he will go on hauling wood, & plough after you come back.  I do not expect to use the horses much this winter.  Good night.  I hope your resolutions will pass, & in your next you will give me an account of your speech.  You must not let yourself be prevented from making a speech.  You do differ, how the outs, not going for Disunion, so they do not wish you to have the opportunity of expressing your opinion.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.  Howd� to Willie & Frank

Saturday night, 14 December [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, in which you mentioned you had spoken, but only an hour, & had not said half you wished, that you had astounded the Legislature, & your speech been poorly quoted, misrepresented &c.  All this is so different from what I had expected, that I feel disappointed.  As you have said the majority of the Members agreed with you.  I did not know your opinions would astonish them so, but the truth is you only agree in wishing a Southern Convention, but they wish it for the purpose of dissolving the Union; you to preserve it, & that is a great difference.  I knew I would not like the notes of your speech in the papers, as they have not done you justice. So I thought it best today, not to look at the papers.  All the speeches on the other side, never mind how poor they all are praised.  Mrs. Pickerell told me. The correspondent of the Mountaineer spoke highly of Mr. Leitner�s speech.  I hope you will have yours published just as soon as possible; that justice may be done you, but I am thinking in what paper you can get it published; that perhaps none will publish it.  If all refuse, you must have it published in pamphlet form, even if you have to send it to Augusta.

		My greatest comfort during you absence has been to go every Saturday afternoon to the Miss Andersons & tell them the news from Columbia.  They are so few now with whom I can converse freely, & meet sympathy.  They are the finest ladies I know of.  They are so conscientious & act so on principle.  They are poor, & yet live respectably.  At one time they were afraid they would have to give up their house, & if they would get no other board out, & if so, they would be obliged to apply to their brothers for aid, which they were very reluctant to do, but for the present they can keep the house.

		Mr. & Mrs. Campbell left the morning after the wedding.  I believe for Augusta, but I am not certain.  They did not wait for the sister to return from Virginia, though she is expected every day.  Mr. Luther went to the wedding, & says though many were invited, there were only a few there.  Mrs. Arthur today sent each of us some cake.

		I am sorry you make no mention of a bundle having been sent to you from Charleston.  I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to get me a Sashe, & send it by someone to you, or if no private opportunity occurred to send it on the Rail Road directed to the Columbia Depository to your care, & I have repeatedly written to you to send to the Depository & see about it, but you give me no answer on the subject, & now the time approaches for you to leave Columbia.  I feel very uneasy, for fear you will leave without seeing about it.  Though a little matter to you, it is a great matter to me, for I have nothing warm to wear to church.  My cloak is too old.  I have had it now 15 years, & my shawl is too thin, so I beg you to interest yourself & send the children down to the Depository every day to see if the bundle has come.  It will be a pleasant walk for them, & keep them from annoying you with their company, which I am afraid they do, as you say they are constantly with you.  I thought Willie having Frank as his companion would have been independent of you, that they would have spent the greater part of their time in walking about the town.  Today a letter came from Mr. Spartan Goodlett, inclosing a list of 10 subscribers, & wishing you success, & his best wishes.  The names are Wm J. Pennington, James K. Dickson, W.J. Gilreath, W.D. Berry, John Groce, Asa Cunningham, Lewis Cockrell, William Dickson, John Mosteller, Spartan Goodlett.  If all you send Prospectus to, will send you 10 subscribers, I will be glad.  Except Mr. O�Hanlon, all wish the weekly numbers, so I do not think there will be any use for a triweekly.  If so, the expenses of the printing establishment, I hope will be less.  I see pretty plainly, the paper will not be issued the 1st January, for that is only two weeks from now, & the type is not even here.  Mr. Elford ought to hurry.  How times are changed.  The Mountaineer that seemed to belong to you, now your greatest enemy & governed by such a little mean of set of men, who have been hitherto of so little importance, & edited by a simple schoolmaster of Chester, & a drunken sot from Alabama, they dictating to your friends, & reeling with a rod of iron, & carrying everything before them.  Papers have such influence & they misrepresent so, & in this State at present, there is no chance of vindicating oneself.  

		I am sorry Mr. Young was defeated, but on the first ballot Mr. Reed ran so well, I thought he would be elected, & his being a Member of the Legislature was an advantage.  So Mr. Young though he got himself elected to the Nashville Convention, did not gain his end as Genl Whitner did.  

		Scott is about the same,  He is very weak & stays down a great deal, but Reuben says he eats & drinks a good deal.  Dr. Earle told Mamma , he noticed him last summer & thought him S�, & if I sent him to his stable, he would try & cure him, but it is now Sw� you know, it is the reverse, his under parts seem affected.  Reuben says, it may be worms in the Kidneys.  I think it is Spinal affection.

		This is the last letter but one, I am to write.  You must write so I can hear from you three times:  Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday.  If I hear nothing to the reverse, I will send Reuben Thursday, perhaps Wednesday & let him rest a day at Fulkes.  Will Mr. Duncan return with you, or come in the Stage.  If you set off at 8 oclock I do not think you will come all the way to Laurens that day.

		Tomorrow is Sunday.  I will let the horses rest, & walk to church if I go.  Today has been cloudy & cold, looking like Snow.  Dr. Turpin has had a very bad drinking spell.  I hear old Maj Turpin left no will.  

		Mrs. Pickerell has been sick in bed for several weeks.  Every day I send her something.  As she has no one to�for her, I have been to see her twice.  She is very grateful.  Says she knows I need nothing she can do for me, but if I did, she certainly would do it.  Mr. Pickerell & herself are good Union persons, so there I meet with sympathy, & they are both very sensible.

		I hope your speech will soon be published.  I do not suppose it will be approved of then, but still you can do some justice to yourself then.  I expect you did while making it.  I am afraid you did not do as well as you expected to.

		If any more ideas occur to me, I will write more tomorrow night, & dare say many will.  Love to the boys, Your wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		As I thought, I have many things to write about.  I did not go to church this morning, but I did this afternoon.  Next Sunday Mr. Arthur gave out, he would handle preaching morning & afternoon on the subject of Slavery.  As I have no doubts on the subject, & think it a very inappropriate subject for a Sermon, I am not going to church to hear him.  I dare say it will have a political bearing.  It is hard that those in the minority who dare to express their opinion are branded as Traitors, & it is impertinent for persons to be writing to Mamma in that strain, when they know you think as the minority does.  Today Mamma showed me a letter from Miss Drayton, & of course she must allude to Politics, & she expresses herself as follows.  �I suppose you are as much interested in the state of public affairs as I am; things are coming to a crisis, which might all have been prevented by fairness & unanimity in ourselves a few years back & even now unanimity would not only save us, but place us on a better understanding & finer position than we have possessed for years, but alas! Traitors within the camp are often exhibiting their satanic�some bought with Texan lands, with Northern dinners & flattery, or the hope of preferment.  They do not feel, �this is my own, my native land.�  I will say the reward attendant on their course.�  I suppose she alludes to Genl Hamilton & Mr. Poinsett.  I have not seen the letter of the former, but the latter I am sure, if he had not felt �this is my own my native land.�  Would have kept quiet, & not exposed himself to be assailed & persecuted as all who express their opinion on that side are.  Mamma says in the Mountaineer Mr. Poinsetts peice is answered & he is made out to be certainly wrong.  It is signed Tyger & Mr. McBee says Dr. Crook wrote it, & Mamma says Genl Hamiltons letter is ridiculed & spoken of as showing so little sense, that the writer does not believe Genl Hamilton wrote it.  I suppose you will also be scored.  If it were not for the Southern Patriot I believe the Mountaineer governed as it is now & nothing to counteract it, would not leave you a friend in Greenville.  Mr. Pickerell says it is an incendiary paper.  I am more provoked with Dr. Crook than anyone.  He priding himself on his patriotism when he is a selfish designing deceitful hypocrite, nothing but self interest has changed him.  I am sorry I spoke to him the other day.  I never will again, & as for being our Physician, he never enters this house again in that capacity, if I can help it.  He is a Traitor.

		Mr. Croft leaves tomorrow.  I saw him after church.  I forgot to tell him why you had not written to him.  He will be in Charleston before long.  If you choose you can write to him there.   I have given him some Prospectus� to distribute.  I rode with Mr. Croft over to Mamma�s in his carri[a]ge.  He was at Miss Lewis wedding.  He says only about 30 were at it.  Mr. Campbell has rented his house, so he says.  Genl Thompsons wife he told me was neither rich or handsome, that he married her because he wants a family, that his children are outrageous, that Genl Thompson is coming here in January, that he chooses to he can be happy, & if he is not loyal & faithful, her family will take it up.  I hope it is not true that Genl Thompson is to be here in January.  He will ruin the paper.  There never was a man so disliked & thought so dishonourable, & I am truly sorry he is not your enemy as he used to be.  You then flourished, but leagued with him, you will fall with him.  

		Miss Drayton says Jenny Lind is to be in Charleston about the 19th.  That will be about Thursday.  Do you not wish to go to town to & hear her.  If I had known it, I would have proposed going down in the carri[a]ge to meet you in Columbia, & gone on with you to Charleston to hear her sing.  Mrs. Erwin Jones I hear is going down, will meet Mr. Jones in Columbia & go with him to Charleston to hear Jenny Lind,  They have money enough to do anything.  Do not speak of this to Mr. Jones.  I do not wish him to know that I think of her or mention her name for I despise her, & think her as malevolent & bad as ever be.  They are well matched.  Mr. Arthur has some as bad Christians in his church, as you can find anywhere, some who if they do not commit murder, are murderers in heart.

		Scott all today has been lying down.  He eats & drinks  but is too weak to stand well.  The stable is so small he hurts himself when he gets up, strikes against the stable.  You made a great mistake in hav[ing]  so little room for the horses.  I believe that is one reason they are lame & sick so constantly.  They did better in the old sable which was larger.

		You must not forget to buy the few things I have mentioned.  1 dollars worth of Hops, or fewer if you cannot bring so large a bundle.  Some Clover & Blue grass seed for Mamma, a bottle of Otto of Rose for Ann, 50 cts.  You got it at the confectioners I think.  Try & find my bundle that I have told you was to be sent to the Depository.  I am sorry you have said nothing of the writing desks I begged you to inquire the prices of for Mamma.  I would like you to have given me an answer.  I have not looked in the last papers, so I do not know the last news from Columbia, who were run for Governor even.  I was afraid I would see you spoken of as I would not like.  I thought as the majority agreed with you in wishing a Southern Congress, that you though you differed somewhat would on the whole please them.  I expect now you are more coldly treated as Dr. Lieber is, you ought to get those few who do agree with you, to do more for the Southern Patriot than merely take one copy.  They ought to take a dozen & help you sustain it at the commencement when it will need the exertions of every friend.  They ought to tally around you, come to your support.  Your attached [Wife], E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received your letter today.  I am sorry to see how anxious you are to get home, for though I wish you to love home; still I like you to pass your time pleasantly away from it, & I am afraid your great anxiety to get from Columbia, shows you are not treated well by those around you.  I expect since you have made your speech, & declared your love for the Union, you are looked coldly upon as Dr. Lieber is.  Before they knew you went for a Southern Convention & in that they agreed with you, & were disposed to treat you as a friend, but now having declared your motive for going for it, �Love of the Union,� they find it just the reverse of the reason they go for it, to �Dissolve the Union,� so they look upon you as an alien, an enemy.  I have not read the papers since you made your speech, for fear I might see you spoken of in a way I did not like.  Today I was mostly looking in the Charleston Courier for the deaths & marriages, &�glanced at a paragraph containing your name & the expressions of your attachment to the Union.  I did not care to see what followed, so closed the paper immediately.  I am sorry you did not say in your letter today, anything about publishing your speech.  I am afraid the papers have refused to publish it.  If so it is a pity you made it, as you did not say half you wished & have been misrepresented in that half.  I am very glad the Senate has passed a resolution for a State Convention, & hope it will pass the house.  I would prefer they should Secede at once, this very moment let us have the Crisis now.  Until it comes,  the people will be kept in a constant state of excitement, so I wish it to come & be over.  How unlooked for these times are.  You had just got over the Stigma attached to you as a Union man, & now your position is worse than it was then. You have fewer to bear you company.  If it had not been for Col. Memminger interfering in Greenville, things there would have been more as they were during Nullification times.  There would not have been so many renegades as there are now.  His change gave the others courage to follow.  But I must now speak of what immediately concerns yourself.  Scott is still alive, & that is about as much as I can say.  He has entirely lost the use of his hind legs.  He has been laying down for several days.  When he eats & drinks he raises himself on his front legs.  Today Reuben said he seemed liv[e]lier than usual. & if he could be raised up, & supported by ropes, he would do better, so I bought a rope & they managed to raise him up, but he had no strength in his hinder parts, & dropped down again.  It is sad to think of such a fine horse, dying as he is.  I was at the Stable yesterday & heard him groaning.  I shed tears now when I think of it; how different his situation from when I used to see you mounted on him.  I beg you ride on Byron & he the finest & largest & strongest looking horse I ever saw, & I believe his death is owing to his superiority.  He was too fat, & noble to have been worked as he was, ploughing all summer in the hot sun.  A poor, mean, thin horse could have borne it, but Scott was not born to be treated in that way, worked lightly, he would have been well now.  About a week ago during the night I could hear him knocking himself against the Stable, but now he lays perfectly quiet, so every morning, I expect to hear he is dead.  I am afraid it is the journey to & from the Rail Road that has knocked him up so completely.  After telling you how sick Scott was, I thought of your own accord, you would be afraid the other horses would be injured, & propose coming back in the Stage.  I did not like to propose it to you, for fear after being so extravagant as I knew you had been, that you might not have funds.  So I asked Reuben while I was writing to you, if the other horses were well.  He said yes, there were well.  This morning Charles came in & told me that Byron was too lame almost to go to the river.  I went to the Stable & saw him walk, & his leg seemed very lame, & when he stood still he would hold it up, as if it hurt to touch the ground & when Reuben touched the soft part of his foot above the hoof, he would wince.  Mr. Cauble shod them yesterday, & he says Byrons lameness is owing to Mr. Westfields having made the shoes too small particularly at the back foot, & that has cramped the foot & lamed it.  You know Byron has been lame for a long time & it is very provoking that it should be owing to the Shoeing, so I have told Reuben to say nothing about it to Mr. Westfield, but not to go there again to have them shod.  This morning we waited anxiously to receive your letter to know what you would direct, & finding that you still said Reuben must go for you, Byron being entirely too lame to travel 100 miles almost.  I sent Reuben to Mr. Pecks to hire a horse to put with Selim, for Selim is perfectly well, & he has hired one at 50 cts a day, & will set off Thursday morning, & meet you at Fulkes Saturday morning.  Queen Mary in writing to William� is very anxious he would approve of what she is doing. So in the same way I am anxious you should approve of my acts, but I am not in much fear of you as she is of him, & she had�too loving in her expressions, when you recollect she had a rival.

		I am sorry Willie & Frank have been so much in your way, another time you will carry only one, or carry me instead, & think you had better make it a rule, always when you go to Columbia to carry me, & what I prevent your spending extravagantly, can pay my board.

		I am very glad to tell you that I today received a letter from Aunt Mary McCall in which she says she has sent my Sacks or�to Columbia to you, by William Johnston, son of Mr. Andrew Johnston, a student in Columbia College.  She wrote Friday & said Mr. Johnston was to go to Columbia that day.  You wrote Friday & yet you do not mention having received the package so I feel quite uneasy.  It was directed to you at Maybins Hotel.  I suppose it will be sent to the bar to you, but if it is not, you must find out through Prof. Leiber or Williams where Mr. William Johnston is & ascertain from him what he has done with the bundle.  You must not leave Columbia without it.  Aunt Mary had it made after one a cousin of hers had just brought from Europe.  It cost $10.25 cts, & I have made independent of you, since you were away 8 & 9 dollars, almost enough to pay for it.  The 15 dollars you left me is barely enough for household expenses.  I wish you to live well after you return for a while at least, so I have bought 6 Turkeys, 5 ducks & plenty of Eggs.  Christmas I have invited Mamma & Susan�s families to dine with us, so you may tell them all the news.  New Years day Susan says we must dine there.  Today Mrs. Fields bought some very nice Socks 25 cts a pr & as you had only 3 pr, I bought 3 pr from her for you.  I paid Mr. Paynes bill $1.70 cts.  I bought 3 pounds of tea all Pinckney Mr. Bee has left.  I bought 150 worth of Candles yesterday; so in all these ways the 15 dollars has gone, & I was obliged to borrow 1 dollar from Mamma to add to 9 I have to enclose to Aunt Mary McCall, & for the remainder of this week I intend to spend nothing at all.

		  I will have some provisions wo� & send by Reuben for you to eat coming up; some cakes for the children & some bread & meat; & apples.  I wish you had sent the tin box back in the carriage to hold it.

		Yesterday Mary came in from the Portico & said to me Dr. Crooks asks if Fanny had ever been vaxinated.  I thought he was very officious, & I said no, & I do not wish her either.  About an hour after he made his appearance at the door & came in & asked me the same question & I asked him, if it ought to be done.  He said yes, the Small pox was at Hendersonville, & Mrs. Clayton had died of it.  Her husband had brought the infection in his goods from Hamburg & in all probability it would come here & everybody ought to be vaccinated, myself included.  I asked him where he got the matter from.  He said it was some he had had two or three years & vaccinated about 200 persons with it, & out of that number only one had taken & he kept the scab of that one.  I thought it must be very poor matter indeed to have effect in one case out of 200, & besides it was very officious in him to be prescribing unasked as if of a matter of course he was always to be one Physician so I did not encourage him to vaccinate Fanny.  He asked her if she would be frightened, & she said yes; & he said fright prevented its taking, & he would go over to Mrs. Hokes & vaccinate Sally Hoke, & if that took use matter from her sore; so he went off.  I told Mamma to ask Dr. Earle, if all to be vaccinated, & if so he can do it.  Dr. Crooks before did it so badly he made your arm so sore I was afraid it would have to be cut off, & after all I believe none he did took.  He is so deceitful & hypocritical & fawning, & pre� at the same time, that he is all openness & warmth & sincerity, that I have a perfect contempt for him.

		Mrs. Michael Hoke is at Mrs. Hokes, & tonight Mrs. Hoke asked me to take a sociable cup of Tea   with her.  I asked the servant who was going, & as soon as she mentioned Dr. Crooks name, I determined I would not go, so said I did not think I would be able to; & this afternoon I sent word I expected to be particularly engaged at home.  My engagement is writing to you, which I prefer to being in Dr. Crooks company, where I would be obliged to play the hypocrite, & listen to his hypocritical patriotism.  Mrs. Dr. Williams came to see me this afternoon.  She says Hetty D�Oyley went to see her Mother the day Anna Williams child died.  She thinks they will be reconciled now.  The little girl was 8 years old.

		Anna is now preparing for the Examination which takes place next Friday, so you will not be here.  I have been hearing Anna her lessons, to see if she knew them well enough so I would not be afraid to be present when she is examined.  This afternoon she said 20 pages in the Scholars companion which is a hard kind of Spelling with meaning, where there are two of every word that is pronounced alike.  Yet I felt difficulty, & with different meanings & she hardly missed a word, & sometimes would say a column herself, without my calling out the words she has such a good memory.  I have heard all she has been learning in History, & to every question, she gives an answer that does very well.  I am going on to hear her Geography & her other studies & if she does as well, I can go with confidence to the examination.  The Music is to be at night.  This winter will be so cold for Anna to practice in the Drawing room without fire, I think she may as well stop with her Music until the warm weather comes again.  I will make her practice what she has learnt, w[hich] she may not forget.  Both Fanny & herself long to see you.  Fanny says �Pa stays too long.�  Anna says you promised her a book.  If you choose to, you may buy her a simple book costing not much, or give one of Willie�s to her.  Write her name in it.  Tell Frank his cousin Susan Hayne has sent him a very pretty book called �Simple Ballads.�  Tell Willie I have not seen H� yet, & I expect H� has not seen the outside of the Stable.  I have neglected to tell you that one night the Calf of the white faced Cow was gored so Reuben thinks, by the Cow; that it died in consequence, but the Cow still gives Milk, & that the old Cow that for a while was left at the Farm with her Calf gives Milk now too, so when the Cow with the young Calf is milked, which will be next Tuesday, we will have the Milk of four Cows.  Some of them this winter you can dispose of.  Perhaps you can winter them at Mr. Fosters,  if not sell some.

		I will stop now it is late & finish tomorrow.  You must write me so I can hear twice more, Thursday & Saturday.  A letter came today from a Mr. Brown a merchant in Marion Alabama enclosing a note against Mr. Sam Town[e]s for 53 dollars, due for goods he had bought for himself & family.  Mrs. S. Town[e]s once told me the dearest friend she had, was in the Lunatic asylum in Columbia, & that when you went there, she would like you to go & see her & inquire about her.  I have forgotten her name.  I think she was originally from Spartanburg.  Mrs. Town[e]s became intimate with her in Alabama.  Wednesday morning Scott is still the same.   Reuben is going to set off this afternoon for you; for the journey is too long for two days, particularly if you come back in 2 days.  They must have a while to rest at Fulkes.  He will take Selim & Mr. Pecks horse.  It is strange Genl Thompson does not mention his bride.  Mr. Luther heard he bought her 2 rings in Charleston 1000 dollars apeice.  If so he was very foolish & his children ought to be angry.  I do hope in your next letter you will tell me, you have received my package, & not keep me in such suspense.  Buy the hops, a bottle of Otto of Rose for Ann.  I believe that is all; except tell Willie to buy a toy for Vardry & the blue grass & Clover seed for Mamma.  I wish you a pleasant journey.  I will expect you Sunday night, or sometime Monday.  Then you will have a long time to stay at home, & get tired of it, & scold your wife, & fret at the children.  I hope after awhile all the excitement will pass away, but I do hope the politicians will bring things to a crisis at once.  I wish them to secede.  Until they do, they will use the excitement for their own interest.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

		Reuben will start before long for you.  I will write a few lines by him.  So you will hear often enough from me.  I have just been to the Stable to see Byron.  He is very lame & can hardly walk.   I am afraid Reuben is a bad hostler.  We have such bad luck with our horses.  Byron will stay in the Stable & have a long rest, so I hope in time will be well.  Scott is languishing.  I wonder he lives so long.  We all long for you to come back, but you must not expect everything to be perfectly happy at home, for I assure you the servants, some of them are the�of my life.  Minerva�s impertinence is beyond endurance, & if it were not for her situation, I would have sent her over to Mr. Massey�s to stay, while you were away, & get some of his whippings.  This very moment she has been disobedient.  I sent her Flour this morning to make into biscuits to send to you, & she has not commenced them yet, & the meat is not even cooked, so we are now only waiting on her.  I assure you I would rejoice to leave home as often as you do, & it is your leaving it so often, makes you value it.  If you were here constantly, you would get tired of it.  So I am glad sometimes you can leave it.  I wish you a pleasant journey home, & do hope the next news I hear, is that the State has seceded.  I want some of the braves to have an opportunity of proving their valor.  They will then be cooled a little.  The weather is quite cold.  I suppose Mr. Duncan will leave Friday before the Legislature adjourns.  The next time you must go & come in the Stage.  It will in the end be the most economical.  It is strange Mr. Elford stays so long at the North.  I will now conclude.  This is my last letter.  Your attached wife, E.F.P.

[Greenville]

My dear husband
            
		I will add some more to my letter tonight as I have some more to tell you.  I went to church morning & afternoon, carried Anna this morning, & Mamma this afternoon.  Mr. Arthur did not have service Fast Day, so this morning gave us a sermon suitable for the times.  It was a very good sermon.  He attributed our troubles to national sins, which sins are a love of wealth, pride & self conceit, Infidelity, the wrong manner in which the press is conducted, influenced by prejudice & passion, & said the fanatics at the North, & the exasperation at the South went too far, & we must join in praying the evils to be averted , which would come, if our Union were�& evil war come upon us.  Altogether it was a very good sermon & would give offence to no one.  Mr. Campbell & Miss Lewis are to be married Thursday night, the 12th inst.

		Mr. Croft paid me a visit this afternoon after church.  He goes in a week.  He will take some of your prospectuses & try & get subscribers.  Mr. Pickerell today sent for some to send to Anderson.  I sent him four.  I sent him Mr. Poinsetts peice to read.  He said I must send it wherever I thought it would do good.  I sent it to Mamma; she likes it very much.

		Mr. Luther McBee & Alexander returned yesterday.  Mr. Luther called here while I was at church this afternoon, & told Anna would Frank would come home tonight with Mr. �, but you had written that he was not coming, so I do not expect him.  You must tell Willie to eat at ? past 1 with Frank, as well as at 4, for it is too long to fast, from breakfast until 4, & it will make Willie sick & he will grow thin.  I went to see Susan before church this afternoon.  Her baby is�ailing.  She says Mr. Luther says, you are almost the only true man in the State.  He said it was ridiculous to listen to Mr. Memmingers boasts of what he would do rather than submit & recollect how tamely he bore Genl Thompsons lie.  Mr. Luther dines at Aunt Eliza�s, & says Eliza & Sue are violent on Politics., that they took the first chance of saying they are for Disunion.  They would not submit to their oppressors, so he took the first chance of leaving.  Uncle Arthur called to see him, & invited him to dine, & he liked Uncle Arthurs wife.  He did not go to see Aunt Turnbull or Aunt Haynes.  His feet he said hurt him, & Paul passed him & Alexander in the street without speaking, but afterwards left his card.  That was all they saw of him, & Mr. Henry Peronneau met Mr. Luther in the street, & very�said he would be glad if he would call & see him.  Aunt Eliza sent up some little presents to the children, Bible words for Willie, a book for Frank & Fanny, some little flower pots for Anna, & a peice of ribbon for myself.  If you go to town the only persons I wish you to go & see are Aunt Anna Turnbull & my Aunt McCall.  They are my Fathers relations, & I love them.  He Mamma says was different in politics from her mothers, which was certainly in his favour.  Our family woke upon all  on the opposite side as Traitors.  I hope never mind when you see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor, that you will not 	speak to them.  Mr. Taylor has often avoided speaking to you.  Mr. Croft says Miss B� wrote word that every child in Charleston even, was a Politician.  I hope that all read Mr. Poinsetts letter.  He certainly put the State in a most �tous light, & explained California better than I have heard it yet,  & though if Genl Taylor as you thought interfered in forming it into a State, still he says, that would have made no difference.  The people would have done the same.

		When you make your speech study it well beforehand & make a good one.  Say nothing that must be borne out.  I would be very glad if your resolutions are adopted but to me it seems no use to have a Southern Convention, for the other States are satisfied, so why should there be one.  But you know best; I mention my ideas only, & I wish you to be right in all you propose.

		Mr. Croft says Genl Thompson is a compound of evil.  He said there was no confidence to be placed in him, & his friends had found it out, & therefore given him up.  He says his wife was neither handsome or rich.  I am so sorry Genl Thompson has anything to do with the paper, that he subscribed for it.  It can never get along with him as a Stockholder.  You must buy him out as soon as possible.  He will be a dead weight to the paper, & you must never allow him to write for it.  It was most unfortunate you asking him to join.  

		Last night I did not send to the office after the Augusta Mail came, so I do not know what came for you.  The weather turned very cold last night, & it continues so.  I hope tomorrow the hogs will be killed.  

		Mr. Luther bought for Susan a beautiful Carpet for her Dining room & oil Cloth for her Stair case & Entry.  Elizabeth Jones chose them.  I would much rather have such things than all the books you buy.  I would much rather have a Carpet to keep my chamber warm & comfortable, & one for
 The little Dining room which is in rags; but you will buy books, & then there is no money left for anything else.  You are not satisfied with a few, but if you begin there is no end to them.  I wish I had half the money you have spent in books, , & you have so many expenses to meet, & you do not prepare for them.  If you will spend the money, then always carry the whole of us to Columbia with you & spend your money in paying our board.

		I was sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.  I know you would have spent a pleasant day, & now he will not ask you again.  

		You will be tired of my letter, but it is a relief to me to write & now I am going upstairs to read to Mary.  Good night.  Young Barnwell who graduated is engaged already to a Miss Ball, a pious young ledy, attending his fathers church.  

Monday 8 oclock.  I will not finish, & only say once more, that I will be very thankful if your resolution for a Southern Convention is adopted, for the State will have something, & that is the safest mode of�, but I doubt if they will be adopted, but I hope it will.  

		Reuben has gone for a load of wood, & I hope by the time he returns Charles will be here to kill the hogs for it is very cold.  Charles is at Mr. Deans, & I am afraid from his not coming in, he is killing hogs for him instead, which will be very provoking.  I have sent Lindy to bring him in.  My pen needs mending.  I can hardly write.  My next shall be shorter & neater.  Lindy has just come back.  She met Charles coming in, so the hogs will be killed today.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

My dear husband 

		Since I sealed my letter an event has occurred, which I must inform you of.  This morning about 4 oclock I was awoke[n] by a wrapping at the back door, & Edward came to say his Mother was sick, & wanted Mom Phillis.  She must be sent for.  She had not expected to be confined until after Christmas, & she fell back in her chair yesterday, which I suppose must have caused her to be sick prematurely, so I was dreading the dangerous time she would have.  Not half an hour after I sent Lindy to know she was, & she said Mom Phillis was there, & the baby too, & that the baby had been born before Mom Phillis came.  May who I had sent to stay with Elisa, says she went down in the kitchen to get a longer candle, & while there the baby was born.  Only Charles was in the room with her, so I suppose he acted the part of Midwife.  The baby is very small, which I suppose is the reason she had so good a time, & weakly sickly persons always suffer up, than the healthy & strong.  So I am very glad & thankful it is safely over with her.  It is a boy, so it will be Fanny�s waiting man.

		I forgot to tell you, that you must write letters to as many persons here as you possibly can.  I think Mr. Nicol would be glad to hear from you; write to Mr. Hoke, Mr. Croft, old Mr. McBee & other persons in the village & county.  Col. Jones goes to Columbia today, but I send my letter by Mail, as you once told me always to, as they were not delivered to you so soon.

		No letters except those two I mentioned the contents to you have come; 3 pages from Philadelphia begging you to exchange with them came yesterday.  When you are Editor I hope you will receive books & periodicals in abundance.  Mr. Burt�s order to have the Prospectus published for what he was to be paid, was not forgotten, strange the workmen forgot to publish the explanation, but not the Prospectus, & I expect he has forgotten it to this day.  Do you remember.  I will never forgive you, if you vote for Mr. Burt, or Mr. Memminger, or Mr. Rhett for I suppose someone besides Mr. Hammond will oppose Mr. Rhett.  Poor man whenever Mr. Hammond comes forward before the public, his bad conduct is mentioned.  It would be well if all wickedness brought its punishment, as his has done.  I expect he will be afraid to run, for fear of developments.  It is a gloomy day, again, but not raining at this moment.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s sent to ask me to go & see her, but I am not going, on account of Mr. Sam Town[e]s, who has acted dishonorably to you,  I sent Mr. O�Hanlon�s letter & Mr. Petigru�s to Mr. Arthur to read.  He told me he would be glad to see them.  I hope he read[s] them to Mr. Campbell.  I wish my dear husband you could be elected President of the College or Bank, or have some honorable office bestowed on you, as Law is getting scarce.  Write me who you think will be elected Solicitor.  I do hope Mr. Young will; even Mr. Duncan ought to vote for him. after such an�ful conduct in the Greenville Candidate.  In haste, E.F.P.

Wednesday morning, 9 April [1851]
Greenville

My dear Aunt

		Your letter to Maj. Perry enclosing mine to you arrived yesterday, & as he will [be] busy all this week Court & not be able to answer it immediately, I feel compelled to do so.  My love for him almost prompts me to remain silent & bear all the blame that has fallen on me & which though the weaker vessel I would gladly sustain for his sake; for there is no sacrifice for me to make to secure his happiness & the good opinion of others for him; but as Mr. Peronneau in his letter to Mamma said, it was sincere affection alone, that induced him  to notice what otherwise he would not, so the same feeling prompts me to place myself in a correct position before you.  Maj. Perry is at this moment in Court pleading for the life of a poor man.  I at the same time am pleading his cause & mine, & am thankful it is a more just one than he is engaged in.  It is a little singular that a discourteous act shown toward us, should be turned against us, & we made the party who has offended.  That returning a paper is a want of courtesy & not an ordinary thing, is proved by the paper not having been returned by any of the Disunionists to whom it was sent, on whom Maj. Perry had any claim, except my two cousins.  All with their exceptions have kept it; nrt do I see why they should not for what contamination is there in receiving & even reading a paper edited by a sensible, sincere & disinterested Party, one who is universally esteemed to be prompted by love of his country & acting conscientiously for her best interests, & who time will show whether he is not more correct in his views than those who op[p]ose him.  Such a paper would be read with profit, & when published by a connexion, & in a place where those dear to you live, & giving information of a most flourishing & interesting part of the State.  It seems strange when such a paper should be turned away as if it was contamination to look at it.  A paper edited by Wm Ed or any of my relations or friends in whom I felt an interest, never mind how it differed with me in Politics; I would keep out of courtesy if sent to me if from no other motive, & think I would read it with interest, & perhaps have my own views enlightened by it.  As what we look upon as a want of courtesy we find was not meant as such we are willing to forget & forgive.  I do not suppose Mr. Peronneau told Wm Henry to return the paper, but I supposed that as Wm Henry knew the paper was meant for his Father, he of course showed it to him, & told him how he intended to dispose of it, & received his Fathers�.  I tried to excuse this act to Maj. Perry, instead of irritating him, & he told me it was an act of discourtesy.  It was very strange a thing meant as a compliment, should not be taken as such.  I will now correct a mistake under which both yourself & Mr. Isaac Hayne are labouring.  You think I wrote my letter in a state of irritation caused by the attack in the Mercury on my husband, so far from it, I did not know of the peice until I was about closing my letter.  I only knew of the two slights I mentioned ; was not aware that a much greater one was even then on the way.  The Mercury need not have been�.; even if I intercepted it as supposed; for there are many Mercury�s taken here, so my husband would be sure to have seen it, & he takes it himself now.  He takes papers of both parties.  He wishes to see both sides, that his mind may be enlightened, & he be able to judge correctly, & come to right conclusions, which he could not if he confined himself to only one side of the question.  My letter need not have been returned with the idea that I was acting in an underhand manner.  For fear that I might be making the matter of too much importance I asked my husband first, if he had any objections to my writing on the subject, & he said none at all, & to be certain I had written nothing  he disapproved of, I gave it to him to read before I sealed it, & he approved of it entirely.  I hope next week he will write to you & tell you this himself, for he does not regard the case as at all difficult, or treat with the least severity, the �ullation of his Wifes feelings, & how can he, when those feelings originated from his own.  I intend however to submit this letter to him, so when you receive it you will know that he has endorsed it.  It would be a matter of pain to me, to write one line that he disapproved. To enable you to judge correctly, I will have to go as far back as your last letter to Mamma.  I read it with pleasure, & said to Maj. Perry, Aunt Eliza has sent me a kind message & begged me to write & speaks well of you.  I hardly think she knows Cousin Isaac sent back the paper.  I am sure she would not have approved of it, so I believe I will write to her & if you have no objection I will mention how hurt we have been.  He said he had none at all, so a few days after I wrote, he came in while I was writing, & I told him to whom I was writing.  He went to his Office & to my surprise returned in a very short time with a newspaper in his hand & indignation expressed in his countenance.  The Mail had just arrived & I saw he had received something that displeased him.  He said just see what an insolent peice Col. Isaac Hayne has written in reply to that incidental remark of mine about him in the Patriot, & he has sent it to me himself.  I ought to send it back to him, but that would be making it of too much importance.  I said is the peice disrespectful to you.  He said he calls the Greenville paper instead of the Southern Patriot, & instead of the Citizens of Greenville, says the Greenville people.  It is written in a sneering tone throughout, & does not contradict once the assertion I made that he was opposed to secession, but quotes long extracts from old speeches of Judge Cheves & others proving they hate the Union, which I knew before, & begs to have it published in the Southern Patriot, but of course I will not do that.  I gleaned over the peice & saw it very disrespectful, as the manner in which he asks why were not Mr. Memmingers opinions mentioned, & hinting that his could not be misrepresented as the others were, as the Greenville people had heard him themselves, so I gave the paper back & said I do not care to read it.  I am about closing Aunt Eliza�s letter.  I have no room to mention this peice & have no time to write another letter, as I wish you to read this before you go to Anderson tomorrow, so he took the paper back to his Office & I finished in a few moments my letter.  After I had done I began to think of the peice, & I was so afraid Maj. Perry would answer it & express his indignant feelings, & trouble would come, that I thought the best plan would be to treat the Mercury after the fashion the Southern Patriot had been treated.  As the views we did not concur in, & sent by me with my compliments it would not be making it a matter of too much importance or give offence either, so I sent Willie to the Office to tell his Papa to send me the paper & not reply to it in any way.  He sent me the paper & said he would not reply to it.  I sealed the paper up & put my compliments on it to show I sent it back & there the matter would rest as I hoped.  When Maj. Perry came home he asked me what I had done with the paper, I told him, & he said very well I have another at my Office if I need it.  I then gave him my letter to read & he approved it.  The next morning early he went to the Office & returned in a few minutes & asked me for the Mercury, that the one he had at his office Mr. Elford had taken away & as he did not intend to publish Col. Haynes peice in the Patriot, it would be necessary to make a few remarks about it.  I gave it to him & he afterwards returned it to me & he drew his pen across my writing to prevent he said my being indicted  for writing on a newspaper.  He that day went to Anderson, & the next day I sent the letter & paper by the same Mail.  I was sorry to send them together knowing it would be thought the letter was the consequence of the paper, but I was loth to keep the paper until the next Mail so despatched them.  When Maj. Perry returned from Anderson, he said the Lawyers & Members of the Legislature & other who were in Columbia last winter told him that it was generally understood there that Col. Hayne was opposed to Secession.  His peice was considered an evasion of the question & Mr. Burt the Editor of the Disunion paper in Pendleton said he felt inclined to give him a�himself, but as it might be the means of sending him  back to the position he first occupied he would not, for he was glad for him to come over to Secession if possible as the party was getting so weak, the whole State seemed to be changing.  I have heard also that Mr. Filmore�s Organ had published the peice & claims Col. Haynes as a Union man.  So Maj. Perry was certainly not far from wrong in the assertion he made, & none of the other gentlemen thought proper to contradict it, & if they had it would [have] been in a different tone, for they would in reality have been actuated by kind feelings & former personal relations.  So far from believing you would approve of the peice , Mamma told me I ought to send it to you to show you how disrespectful it was, & she has been constantly urging me to send you the paper, knowing as she said  you would read with interest anything Maj. Perry wrote, so little can we�of the feelings of each other.  Until you mentioned it I had no idea Wm Ed took the Mountaineer, & if he has taken it for months past, I would know you could have retained your high opinion of Maj. Perry, for until lately, ever since the Memminger meeting, it has been filled up with abuse & misstatements of Maj. Perry.  So the people at last said they were tired of the same subject, & reading the abuse heaped on one man, & many at the last Election voted for him, who never had before  because they said the Mountaineer was so unjust to him.  As you agree with that paper in principle, of course you believe all that is in it, so I am surprised you have a good opinion of one it has so misrepresented.  I am indeed astonished at Wm Ed selecting that paper & supporting it.  Maj. Perry has not admitted it into his house since the Memminger meeting.  It was supposed when he commenced his paper, he would return all the malice & abuse that had been heaped on him, but he has treated them with silent contempt, & though they felt at first relieved to escape what they were dreading, they feel now mortified at no notice being taken of them, & are compelled to be silent themselves.  It is only to know the Editors of the two papers to decide which is most worthy of patronage.  In the Southern Patriot next week there will be extracts from  25 letters from different parts of the Country showing the state of public feeling, some of them from distinguished men.  This gives a more correct idea than anything an Editor can say.  I have been led into a controversy very much against my will.  I am me, for I am no Politician, & do not pretend or wish to be one.  From hearing the subject discussed every day by my husband & others, I do understand the state of parties, & do feel very much interested on the subject, & was very anxious a paper should be established in Greenville advocating views which seemed to me correct, but I trust I am liberal to those who differ from the one I most honor.  I am sure he is, & many think he is not as staunch for the Union as he ought to be, that he speaks of the rights of the South too strongly  & ought to go for the Union above everything, but he pursues the course that he thinks will ensure justice to the South & the stability of the Union also.  

		I have now expressed the motives under which I acted, as they were sanctioned by one superior in wisdom to myself.  I hope now I will be better understood, than I have been, & I feel relieved that what by most here was considered discourteous  & uncalled for, was not looked upon in that light by those from whom the acts proceeded & whom I have been accustomed to respect & love for myself & relations alone even if a stranger to me & regarded in a sacred light & have always tried to serve.

My dear Husband
        
		Again I have to write to you, & have nothing of importance to tell you, except that I received a letter from Aunt Mary McCall last night, & she says she received the Check for 70 dollars safely presented it to the bank & obtained the money.  Last night Willie went to the Post Office & brought the papers & two letters for the Southern Patriot, but I thought I ought not to open them, so do not know what they contained.  I sent them this morning to Mr. Elford with your Editorial.  

		The weather is still gloomy & cold, no sunshine today.  

		I hope you have before this reached Columbia safely & have pleasanter weather than we have here.  Reuben went to Mr. Suddeth�s, but did not see him.  The servant he saw seemed to think Mr. Suddeth did not intend to take the Cows.  If he does not come & look at them, I will send them to Mr. Fosters.

		Willie & Frank are at school.  Anna has just come home to get her dinner.

		I have to write to Aunt Mary for Susan, so can write you but a short letter.

		Hext is asleep.  The colds generally are better.  I have told the children, whichever behaves the best I will tell you to bring a present to.

		I have not as much to write about as I will have when I hear from you, so I will now close by assuring you, we speak & think of you constantly.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		It is raining today.  We indeed have unpleasant weather,  I hope it is more cheerful where you are.

		Mr. Suddeth has not been to look at the Cows, so the first good day Reuben will carry them off.

		The Carpet came yesterday.  I think it a beautiful one, & the Rug very pretty, & matches the Carpet exactly.  I will make up the carpets as soon as I can, but the days are so short, by the time the house is fixed, the day is gone.  It will take me a long time to do it.  I never had so much to do as I have now.  Your Shirts have taken so long to make, that all the other work has been neglected, & I now feel as if I never can get through particularly as Elisa helps so little, but I will not fill up my letters with complaints.  I will only add that yesterday I got warm dresses for Anna, Hext & myself, & though very reasonable only 20 cts a yd still they amounted to nearly 8 dollars & have made such an inroad in my purse.  I would not be surprised if my funds failed too soon.  If so, I will have to draw on you & hope you will not be displeased.  You have no idea how expensive	the clothes a Lady & 5 children amount to, dressed in the most economical manner & without many necessary comforts for FlannelI have not known for years.  I have bought myself two cheap dresses to wear at home the whole winter & part of the Spring.  My other dresses are not suitable for home as they are Silk or too light, & would get ruined immediately.  

		Anna wrote a long letter to Aunt Mary Hayne last night.  She has just come home from school, & is practicing on the Piano.  Only 3 girls at school, so she came home early.  Willie & Frank have not come yet.  The umbrella�s are so broken, Willie was to stop at Mr. Nicols & buy a new one.  Mr. Irwin told Frank he thought he had gone to Columbia.  Perhaps he sent in his bill from that thought, that he might get his money before Frank left, & not seem so unreasonable as to send in an account afterwards for schooling which he had not given.

		Mary seems pretty well now, & I am thankful for we live in confusion when she is sick.  Minerva & herself are our most useful servants, & we miss more when they are sick.  All of our colds are better.  I hope yours is.  I long to hear from you.  I am glad you will not be here in the confusion of taking up & putting down Carpets.  You will enjoy only the comfort of them.

		Mary says the Bull that has come back, is ours.  I have not been out since you left & have seen no one, so have no news to tell you.  I hope to see the Southern Patriot tonight.  I think I am its youngest admirer, perhaps because I was the originator of it.  

		I have now to write two letters to Aunt Mary McCall & Aunt Harriet McCall.  I am glad the 73 dollars for the carpet she received safely.   

		Minerva is out of bed now & better.  John came in yesterday.  Charles is still there.  Reuben hauled Mrs. Cauble two loads of wood yesterday.  Today he burned the chimneys.  Minerva is making some Cake & Lindy helping her.  Elisa is making Willie a Jacket.  Sarah is cleaning the knives, & Fanny helping her.  Charlotte is holding Hext & trying to get him to sleep.  Anna is practicing, & I have just finished my letter to my dear husband.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I am very busy making up the Carpet, & intended Willie should write to you today, but he had not returned from school yet, & I am afraid would not write in time for the Mail, so I am writing in a great hurry you may be sure.

		I was glad to see by the Southern Patriot last night that you had arrived safely, Rail road accidents occurring so frequently made me uneasy until I heard.  In your letters to me mention all the compliments paid you.  You are my hero, & I wish to hear a great deal about yourself.

		A letter came to you from old Mr. Reese last night.  He was at Anderson C.H. on his way to Georgia, leaving this State forever, & wrote you a kind gratifying letter.  I sent it to Mr. Elford to
Publish.  Mr. Elford sent word he would leave Monday morning.  

		I see in the paper a notice that Judge Wardlaw should be appointed President of the College.  If he is, I hope you will receive your reward by taking his place on the Bench.  I am waiting anxiously for you to be rewarded in some form or other.  You have saved the State [&] are entitled to the highest honors in the gift of the State.

		 Mrs. Collins came here Monday to know if her husband could rent your farm.  Says Mr. Canon & Mr. Luther McBee know them well.  She has a large family of children the eldest a daughter of 13 years old so only the Father would work on the Farm.  They have a child born without legs & only one arm, which would be a dreadful sight to look at when we went to the Farm.  She said she would raise chickens attend Cows & do anything in that way.  She was so anxious. I promised to write to you, & she was to come next week to hear your answer, so you must write me something in answer, but you had better not engage to anyone until you come back & consider well whether you will rent at all.

		We are all better of our colds.  Hext is now crying to be nursed so I will stop to attend to him & then go on with the Carpet.  

		I hope to hear from you tonight  & every night but you must write only when perfectly convenient.  Do not put aside business to write to me.  Willie Has bought himself a knife, so says you need not buy him any.  Believe me as Ever, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I was really disappointed I did not hear from you last night, & uneasy as I cannot conceive why you did not write, for Monday night you would have spared a few moments to me.  This is the fifth day since you left, & I have not received one letter, & this is the fifth I have written to you.  Mr. Elford did not hear either, which makes me more uneasy.  I hope I will hear tonight.

		An extra of the Southern Patriot was issued today, containing the Governor�s Message.  I see he still thinks Secession the rightful remedy.  I hope there�a division still, will make your independence conspicuous.  I was afraid you would be lost sight of in the mingling of parties, but I hope you will in the end be rewarded, though I am afraid the ambitious & aspiring will outstrip you.

		I have just finished putting down the carpet.  It looks quite handsome.  I am afraid it will be injured before you return.  It makes the rest of the house look shabby.  I have not made the carpet for the little room yet.  Aunt Mary sent 2 peices of binding more than was necessary, & the thread we paid 50 cts for never came, so 2 dollars we might have saved, was spent.

		Charles has staid at home today for the first time.  Mamma no longer needs him.  He is now spading the garden, Reuben is hauling wood.  Tomorrow I will tell him to drive off the Cows.  He ought to have done it today.   The weather is now good, & much warmer & pleasanter than it has been.  Today Willie & Frank go to school the last time for 4 weeks.  Anna will not have holiday yet for 2 weeks to come.

		Mamma is better, but we are all so busy we have not been able to see each other.  I have no news to tell you, as I have not been out, & have seen no one.  

		We are all pretty well.  Willie will write to you now [that] he has holiday.

		Charles says Burrill Ferguson who has only a Wife & two children would like to rent your Farm & that he would make a good crop for you [&] would cultivate your swamp land, that he would do better than Mr. Collins, who has so many children.  I think the dreadful sight of the unfortunate child would be objection enough to them.

		I must now close, & you scarcely deserve this letter but I return you�for evil.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		Anna wrote to you yesterday.  I was very busy making up the little room carpet, & I am happy to say, little Carpets are made, & put down, & the two rooms look very neat, but I am afraid, before you see them, the dirty feet of so many servants & children will have ruined them.  The old Carpet is put down in my room, & I have moved the set of Drawers & Basin stand from the large room into ours, & the Curtains, for we are entitled to the best in the house, you especially, who works hard & makes all the money, so I thought I would have a very nice room ready for you on your return, & I assure you it looks so nice & comfortable, you will be very much pleased with it, & the carpet makes it so much warmer.

		I was disappointed again last night in not hearing from you.  I hope you were busy, or the Postmaster as usual careless.  Mr. Elford did not hear either.  I thought you were to write to the Patriot every Mail.  You ought to write longer letters for the paper, & I am disappointed at their being so short.  Perhaps you have not had much to write about yet.

		I hope you interceded for Mrs. Hughes, after all the trouble she has taken to go so far.  She deserves to succeed in getting her son pardoned, so for her sake at least I hope the Governor will show mercy to him, & hope he will be merciful to all for whom you carried petitions.

		I am glad Mr. Isaac Hayne & yourself have met & spoken; nothing more is necessary.  He & his sisters are very disagreeable, I think, & though Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor lived with us, & we were brought up in intimacy, I now regard them as Strangers.  They seem cold hearted & selfish.  I am glad your cold is better.  You must give yourself no uneasiness about us.  I write to you daily, in order to make you easy & satisfied.  I wish you to enjoy yourself & attend to your duties as a Legislator & Patriot.  I will attend to home & everything is going on well.

		Mr. Elford paid me a visit this morning.  He goes Monday morning in the Stage.  I will write by him.  He says Mr. Duncan & yourself are going to Charleston with him.  You must do as you please, but I think you had better go some other time, & not leave your Legislative duties now.  It will be an unnecessary expense, & when you go, there are many things I wish you to purchase which I cannot tell you now.  You had better go down in February during the Races.  You will then have been at home & wish for a change again.

		Aunt Mary McCall has sent 2 yds of Carpeting less than the room needs.  Mr. Elford looked at the Carpet & says he will buy it for me.  I will get him to buy a Straw carri[a]ge & chair for Hext, which I am very anxious for, & wrote to Aunt Mary to inquire the price., but I will get Mr. Elford who is so good a judge & has offered to buy anything.  To buy them for him the carri[a]ge will be 3 or 4 dollars, the chair 1 or 2.  I mention it to you, so that if Mr. Elford tells you, you need not be surprised.  I suppose you will have no objection to his getting them.  Hext needs both careri[a]ge & chair now.  Lindy hardly ever has time to hold him, & it is so much better for him to be drawn about, than held by � & Charlotte.

		You would stay so short a time in Charleston now only a day or two, that I think it is not worth the expense going down.  Some other time you can stay longer, & carry Willie & Frank with you.  If you were to stay any time now, you would be neglecting your duties.  Mr. Elford says someone asked him if you did not feel more at home in Columbia this winter than the last, & he said yes & that next winter you would still be more at home for the Legislature would be a new one, scarce one of the Members in it, that is now he says the Secessionists in their hearts thank you for getting them out of the scrape.  I think the Cooperationists are a cowardly set.  They have not the boldness to come out as Union men.  They cannot bear what you did.  I am sure you deserve to be rewarded., but not being ambitious. I am afraid you never will be.  You ought to try to advance yourself for the sake of your children.

		Young Powell brought Col. Picket�s history of Alabama, that he gave Uncle Arthur for Mamma, & Uncle Arthur gave Aunt Eliza to send, & a bundle of Shoes, Susan sent for, & a little worsted bonnet apeice for Hext & Susan.  I wrote to Aunt Martha to buy Hext one. & she sent it as a present, but it is not pretty, & does not fit him, is too small.

		I have been interrupted so that the dinner hour has arrived, & dinner is coming in, so I must soon close.

		I sat with Anna while she practiced today, the first time for a month or more.  I am too busy to go out.  

		I bought Reuben a pr of shoes yesterday.  He asked for them.  Mary & himself are quite well now, & Elisa as well as she ever is.

		The children are behaving pretty well.  Willie drove to the Farm today & Reuben brought home  a load of wood.  Willies cold is well; so is Franks.  We are all pretty well & hope you are too.  Yours as Ever, E.F.P.
