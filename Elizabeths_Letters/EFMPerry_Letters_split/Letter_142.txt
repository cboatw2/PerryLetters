Letter 142

Friday morning, 30 November 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

	I ought not to write to you today, for I have now written you three letters, & received not one from you.  I have always said if I was neglected by my husband, I would not bear it calmly & submissively, as some poor, weak spirited Wives do.  You will think now I am not putting my Theory into practice.  I assure you I only write because I am certain tonight I will hear, a most justifiable excuse.  You are always so attentive in writing, that when I do not hear, I am sure it is business prevents you, & I am always pleased you should have just as much business as possible to occupy you.  I mentioned in my last that Mamma, Susan, Ann & the children were to dine with me that day.  Mr. McBee I invited but he was busy assisting in the Hog killing at his fathers, so did not come.  We spent a pleasant day.  Yesterday after breakfast, I was surprised by a visit from Clarke & Harriet Perry.  They came to Eveline Fosters wedding.  They dined here.  I asked them to pass the night, but they said they had promised to return to Mr. Fosters, & were to leave for home this morning by the way of Mr. Hunts, where they would sleep tonight.  Clarke regretted you were not at home.  He walked to the Mill, & the Village & Harriet walked over the house, & I entertained her as well as I could.  I thought they were going to pass the night & ordered the carri[a]ge to carry her to ride, but they said they could not stay.  So I carried Mrs. Forbes to Mr. Colemans place.  Mr. Powell is painting the house Straw colour, & it looks much prettier than ours.  The colour of our house is entirely too deep.  I am longing for it to fade.  Eveline left for Abbeville yesterday.  She had a small wedding. Principally the family, & the persons Dr. Cox brought with him from Abbeville.  She is just 15, he about 21.  Miss Vance was married last night; only the connexions of the parties were invited.  Mrs. Dr. Williams says Mr. Dubose came here last summer in search of a Wife; at Mrs. Brooks he saw Miss Vance.  Miss Ann Anderson came to see me yesterday.  She says Mrs. Stuart the Wife of the Teacher of the Academy, is a very plane lady in appearance quite a contrast to her husband, & quiet in manners, that they have been married several years, & lost one child, that Mr. Stuart has taught in her brothers family. & was once private Tutor in the Rutledge family in Statesburg, & gave private lessons to young ladies, at the same time that he kept a school for boys.  Dr. Simons has five borders engaged to him & some scholars I am afraid his�will take, particularly from his saying he would be cheaper than any other.

	I gave you wrong information about your Hogs.  First I said they had killed only 5, & afterwards said they had killed all.  I misunderstood, Reuben says they killed 9, & left 4 which had been injured by fighting &c to be killed at a future time.  The weather still continues cold enough to be safe.  They are going on with the ploughing today.  It does seem a pity to put such fine horses in the plough.  You must get a Mule.  I have heard Mrs. Sam Earle was coming on with Mr. Earle to be with Dr. T� in her confinement.  

	Mamma paid a visit to Mrs. Rowland lately & heard the other side of the quarrel, & it really seems from Mrs. Rowlands representation that she is not at all to blame.  She says she is not as well off as persons think, & her son John left his property to her on that account, & on his death bed wished he had more to leave her; that at her death, she intended leaving it to his Sisters, but that Mr. Beattie & themselves made so much fuss about it,  that her son Tom & Mrs. Henry Earle begged her to give it up at once to them, & they would return her what she had given them; that she had given it up now, & was so straightened, she intended to sell her place, & move to another place she owned 20 miles in the Country, that she had worked hard to give her children a good education & a start in life, & this was her return, that�Speers she always liked, but Mrs. Speers would not let her give anything.  What she gave Mrs. Speers had settled on herself.  She said a good deal more, & cried bitterly, & said the ungrateful conduct of her children was the greatest affliction she had ever met with.

	Ann received by the last Mail a pleasant letter from Paul.  In it he says that he had that morning seen Alston Hayne, who had lately returned from Philadelphia, that Alston inquired particularly about us all, & had a high opinion of your abilities, & regretted your non election to Congress, (& which I will never cease to regret)[.]

	We are all well.  Anna & Frank are at school.  I think Frank finds it much pleasanter at Mr. Beads�, than he did at Dr. Simons school.  He had no dread of�now.  Fanny is playing about, & still talks about you, & Billy in Lumbia.  She is as�as ever & as interesting.  Since sleeping at Fanny Town[e]s & bringing her home to sleep with her, the very next day when she came from school, said Fanny Town[e]s had quarreled with her.  Anna had taken a tuck out of her dress, which made it quite long , & Fanny Town[e]s told her, her dress was too long.  Anna replied, that she dressed as her Mamma wished her, & so Fanny got miffed & left her seat at the desk with Anna, & would not speak to her, & Mary Croft who had quarreled with her companion, left her desk & came & sat with Anna.  I have not asked whether the quarrel was made up yet.  

	Yesterday as I was riding, I saw Judge Moore walking with a lady.  I could not see the ladys face well as she had on a sun bonnet.

	Our dining room now looks very comfortable.  I have shut up one of the doors by the Sideboard
 & removed the Table in that direction, & a little in front of where the Table was, put the Sofa, the one Jim made.  Mamma & my Sisters think it the sweetest little Sofa they ever saw, & now that E� has altered the Cover, & made it right, it does look very comfortable.  Mr. Rosemond came here yesterday. He measured the distance for the Fence, & will send a bill of what it will cost.  I believe I have nothing more to tell you.  Mamma desired their love to you when I wrote.  Mrs. Hokes family are to take tea with me this evening.  Tell Willie he does not know how anxious I am to know how he is getting on.  I hope to hear a good account of him, & that he will return quite a man, & never quarrel with his brother & sisters again.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. I have a shocking pen, & do not want to trouble Mr. N� very often to mend it.
