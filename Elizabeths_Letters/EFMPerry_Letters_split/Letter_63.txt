Letter 63

Friday morning, 24 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	Again have I taken my seat at your desk in the Library to write to you.  I read yesterday evening your letter in the Mountaineer.  It gave me pleasure, but I think it was written in a more careless manner than you generally write.  I suppose it was written in a hurry, but when you write to be published, you ought to write with great care.  You did not dwell long enough on the different subjects, & one thing I was surprised at, was your laying so much stress on dress.  It would make the impression that you thought dress of so much importance, when I know you do not value it in the least, & I am sorry an impression so much against you  should be made.  If the Members of Congress had behaved well & performed their duty, it would have been of no consequence if they had dressed badly, though it would have showed more refinement, if their dress had been�.  Another thing I did not like was your court to Genl T�..n.  His character I do not admire, & I do not like to see one so far above him  in everything that is worthy of praise as you are, paying what seems in the eyes of others, flattery & court.  Where one possesses vanity, it should be pulled down, not puffed up.  There was an ungrammatical expression in your letter also.  You see with how much interest I must have read your letter to criticize it so, but I assure you it gave me great pleasure, & the remarks I make, are for you to proifit from in future for I love my husband so well that I wish his letters to be faultless, so as to escape criticism from others.  So continue to write, for all you tell is so interesting, that I always wish you would tell more.  Your letters to me are very interesting, & I think might even do to be published.  Mrs. Butler was here yesterday & says she is coming again tomorrow as she thinks I may hear from you tonight.  She is so anxious to hear something of her family who she thinks you will of course see.  She says you must go to N London if it is only for two hours.  Her sister Mrs. Rogers is there, & her niece Miss Rogers wishes to come to Greenville, & she thinks it would be a good opportunity for her to come on with you.  You might arrange it when you return to N. York or Washington on your way home, she might meet you, & come on with you.  I hope you are willing to put yourself even out of the way to oblige others, so that you will make some arrangements of this kind.  Mrs. Butler is very anxious for a French cap.  She has written to her sister to get her one & send by you.  She says I ought to have told you to bring me one so now she has put it in my head.  I would like one.  You must bring me one.  I would like you also to bring me as a present to Mrs. Butler, for in all probability she will not get the one she has written for, & she has been so long talking about a French cap, & you can get directed to a Milliner in N. York.  I wrote you in my last, that I wished you to buy a set of Coral beads for Susan.  She did not know I had written, & asked me the other day. if you would be a good person to get her a set, that she wished one.  So you see it would be an acceptable present to her.  Get a set of small coral beads for the neck, & two smaller strings for the arms, that is called a set, the Jeweller will tell you.  Mamma & Susan are with me washing, so I am not lonely, though nothing can make up for your absence.  I think one reason we love each other so, must be that we are often separated.  When apart, we feel the loss of each other so much, that when we meet, we value each other more than ever.  Mamma sends her affectionate love to you, & says she believes they love you as much as I do.  They have learnt to value you.  Willie has holiday now for 4 weeks, & enjoys it greatly.  Not a day passes but all the children speak of you.  Frank is a sweet boy, a universal favorite.  He greets everyone with such a smile, that he wins their hearts immediately.  My mantle was up yesterday, & I took my meals for the first time down stairs (since you left) & commenced keeping house again.  After dinner�We have just dined.  Mr. McBee dined with us.  Susan is here.  He sends his love & says you must do all you can for the Rail Road.  Very few persons have come to Greenville as yet.  Sunday I am going to church, & next week I wish to go by to see Mrs. Dickson & Mrs. Poinsett.  You must certainly go to N. Haven & deliver all the letters Mamma gave you.  You must not omit going to the Graveyard, that beautiful spot, where you will see in the plot owned by Mr. Ingersoll, the grave of my little sister.  You will then realize that we indeed lived in N. Haven.  Now that you are at the North, you ought to go everywhere, & I think it is such an advantage to have introductory letters.  It makes you acquainted with the people, & enables you to see the country better.  You must deliver them all.  I am sure in Washington you must have felt the benefit of them.  I am afraid from the Presidents overhearing your remarks on Oregon that it�him against you.  I am sorry, for I wished you to gain the favor of the President.  Your descrying of Mrs. Polks vanity was not at all pleasing.  The more elevated one is in the world, the more humble they ought to try to appeal.  Of course she must be pleased at the distinction of�& husband, but she ought to have sense enough to conceal it.  I value   you more as much as if you were President, & the reason I am pleased at any honor paid you, is that it is a proof that others value you, as well as myself, & for this reason I would be pleased if you were made President, if not Judge, at any rate Senator as you now are.  I am not vain at being the Senators wife, but grateful to the people who appreciate you.  By the by, are you not afraid that the remarks you make about the house may get you into trouble.  Every member may call you to account, thinking it a personal insult.  If they do, apologize.  I cannot consent to your settling it in any other way.  I am serious, & you must be more careful.  You must continue to write for the Mountaineer, but write well as you know you can write, for your letters are always interesting, & your travels now afford such a good subject for your pen, & you see so many persons also.  Mrs. Butler said she hoped you would write about Genl Towson, that he distinguished himself in the last war, so I suppose you know all about him.  She mentioned someone who went from N. York to Boston for 50 cts in an opposition line.  I want you to buy �Walker on Beauty�, & if you cannot get all of Mrs. Sherwoods works, you might get the �Lady of the Manor�, if it is reasonable.  Would you not like to get for yourself, �Horace Walpoles last letters,� that you could [write] a review of.  You must bring some clothes or articles of clothing for Willie. Frank & Anna ready made if you see them, so I may know the fashion.  Hat or Dress or something of the kind.  I have in my different letters given you various commissions, but you must consult your purse, & your judgement.  I long to see you, but at the same time wish you to remain away long enough to see everything worth seeing.  Perhaps on your return you can stop at Bordentown, Wilmington & Carlisle, & at Philadelphia be well to deliver your letters.  You must see Mr. Van Buren, & write an interesting description of him for the paper.  You had better remain some days in Washington on your return , for I am sure you did not stay long enough before.  You must certainly go to N. Port, & engage lodging there for me next summer, & go to Burton River [where] her brother lives.  She says you pass it, & it is a beautiful place.  Yours, E.F.P.

I have written you 6 letters, two at Washington, two at N. York, two at Boston.  I have no news to tell.  Take care of yourself.  The weather here is now hot.
