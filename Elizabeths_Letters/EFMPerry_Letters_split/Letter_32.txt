Letter 32

Wednesday morning, 27 November [1844]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I am now to write my second letter, before I have heard from you, & I write without delay, because I am going to consult you  how I shall act, with regard to the letter just received from Pamela.  I will now tell you what I was afraid to mention, until I knew all had turned out well.  When I paid my visit to Mr. Yancey, Mr. Yancey said he would be obliged to give up going to see his Aunt, for he could procure no conveyance in the village.  I instantly offered your horse & buggy to him, & he accepted it with great pleasure & said Mr. McKay would go with him to bring it back.  After he had gone I was uneasy, lest the horse being skittish, some accident should happen, but Mr. McKay has just returned quite safely, & bringing me a most grateful letter from Pamela, thanking me for enabling them to see Mr. Yancey, & giving me a most pressing invitation to visit them.  She says I must go with the children & you must meet us there & all partake of a Christmas dinner.  She says the first night I can go to Goldsmiths, & the second night reach their house.  She says I must go, that I know they all love me  & consider me almost as a relation.  She says that she is not going to Columbia, that Mrs. Cunningham is prevented by sickness from going with her daughter.  You she says on your way up can stop at Laurens, & they will have a buggy there to meet you, or I you know send the carri[a]ge; or else you could get in the stage which passes through their plantation, & which meets the Greenville stage.  Pamela says she will not hear of any obstacles or denials; & she knows you will not object; says she regrets exceedingly you could not have stopped on your way down, but insists on your doing so on your return; says she will accept the offer of you as an escort, during one of the four winters you are certain of being in Columbia.  Now My dear husband what shall I do?  I would like to go very much & see no objection to it, & it would be so pleasant for you to meet me there & all return to Greenville together.  I would not go for two weeks at least, so that Jim could kill hogs before we went, & if you prefer it, Jim could return after carrying me to Mrs. Cunninghams, though I do not think that would be necessary.  I think it would be a pleasant way of passing the time during your absence, so you must write me immediately whether I shall go; for though so anxious to go myself; I will of course give up if you object, but I rather think you will like me to go, & if I do go, I will arrange everything at home, so as to go on well without me.  I will now drop this subject & tell of all that has occurred since I last wrote.  Sunday night a letter came from Mr. Bancroft, acknowledging the receipt of your check.  Monday I paid visits.  I went to see first Miss Pinckney, who I always like & she gave me a p[ai]r of gloves for one of the children, which she had bought for Charley & were too small for him.  Mr. Pinckney says the Physicians have advised him to take 2 years rest; otherwise he will have Spinal complaint.  So I believe certainly at the end of this year he will leave us, for which I am very sorry, for I think a family like his, an acquisition to Greenville.  He says Mr. Sharpe was once in Greenville in Bevens store; then returned to Pendleton, & set up a Confectioners shop, & afterwards entered into business with young Warley; that he has no education, which you can perceive by conversing with him; & that he is good looking, which I think must have caused Frances to have fancied him.  Mr. Croft was at Mr. Pinckney�s & asked me if I had seen the compliment paid you in the Charleston Courier, & then said to Mr. Pinckney, that you were now Senator, higher that you had ever been before, & elected by such a handsome majority.  I saw him (Mr. Croft) yesterday afternoon at Mamma�s & he said to me Well the Maj now is in all his glory, the next thing I expect to hear of him is, that he is President of the Senate.  I am thinking now, that I ought to have advised you to appropriate that honour to yourself, & if you had signified your wish, perhaps you might have obtained it.  How delightful that would be, to be a Senators wife is good, but Wife of President of the Senate, still better, & I am sure if you had tried for it, you might have got it.  My next visit was to Mrs. Thompson.  I saw Genl Thompson for a moment.  He was about going for the fourth time to Mr. Carsons to persuade him  to sell him his place.  Genl Thompsons miniature I do not think a good likeness, & Mrs. Thompsons can never have looked like her.  Speaking of the Torchlight procession, Mrs. Thompson mentioned, that Butler, Mr. Holcombe, & some other gentlemen were standing by the Mansion house, & Butler said �how will this do?� & Mr. Holcombe said, �very well for the occasion,� & Mrs. Walker who was at one of the windows replied, �if we had our hands in the public treasury , we would do better,� meaning it of course for Genl Thompson.  Afterwards she went for Butler & apologized to him, saying if she had known he was near, she would not have said what she did & she did not mean it for him, which made the matter worse, for if she did not mean it for him, she ought not to have apologized to him, more than to Mr. Holcombe, Mrs. Thompson said, Mrs. Walker by her conduct during Nullification times, had�her of politics.  Next I went to Mr. Crofts to see the ladies there.  Mrs. Pearson mentioned the compliment paid you in the paper, & said she would like to read your address, so I borrowed Mamma�s copy, & sent it.  Mr. Croft illuminated his house Saturday night, also Mr. Choice his office, the printing office at the Jail, those were all.  Then I went to see Mrs. Beattie.  She says Mr. Spears has sold his house in Laurens, & with his family will live with Mrs. Rowland.  He is half of his time from home, & his wife finds it lonely.  Lastly I went to see Mrs. Duboc.  She said she had heard glowing descriptions of your party.  Mrs. Lee said she looked forward to your being a Judge.  Mrs. Duboc said Mr. Moore had gone down in the stage with you, to be admitted, & that he said you would be one of those  appointed to examine him.  I hope you have been, for I like you to examine the students, so there is another lawyer for Greenville.  I think if some of them do not get offices, they will certainly starve.  There were five visits I paid in one morning, in consequence of having a carri[a]ge.  In the afternoon I went to see Mrs. Townes who was out, & then called for Mrs. Barclay to take a ride, instead of paying her a visit.  She had sent me word that she was to leave the next morning.   Mr. Barclay has gone to Newberry, she to Columbia.  Yesterday morning I went to see Mrs. Gibbes.  She also mentioned the notice of you in the paper.  Mr. Gibbes is better.  He was walking about the farm.  Yesterday afternoon I rode up to Mr. McBee�s.  They were all out, except Mrs. Carson.  I then called for Susan to shop.  The gold peices you  gave me, pass here, $4.85.  Today Jim is hauling wood, & in a few days I suppose he will kill hogs.  I have only two more visits to pay, & then I will stay at home & work.  I hope to hear from you tonight, but if I do not, will not be uneasy, for I do not wish you to write to me except when perfectly convenient.  If you write to others, I will be satisfied.  I saw Mrs. Duncan in the streets yesterday.  I suppose she is well.  The village looks very dull.  I have no news to tell.  I suppose Mr. Lester has you down to be admitted.  Do you think Mr. Elford or Butler will be elected?  I get along quite well, though you may suppose how much I miss you.  But I do so wish, you need not decline going to Congress on my account.  See how good I am to write you every Mail, so you must be happy & contented, & enjoy yourself.  If you do not write me, you are tired & homesick.  I will be so provoked, I will stop writing to you, & you need not pretend you are anxious to see me, for as soon as you come home, you commence scolding me.  The children are well.  Willy was anxious to write to you, but I have no room.  He says he is sorry Papa has gone to Columbia, but he wants his drum.  I wonder what other wife writes to her husband, as often as I do.  I expect some of them will not hear during the whole session.  Do the Greenville delegation all board at the same house with you?  You must excuse all mistakes, for I have written in a hurry.  I am anxious to know if you will like me to go to Mrs. Cunninghams.  I hope you will, for I would like to go very much.  I do not see anything to prevent my going.  But if you would rather me not, I will not go.  You must write immediately & tell me.  I have now reached the bottom of my page & will bid you adieu.  Ever Yours, Liz
