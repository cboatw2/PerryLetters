Letter 12

Sunday night

My dear husband, I have just received your second letter, and read it with much pleasure.  I am glad you pass your time so pleasantly.  You are now in the society suitable for you among refined intelligent gentleman, who know your value and appreciate your talents.  I wish it was your fortune always to mingle with such. You would then not find it so hard to obtain a seat in the Legislature.  There would be no office which they would not think it an honour to bestow on you.  As it is your sad fate to dwell among an ignorant, conceited, anxious people who are ready to slander and find fault with you for everything you do.  You ought to be careful and judicious in the course you pursue, and not offend them so seriously as to be defeated at the next election.  You are so calculated to shine in public life that I wish you to continue in the Legislature as long as you can, & I am constantly uneasy lest you should do something to offend the people & cause them not to elect you.  You must not forget to be the first to introduce the fee bill.  You must always take sides with the upper country.  I would much rather you in debate be on the side with Mr. Wardlaw, Burt, Henry &c. than with Mr. Rhett & the lower country members, & you must associate with those from the upper country, particularly your colleagues; be very kind to Mr. Earle, Simth, & Ware.  I wish you would be very attentive in sending pamphlets & other papers important or unimportant to your constituents.   I think they are pleased when you do & displeased when you do not.  Dr. Crook told me you sent him the Governors message.  Write to him & some others too.  Last year Dr. Crook told me you were sending no papers home.  He expected you did not wish to be elected again.  I should think it delightful for one of your talents to be a member of the Legislature.  You can display them with such advantage there.  I would rather be in the Legislature than in Congress; would rather be distinguished & popular in my own state than anywhere else.

	Wiliam Hutson is a cousin of ours, & I believe a fine young man.  Thomas Fuller who I believe is a member; we knew well in New Haven.  He married Miss Means a cousin of ours also, but we never saw her but once.  He invited us to his wedding.  Have you become acquainted with him?  Mr. Albert Rhett I regard as a friend.  I believe he had a sincere friendship for our family.  Our acquaintance commenced in New Haven.  Those we knew there we will never forget.  I always feel interested in hearing of him.  I liked him very much.  He invited us to his wedding.  He was quite intimate with Mamma.  I wonder if he recollects all about New Haven.  You may remember me to him if you think proper.  I am glad my letter gave you such pleasure.  Will is quite well & looks healthy.  Three of his jaw teeth have made there appearance.  I do not think he has forgotten you yet.  Dr. Crook was here the other evening.   Will went up to him & sat in his lap.  I think he knew it was not you, but he reminded him of you and he felt pleased to be in his arms.  You must tell Mr. Albert Rhett that I have a little son named William Hayne McCall.  Mamma has just been downstairs for a moment.  She says you must remember us all to Mr. Rhett & tell him we have never forgotten him; but always think of him with the greatest regard, and she hopes the friendship he once felt for one member of her family (now in another world) will be extended  and perpetuated in her & her remaining children.  You must call  & see Aunt Brewton when convenient, & be kind to her.  She is so afflicted.  She feels kindness now particularly.    Do go & see her soon & give our love to her.   Victoria does remarkably well.  We have abundance of Milk & cheese two or three times a week.  We make just enough butter for table use.  We have not slaughtered the hogs yet.  John is very busy at the house.  I expect he will not kill till you come back.  Mrs. McBee sent us some Sausages last night.  Dr. Crook promised to send some potatoes last night after supper.  John came up & said, �Mrs. Perry, James is thrown from the horse on his head.  I want you to give him some Turpentine.�  At first I did not understand him & thought he said the horse was thrown on its head.  I was relieved when I found it was James.  He said he felt rather unwell, so I told him not to ride the horse again, but let John water it.  Today I sent him to Dr. Crook�s to know if he ought to take anything.  He said I must give him a dose of Castor Oil & Gum Arabic water.  I did so, & he is now much better, almost well.  Susan & Ann say I must tell you, you must not bring anything for them from Columbia.  You have been already so kind to them, for he would have let them stay so long under their roof as you have.  They have the greatest regard for you, & will in the present case take the will for the deed.  I tell you you must bring them something, but do not bring an expensive present that you cannot afford.  They like Music boxes very much.  If you were to see a pretty one for a few dollars, you might bring them one between them.  Perhaps you might get a very pretty one for 5 dollars; you ought not to give more.  You know I told you this time not to be extravagant, but bring us cheap presents, not more than two or three dollars apiece.  You say you have already made me a beautiful present.  I know that it is an expensive one as it was bought in a Jewellers shop.  I do hope you have laid out your money judiciously.  Write me what it is you have bought.  I hope it is not Silver tumblers.  I would rather have anything than them.  I think they are perfectly useless, unless you have everything to correspond.  I think I will be pleased if it is anything but silver Tumblers.  Do relieve my mind soon, & do change the tumblers if you have bought them for something else.  You say you intend purchasing a beautiful copy of Nicholas Nickleby.  I would much rather you buy a plain copy, that will cost less, & spend the rest of the money in buying other books.  You say you have purchased some books already & one you think I will admire. Perhaps the rest are Law books.  There is a book called �The Realities of Life� written by a Miss Gaillard in Charleston.  If you were to come across it, & it was cheap, I would like you to get it.  I believe the Stores in Columbia are very dear,  You had better buy your books at Auction.  I would rather have a pretty straw hat for Will than anything else, & one larger than the size I gave you, that he may wear it next summer.  Perhaps you might get some lady to purchase it for you, Sarah Taylor for instance.  Write me word how much Musical boxes cost.  We all admire them very much, but perhaps in Columbia they are very expensive.  Do not buy one until you have written me the price.

	Recollect take the part of the upper country in debate, be kind to your colleagues, attentive
 in sending pamphlets to your constituents. Introduce the fee bill, & do all you think best.  Go to see Aunt Brewton.  Be as economical as possible, judicious in your selection of books, consult my taste.  Write word what is the present you have bought, and the price of Musical boxes.  If they are cheap I would like one but if they are dear I would not.  I am afraid you cannot read this letter it is written so small.  If you write letters for the Mountaineer take great pains with them.  You must be a consistent Politician.  My dear husband I have [word obscured] you a great deal of advice, but I hope it will not have so great an influence over you you will follow it in opposition to your own judgment.  My next letters will relate more to family, except as regards silver cups, do as you think best.  I remain as ever your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
