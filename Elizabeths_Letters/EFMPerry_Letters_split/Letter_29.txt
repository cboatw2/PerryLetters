Letter 29

Monday morning, 20 May 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	You see I have broken my promise, (not to write to you).  I am afraid you will be very angry as you think, the mind once made up, right or wrong, it must never be changed.  I hope you will forgive me this once.  I�ll try & not offend again.  It is charity to you that induces me to write, for I know how much at a loss you must feel now, having been three days without receiving any advice.  I must write a book for your especial benefit, containing advice on every subject, which you can constantly apply to when absent from me.  I think perhaps it is the want of this that has made you pursue such an inconsistent course, partly a Union man, partly a Nullifier, partly a Whig, & partly a Democrat.  You think a little with each party, & belong to no party whatever, & no party owns you, or supports you.  This is owing to your making up your mind on different subjects when away from me,  After consulting me, you find you are wrong, but having made up your mind, you can�t change it, & therefore pursue a course which you know is against your interest, & perfectly calculated to advance the interest of others.  However advice is to end my letter not commence it, so I will now tell you all the incidents that have occurred since you left, & as what is last said produces the greatest impression, close with the advice.

	When you requested me to write the same day you left, I told you I would have nothing to write about.  I might have had something very serious, for you had been scarce gone ten minutes when the Market bell rung, & there was a cry of fire.  Nothing alarms me so much except an election in which you are concerned, as the cry of fire.  Everybody seemed rushing round our corner, so I knew it was near us.  It was Mr. Murphy�s house.  A spark from the chimney set the roof on fire; fortunately it was put out immediately (long before the Engine arrived), or there might have been an extensive conflagration for the wind was blowing high at the time in the direction of the village & everything as dry as tinder.

	As soon as the alarm of fire was over, I dressed & walked to see Mrs. Faber.  I thought she would expect it.  Miss Lynah & herself were very glad to see me.  They said I looked well, & not like the Mother of three children.  Of course to seem still younger, I told them that I had had four.  Mrs. Faber said you looked quite well.  Miss Lynah will stay with her Aunt at Flat Rock until her Father�s family come up & then return here & pass the summer at Pattons.  Mrs. Faber has not hired her house.  Mr. Lowndes changed his mind.  The afternoon I spent at home & sent Willy & Anna to Mamma.  They were very glad to see them; said they looked & behaved sweetly, assisted in fanning Ann, & Willy has commenced planting a little garden under the drawing room window, which every day he wishes to go to water.  Just before supper Mr. Barclay came to see me & spent the evening.  He told me Mr. B� had sent for him to sketch his child, & as soon as he returns he is to paint what he sketched, so I am glad he has another engagement.  He went Saturday on Plough boy.  A letter came for you Friday night from Mr. Leitner, though it must have been in the office before you left.  On the back was the request, that if you had left, it might be sent to you.  I sent it to Col. Townes.  He said it was too late that night to put it in the Mail. But he would the next day.  A Hamburgh Journal also came, sent I suppose by Mr. Yancey, as it announces him as a candidate for the Legislature.

	Saturday morning I staid at home & worked in the afternoon.  I carried my jewelry to Mr. Pickerel, & went to see Mrs. Markley, Mrs. Elford & Mrs. Town[e]s.  At night I went early to bed.  Sunday morning Willy & myself went to church & heard a missionary sermon.  Miss Stuart & two of the children sat in the pew.  I would not be surprised if they had taken possession for the summer.  In the afternoon, I went with all of the children to Mamma�s.  She was very glad to see us; Ann just the same.  They inquired after you.  We walked in the garden, & Mamma waked with me to the gate.  We got home just at dark.  After supper I told some Bible stories to Willy & then went to bed.  In the night it thundered and the wind blew.  I predicted a storm, but it passed over in a few minutes, & no rain yet. 

	This morning just after breakfast, I went over to Mr. Watson to pay my respects to your second self.  It is indeed an admirable portrait.  If I only looked my best, I might be persuaded, to have mine taken.  Butler Thompson came in to look at it.  He said it was the best Portrait he ever saw in his life.  It was precisely you, except a little younger.  Mr. Wells was looking at it.  His only objection was the shadow of the spectacles, Which Mr. Watson says is the most ridiculous criticism on a picture he has ever heard, & though he does not wish Mr. Wells to have it, shows he is too ignorant on the subject to be a competent judge.  The picture looks so much better at a distance, than near.  When I first went in the store, it was directly behind the counter, I was hardly more pleased with it than I was in Mr. Barclay�s room.  I begged Mr. Watson to put it at the end of his store, & at that distance & in the shade, I was delighted with it.  I imagined you standing in the store, & was surprised you did not speak to me.  You must get a very handsome frame for it.  If you cannot get one in Charleston, send to the North.  That picture will remain in the family always, generation after generation,, perhaps hundreds of years, & sure to show to your posterity, how the founder of their family looked.  Do my dear husband render your name so distinguished that it will be regarded with pride, by all your descendants.  Don�t let them say �My Grandfather was beaten by Dr. Sullivan.�

	Mrs. Marion�lingers, but I believe she is very low.  I have no news at all to write about.  I heard Miss McBee was going to the North with Mrs. Dr. Butler, but I hardly believe that; I do not believe she would leave the Dt. to electioneer alone.  I heard Miss McLeod was engaged to Mr. Mood, but I do not believe that either.  I see in the paper the death of cousin Edward Finley who you recollect as a member of the Legislature.  Aunt Finley of our five grown children has one left.

	I have so much work to do, that I will not be able to write you again.  It takes up too much time.  I will now mention my commissions.  Do not forget to buy for Willy a Leghorn hat with a wide rime.  Measure the crown by the string I gave you.  For Frank buy a common straw�not costing more than 25 cts.  For Susan & Ann I would like you to bring a little trifle, not costing more than 50 cts.at the utmost.  The pincushions you brought them last winter 3 1/4 cts a peice showed them yesterday to me on the Mantle peice, & seemed to value them greatly.  Any little trifle would do, such for instance as those little glass figurines you brought me once.  It is merely to show that you have thought of them.  Ann says she does not care for any oranges, but I think you had better bring her a few.

	And now my dear for the advice, which I know you are anxiously expecting.  I do hope you are for annexation.  If you are not my misery will be complete, for now I doubt if you will be elected, then I am certain you will not be, for it seems treason in a southerner to be against Texas. Unless he is a Whig, & nobody will vote for you.  Dont be so foolish as to do everything to injure yourself, & benefit your opponent.  You wont electioneer, when you know it is so particularly important for you, who have so many things against you, & so many persons doing all they can against you.  I believe you want to be defeated, though you know how mortified I will be.  I am certain that if you were to take an interest in the matter & do all you could to ensure success, you would be successful, but instead of that, you take no interest in the matter, & do all you can to be defeated.  Your conduct certainly indicates that, & I don�t know why you are a Candidate, unless it is to be  the death of me, for uneasiness of mind is wearing out my body, & I cant endure it much longer.  All of the Candidates wives feel easy except myself, for they know  their husbands will exert themselves to be elected, but I who am sensitive, know that my husband who has so many enemies working against him, will leave his election to chance, & chance never elected anyone to the Legislature.  I have read the arguments for & against Texas & I am for Texas, & you may as well be apparently for it, if in reality you are against it, for I do not believe it will be admitted into the Union.  You must make haste & come back to electioneer.  In the meantime all I can do for you.  Write me.

	If you are defeated I will tear up your picture.  Your descendants shant see it.

�.me by your inertness, laziness, obstinacy &c.  I do not intend to write to you again unless I have something very important to write about.  I will now tell you news that I know will shock & grieve you.  Judge [Baylis John] Earle is dead.  He died this morning.  He returned to Greenville a few days ago looking very badly, though his friends told him he looked better, as it pleased him.  Yesterday after dinner, he went into Mrs. Colemans room to chat.  Suddenly he said his tongue felt thick, he could not speak well, & he would go in the drawing room & laid down, he got up to walk.  When he was taken insensible, he was laid on Mrs. Colemans bed & continued so until this morning when he died.  It was a fit I suppose.  He was perfectly unconscious. Just a few moments before he died, he was turned on his side.  When he was put again on his back. He opened his eyes for a moment & looked perfectly natural, but instantly a spasm convulsed his body & he died.  Mr. Sam Earle was sent for after he was taken sick & was the only one of his family with him.  Mr. Edward Earle had been here yesterday morning & left.  He was sent for & arrived 10 or 15 minutes after his brother had breathed his last.  Delia tells me she has just seem Mrs. Mays carri[a]ge come in from Pendleton.  After nursing her brother so long, she must regret not being with him at the last.  He is to be carried to Pendleton to be buried as soon as arrangements can be made.  He is now at the Mansion house.  There is to be  a meeting of the citizens this afternoon.  I suppose to[page torn]resolutions.  Da�[page torn]Judge Earle eat a plate of cherries which made him feel badly.  Yesterday he f[elt] better & eat a [hea]rty dinner.  Mr. Lester was at the door a few minutes ago.  He said Mr. Choice said when Judge Earle went to Florida (I do not know whether the last time or not) he left a will with him, but it was not now in his possession, & he did not know whether it was destroyed or not, & Mr. Cloice said from an estimation they made not long ago his property was 60,000 dollars.  I had thought he was worth twice as much.  Mr. Edward Earle when he came this morning, Mr. Lester says, took on a great deal.  How I wish you had sent for those Busts when Judge Earle offered them to you, we would now have had them to remember him by.  Mrs. Marion was buried yesterday.  It was while her funeral was taking place, that it was reported Judge Earle was dying.  How strange another world must be.  I wonder if persons recognize each other.  What a mystery, and how gradually it is made known to all, one after another.  Judge Earle has often of course thought of what kind of existence he would enjoy after his soul separated from his body.  He was certain how it would be; well this morning the secret was revealed to him.  I hope it has been to him a happy change.  
	I will now change this sad subject for a happier one, at least to the parties concerned.  Mr. Elford & Miss Sloan are to be married next Thursday.  Mr. Barclay returned from Spartanburgh yesterday.  He brought you a gold pencil case from Mr. Seay.  The bill in NY mentions the Pencil case 14 dollars & cutting the Initials 3 dollars, 17 dollars altogether.  The initials are in German text, which I do not like as well as plain letters, as they are not so easily distinguished.  It is a beautiful pencil case very heavy.  I do not know the cost of them so cannot tell if it was dear.  I went with Susan one afternoon to look at your picture.  Both her & me think Mr. Barclay has not done you justice.  I do not think he has given you as noble a countenance as you deserve, & there is an unusual look about the mouth you have not, & we do not like.  Still it is very much like you & could be recognized anywhere.  You are a remarkable looking man, & so easily taken, that it would be hard not to take a likeness of you that would not be known, for your features are marked, but what I wished was your countenance & expression when you look most benevolent.  The mass of the people do not observe your countenance particularly & therefore do not miss in your picture & what I miss, as Susan says it certainly looks like you, but there is something in it that is not you.  Justice has not been done you.  But the picture is so much like you, that someone standing at Mr. Watsons store, looked in & said �I thought Maj. Perry had gone to Columbia.  I am afraid for Mr. Barclay to take mine.  I know he would not succeed as well as he has with yours.  He could not have had a better subject than yourself.  I hope he may meet with success, for I am sorry for him, & he seems a worthy young man. These sheets of paper are not large enough for correspondence between husbands & wives, particularly when a husband acts so badly as to require half of the letter to be filled up with scolding.
