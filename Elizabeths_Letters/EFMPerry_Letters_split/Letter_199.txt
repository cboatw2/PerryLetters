Letter 199

Thursday morning, [1851]
[Greenville]

My dear husband

	Willie wrote to you last night, & I cannot seal up his letter, without adding a few lines.  I always have so much to say.  Anna is very much pleased at your praises.  Frank is anxious to write to you, but does not yet write legibly.  Fanny is very busy & industrious & often asks if she is not the best.  Hext is well & sweet, & will be very much pleased with his Indian Shoes.  He wears Shoes & Stockings now, , & the Indian Shoes if he does not wear much, he can keep in remembrance of you.   You must be sure & buy me another pr to give to Susans baby, & the two pocket books.  These are all I wish you to bring me.  For the children anything you bring will please them.  Toys & candy is so dear in Columbia, you cannot bring much of either.  

	It seems to me the State is getting in a more dangerous position than ever, for after the people have declared against Secession, the leaders are determined to go on with their designs.  The Patriot has yet an important part to act.  The danger is not over, as Judge O�Neal[l] said.  You have still to open the eyes of the people, & save them from disgrace & ruin.  What a pity we cannot have peace like the other States.  I am sure we would not know we were ill treated & dishonoured, if the Politiciasns did not tell us so.  Well after they have Seceded, I hope they will be satisfied.  You will do your duty, & that is all you can do.  But what is most provoking is that all will be taxed, even those who are opposed to contemplated action, so I hope you will try & exempt those who are opposed, from taxation.  They should not bear the burden.  Even Mamma, whose income is only sufficient for her necessary expenses.  Mr. Barnwell, Mr. Rhett, & such should hear it.  

	I hope to hear tonight from you, & to see the Patriot.  It is the only paper I have seen since you left.

	I am sorry you did not dine with Professor Brumby.  Whether busy or not you ought to have gone.

	The weather is charming today.  We are all well.  I have now a particle of news to tell you.  I have been out but once to Mamma�s, & owe everybody a visit, so nobody comes to see me.  I am very busy seeing for the children.

	If you saw a suitable present for Mamma, I would love you to bring it.
