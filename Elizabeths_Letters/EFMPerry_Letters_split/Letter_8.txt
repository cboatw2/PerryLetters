Letter 8

Sunday night, 15 December 1839
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you in which you mention you may perhaps be at home Friday night.  It was what I was thinking you would do; for it the Legislature adjourns the 19th you will either have to leave Columbia the day it adjourns, or remain there a day after it adjourns.  I knew you would prefer the former to the latter plan.  The letter that arrived Friday night, I will answer now along with the one that has just come.  This will be my last letter, as it is probable you will leave Columbia before another one would reach there.  In Wednesday�s letter you will tell me whether certainly you will be at home Friday night.

	You were mistaken in thinking Mrs. Butler meant to compliment you when she said Will looked like you; it was the reverse, she said, it was paying Willy no compliment but he certainly looked like you.  I was quite offended that she should think you so ugly; that it was no compliment to look like you.  I try to trace a resemblance myself though in vain; with the exception of the forehead where the hair grows.  I recollect when he was first born, I felt disappointed when I heard Mrs. Sloane say, �he looks like his Mother.�  I was in hopes he looked like his Father.

	The tale about John Cunningham is a bad one, I have no doubt true.  Mr. L�man would have no object in inventing it.  You recollect he told you in Greenville he had a note against him, for Jewels purchased for Miss Noble.  I suppose John found he could gain Miss Noble very easily without making her expensive presents; so changed his mind about giving her the Jewels.  You had better call  and inquire after Aunt Brewton.  She will be pleased with the attention, though she may not see you.  I thought perhaps William if he was still engaged would go to see Pamela before he returned home.

	I like Mr. Burt and hope he may be elected Attorney General though as I have heard nothing about it, perhaps he may not have the chance.  Mr. Bailey may not have resigned.

	 Mr. Wells paid me a long visit last Friday.  He came to bring two Mountaineers that the boy had not brought the last two Fridays.  We had quite a chat, on matters & things in general.  I told him my fears of Mr. Powell, that he might injure you.  He was Jobs comforter.  He said Mr. Powell was indeed to be dreaded, that he was now a desperate man, capable of anything.  He says a great many here are dissatisfied with Mr. McBee�s election.  Dr. Crooks, Mr. Hoke and others.  I myself should think they could have elected a more competent one, one more distinguished, and publicly [word obscured] would give greater reputation to the Road.  I expect Mr. McBee feels as Genl Thompson says, Mr. Walker felt the morning after he received the solicitation to be Candidate for Congress, �a great man.�  Mr. Wells says Greenville like all villages is a backbiting sea which place, so many families are on bad terms.  
	   
	I am glad you have purchased Will a Waggon.  I have seen the kind of Chair you describe.  I am sorry now we got one from Mr. Harley, though it will do for him when he is older.  I have been thinking of the books you have purchased, & think you were right not to let so cheap an opportunity pass.  I am anxious to see them as well as the other things you have purchased.  What a pleasant evening we will spend next Friday looking at them.  I hope to see the Coloured Morocoo & Willy�s shoes among them.  I am also anxious to see your accompaniments as you.

	You will find Willy [word obscured] improved, for he improves every day.  He is certainly the most interesting baby I have ever seen.  He now eats �Homoney� at Breakfast & Supper, and I put a bone or peice of Meati in his [word obscured] at dinner.  I must tell you how economical I have been in dressing him.  You may perhaps recollect a Coloured Muslin dress I had when I was married blue & brown figures.  I wore it very seldom, so it was almost as good as new, but I had so outgrown it, that it was never altered to fit me.  Well!  I have cut it up, & will be able to make three dresses for him out of it;   one I have almost finished and he shall have it on the night you arrive.  I have made him a nice Calico cloak to wear in the yard.  His Gingham bonnet I have not made yet.  Since he was born. I have done a stich of work for myself.  It gives me much pleasure to attend to him.

	I went to church this morning, but not this evening the wind blew so high.  The Working Society has not met one since you were away.  The weather has been so bad.  I have thoughts of inviting Miss Pinckney to dine here on Tuesday, if I can provide her with something to eat.  I must try and get some Eggs, & Mary Croft will assist Minerva in making what is necessary.  I wish if I can to return [page torn] invitation.  

	Mrs. Butler was here yesterday.  She came to hear [words obscured] & thought perhaps you had mentioned Mr. R� P�& his family.  I told her of the books you had purchased, & when I told her of Scotts Commentaries, she said, she would like you to purchase her a set, if it was the Bible & Commentaries together at $4.50.  Of course now you will not have time, and most probably no money to spare, but I mentioned it to you, as she told me to.  I am glad you purchased them for yourself.  They are so valuable.  Books cost so much, that they can be got cheap, it is well to get them.  That large Bible you got last year, persons think cost 15 or 20 dollars, & you know it only cost five.

	Jessy this evening made her appearance in company with Judge Earle�s boy.  She is now in the Stable.  Mrs. Griffin came yesterday to know if you would buy any Cider if she sent it.  I said yes; about 30 gallons.  Allen has not been here to do anything.  It is now past 9 time to go to bed.  This is my last letter to you for a long time. I expect to hear once more from you.  Ever Your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
