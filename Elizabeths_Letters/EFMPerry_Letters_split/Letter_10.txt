Letter 10

My dear husband

	I am happy to be able to inform you, that Willy is convalescent.  Dr. Earle last night said there was no need of his further attendance, that In a few days Willy would be well, & that soon he would ride out, & riding would do him good.  He thinks now of nothing but eating.  Has been fretting because I would not let him eat Jelly & sweet Wafers Mrs. Pearson sent him, & which Dr. Earle said were not good for him.  He said I must write & beg Grandma to send him some Puffs, & wishes he was well  & could dress.  He is tired of bed.  He slept well last night. & this morning had a movement of the bowels without taking medicine.  Dr. Earle says all he will need now is a little Rhubarb & Magnesia when he is confined in his bowels, & must be prudent in eating, that after this sickness, which he calls Inflammatory Fever, he will be stronger & heartier than before, & grow fast.  Dr. Crook was here this morning, & said Willy was doing well & might eat anything, but I will not follow that advice.    The rest of us are well.  Mamma is unwell. She has not been able to come in for two days.  Mr. & Mrs. Yancey came to see me yesterday; they leave next Monday.  How thankful you will be to hear Willy is so much better, you can stay at Anderson as long as you please.  Willy drinks Wine whey all day, & last night for his supper took two cups of hot water tea, one with biscuit soaked in it, the other with bread.  He is now awake, looking at me writing & looks as bright.  Dr. Crook would say as a new dollar.  Ever yours, Liz
