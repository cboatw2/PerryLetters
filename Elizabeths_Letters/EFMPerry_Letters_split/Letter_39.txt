Letter 39

Friday afternoon, 24 [22] November 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	I �I seat to write you by Col. Town[e]s.  He left this morning with Mr. Cox, but to prevent your being disappointed, I will send a few lines by Mail.  Mrs. Town[e]s� children are now here playing with Willy & Anna.  I am seated in the library, & they are playing in the balconies.  The most important incident that has occurred since you left, is the arrival of a barrel of Flour from Dr. Robinson.  It came last night.

	Susan came in yesterday afternoon & carried the children to shop.  I was too busy to go.  I received a note from Mamma today.  She said I must write & tell you to buy two cups, one for Anna from Susan, the other for Frank from Ann, and that she will make up any deficiency.  You must choose pretty ones, & we will value them as Susan�s and Anns presents.  I thought of you last night when it rained, & was afraid today would be unfavourable, but fortunately it has cleared away.  I can imagine the pleasant time you will pass this evening at Mrs. Cunninghams.  We are all quite well.  Ann had a bad night, & is very poorly.  I have nothing to write about; & as I have written this Mail, in all probability I will not write by the next.  I miss you greatly.  I think I will pay some visits during your absence.  My time is so occupied, that I am not lonely.  I think the trip to Columbia will be pleasant for you, & for something to talk about for a long time after you return.  In future if you do not hear from me, you must know that your household are all well. & that I have nothing interesting to write about, & am very busy sewing.  I have now a large basket of clothes to mend.  As it is late I must send my letter to the office.  Believe me my dear husband, Your affectionate wife, E,F.P.
