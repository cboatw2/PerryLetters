Letter 176

Greenville

My dear husband

		Reuben will start before long for you.  I will write a few lines by him.  So you will hear often enough from me.  I have just been to the Stable to see Byron.  He is very lame & can hardly walk.   I am afraid Reuben is a bad hostler.  We have such bad luck with our horses.  Byron will stay in the Stable & have a long rest, so I hope in time will be well.  Scott is languishing.  I wonder he lives so long.  We all long for you to come back, but you must not expect everything to be perfectly happy at home, for I assure you the servants, some of them are the�of my life.  Minerva�s impertinence is beyond endurance, & if it were not for her situation, I would have sent her over to Mr. Massey�s to stay, while you were away, & get some of his whippings.  This very moment she has been disobedient.  I sent her Flour this morning to make into biscuits to send to you, & she has not commenced them yet, & the meat is not even cooked, so we are now only waiting on her.  I assure you I would rejoice to leave home as often as you do, & it is your leaving it so often, makes you value it.  If you were here constantly, you would get tired of it.  So I am glad sometimes you can leave it.  I wish you a pleasant journey home, & do hope the next news I hear, is that the State has seceded.  I want some of the braves to have an opportunity of proving their valor.  They will then be cooled a little.  The weather is quite cold.  I suppose Mr. Duncan will leave Friday before the Legislature adjourns.  The next time you must go & come in the Stage.  It will in the end be the most economical.  It is strange Mr. Elford stays so long at the North.  I will now conclude.  This is my last letter.  Your attached wife, E.F.P.
