Letter 60

Tuesday night, 28 October 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	As I promised to write to you I must, & I write tonight, because tomorrow I am going to Mamma�s to help Susan work.  I was there part of yesterday & today.  You are perhaps uneasy about Willie.  All Sunday he complained of pain in his stomach, said he felt weak, & as if he would throw up.  At night I went for Dr. Earle.  Just before he came, Willie threw up some acid stuff.  It seemed to relieve him.  The Doctor said I must give him a dose of Castor Oil, & 10 drops of Laudanum.  It operated, & Willie was well enough Monday to go to school.  I dare say he will be better for that dose of Medicine.
