Letter 158

Wednesday morning, 8 May 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I have stopped in the midst of my housecleaning to write to you. but I am in such confusion, I cannot collect my ideas sufficiently to write an interesting letter.  I have had the whole house whitewashed.  When the carpet & furniture was moved out of the Dining room, the walls looked so dirty, I thought it best as I was obliged to buy yellow wash for the little dining room, to have another coat given to the big one, so it has been done.  Mr. Smith is here with his brother & will finish today.  They commenced the house yesterday & having to dismantle the whole of it  you cannot conceive the disorder it is in, but I am willing for it, for the sake of cleanliness that follows & when you see the quantity of dirt swept under the Carpet, Furniture & corners you would wonder how we could have existed.  It is well you are away.  You would have to leave on three occasions, whether business called you away or not.  Last night Anna, Fanny & myself slept in Anna�s bed.

		It is now raining a little.  Reuben & Lindy have gone regularly to the Farm.  Scott�s lameness is better.  Hochelago, yesterday laid down a good deal, & I was afraid was sick.  Charles brought Mr. Longs Dudley down who said nothing seemed the matter with him.  He expected he was suffering from the operation he had gone through.  I do not think he will ever get over that.  He seems so sad & dispirited.  It has certainly lamed him.  I  hope to hear from you tonight.  Mr. D��s came here yesterday afternoon to say a Piano had arrived, & you should have the refusal of it;  that it was a very fine instrument & Anna�s mind was capable of learning more than she did at present, & he was anxious she should commence with a class now forming.  The price of the Piano frieght  included 300 & you pay at your convenience.  Mama, Susan & myself went up to hear the Piano.  As well as we could judge it seemed a fine one.  Mr. D� sent me yesterday a letter to you, which he requested I enclose to you at Columbia, speaking of the Piano & advising Anna to learn.  I do not send it, because you will be at home so soon, you can then decide on the matter.  If you could pay for the Piano, I would like to get one, but I cannot say I wish you to go in debt for it, so we will speak on the subject when you return.  That is time enough.  He expects other Pianos which will be more reasonable, though perhaps not as good, so it is no�to determine at once.  If anyone wishes this Piano that has arrived I will call Mr. D� to let them have it.  When you return we can decide whether it is best Anna should commence at once, whether this year we can afford it.

		Mrs. Tom Rowland has a Son, & Mrs. Charles Rabb has lost hers.  You know she brought one with her from Louisiana.  It died yesterday.  Miss Markley is not expected to live long.  Mr. Choice is going soon to send the boys, under his charge to Princeton, so Mrs. Blake will lose them as scholars.  Mr. Beattie says he knows she will have a good school, but several think her terms too high.  Do you not think Mr. Croft�s plan a cunning one.  The Dr. Crofts can afford better than most to pay for their children dancing.  Old Mr. Croft can pay for Mrs. Pearsons, & yet he would wish Mrs. Blake to stay with him, save her about 30 dollars, & give his grandchildren 80 dollars worth of dancing, & speaks as if he was quite kind in making the proposal; says he would be the means of putting hundreds in her pocket, that if she makes it she shall have her glass of wine every day, as if that was really extraordinary.

		Mamma saw Mr. Arthur lately in the streets.  He seems to bear his loss well, as I said, only the week before he bought the boy for 600 dollars.  Mrs. Arthur has had headaches lately, but has not yet been in the state she usually is after her confinements.  Mrs. Thomas I believe is still suffering with her knee.  Saturday I went to see her, & she was then not able to put it to the ground.

		We are all well.  I would write more to you, if I had received a letter from you.  I hope you will get a new trial in Miss Green�s case.  Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma that E� had received my letter about the bonnet, & would purchase it, that if I had written the age of the young lady it would have been a guide but as it was she would try & do her best.  I am certain it will be a pretty bonnet, at any rate prettier than could be got here.  I will never get a bonnet in Greenville.  They are always old fashioned.

		The Drawing room is fixed, & Minerva & Mary are now fixing the Entry.  Upstairs is whitewashed but nothing else done yet.  The little dining room now is to be yellow washed.  I wish every part of the establishment just in order, but it will take a long time.  Charles is working in the garden, but is called off very often to move furniture.  I must now stop.  I went to your Office yesterday to look for writing paper but could find only this coarse kind & saw no ink.  I am badly off for all materials for writing, so you must make excuses.  I would not write today I am so busy, but you may be uneasy if you do not hear. So I write.

		I long to see you.  I forgot to send last night to the Post office, so do not know if any letters have come.  Adieu, Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
