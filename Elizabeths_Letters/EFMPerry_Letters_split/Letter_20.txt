Letter 20

Wednesday morning, 8 December 1841

My dear husband
	
	I am seated up by the fire writing to you.  Delia is making up my bed.  I expect to remain in bed a few days longer; but I am happy to tell you that I am on the recovery & in a few days expect to be quite well.  I have at last found something to do me good, & recommended by Mrs. Dr. Butler.  She met Mamma yesterday & told her she knew of something that would certainly cure me, the Shumac made into a poultice [page torn] she was going to Mrs. May�s & would get one of the servants to get some, & bring it on her way back.  So she brought it, & came up in my room, & showed Mamma how to make the poultice.  The very first one relieved me.  The lump is now getting softer, & I hope soon to be quite well.  I am now in no pain at all, but as long as I have to apply poultices I must remain in bed.  Mrs. Butler asked when I had heard from you & if you were well & her face turned red.  You know it is the first time I have been in the room with her since she insulted you.  I am sure going to forget that insult.
	There is one more improvement I wish you to come home with.  It is with a little more hair on your head.  Do you not think you could have a scratch fixed on so easily, that it would not be observed.  I think it would be the greatest improvement to you.  I am alarmed when I see how your hair is dropping out at the back of your head.  I am afraid you will soon be entirely bald.  I am not joking.  I am serious.  You had better send home your books in the stage before you come.  If there are too many for one box, pack them in different boxes.  You might send them at different times.  See them put in the stage yourself.  They would come perfectly safe.  So in your next letter write word how much the Magnifying glass & pictures cost.  I wish to know in particular, so do not forget.
	Willy is quite well & now shaking my desk.  He has of his own accord left off saying Willy�s horse & using Willy for everything & says Instead, he will say I toe, I sew & I frock [page torn] Anna is thriving.  You will find her quite improved on your return.  I must now stop writing & go back to bed & have a poultice put on.  I expect to hear from you tonight.  Excuse all mistakes, & the shocking writing.  I am holding on a poultice with one hand & writing with the other.  Your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
P.S. I am not lying in bed.  Willy�s shoes are a great deal too large.  If you get any more get them smaller.  I am sorry to tell you Delia is getting [to be] a very bad girl.  When you return you will have to take her in hand.  James has done quite well.  He goes through his routine of duties without be[ing] told.  He is a faithful servant, but Delia you have every day to follow up & see that she does her work or she will not do it.  �me very much, now.
