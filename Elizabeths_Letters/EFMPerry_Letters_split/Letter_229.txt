Letter 229

Tuesday, 12 oclock, 14 December 1852

My dear husband

	I have just written a long letter to Anna & am tired, but will now write to you.  I was very glad to receive two letters from you today, & one from Anna.  I read Anna�s to you.  She writes well, & Aunt Anna Hayne tel[l]ing her to write me word; that she did credit to her parents, is worth something, for Aunt Anna is very particular about the behaviour of children, expects more from them, than anyone I know of.  Anna asks after Hexts eye.  She ought to say his eyebrow.  Frank one day in the yard accidentally struck him on his eyebrow, & it bled, but only for a little while, & is now quite well.  I explain, for you might wonder what Anna alluded to.  I am glad she enjoys herself so much.  I was afraid she would be homesick.  Her visit will be attended with expense, but I dare say it will be of permanent benefit to her, & she will be improved & so many relations I have in town ought to see the children to feel an interest in them.  What Anna has bought will last her next winter.  I have written to her that there is so much to tempt her wishes, if they are gratified now, she must be willing to deny herself hereafter.  I think she will need more money.  If you would send her some just before you leave Columbia, I would be pleased, & it would please her to be so thoughtfully remembered by her Father.  She will not for a long time again cause us so much expense.  I am glad you have received a box.  I hope it is the one from Aunt Mary McCall.  I would wish you to send it in the quickest way, for I ought to have had it weeks ago.  I have not made a single winter article of clothing yet.  Can it not come immediately by the Stage.  Write on the box that it must be sent by the Stage.  If you have not sent it yet, or do not until you come, be sure to bring it. If it cannot come in Mr. Duncan�s carri[a]ge, send it by someone coming in the Stage.

	I am very much pleased at the good opinion the Members have of you.  It is only for you to be known to be appreciated at a distance your character is not understood, but those who know you best, respect you most.  It requires but very little exertion on your part to be rewarded with the honors others get, for I think the prejudice against you is passing away.  I hope your friends will still as they proposed show their estimate of your character by voting for you for Governor.  I do not expect you to be elected.  It will please me though for you to receive votes.  It will make them think of you another time.

	Yesterday the hogs were killed.   Today Mr. Lasly & his daughter are helping cutting the meat, drying the Lard &c.  The daughter did not come in yesterday.  I thought she was at the river when I wrote to you.  The servants are all busy.  Mr. Lasly seems very obliging.   I have been several times to the L� house since I have been writing to you.  He says we ought to have 10 Cans of Lard, but I do not think so.   Charles says we ought to have had Becky 10 years ago, that he likes her, so do all the servants.  I have not yet seen any cause to regret buying her.  Lindy did not answer, even when she tried her best.  The servants did not respect her, so it was one constant state of confusion & Minerva who we would have been obliged to take home, makes everybody unhappy about her.  Lindy in the Spring we must hire out.  We now have plenty of Milk.   We milk three Cows, the last one only commenced today.  This winter we can either churn, or have rich Milk, Syllabub, Custard &c.  We will have plenty of Meat, Sausages, spareribs &c.  The parsnips in the Garden Becky cooks delightfully, so when you return, we will live better than when you left, particularly after our Groceries come.  If Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford let you get any Sugar, & I lock it up, so the servants cannot steal it.

	Today is cold, rainy, & gloomy.  The weather has not been suitable for cleaning the yard, scouring &c.  I will be almost glad the Legislature should sit a little longer, to allow you more time to pass important bills for the reformation of the State, & the Equality of the Upper county, & allow me more time to clean the house for your reception.  It is cold.  I can hardly write.  Hext wants me, & the children are making a noise.  I will be so glad not to have to write so much when you come back.  It takes up so much time & fatigues me, so that I can hardly do anything after but rest, but for your comfort I write every day.   I hope you dined with your old friend Mr. Hearn.  In inviting the Greenville Delegation, I think Pinckney McBee ought always to be excepted, for he would be out of his place, & would not even enjoy it, & does not deserve it either, so I hope he is not included.  
	I have not heard yet of Mrs. Thompsons being confined.  I am glad you have dyed your Whiskers.  I expect your look five years younger.  You ought to have done it when you first went down.
Anything that adds to your comfort, convenience, & good looks, you must get.

	Be sure to bring the box with you or send it by the Stage.  I will be very glad to see you.  The weather is getting bad so cold cloudy & rainy, but I hope it will clear before you set off.  Be careful & not get hurt on the R[ail] Road.

	Hext if he has forgotten you, will soon remember you.  He calls Charlotte Oh Da, & when he is in my lap, & I say Oh Da come & take Hext, he clings close to me.  

	I thought you were going to buy a new W[h]ig, but perhaps the present one will do until you go the North & get one there.

	I must now close.  I wish you could go & see Col. & Mrs. Preston before you leave.  If so give all of our love to you.

	I write in a great hurry & will write until you set off to come home.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
