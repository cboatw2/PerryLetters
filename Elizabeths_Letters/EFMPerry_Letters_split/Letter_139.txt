Letter 139

Saturday night, 24 November 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

		Mr. Elford called this afternoon, to say he was to leave tomorrow for Columbia, & would take any letter or package I had for you.  I avail myself of the opportunity to send both, for I have a pr ofto, you had better get him some new ones to you, so I send them now, with a Shoe to have them made the size of.  1.25 is what they used to ask, even for yours, which are so large.  Perhaps the men will make them for less.  I am very fond of these kind of Shoes, & I have just worn out a pr, & wish these to supply their place.

		I am writing sooner than I expected to, & had not supplied myself with writing materials.  This accounts for my blotted paper, the only sheet in the desk, & there is hardly any ink in the inkstand.  I have thought of Willie & yourself constantly since yesterday morning.  In the afternoon Anna went home with Fanny Town[e]s, so I have been unusually quiet & lonely.  Tomorrow afternoon Instead of going to church I will go for Anna.  She was delighted to go.  She is of a very social disposition.  Frank seems lost by himself.  He liked the girls school better than he expected, & went off willingly yesterday afternoon.  Fanny is very merry &�.  Last night I invited Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon to take tea.  They had told me they would come over one evening socially, & I thought I had better invite them at once.  We spent quite a pleasant evening, conversing, & looking at pictures & books.  Fanny was the life of the evening & very entertaining.  This morning Mamma Susan & Ann came in to shop & pay me a visit.  Mamma brought a kind letter she had received from Miss Drayton.  In it she mentioned that Paul Hayne had received  the Gold Medal as a reward for Elocution, & that she heard him speak, & he well deserved it.  I saw also by last nights paper that he had received it.  I am glad, as it has gratified his Mother, I am sure & will be encouragement to him   Miss Drayton mentioned that Dr. Tiddyman had sent up trimmings for the altar & pulpit of the Episcopal Church, & wished to know if they had been received.  Said he was soon to cross the Atlantic.  She mentioned that her nephew & our cousin Wm Ford, had by collecting money for the Library society & in other ways doing business more efficient to reenter College himself.  He was a young man of talent, & highly thought of.  �his Uncle Tiddyman without denying himself in the least have given him the money & educated him.  Some abound with money, others have to struggle for it, even to get an education.  

		I asked Mrs. Town[e]s to take tea with me this evening socially, but her baby was not well enough for her to come.  Reuben & Charles have been ploughing, & this afternoon Reuben cleaned the carri[a]ge.

		A man yesterday brought me your Office key, which I was very glad you sent.  I looked in the Drawer after you left, & not seeing it, knew you had carried it with you, & intended requesting you to send it back by some one, that I might have your office well cleaned.

		A letter came last night from Mr. Taylor, saying your writing to Nancy Saterfield had done good, for she had since called on him & promised to pay what she owed him, that if she did not he would let you know.  

		Mrs. Kingsland has just sent me a Pumpkin pie & said if it was not Saturday night, she would come down & sit with me, & she sent word Mrs. Arthur had received the trimmings, & they would keep it for the new Church.

		You have now been two days in Columbia & seen of course a great many people.  I  am anxious to know how Willie gets on, whether he enjoys himself & whether you are able to manage his dressing, so as to make him appear to the greatest advantage, the little minutia of combing & curling his hair well, turning down his Collar & Waistband neatly, arranging his Cravat, for by this time he has one.  All these little things are so important to the making a neat appearance, & a Father overlooks, but a Mother attends to with particularity.  I wish Willie to look his best now, for so many will see him, who know me, & I wish him to do credit to me & what is more important, he must behave himself so as to do credit to his parents; behave as his did on his first visit to town,  when his fiends said , he committed not one impropriety.  I hope to see him return improved in every respect, in character manners & appearance.  He is where he can profit more than here, running about the streets, & playing marbles with the W�, V� &c, & it was to avoid the bad habits & manners contracted in such company that I wished him to go with you.  The more he can be with you, the better it will be for him.  If he is tired or gives you trouble, he can return with someone. But I hope you have found it pleasant to have him, & that he enjoys himself.  You have of course�your appearance before this.  I expect I would hardly know you if I were to see you now.  You were indeed getting quite shabby when you left.  If you can find clothes to fit Willie, you had better get him some new ones.  Except his Boston suit, he has never had any yet to set well on him.  In future I expect a Tailor will have to cut for him.  He will be obliged to get a cap or hat when he returns, so if you see pretty & reasonable ones supply him with that article at least, & get some fashionable covering for Franks head.  With regard to my present, I wish to impress it on you, that I am not so anxious for something warm, that you should get it, whether expensive pretty or not.  Miss Drayton & others say, that Charleston is overflowing with pretty & reasonable of every description.  I would much rather always get what I wish in Charleston where there is a greater choice.  So if you do not see a Shawl�Mantilla or little Cloak or whatever is worn both reasonable & pretty in Columbia, I beg you to get nothing for me.  I will wait until you return, & then send to Charleston for something.  I wish something very pretty & reasonable too, & I am afraid, such cannot be got in Columbia, a place not calculated for either fashion or cheapness.  Write me when you can, & when you cannot, tell Willie to, but his letters must not be too short.  Frank said I must be sure & tell you to buy him a drum or trumpet & ball & I don�t know what all.  Fanny talks of the Cocoa nut cake.  You supplied me so well with money, if yours gives out, you must write to me for some.  Tell Willie I hope to hear he has been a good boy.  Perhaps I may not write again until I hear from you.  Yours, E.F.P.
