Letter 217

Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter mentioning Anna had left, & I am very glad to hear from you.  I hope the Mail will continue to come regularly, & you to write every day.  If you do not, I will miss the letters so much.  It gives me something to think of each day, but you must not again mention honors offered you, & declined by you.  You must if it is only for my sake, accept them, for you know I expect to be unhappy, until you are elected to some Office, that will make me feel, you are appreciated by your fellow men, that your noble independence & disinterestedness, has been rewarded.  So I hope you will be run for Governor, even if you are defeated, it will be of benefit to you at some future time.  Your name will be brought forward, & the next time you will be elected to that or some other office.  But I hope you will now be elected, & if you consent that your friends  should interest themselves for you, you will,  you must not be so indifferent to these worldly honors.  For the sake of your childrens future benefit, you should exert yourself more to advance your name & reputation.  If you had been married to a Lady like Mrs. Brockman you might remain satisfied as you are.  She would have had no aspirations  for you, & would have been contented & happy, but I am different.  My desire is to have you exalted in Station, for you are of a superior order of being, & deserve the highest honors in the gift of the people, & until you get one Honor that will show to the world, that your fellow men have appreciated you as you deserve, I cannot be satisfied.  It is not for myself that I wish it but for you.  I am contented to remain in obscurity so you meet your reward.  But I cannot be satisfied until you are rewarded in the way I wish, not as you say a good conscience, is all you look for.  I look for something more.    So I hope you will be elected Governor.  If you are not, as you have elected Judge Evans a Senator, you ought to be elected Judge in his place.  So you must return either Governor or Judge. In one other thing also you have acted as you usually do, giving place to others,  the bill giving the Presidential Election to the people, you first introduced, & have made the people determine to have this Session when the bill can pass, & you ought to have the credit of, you have let Mr. Poppenheim take from you, so instead of your name going down to posterity as the Author of this great reformation, you quietly give it to another, when you are the one who deserve it.

	I will write to Anna today.  I am glad she enjoyed herself in Charleston, & received so much kindness.  I am willing for her to remain several weeks in Charleston & even the whole winter if her friends wish it.  Two weeks is too short a time for her to stay.  You can come home, & she come up with someone who will be coming.  Mrs. Elford goes down Monday & will stay 3 weeks.  Anna can come back with her or someone else, after the trouble & expense  of getting ready & sending her down she ought to stay 3, 4, or 5 weeks at least.  I do not know when she will go again.  But I dare say Aunt Eliza will write to me about her staying, & I can then determine how long she had best stay.  I know there will be plenty of opportunities for her to return.

	I will speak to Mr. Hoke about the Hogs, & the first cold weather get him to buy some.  At present it is too warm.  It is today raining, but I dare say it will clear up cold.  We are all well, & coming on quite well.  I keep house in more comfort than I did, & when you return, hope to live systematically, & have everything in order.

	Frank goes to school.  He seems a favorite with everybody.  Willie reads & cuts & hauls wood.  I would much rather him be with you.  He would improve in character & manners more than here.  In future you had better carry him.  I dare say Mr. Janney would not charge for Willie, if he occupied the same room with you.  

	You must have been pleased at Gov. Swains remembering you so kindly.  It is a pity you had not both met as Governors.  It would have been an interesting incident.  Two school mates being elevated to the same office, & meeting after 30 years had elapsed.  

	I never know of any news to tell you.  A letter came from Mr. Hamilton today enclosing a second check for 300 dollars, In place of the one that you wrote word you had not received.  I suppose this second one will be of no use to you now.  But I will keep it carefully until you return.  If you have 400 dollars in your pocket book, & Mr. Gladden pays you 100, you can pay for Becky.  What next you receive pay your other debts with, & I hope next year being the�of debt, & even have some to invest profitably for future use.

	I am afraid the Railroad will constantly be injured by these rains.  It passes over so many water courses.  I should think it was not built well, or managed well.  You had better have the carri[a]ge sent for you to Columbia or hire a conveyance.  The horses are quite well & the animals generally.  Charles until the rain was digging ground nuts, & Reuben hauling wood.  Mr. Lasly is cutting down trees for the Log house.   

	I write to you every day.  As you were so extravagant in buying Anna a Medallion, I was induced to buy something for the house which we much need, an Entry carpet 21 yds at 1 dollar a yd.  The Oil Cloth is completely worn out, & I have bought a beautiful Carpet, only two thirds more than the Medallion cost, & will be much more useful, & add to the beauty & comfort of the house.  It would take all of my money to pay for it, so I will not pay until you return.  I have only bought what servants clothes was necessary, but it costs a great deal, & to keep the house for so large a family.  

	I am glad you are spending your time pleasantly with congenial spirits.  It is what I wish you would always enjoy.  Greenville is too little & contracted & narrow a sphere for you.  I must now conclude.  Ever Truly Yours, E.F.P.

Dear Mama

	I wrote yo Papa yesterday and so will write to you today.  I have not written to you in a long time, because I have enjoyed myself so much that I have not had time to write to you.  I arrived here Wednesday evening safely.  I came down with Mr. & Mrs. Trimmier.  They were staying at the same Hotel with us & perhaps I will go up with them, for they will be going up about the same time that I will.  I spent Tuesday with cousin Elise Martin in Columbia.  She had just arrived two days before & came for me to go to her house.  I did not see Cousin Sarah Taylor because she was too unwell.  Yesterday I went to see Aunt Annie, aunt Mary Hayne, and aunt Anna Turnbull, and aunt Martha, but I did not see aunt Harriet.  I suppose that she had gone in the country with aunt Sarah Matthew�s.  Cousin Susan took me to see them.  I would have gone to see my other aunts if it had been a good day.  It was cloudy all day and rained some.  I also went up S� street, and I had my ear�s bored, and bought me a pair of gaiter boot�s, and a pair of gloves.  I just have finis[h]ed practicing.  I thought I would have forgotten my Tune�s, but I still knew them, and I am going to practice regularly every day.  I enjoy myself very much.  All of my aunts seemed glad to see me, and wished Fanny had come too.  They say that they would not have known me.  They do not think that I look at all like you, but the image of Papa.  I will have to write Papa sometimes too, and so you must not expect a letter every day.  You must write to me soon.  Tell Grandmama aunt Susy, aunt Annie Frank Fanny Willie all howdye for me and give Hext a kiss for me.  Tell Willie he must write to me.  Your affectionate Daughter, Anna

My letter is written so hurriedly read it yourself & tell Aunt Eliza my messages.
