Letter 179

Saturday morning, [1850]
[Greenville]

My dear husband 

		Since I sealed my letter an event has occurred, which I must inform you of.  This morning about 4 oclock I was awoke[n] by a wrapping at the back door, & Edward came to say his Mother was sick, & wanted Mom Phillis.  She must be sent for.  She had not expected to be confined until after Christmas, & she fell back in her chair yesterday, which I suppose must have caused her to be sick prematurely, so I was dreading the dangerous time she would have.  Not half an hour after I sent Lindy to know she was, & she said Mom Phillis was there, & the baby too, & that the baby had been born before Mom Phillis came.  May who I had sent to stay with Elisa, says she went down in the kitchen to get a longer candle, & while there the baby was born.  Only Charles was in the room with her, so I suppose he acted the part of Midwife.  The baby is very small, which I suppose is the reason she had so good a time, & weakly sickly persons always suffer up, than the healthy & strong.  So I am very glad & thankful it is safely over with her.  It is a boy, so it will be Fanny�s waiting man.

		I forgot to tell you, that you must write letters to as many persons here as you possibly can.  I think Mr. Nicol would be glad to hear from you; write to Mr. Hoke, Mr. Croft, old Mr. McBee & other persons in the village & county.  Col. Jones goes to Columbia today, but I send my letter by Mail, as you once told me always to, as they were not delivered to you so soon.

		No letters except those two I mentioned the contents to you have come; 3 pages from Philadelphia begging you to exchange with them came yesterday.  When you are Editor I hope you will receive books & periodicals in abundance.  Mr. Burt�s order to have the Prospectus published for what he was to be paid, was not forgotten, strange the workmen forgot to publish the explanation, but not the Prospectus, & I expect he has forgotten it to this day.  Do you remember.  I will never forgive you, if you vote for Mr. Burt, or Mr. Memminger, or Mr. Rhett for I suppose someone besides Mr. Hammond will oppose Mr. Rhett.  Poor man whenever Mr. Hammond comes forward before the public, his bad conduct is mentioned.  It would be well if all wickedness brought its punishment, as his has done.  I expect he will be afraid to run, for fear of developments.  It is a gloomy day, again, but not raining at this moment.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s sent to ask me to go & see her, but I am not going, on account of Mr. Sam Town[e]s, who has acted dishonorably to you,  I sent Mr. O�Hanlon�s letter & Mr. Petigru�s to Mr. Arthur to read.  He told me he would be glad to see them.  I hope he read[s] them to Mr. Campbell.  I wish my dear husband you could be elected President of the College or Bank, or have some honorable office bestowed on you, as Law is getting scarce.  Write me who you think will be elected Solicitor.  I do hope Mr. Young will; even Mr. Duncan ought to vote for him. after such an�ful conduct in the Greenville Candidate.  In haste, E.F.P.
