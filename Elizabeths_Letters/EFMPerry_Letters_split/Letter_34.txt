Letter 34

Monday morning, 11 December 1843
Greenville

My dear husband

	As you do not seem to know exactly when you will be at home & you will be uneasy if you do not hear, I will write a letter, so if you remain in Columbia this week you will hear from me.  You must not return home one day sooner than your business permits.  Stay as long as you ought to; work hard now, for you will have a long rest.  If you run for Solicitor, do not think of returning until the election is over.  Mr. Croft told me yesterday he heard you were to be Solicitor.  If you think you would be elected, I would like you to be a Candidate.  The Legislature you have served so well, ought to give you any office you ask for.  But I will not give you any advice on the subject, but leave you to act as you think best.  

	As you will be uneasy about home, the next time you leave, I will write every Mail.  I will do anything to satisfy you, to make you happy & easy & willing to stay from home.  If you like to hear from me you must remain a long time absent, that you may receive a great many letters.  It almost provokes me that as soon as you leave home you should be thinking of returning, & particularly when returning would be detrimental to your interest.  I am really shocked at your childishness.  Why surely you would not run for Solicitor, & then come home before the election is decided, & give such an advantage to your opponents.  I hope your good judgment will not allow you to act so foolishly.  If you do, your influence over me is gone, for I do not think of being guided by one who will act so strangely as that.  I will have no further confidence in your understanding.  I make home too pleasant for you.  I intend now to grumble & scold & complain, & make you so unhappy, that you will be glad to get away, & dread returning.  I regard your interest  so much, that if your writing to me, interfered in any way with your business I would not wish you to write, though I derive so much pleasure from your letters.  I am writing today merely to keep you quiet, for I write with the greatest inconvenience to myself.  It is washing day, so that Lindy is Frank�s nurse, & of course he is fretting, & I have to stop every now & then to quiet him, & also to interfere with Willy & Anna who are now quarreling on the floor.  If you are in Columbia Wednesday night & do not hear from I am afraid Thursday morning you would start home, even if you were in the midst of an important case, or the election for Solicitor had not come on.  For the sake of your clients, I must keep your mind easy, to enable you to do justice to their cases,  Perhaps the constant uneasiness you have been in, from hearing from home only every other Mail has been the cause of your losing so many cases.

	I am glad the Rail road stock has fallen, otherwise I might be disposed to murmur at your selling your shares for so little.  You will now just be able to pay your debts & feel free again.  Aunt Eliza in her last letter to Mamma said, Mr. Hayne was not unmindful of her letter on the subject of giving you my portion of my Fathers estate, that he thought Mamma was able to do it & much approved her intention; that her income is at this time better by 200 dollars than it was some years ago.  This resulted from the increased value of Bank Stock, in some investments he made for her by your advice.  That Mr. Hayne will write soon a full statement of my claim upon my Father�s estate, & of Mamma�s affairs in general.  If I do get my portion how delighted I will be, for it will be something to depend on against a rainy day, & you can improve it for the children.

	I went to see Ann yesterday after church.  She was seated, or rather laying down in her chair which she likes as much, as suffering as she does, she can like anything.  It supersedes the necessity of Ann being held, & is a great relief to Mamma & Susan.  It is a noble chair, well worth 20 dollars.  Ann liked the oranges & Pine Apple very much, & said I must thank you for them.  We all enjoyed them.  It was fortunate I wrote you that Ann had a chair.  If you had bought the other, you would have been obliged to have kept it for yourself.

	I have written a long letter to Pamela.  Mrs. Croft has heard lately from her, & she is better.  I wish you would pass a night with them on your return, & comfort them about John.  I wrote her you thought you would gain his case.  It would be very unfortunate for Mr. Yancey to be put in Jail when his wife is sick.  If all challenges were followed by such consequences, duelling would be put a stop to.  Yesterday was a beautiful day.  I went to church morning & afternoon.  Mr. Pinckney looks quite well & rather fatter.  Old Mr. Pinckney & his wife & youngest daughter left for the lower country today.  Mr. Pinckney inquired after you & offered to take any commands to you.  I would have written by him but feared he would be a long time on the road.  As he was so polite, if you see him in Columbia you must speak to him.  This morning the sun shone, but now it is raining hard, & Minerva & Delia are at the spring washing.  You could not have had worse weather than we have had.  I bought Saturday some delightful apples from your client Mr. Sherman.  He gave me the history of them the�he brought from New England & grafted.  His manners were like Mr. Burts, when he said he was well acquainted with you, which caused me to ask his name.  I thought he would say Burt.  He says they will keep all winter, until apple trees bloom.

	Aunt Eliza wrote about Fanny�s wedding.  She says she could pronounce Capt. Beall an estimable man from his countenance & deportment, which is marked by modest simplicity which seldom[page torn] to a trifling character.  He is certainly well looking & prepossessing, modest & manly in address &[page torn] & quite disposed to regard them in a friendly manner.  Uncle Arthur thinks very highly of him, but feels much in parting with Fanny to such a destiny.  They are to pass this winter in Washington but his station is Louisiana.  He has no resource but his profession.  Fanny only won the consent of her Father, though he very highly estimates Capt. Beall.

	Aunt Eliza says she heard I was going to town with my little ones; that she thinks it very desirable I should & truly wishes she could lead the way in urging it as a visit to herself but that Mamma knows her situation which hampers her wishes on subjects of this kind.  She thinks it greatly to be desired that I should make my children known to their friends, that intercourse fosters affection.  Aunt Martha McCall she says expressed a great desire to see the children, & Aunt Anna Turnbull said she wished I would come.  Aunt Martha often refers to their broken up condition as a family.  Aunt Eliza says she often thinks how much the sight of Mamma & hers would gratify all of her friends.

	Aunt Eliza says Mr. Rhett died a Christian, & that this was not the result of a death bed repentance, for the last two years he had been very serious, & would have made an open profession of religion had Mr. Barnwell encouraged him to do so.  His illness was short but he was very sensible of his approaching end & perfectly calm & resigned.  He said to his brother Barnwell, �What now is ambition? & lamented that his life had been passed in pursuits which belong to this world only.  His brother Edmund arrived after his death & clung to the mournful relics in the bitterness of grief, but thanked God that his brother died a Christian.  Mrs. Rhett is with her Mother.  She is resigned & submissive tho she can only lift her hands & weep.

	Only two letters have come for you, the one from Mr. Fabers agent & one last night from Wesley Robertson, & no one has enquired for you but Mr. Sherman, who said he would get some counsel from you on your return.  So you see you lose nothing by being absent.  As you have spent $900 this year in servants, we will visit town if nothing happens next Spring twelve months.  I must see your Gold pen before I can judge if it was a wise purchase.  You will get tired of it before the half of fifty years, & I rather think it will not be a good pen then the fifth of that time.  I have just received a note from Susan.  She says Ann appreciates your kindness in thinking of the chair for her.  If you see a pretty prayer book for about $1.25 bring it to me to give to Ann or if you chose you can give it as your present.  I hope this letter will find you in Columbia.  Do not hurry home.  The longer you stay the more glad we will be to see you.  Do you think you will get Willy a horse or not?  Truly yours, E.F.P.
