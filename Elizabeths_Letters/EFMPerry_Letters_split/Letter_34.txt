Letter 34

Sunday evening, 1 December 1844
Greenville  

My dear husband

       I have just received a letter from you, which I will answer, along with the one received last Friday.  Do not begin talking already about home.  I should think the scolding wife, bad children, & worthless servants you always find there would make you regard home with anything but pleasure.  I think going from home very pleasant, & am writing anxiously to have your permission, to leave it for a short time.  The next Mail I expect to receive permission, & then I will make preparations to go as soon as possible.  I wish to go very much, & the children are very anxious.  I think after carrying me, Jim had better return home, to attend to things.  I will see that everything goes on well during my absence.  Indeed there is no objection to my going, & I hope you will not be so unreasonable as to object.  If you have, think the matter over & decide differently, & write me word I may go.  I think I can get off by the 11th.  You must stop on your way from Columbia, or if you prefer it, return home first & then come for me.  I would like to pass Christmas there, so you might come a day or two before Christmas.  If I set off here the 11th I would get to Mrs. Cunninghams the 13th so if I staid until Christmas, it would be only allowing 12 days for my visit.
       
       Mamma has received no letter yet from her friends.  I wish you would write us all the particulars of Uncle Haynes death, when he was taken sick, how long he was sick, if his children were all with him, & so on.  You can ask Mr. Martin.  Mamma is uneasy about her business, & does not know who will attend to it, or how it will be managed.  She wishes, & so do I that after the Session is over, you should go to town, if it is only one day to attend to it for her.  As it is so convenient now to go on the Rail road, & a short visit, would not be very expensive.  I hope you will oblige us by going.  I think it absolutely necessary, you should, to prevent confusion in Mamma�s affairs.  Mr. Hayne is indeed a loss to her.  I know often she would have lost property, if it had not been for his watchfulness.  Once negroes that were mortgaged to her, were about to be sold, when he discovered it & prevented it, & he had trouble in securing to her Roumillato house.  I hope when Mamma receives a letter, some mention will be made of her affairs, but I rather think you will have to go & see about them, & it would be more convenient to go from Columbia, & less expensive than from Greenville, & if it is necessary, you will certainly not refuse to give Mamma this proof of your friendship.  So our minds will rest easy on that point.  
       
       I am surprised Mr. Roper has given you no package for Susan.  He was to have given you her watch & something else, & you were to open the letter directed to Mr. or Mrs. Roper.  I do not know which, & pay whatever the articles amounted to that Mrs. Roper bought.  I believe Mamma sent more than enough money to pay for them, & it would have been convenient to her, if you could have brought any money that was over, back with you.  I am not anxious about Mr. Earle�s election.  He is rich enough to do without office.  Someone poorer deserves it.  Mr. Butlers I am anxious about.  He I expect is very poor, has a large family, & has been an attentive Lawyer for some years, & entitled to the office he seeks.  I do not think Mr. Elford as a Christian even, ought to have opposed him, for he has just commenced practicing Law, has one office already, no children to support yet. Has got property by his wife.  I hope Mr. Butler will be elected.
       
       I am glad you are seated by Mr. Young, for it is well for you to associate with Upper country gentlemen.   It is from them all you have to hope for in this world depends, unless you are thinking of being Governor, or United States Senator.  But for the present, I am satisfied with you as State Senator, & if you only keep the honour, will not aspire to more, though when you see fit to become a Member of Congress, I will certainly not object.  Do in writing letters for the Mountaineer, be careful in expressing your opinion., so as not to give offence to anyone, & be sure & not say anything against Texas.  If you cannot say anything in her favour, also do not mention her.  I wish you to please in every respect a people who have been so good to you, & not make yourself enemies by imprudent remarks.  You must take this advice in good part, & profit by it.  I am glad you have gained a case.  I suppose there are so many candidates because times are hard, & persons can find no way of supporting themselves.  How can you say you have nothing to write about, when you are in Columbia, & see so many people.  Your trunk not enough.  I begrudge money spent in Columbia.  For I believe you give almost twice as much for anything as in Charleston.  Mr. McKay said he believed Mr. Yancey would not be able to go to Columbia, & regretted it, as he was anxious to see you.  Mr. McKay is said to be engaged to Miss Atwood & Miss Austin is engaged to Mr. Hill, Mrs. Duncan�s brother, perhaps the one we saw at the Chick Springs.  
       
       The servants have given me no trouble, & if they do I will take it calmly & not be worried.  The children are well.  Willy has improved in his reading.  He takes more interest in it, & will know a good many stories to read to you.  The animals are all well, except a [page torn] one of Cows stepped on.  John says, Mr. Hoke said, you must give him two of the Berkshires just born, but Mr. Hoke cannot give away your pigs, although he lent you the sou for as long as you support it, it is yours, so if you give the pigs to John , twill be as your own.  I went to church this morning & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Pinckney.  This afternoon took a ride with Susan & Mamma.  
        
	I think Frances by this late act of hers, has proved herself worthy of her uncle Mr. H.L. Pinckney.  She must be low indeed to connect herself with such a person as Mr. Elam Sharpe.  Mr. Pinckney here says he is not even intelligent.  Frances must have been anxious to be married and lost to all pride of feeling, which every lady ought to have.

	   Your letters give me great pleasure, but you must not let them interfere with your other engagements.  As all are so glad you are back in the Legislature, you must try & perform your duty there well.  I am very glad you are there.  It is something pleasant to think of.  You ought to be there if only for my sake.  Greenville is so dull.  If you were here, you would wish yourself away.  I am glad you are away this dull season.  I get along well without you, so do not be uneasy, & I hope you will let me recreate a little.  Yours, Liz

Benjamin Perry
