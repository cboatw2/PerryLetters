Letter 260

Sunday, 8 May 1853

My Dear Mamma

 	This is Sunday morning and we had intended going to church, but the rain prevented us.  It also rained last Wednesday, and I expect you do not have as much rain in Charleston as we have here.  I do not expect the Smallpox could have been bad or you would have went on.  Reuben said that you were not certain that you would go on if it was ther[e], but I never heard you say anything about it.  Mayday is past and Aunt Susan read me her letter�to you in which she told you about it.  She did not like the way Mrs. Earle did about the wreaths.  We had enough to eat upon a table in the yard, and we had enough of dancing also.  I danced some.  The dancing continued until late at night and it was twelve oclock when I got home.  Hudson stayed with me that night, and as we had holiday the next day he stayed  with me also until after dinner and then went home.  Aunt Susan likes very much.  I wrote a letter to Papa last Wednesday for one he wrote me before.  I wish you would write to me some, or as I expect you will be very busy in shopping and visiting.  You must tell Anna to write me, and tell her that if she will write to me I will write to her.  I am now writing upon that Aunt Brewton gave to me and you must tell her that I thank her very much, and give my love to all my relations.  I am writing in the Library and Aunt Susan has just come in and says that as I am writing she does not think she will as there is no use in both of us writing.  She says that I must tell you that we are getting on well considering there are so many together.  She says that Mrs. Caroline Reardon who was Miss Rinehart is coming to live in Greenville , and this is another reason that she is glad she has got out of the McBee family as Mrs. Reardon has such a tongue and temper.  And she says that Luther [McBee] contualy been sending notes and messages.  I must now stop writing.  You must excuse me for all the mistakes in this letter.  Frank has written to you but he would not let me read his letter.  Give my love to Anna.  You must bring me a pretty present.  Your affectionate son, William H, Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
[Charleston]
