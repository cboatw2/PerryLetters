Letter 187

Sunday, 2 oclock, [ca. November 1851]
Dreenville

My dear husband

		According to promise I have taken up my pen to write to you, but with literally nothing to write about.  The clock struck 4 as the stage drove off, so you really got up unnecessarily early.  Another time I will not arouse you as I did.  I slept soundly until morning, when I awoke feeling very much fatigued from my disturbance in the night.  The children slept late, & as it proved to be a very unpleasant day, we resolved not to go to church, to hear one of Mr. Arthurs old sermons, so we read the services at home, & got through only a little while ago.

		Mr. Tindall left an advertisement about his writing in the walk, with a bird drawn on paper with a pen.  I told the children whichever of them behaved the best should have the bird so I put their names on paper & whenever they misbehaved gave them a mark.  Thus far Willie & Fanny have behaved the best, & bid fair one of them to get the bird.

		I received a note from Susan [a] little while ago.  She asked if you had left, & said you had gloomy weather.  It has been cloudy all day, gloomy & dull.  I hope you are wrapped up warm, & getting along comfortably.  I told Reuben to go to Mr. Suddeths & ask him to come tomorrow to look at the Cows, that if he went this morning, this afternoon he would go to church.  He said he would, but I have not seen him since, & do not know if he went or not.

		I have had the dining table moved into the small dining room, & we will take our meals there now.  It makes it so pleasant to have the table in a different room from the one we sit in.  When you come back I hope the rooms will both be fixed nicely carpeted & cleaned, & our chamber also looks more comfortable with a carpet which it has needed so long.

After dinner

		We have eat[en] dinner, & it is now raining a little.  The winter has continued gloomily.  I hope the end will be pleasanter than the beginning.  If you would like Willie & Anna or one of them to commence writing under Mr. Tindall let me know & I will let them begin.  I see from his advertisement  that he does not charge unless you improve.  Hext is doing pretty well, seems not have experienced any bad effects from the Magnesia.

		My eyes hurt me in consequence of my loss of sleep last night.  I can hardly keep them open, & as soon as I have done writing, I will lay down on the sofa & take a nap.

		Take care of yourself & come back quite well.  I have read the Patriot through, your Editorial twice.  Bill Smith�s letter is an amusing one, & the peice on the Union from the Louisville Journal very good.  I hope Mr. Duncan, Col. Brockman & yourself are getting along in friendship & harmony.  You have stood by each other too long, to be separated easily. 

		The children are talking, Anna is writing to you, but I do not know that she will send her letter.  I will finish before her.

		I believe I have nothing more to write, having parted so recently.  I will conclude as usual with a little advice.  Distinguish yourself this Session, as I think you generally do, introduce all the improvements you mentioned in your Editorial last night.  I think the road tax for the poor man is unjust.  The Election of the Commissioner ought to be given to the people, as well as President & Governor, & indeed all the changes you named ought to be adopted by the State.  Do all you can for the best interests of the State & your District Greenville, get money to build a new Court House, & in short prove yourself to be as hitherto the best member ever sent from Greenville, & I hope you may yet meet the reward you deserve, & which you have not got yet.  Adieu.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
