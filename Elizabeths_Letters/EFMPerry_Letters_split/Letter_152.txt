Letter 152

Friday morning. [1849]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will write  you a few lines, as it may be a comfort to hear from home tomorrow if you are�that long at Laurens perhaps I ought not to write,  You may not care to hear so often, but I judge of you by myself, & when absent from you, my only comfort is your letters.  Mary I am sorry to say is sick, but I expect not seriously.  She complained yesterday of pain in her stomach, so could do not any work.  I gave her castor oil, & pepper tea & put on mustard plasters.  Today she said she felt no better, so I sent for Dr. Crook.  Think it safer a Doctor should see her, & he says she has cold & must take Parsley root tea with Nitre in it, & iron herself with a warm iron, so I hope & suppose she will soon be well.  It puts me to great inconvenience having her sick, & Minerva on finding she had to do some of her work, was most impertinent, but I need not dwell on this subject, for you know I have never had your sympathy or aid in helping me in these domestic things & I always look to others for sympathy.

		Mrs. Kingsland & her youngest sister came to see me yesterday.  These are all I have seen since I wrote, & I have not been out.

		I am almost sorry Dr. Teague paid you.  I so prefer your having a note, drawing Interest, & if associates children  take part of your Rail Road Stock, you will not have so very much to pay.  You had better keep only one thousand or 1500 yourself, & they take the rest, even if Mr. Foster takes some. 

		The children & myself are well.  Fanny sweeter than ever.  Last night at support Anna said something about your drinking hot water tea when you were a little boy.  Fanny got quite offended, & said to me almost crying �Tanner calls Pa a boy, Pa aint a boy,� I said �what is he, is he not a gentleman,� she said, ��no. Pa is Pappy.  Pa is Pappy.�  She is always saying something sweet & affectionate.  The children go regularly to school.   Dr. Simons seems kinder since his disappointment, than he was before.  I hear that Mr. Leary has asked Mr. Erwin, who teaches at Spartanburg to assist him, perhaps Mr. Stevens declined coming.

		I hope Mr. Farleys business will be profitable to you.  The woman who murdered her husbands mistress, sa�ied her revenge for, she ought to have shown her contempt for her & him by leaving him, to the enjoyment of one he preferred to her.

		I hope to hear from you tonight.  You need not be uneasy about Mary.  When you return Sunday, I dare say she will be up, at her work.  Dr. Crook said he wished to see you about his Turnpike road, that he expected he would not be able to go to Columbia himself.  

		Mrs. Durbec sent me word a few days ago, that she had received a letter from Mrs. Blake, who sent her love to me, & said she had written to me, & wished to know if I had received the letter.

		Mr. Sam Town[e]s left for Florida a day or two ago.  We have still pleasant weather.  I am glad negroes are rising though perhaps it is no advantage to us, who have, except Jim, none to dispose of, & I expect you have not determined to dispose of him.  If ordinary men servants sell for one thousand, he with his trade, ought to sell for 1500.  I will be willing to sell him when you can get that.  You know Sheriff a common negro & a rogue into the bargain sold for 1200.  Betsy, Jims wife has returned from the Limestone Springs.  I expect Jim has forgotten her.

		We will all be very glad to see you Sunday & you no doubt glad to see us.  I have nothing of interest to write about.  I am sorry Miss Dillard cannot have her case tried.  She is quite unfortunate.  I expect she will often be inconvenienced in the same way.  If her mother is good for the note, no matter if she does not pay it now, though I would rather have her money & Dr. Teagues note.

		Believe me my dear husband as I ever have & ever will be your attached, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
