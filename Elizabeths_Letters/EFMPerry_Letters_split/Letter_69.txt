Letter 69

Monday, I wrote to Mamma & Susan this morning to consult them whether it were best to put off the party.  They & Mr. McBee think of course it ought to be.  As we pay you the compliment, I hope you will be pleased.  I believe no wife would give a party only a few days before her husband�s return instead of waiting for his arrival.  So we will welcome you home cheerfully.  All the preparations will be made during your absence.  You will not be troubled with them, & the night after your arrival it shall be.  You will have an opportunity of meeting many of your constituents & telling them the news.  So I hope my dear husband you will appreciate our motive & feel the compliment.  As so many gentleman have their wives with them in Columbia, it cannot be very troublesome attending to them, so next Winter you must have Willie with you.  He will be worth showing.  Susan wrote me such a kind note about you that I enclose it for you to read.  It will be worth the postage 5 cts.
