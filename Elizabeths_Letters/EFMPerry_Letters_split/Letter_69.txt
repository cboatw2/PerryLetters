Letter 69

Saturday night, 31 October 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I will now write you a letter & send it by Mr. Elford who goes to Pickens tomorrow.  It is more convenient to send it to him than to Mr. Spears, being so much nearer.  We are all quite well.  Frank is now I think as well as ever.  He eats a good deal, but seems to experience no bad effect from it, & as he only eats wholesome things, I do not think it will injure him.  He talks a good deal of you, & is impatient for your return, as all of us are, but though missing you so much, I am glad you should be detained by business, so do not return one�before you ought to.  Never leave while there is the least probability of your getting business, as that is our support.  I am anxious you should have as much of it as possible.  Among some visits I paid yesterday, I went to see Mrs. Elford & I saw Mr. Elford.  I liked him very much. He says the lawyers here are very anxious you should be made Judge, as it would be to their interest, throwing your business into their hands.  My dear husband there is nothing that would please me more, than that you should be elevated to the bench, & if there is the least probability of your succeeding you must try for it, & a Chancellor would be the very thing for you.  There will be a good many vacancies on the bench soon.  Judge Johnson, Richardson & Harper, so I should think you stand as good a chance as any one else of succeeding one of them.  So you must let yourself be talked of in reference to it.  You are now as much from home as a Judge is, & have much more disagreeable duties to perform, & not so well paid, particularly now, when Law business is scarce, & a Judge is more respectable than anyone.  I prefer it to being a Member of Congress.  You must make exertions yourself to get the office.  You must not expect to have it given to you without your trying for it, but don�t mention any of this & we will talk about it when you come home.  I went to the wedding with Mr. & Mrs. Town[e]s.  Susan or Mr. McBee did not go.  They were neither of them well, & even otherwise, she could not have left the baby, Mamma being sick also.  The room was crowded, only one being opened to receive the company.  I could not see half the persons who were there, but it was not such a general invitation.  As to Butlers wedding party, you know the whole village were at that, but at this one only the persons I expect that Mrs. Thompson invited.  I spent a pleasant evening, but not as pleasant as if you had been with me.  I did not feel so independent as I would have felt with you.  I was near Mrs. Poinsett almost the whole evening, & Mr. Poinsett & Genl Thompson handed me in to supper,  Many inquiries were made after you.  I told them you were attending to your business, while they were pleasuring it.  Mrs. Thompson said you ought to have come.  I thought she looked�, & she looks badly very thin.  I think she has been sick.  I expect she felt sadly at giving up to another her only daughter.  Genl Thompson said his head felt turned the whole evening.  The bride looked pretty, but very thin.  Mr. Edward Earle & Miss Calhoun seem to like each other very much.  I dare say that will be a match.  Mr. Sam Earle was not there.  He was invited, but Mrs. Harrison did not send him his invitation, so he did not know he had received one.  If he had received it, he would have gone, for he wished to go.  Mrs. Mays & the Miss Maxwells who were staying at his house went; was it not strange in Mrs. Harrison.  There were 6 bridesmaids & Groomsmen.  Mrs. Butler Thompson does not look as if she intended to increase her family.  Some say it is a mistake, but I suppose not, as those who ought to know, say that she does.  You say Genl Thompson told you she did.  She has only taken a long time about it.  I have told you as much about the wedding as I have room to.

	Last night it commenced raining, & has been raining hard all day.   It has now stopped, so I hope tomorrow will be clear, to allow me to go to Church. & you to travel, for you cannot have travelled today.  I am glad you have taken some notes, but would much rather the money.  Perhaps if you had urged, you could have got the money.  The servants I suppose at the farm are doing what you told them.  Mine here are doing well.  Elizas John is much better.   She says she will  soon come home, �really I have no money, & now as I am economizing have so little work for her to do, that I will be sorry when she comes.  If it is any conven[ience] to you this winter, Mary can stay at the farm, Eliza iron & do what little work we have, & Delia attend to the house.   I am now really e[cono]mizing. The bill you left me would at the end of this week have been almost unbroken, if it had not been for paying Mr. Pickwell for mending Watch & Jewelry.  I did not spend the usual sum in Butter,  Mr. Roberts not having brought any.  When you are Judge, we will spend 1000 & put up 1000 every year, so that by the time our children grow up, we will be able to give them every advantage, I will not be left destitute.  Now it is always uncertain what you will make, & you have to beg the people to pay you, but then you will have a certain income, receive it without begging, & be independent of the people, but I need not urge the advantages to induce you to win the place, for you cant be so indifferent to your own interest & your family, as not to wish & try for it if you thought there was a possibility of your getting it.  Four letters came last night, & all electioneering letters, except one from Mr. Thompson of Washington about the Shirts.  He says he is mortified at his having received the money when you had not received the shirts, that he thought they reached you safely, that he will remit you the money, & asks in what manner he shall do it.  The postage on the letters were paid.  A�came & other papers.  The mail before a�letter came from Mr. Pettigru, begging you to interest yourself in Col. Keiths reappointment as City Register.  Col. Keith had requested him to write to you.  You can write him.  Col. Keith is connected with you, so of course you would interest yourself in him.  Mamma received a letter from Alston about her business.  He gave her some good advice such as you have often told me about her breaking in upon her Capital, but she did not like his advice at all, was hurt that he should not think her economical.  She will soon receive money enough from her income to pay Mr. Hoke.  Her house was invested in Mr. Tuppers bond, & she will receive that interest.  Poor Mamma has had a dreadful sore throat & fever with it.  She is now getting better.  Mrs. Duboc is staying with them to help nurse her.  Fam[ily] is quite well.  Mr. Luther has been there the greater part of the week.  I have no room to write more.  The children are asleep.  

	Willie is still head. He makes no fuss now learning his lesson.  Mr. McNutt says he ought to miss & let the other boys get up & he skips all about to try to make him miss & tries to cheat him & tell him he has spelt the words wrong, but Willie says Mr.McNutt says he cant cheat him.  The Miss Ramseurs used to make me go�, said I allowed the girls no chance of getting up.  Take care of yourself.  Come back safe, E.F.P.
