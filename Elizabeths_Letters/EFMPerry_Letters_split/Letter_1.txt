Letter 1


Thursday night, 30 November [1837]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have just finished drinking my tea, have left Mamma & the girls & have come upstairs to write to you.  I would have written yesterday, but I had been shopping from after breakfast until 3 oclock & was so much fatigued that in the afternoon I was obliged to lie down, & in the evening Aunt Eliza & Aunt Hayne took tea with us.  I have been in King street all of the morning, but as I rode I do not feel so much fatigued as yesterday.  I have bought a great many articles & priced almost all, some things are dearer & some cheaper than I expected.  When I tell you what I have given for the different things you must not scold, for what I have given a high price for, I have made up  by giving a low price for other things.  I have bought carpeting for the Drawing room $2. a yard & the dining room $1.40.  To make up I have gone without a chamber carpet, & have got the Entry & staircase carpet very cheap, only 50 cts a yd, & beautiful; the oil cloth would have been for the Entry $40, for it is a dollar & a half by the square yd & the carpeting for the Entry has cost only $17.50, & the staircase $12.50 cts.  For the entry & staircase carpeting I have given but $30 & the oil  cloth for the Entry only would have  been $40.00.  In addition to going without the chamber carpet, I have determined to buy one Calico dress only, & I think I will even go without a shawl.  I consult good judges as to the carpeting, & they advised me to think of the quality, & instead of getting such as would last one or two winters, give more & get carpets that would wear well for years.  All of the carpeting I have got for the two rooms, Entry & staircase comes to $170.00 & if I have given less for the carpeting & bought a chamber carpet, it would have come to more.  But I think I have argued the subject sufficiently, & if you see me favourably inclined to one side, your natural disposition will lead you  to take the other, & you will never be convinced that I am right.  I have tried to act for the best & if even you my husband, do not approve of my conduct I will not be unhappy, for my conscience acquits me.  I have bought a pair of Astral Lamps for $30, a pair of Pitchers $4.50, a pretty little pair of castors $3.00, nice plated ones are $12, or 14.  The pair I have got are a new kind & very pretty.  I have got two pair of glass candle sticks $1.00, a pair of Decanters $8.00.  Other articles I have priced but not bought.  Tomorrow I intend to look at spoons, Mantel glass, Fenders, Andirons &c.  Shopping is very fatiguing.  Sometimes I am inclined to buy a thing at the store I am at, rather than go further.  I have never been so worried in�& constantly thinking can I afford this, can I afford that.  Shopping is pleasant when you have plenty of money, but not when you are limited to a little sum.  However you must have confidence in me & believe that all I do is right, & that I have a better judgement & more experience in these things than you.

	I will stop with this subject, & write of what will interest you more.  You did not expect my first letter to you to be filled up with one subject, shopping.  I will now write of you, myself & others.  I miss you a great deal, & would have even more, if I had not been so engaged in King street.  Last night I thought sleep had forsaken me.  I lay so long awake, I suppose it was because I had not you  to caress & put me to sleep.  I hope it will not be the case tonight.  You must write to me often to make up for your absence.  I promise to answer every letter, which will be doing well, so engaged as I am.  You recollect last year I was not so punctual, but I  love you more now, than I did then.  I take more pleasure in writing to you.  My love for my husband is great.  Your wife longs to see you.  The Diamond Rings are finished, & are very pretty.  Susan & Ann are delighted with them.  I think they are prettier than the one you first gave me.  It is a nice guard to my wedding ring.  I am writing with a very bad pen.  You must excuse both composition & penmanship.   I feel quite tired.  I expect to hear from you on Saturday.  I hope I will not be disappointed.  Believe me, your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
