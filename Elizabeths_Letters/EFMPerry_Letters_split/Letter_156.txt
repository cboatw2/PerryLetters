Letter 156

		Friday Charles came in & planted the ground nuts, & prepared the ground for potatoes.  The slips we will have to buy.  Yesterday he planted his�, & we had in the afternoon a good rain, & last night it rained hard & with this morning, vegetation looks revived.

		Jim came home a little while last evening I expect for his tolls.  He thought he would do some mischief, so he set in the Cows to the Calves, so we got very little Milk.

		Yesterday afternoon I walked to see Mrs. Tom Gower.  She was out, then to see Mrs. Norton, who has been sick a long time, & then on to Mamma�s.  White at Mamma�s it rained hard so she had to send me home in the carri[a]ge.  This morning the children & myself went to church.  As it was damp, I called for Mrs. Walker.  Mr. Arthur gave us an old sermon on regeneration, to a very small congregation.  This afternoon there was no service.  The children were catechized.  Willie & Anna went, & afterwards we all went out to Mamma�s & took tea.

		At church Mr. Croft asked me if I would be home tomorrow at 9 oclock.  He wished to see me on a little business.  I told him yes, so I am quite anxious to know what it is about.  This afternoon I intended going to see Mr. Sam Town[e]s, but Reuben said Scott was lame.  At the church door when I was getting in the carri[a]ge he said the horse was so lame it could hardly walk, but I thought it only seemed a little lame, & that Reuben was afraid I was going to employ him this afternoon.  He said , it either sprained its awful kicking against the stable or had run a nail into its foot, in walking over the old planks in the stable yard, & said if I needed it this afternoon it might be lamed for life, so I told him to attend to Scott, & see that he got well soon.  Reuben loves to exaggerate.  

		It is raining now.  The servants have gone to church.  The children are upstairs in bed.  I am downstairs.  Charlotte told�little while ago, that today Mary joined the Methodist church.  It is no wonder they are turned out so soon, if they join with so little thought as I am sure she has�the dreadful accident happened on Mr. Arthurs R[ail] Road�yesterday while digging the earth & rocks fell on a servant of Mr. Arthur�s named Bob, & Mr. Walkers Joe, & killed them.  Mr. Walker says an easy way of digging is, to dig the earth [word obscured] the bottom far under & then the earth on the top falls down, that the men were digging in this way, & after digging far under the earth did not fall, so Joe & Bob were told to dig a little more.  They began, & in a few moments, the earth & rocks came tumbling down on them & killed them.  She seems to bear it well, but it must be a great trial.  Mr. Arthur seemed the same as usual today, but I am sure he must be distressed at it.  It was owing to carelessness of the Overseer I believe.  Mr. Arthur seems to have been unfortunate with negroes.  Your different papers have come, & 3 letters, one from Dr. Holland about a bill the Tugaloo estate owes him, one from Mr. Christie from Edgefield a few lines�Mr. Deans paper, & one from Peirce Earle to his Wife.  It is directed to you.  Ann says you must not forget to buy her the apple box.  Mrs. Arthur gave her a cap, & she thought she ought to make a return, & told her she would give her  one of those Apple boxes.  With regard to going to town my dear you must do just as you please.  I objected because I thought the expense was great, & the pleasure would not equal it, & if I was with you, it would be pleasant visiting my relations, but alone, you might not find it so, & that next year I hoped to go with you, & introduce you to them all, for some of the pleasantest, such as Aunt Mary McCall & Mrs. Susan Hayne, you have never even seen, & do everything you think proper as regards bank Stock.  If there is any risk, you might sell only half of the Stock.  Aunt Turnbull you saw in Greenville, so if you did not object, I would like you to call on her.  The Hayne family, most of them have treated us so  �gently, they have no claims on your politeness so I do not tell you to call on them, but Aunt Ann Turnbull & my Aunts there I would like you to see.  I feel nearer to them, & they have always been kinder to us, than my mothers sisters.  Tomorrow the Whitewashing will be commenced which is the reason I write tonight.  The home will be in confusion.  This is the only sheet of letter paper in the�.  It is blotted, but you must excuse it, you left me badly off.  I will leave room to add a few lines tomorrow, telling what Mr. Croft wishes to see me for.  Mamma says Mr. McBee told Susan Anna was the admiration of all at Mrs. Cannons Mayday.  Frank is still head.  Willie�s colt is doing quite well.  Fanny talks about Papa, & wished you home the day you left.  I hope your horse held out, & that you did not get wet.  My pen is so bad, I am afraid you cannot make out my letter.  Mr. Croft says he has not sent down yet for his groceries, that it will be a month at least before they are here.  The�will be out of seed, so if you can buy them in Columbia, you must buy some & send by Mr. Elford or the first person coming.  If you can get a cage, you must buy one.  The female has lately had some more feathers plucked out, & the male does not sing at all, so they ought to be separated before they kill each other.
