Letter 135

Friday morning, 11 May [1849]
[Greenville]

My dear husband

		Again I am at my desk writing to you with bad pen, ink & paper, for the deficiencies of which you must make allowances.  I received your letter Wednesday evening, & it gave me much pleasure.  Mrs. Elford sent to know if I had heard, that she had not.  I was glad to be able to inform her of Mr. Elfords safe arrival.  Mr. Bobo was really unfortunate.  I hope your horse will not be ruined like Skylark.  I will not tell you of all that has been done at home.  Tuesday & Wednesday the Mr. Smiths Whitewashed & did it very nicely.  They understand it better than Mr. Wallace.  The dining room they have done lighter than before, so it is now of a beautiful straw colour, the little room the same, but that can never look well, until the leak by the Stovepipe is stopped.  The rooms downstairs  except the Library, are arr� in�, with the exception of the Curtains.  Upstairs is nearly fixed.  Last night I was able to sleep in my own bed, which was quite a treat.  Today the cleaning has been stopped & Minerva & Mary gone to the Spring to wash Curtains, bed clothes &c assisted by a woman of old Mrs. Greens who washes beautifully.  They have more to wash, than I think the 3 will be able to get through with, so next week we will go on washing paint windows &c.  The�of the house will be much�on your return, to judge by the quantities of dirt that has been removed.  If you had seen how much had accumulated under the carpets & in every corner, you would wonder the house should have looked at all neat, or we been able to breathe in it.  A great deal is yet to be done, weeks worth I am afraid.  

		Charles is in the garden.  We have had fine rains.  Yesterday the ground was too wet to plough, but Reuben went to the Farm.  The day before Lindy he said was sick & helped only a little.  Today they have both gone.  Tomorrow Reuben has to go to Mr. Fairs for Corn.  The barrel Mr. Foster sent has given out, & I intend to take the opportunity of Lindys being at home & send for Dr. Crooks to see her.  She is not well.  She has headaches, bleeding at the nose, & she is at a time of life, that she must be attended to, to ensure her health & even life  so I hope Dr. Crooks will put her in a way to have all right.  Mr. Foster sent only 202 pounds of Bacon,  22  peices.  I sent 100 pounds to Mrs. D�Oyley.

		Myself & the children are well. Though I feel fatigued,, from the labours of the few days past.  Scott I expect has got over his lameness.  I have heard nothing more of it, but I was very much afraid it will come on again next Sunday.  Hochel� I hope is getting well.  Yesterday for the first time since the sad change in his fate, he pranced about the orchard as in days of old.  The hogs & pigs I believe are well, & the Cows & Calves.  The poultry escapes every now & then out of the pen, so they are reduced in number without our receiving the benefit.  We churn a little every day, & get one or two Eggs.

		I was walking over the front yard this morning & many of my plants seem flourishing but others are dying from the rude treatment of the Colt trampling  & breaking them down.  A good many Hawthorns are planted & the fence one in bloom.

		Miss M�died Wednesday night, & her funeral took place yesterday morning at Mr. Watsons.  She was buried at her fathers place.  I attended the funeral.  Mr. Arthur performed the services.  She was I believe quite good, �she communicated on her sick bed.  That day for the first time she was told she would not recover.  She said she wished she had been told sooner & she was perfectly resigned & her parents seem so too.  Mr. Bate�s child was buried yesterday afternoon.  Willie says the Clevelands took home their books yesterday from school, that they are going to New Haven to school.  William Choice also, Mr. Jefferson Choice�s son.  

		A letter came for you last mail  from Willis Burket giving an account of the Tugaloo Farm.

		I received a note from Mrs. Sharpe acknowledging the reception of the Shoes & thanking me for them.  Her health she says is better & that they were sorry they missed seeing you, as you passed through Pendleton.  Mr. Croft told me Mr. Pearson was one of the Delegates to the Nashville Convention from Florida, & that he is to pass the summer in Greenville.

		Mamma & Susan walked in yesterday.  They are as usual.  I have been nowhere & seen no one, so have not much to tell you,

		Last Monday Mr. Davis had 5 new scholars, so now he has nearly 50.  He is very anxious Anna should learn�& I would be too, if we could afford it at present.  It would be occupation for her, & prevent her playing at home with servants.  We will talk about it when you return.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  You must not forget to buy some Bird seed of different kinds & send up by Mr. Elford.  If he comes first, Mr. Croft says he does not know when my package will be here.  He does not intend sending down for his Groceries, until freight is lower & the roads better.

		Do not forget Ann�s apple box.  She will think hard of it if you do not get it.  Have the shoes made up.  1 pr is for Ann & she will pay for, & get from the shoemaker the pattern he kept before.  It was a good shoe, & bring back the one you carried this time.		
		You must not let your claims on�be overlooked,�it is what I positively desire for you, & I hope you will be thought of for that office, which you are so well calculated to fill.  

		You will receive this letter Sunday evening.  Before you can get another you may leave, so perhaps this is the last letter I will write to you, for if you are away  only the 2 weeks you expected, you will start for home next Wednesday.  I wish  you would get a new trial for Mr. Gilreath, but I am afraid you cannot.  

		The weather is quite cool.  I must now stop.  I wish to take up some tacks out of the floor in the�chamber.  I took up the matting, & there was an inconceivable quantity of dirt underneath.  I had thought there was none.  The room was so little used. But it is two years since the matting was taken up.  A great deal of dirt had collected.  I have gone through so much fatigue to clean the house for you, you ought to feel obligated to me, the rest of the year, & be very kind & obliging & love me, & never scold me, or give me one unkind word, or make me afraid to ask you for money, or say I am extravagant, & do all I wish you too.  So good bye for the present, & I hope this is my last letter, that this time next Friday you will be on your way home.  Your obedient faithful Wife, E.F.P.
