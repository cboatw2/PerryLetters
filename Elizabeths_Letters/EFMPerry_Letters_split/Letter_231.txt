Letter 231

Wednesday, 11 oclock, 16 December 1852
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I received a letter from you this morning, & also one from Eliza.  I received one from your Papa.  He leaves Columbia tomorrow morning, so I am not to write to him again & will be able now to write longer letters to you.  I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.  If you do not come home by Christmas, you will lose nothing, for you know at that time the servants having holiday, we live in less comfort than any other part of the year.  It reminds me of the way we are living at present.  This week Mr. Hoke bought some hogs for us, which have been killed, & instead of living in abundance as one would think, we almost starve, & have our meals irregular, all the servants being engaged drying Lard, cutting up Sausage meat, cleaning feet, stuffing sausages &c, that they have no time to attend to us, so busy preparing for our future comfort.  Susan Hoke said she would write to Augustus to call & see you, but as you have not mentioned him, I suppose you have not seen him.  She sends over to know if you mention him in your letters, for they were uneasy not having heard from him.  Fanny Hoke is quite sick with Measles & Scarletina.

	Perhaps you heard that Mr. Sam Mauldin was carried down to Columbia & put in the Lunatic Asylum.  He attempted several times to kill himself.  He took Laudanum in Greenville, going down he attempted to jump out of the Cars & when left in the Asylum, tried to beat his brains out.  He eats Opium which is worse than drink.  How sad for his Wife & family.  James Benson is married to a Lady in Abbeville. Mr. Wm Easely is married to Miss Sloan of Pendleton   Mr. Joab Mauldin is married to Miss McIver.  Mrs. Mims Sister Mrs. Genl Hampton has a Son.  This is all the Greenville news I know of to tell you.  

	Frank commenced a letter to you, but I saw it would take so long to finish it, I told him he might stop.  Willie is generally busy reading, cutting & hauling wood, & as I write so often, he thinks he would have nothing to tell you.  Hext is quite well & when I ask where Anna is, holds up his hand, as if to say gone.  Fanny speaks often of you & calls you my sister.  She longs for Papa & Sister to come back, & then adds, I will be sorry too, & when I ask why says because I will have to go out of Mamma�s room & sleep with Anna.  Now I go upstairs & sit with her at night.  Then she thinks that will be put a stop to, so she feels quite divided.  She wishes though she had gone to town with you, & says I ought to have let her.  I did not think of it, but the weather has been so bad ever since you left, that I think this is the very worst time to leave home for enjoyment.  The Spring is much pleasanter & is always the time I will choose.  

	I am glad Uncle Arthur & all of your friends are so affectionate & enquire after us all so kindly.  They are kind to you not only for your sake & mine, but for your Grandmama whom they all love.  You must go to see all of her old friends.  I often wish she would see them once more.  I know she must miss their friendship & society.  You must buy a present for each servant.  I wish this Christmas to give each of the grown servants a Bible.  Reuben, Eliza & Becky I think can read.   Charles, Lindy, Mary, Edward & Clara can bring theirs to me or you at any time to read to them.  8 Bibles plain ones I will have to get.  If Eliza could get reasonable ones in Charleston, & have them packed in the box she is to send, I would like it, but if she thinks it will take up too much room, I will get them here from Mr. Elfords book store.  A prayer book get for yourself & one for Willie, a neat plain one for him, of a convenient size to put in his pocket. Becky�s comb you must not forget & some little present for Ninny, Lucinda, John & each of our servants, either a handkerchief, apron, or something pretty if you prefer it, not the value of the  present, will they regard but your remembering them, & anything from Charleston will seem to them great.  A little present for Mary Mauldin also get.  Little China ornaments can be got for 15 cts.  Those little baskets, cups & saucers &c. that we have had, were of that price.  Get a little present for your Grandmama, Aunt Susy & Aunt Annie, also for Vardry Alex Annie & Susy, a doll for the two latter & some toy or book for the former, a dress for Lindy�s baby of cheap calico, a knife for Willie & Frank, the dolls & sugar toys for Fanny, & with the 2 dollars she gave you buy her a large box of Furniture.  I wish her to begin having a baby house, so as to keep all her things in order.  At some future time I wish you to get a dinner set of China for yourself so inquire now the price.  It will be useful when your young friends come to see you.  You can have a table set to yourselves.  I expect now you cannot afford it.  Some time hence you might get it.  If you need �rilla before you get back, you must buy some & take.  Mrs. Elford went down first, & I expect sent you the gingernuts.  Mr. Elford went down afterwards, I expect had the hair & a letter for Eliza.  You must get Eliza to buy two bottles of �preparation of Castor oil,� one for Aunt Susy [&] one for me.  I am glad you got a new bonnet.  I would like one for Fanny, if it is as pretty as any others worn by little girls of her age.  I have bought a Worsted bonnet here for Hext, & given him Fanny�s cloak, so he can do without anything.  Buy a Cornelian ring for Annie & Fanny, & one for yourself.  I wish you to buy a dress, & have any new fashioned apron; Sack or new bonnet, or anything else pretty you see made up for yourself.  All the pretty patterns you can get, bring.  I am sorry you will not see Aunt Harriet & Sarah, & that you have not seen either Aunt Emily or Aunt Susan, & that sickness is the cause of not seeing the two later.  This visit is an event in your life which you will never forget, & you are grateful I am sure to your friends for being so kind, & will always do what you can in your power to return it.  I hope you will see Eloisa�s family before you leave.  The Legislature adjourns today.  Your Papa sets off tomorrow, & will return in Mr. Duncan�s carri[a]ge, for one of the sons went down in it.  The roads must be very bad.  It is raining now, & has been for several days.  Give my love to my friends.  Go & see Mrs. Elford & write when she will return; also go & see Mary Crayton.  Your attached Mother, E.F.P.
