Letter 264

Saturday morning, 14 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have only time to say we are well, & the weather today so cool that you need not be uneasy at thinking we will find it hot.  I did not hear from you yesterday, so do not know whether you are coming today or not.  I hope it will suit you to come down a little later.  Write me.  I have not got through my business yet.  This morning will do some of it, but cant get through all.  I paid visits yesterday, am engaged Monday to take tea with my old friend Maud Heyward.  Last night I took tea at Miss Draytons.  It was quite a party.  Tonight I take tea at Eloisa Martins.  I am not fatiguing myself.  Yesterday I got a letter from Susan.  They were well.  I have now to stop for breakfast.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.  

Benjamin Per
