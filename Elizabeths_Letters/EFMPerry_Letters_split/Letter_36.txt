Letter 36

	Saturday morning I staid at home & worked in the afternoon.  I carried my jewelry to Mr. Pickerel, & went to see Mrs. Markley, Mrs. Elford & Mrs. Town[e]s.  At night I went early to bed.  Sunday morning Willy & myself went to church & heard a missionary sermon.  Miss Stuart & two of the children sat in the pew.  I would not be surprised if they had taken possession for the summer.  In the afternoon, I went with all of the children to Mamma�s.  She was very glad to see us; Ann just the same.  They inquired after you.  We walked in the garden, & Mamma waked with me to the gate.  We got home just at dark.  After supper I told some Bible stories to Willy & then went to bed.  In the night it thundered and the wind blew.  I predicted a storm, but it passed over in a few minutes, & no rain yet. 

	This morning just after breakfast, I went over to Mr. Watson to pay my respects to your second self.  It is indeed an admirable portrait.  If I only looked my best, I might be persuaded, to have mine taken.  Butler Thompson came in to look at it.  He said it was the best Portrait he ever saw in his life.  It was precisely you, except a little younger.  Mr. Wells was looking at it.  His only objection was the shadow of the spectacles, Which Mr. Watson says is the most ridiculous criticism on a picture he has ever heard, & though he does not wish Mr. Wells to have it, shows he is too ignorant on the subject to be a competent judge.  The picture looks so much better at a distance, than near.  When I first went in the store, it was directly behind the counter, I was hardly more pleased with it than I was in Mr. Barclay�s room.  I begged Mr. Watson to put it at the end of his store, & at that distance & in the shade, I was delighted with it.  I imagined you standing in the store, & was surprised you did not speak to me.  You must get a very handsome frame for it.  If you cannot get one in Charleston, send to the North.  That picture will remain in the family always, generation after generation,, perhaps hundreds of years, & sure to show to your posterity, how the founder of their family looked.  Do my dear husband render your name so distinguished that it will be regarded with pride, by all your descendants.  Don�t let them say �My Grandfather was beaten by Dr. Sullivan.�

	Mrs. Marion�lingers, but I believe she is very low.  I have no news at all to write about.  I heard Miss McBee was going to the North with Mrs. Dr. Butler, but I hardly believe that; I do not believe she would leave the Dt. to electioneer alone.  I heard Miss McLeod was engaged to Mr. Mood, but I do not believe that either.  I see in the paper the death of cousin Edward Finley who you recollect as a member of the Legislature.  Aunt Finley of our five grown children has one left.

	I have so much work to do, that I will not be able to write you again.  It takes up too much time.  I will now mention my commissions.  Do not forget to buy for Willy a Leghorn hat with a wide rime.  Measure the crown by the string I gave you.  For Frank buy a common straw�not costing more than 25 cts.  For Susan & Ann I would like you to bring a little trifle, not costing more than 50 cts.at the utmost.  The pincushions you brought them last winter 3 1/4 cts a peice showed them yesterday to me on the Mantle peice, & seemed to value them greatly.  Any little trifle would do, such for instance as those little glass figurines you brought me once.  It is merely to show that you have thought of them.  Ann says she does not care for any oranges, but I think you had better bring her a few.

	And now my dear for the advice, which I know you are anxiously expecting.  I do hope you are for annexation.  If you are not my misery will be complete, for now I doubt if you will be elected, then I am certain you will not be, for it seems treason in a southerner to be against Texas. Unless he is a Whig, & nobody will vote for you.  Dont be so foolish as to do everything to injure yourself, & benefit your opponent.  You wont electioneer, when you know it is so particularly important for you, who have so many things against you, & so many persons doing all they can against you.  I believe you want to be defeated, though you know how mortified I will be.  I am certain that if you were to take an interest in the matter & do all you could to ensure success, you would be successful, but instead of that, you take no interest in the matter, & do all you can to be defeated.  Your conduct certainly indicates that, & I don�t know why you are a Candidate, unless it is to be  the death of me, for uneasiness of mind is wearing out my body, & I cant endure it much longer.  All of the Candidates wives feel easy except myself, for they know  their husbands will exert themselves to be elected, but I who am sensitive, know that my husband who has so many enemies working against him, will leave his election to chance, & chance never elected anyone to the Legislature.  I have read the arguments for & against Texas & I am for Texas, & you may as well be apparently for it, if in reality you are against it, for I do not believe it will be admitted into the Union.  You must make haste & come back to electioneer.  In the meantime all I can do for you.  Write me.

	If you are defeated I will tear up your picture.  Your descendants shant see it.
