Letter 36

Thursday night, 5 December 1844
Greenville

My dear husband 

	I received your long letter last night, & as I read it, I regretted that I had expressed so much anxiety about going to Mrs. Cunninghams.  I feel frightened when I think you will receive two letters more on the same subject, & dread the next letters I will get from you.  However as the reprimand they contain, I deserve, I will even take it in good part, & profit by it.  I feel sorry now that I did not merely mention the invitation, & ask you what I should do.  I would then have known your real opinion.  Now though you say you have no objection to my going, I do not know that you are willing I should go, & I would not go on any account, unless you were perfectly willing.  I do not care to go before next Tuesday the 11th instant.  So by return Mail you must write me word exactly what I must do.  If you say you would just as�I should go, you have not the least objection to it, I will go, but if you say you would prefer my remaining at home, I will cheerfully remain.  I did not consider last nights letter even a permission to go, for you thought I was so anxious to go, that you were obliged to consent, even against your will.  Now that you see my feelings have cooled down, you will feel more at liberty to give your real opinion.  If by your advice, I go, & you prefer not stopping, I can return home before the Session adjourns, so that you may find me here, or if you do not object to stopping, you need not unless you wish it, stay more than a night.  You must write (that is if I go) exactly the arrangements about Jim, & what day he must meet you, but I repeat again, that I would not even wish to go, unless I thought you wished it, & I am perfectly willing to give up my visit.  Your letter has completely cooled me, & I am far less anxious to go than I was, & unless I hear Wednesday night, that you have not the least objection to my going, I will not.  I am always ready to listen to reason, & would not have been so unreasonable,  if you had been near, & never will be again though you may be away.  I am sorry to have made so small a matter of so much importance.  Having no one to express my thoughts to, I dwell on a matter, until it seems more important than it otherwise would.  But I�ll not do so in future.  If I had known you had no confidence in my letters, & took no interest in them, I am sure I would not have sat up until 10 or 11 oclock every other night to write to you.  The reason I did not mention my sickness to you, was that though painful, it was not in the least of a dangerous kind, there was no necessity for your coming home, as you would have done, if you had known it, for you would have been glad of the excuse, as you were once before when you came home because I had the Toothache.  I did not wish to be the means of making your constituents complain again, that you neglected your duty.  Your father I knew you loved, & to hear of his death would distress you & as you are always so unhappy as it is in Columbia, I did not think it necessary  to add to your unhappiness.  I was afraid that too might bring you home.   If like the other members, you had remained at your post always to the last moment, I would not have been afraid any little cause of anxiety at home, but I kept them from you, to prevent you from deserting.  Now that you have promised me, you will perform your duty faithfully & not leave until the Session is actually over, I will keep you faithfully informed of home.  You ought to remain two or three days after the Session, rather than leave one day before.  As regards lending Mr. Yancey the buggy, I would have felt that I had been perhaps wrong in lending it, as I am in such fear of you, that I preferred not mentioning what I had done, until I knew all was safe, though of course never mind what accident had happened, I would have known it was my duty to have mentioned it to you.  In the future do not be uneasy.  I will let you know everything.

	Last night a letter came from Dwight Lathrop for you, also the Temperance Advocate, whose note in your address, I like very much.  It expresses a great deal, in a few words, & is very appropriate.  The Greenville Torchlight procession, is very magnificent on paper.  Mamma on reading it, said to Susan, �Why did you not tell me you saw all this�.  Everybody (in shopping) asks me about the elections.  A great many were surprised that Mr. Aiken is likely to be Governor & say they thought Mr. Alston would have been.  I heard Mr. Aiken was electioneering a great deal.  Most have thought too that Tom Butler would have been easily elected.  I have always thought Elford would be.  He seems so expert at electioneering.  Mrs. Thompson who I met today in a store said she heard Judge O� Neal[l] was very active for Elford, & that Judge Butler was taking no part for Tom, or any of the Judges indeed.  Mrs. Thompson said she heard Mr. Summer would get the Treasurers office.  I had thought he was poor, but Mrs. Coleman, who came to see me this afternoon, says his father is a rich old Dutchman.  I do not think rich persons, should apply for office.  You must write all the news that I may tell it to persons who ask me.  I met Mrs. Duncan this morning.  She said, in writing, I must get you to tell Mr. Duncan his family were all well, the baby had entirely recovered.  She said she came to see me with Mrs. Sumney & I was out.  I did not know it, until she told me today.  Susan & myself both intend going to Miss Earle�s wedding next Tuesday night.  She is to be married to Mr. Williams, who teaches school in Laurens.  I am glad Susan will go, as Ann does not sleep at night; her going out, will not disturb her.  Mr. Foster one day sent to borrow a vehicle to carry his children to a wedding at Mr. Martin Hunts.  He returned it the next day, with a thousand thanks, & sent word the children had gone & returned quite comfortably.  Jim has hauled some Shucks & Fodder & intends to haul Corn.  He has not killed hogs yet.  He said he thought he had better wait until Mr. Hoke did, who was a good judge of [sui]table weather.  We have had scarcely any cold weather since you left.  Today & yesterday quite warm, & the sun shining brightly.  Jim hauled some wood today, & intends to haul more.  I got up by Candle light.  I sleep between Frank & Anna, so  if I  forget them, when writing to their Father, they will not let me forget them at night, for they are so close I can scarcely turn.   They have been a great deal in the house with me, & then I can manage them quite well, but now in this charming weather, Willy & Anna run about, & are more unmanageable.  Willy takes a great deal more interest in his reading & has read several stories since you left.  He looks remarkably well, & talks with great pleasure of his drum.  Anna is also quite well, & speaks of the baby Papa is to bring her, & you can get one cheaper & undressed, & I can dress it for her.  Frank does not look quite as well as he did before the complaint, but I hope before you come back, he will be as fat as he used to be.  He has not forgotten you, but looks anxiously, when I tell him to go see horse.  I do not think there is any news to tell you.  The village is very quiet.  Mamma has not heard yet from her friends.  I hope she will tomorrow night.  I am glad you dined at Dr. Gibbes.  I will read your letter in the Mountaineer tomorrow, & if I can will add a few lines.  It is now time to go to bed.  The children are all asleep.  

Friday morning.  I read your letter this morning in the Mountaineer.  My objection to it is that it is not long enough.  The invitation to Miss Earles wedding came this morning for us both.  It is to be a very large one.  You must be sure & write me by return Mail whether I leave home or not.  I will continue writing to you, so that you may hear my Mail.  When you return I will be a good wife.  If you had been brought up more among ladies, you would not think me as strange as you sometimes do.  I do not think you understand, or know how to treat the fair sex, but I will not scold you, for I love you dearly, never mind what you think of me.  

	You must write interesting letters for the Mountaineer, & tell the people all you [word obscured] would interest them. but I will not give you advice about what you know better than I do.  I expect with pleasure to hear from you tonight, though you letter may contain  [word obscured].  I am sorry when I think of the one you will receive from me.  You will be provoked at my dwelling so long on one subject.  I never will again.
