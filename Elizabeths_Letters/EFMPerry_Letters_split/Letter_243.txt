Letter 243

Saturday morning. 10 oclock, 1 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just received a letter from you, & am very glad to hear.  When nothing prevents it, you must write every day, but do not let writing to me interfere with any other engagement.  I write to you every day, because I hope my letters give you the same pleasure yours do me.

	I am glad to tell you your Papa feels much better today, & has gone to his office, but he will not be well enough to go to Newberry to attend the R[ail] Road meeting Wednesday.  I wrote to Aunt Eliza & yourself yesterday, to say I was perfectly willing you should remain longer in town, even if you wished it, as long as Mary Crayton staid, as she so decidedly said, your being with her was a pleasure, & you did not incommode her at all, even if her family were larger, it was no inconvenience to her, to have you.  But if at any time you feel anxious to return before Mary Crayton does, write & tell me so, & your Papa I dare say, by that time will be well, & he will go down for you.  Now that you are to stay longer, continue to be as good a girl as you have been, & your friends will be more & more attached to you.  Occupy yourself practicing & working & reading & make yourself useful in every way you can to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  Perhaps you can learn some new peices of Music to surprise me when you return.  If it gives no trouble, get one of your friends to teach you to knit a purse, & finish the Mit, & when Aunt Ann & Aunt Martha return, go & see them frequently, & Aunt � & Aunt Anna go & see, & Aunt Harriet I hope you will see before you leave.  I know she would be sorry not to see you.  You are passing your time so pleasantly, & seeing so much that is new to you. & seemed anxious to remain, that I am sure you will be pleased that your Papa & myself are willing you should.

	Soon I am to send 49 dollars to Aunt Mary McCall, 21 for the Cloak & 7.50 for the bonnet, making $28.50 which is spent uselessly, & I would gladly have sent to you,  The rest of the money is for two dresses & trimmings, as pr velvet Cuffs, a peice of ribbon for the neck, a pr Gloves & a blue veil.  This is all.  Next week I will send you more money.  Write word how much you wish.  As soon as you get your work box, write about it, & tell me the price.  I think it will be a very suitable present to make Aunt Eliza.  So after I hear about yours, perhaps I may write to you to get her one, but do not say anything about it, until you buy it & surprise her.  Inquire the prices of neat writing desks; either a writing desk or work box, whichever she most needs will be a good present for your Aunt.  I am glad you gave the Jar of Ginger & the other presents.

	Day after tomorrow is Sale day, & your Papa will receive money, & I will be able to send you all you need.  This week he has been paying some of his debts.  Three Doctors bills Dr. Crooks 58 dollars, Dr. Earle 24, & Dr. Dean 22,  Cox & Gower 189 dollars for the carri[a]ge & repairs on Buggy &c, Mr. Westfield 44 dollars, & Mr. Heldman 54.  For the Hogs Mr. Hoke bought 10 of them, he paid 140 dollars.  It is pleasant when one goes to town & sees so many things they need & cannot get here, to have plenty of money; your Papa paying his debts, & I also having to pay a large debt, prevents my giving you as much as I would like, but when you make another visit to town, instead of having to send 49 dollars to pay for what is of no use to me, I can give it all to you, & you can gratify your feelings, of generosity, & buy presents for all who have been so kind to you.  I am well supplied with clothes for next summer, & can save all of Minerva�s wages for the next visit any of us pay to town.

	You can buy for Mary Mauldin a little China cup or basket for 28 cts, also for Sally Hoke , a Sugar figure for Fanny Hoke she will be pleased with; more ground nut cake & Candy I will send money for as presents to the children here.  I will not show them the presents in the box if possibly can help it.

	Mr. McKays school begins Monday. & we expect Fanny will commence at once.  She says she does not wish to go, but I know she will be pleased.  She will be occupied, which will make her happy as it does everybody.  Sometimes she prefers going to Miss Hopkins, & then again to Mr. McKay.  We prefer sending her to the latter, so as to be with you.  

	In the Male Academy, Mr. Thomas a young man who graduated the other day in Columbia & took the third honor, is to teach.  We will send Frank to him.  Perhaps Mr. Hillhouse will also be engaged in the Male Academy.  Willie will go to the Baptist College, which does not commence until February.  Mamma let Reitta go home, & engaged old Mrs. Greens servant Sarah to go to her today. & Sarah has disappointed her & says she cannot go yet, so I was obliged to let Lindy go.  The yard is so much pleasanter now, since Becky was here, that Lindy is very sorry to go.  I expect she feels she is not able to do as well for Mamma as she ought, for she went off wiping her eyes.  She had her child in her arms.  Priscilla who is to mind it, following with a basket & escorted by Fanny, & Charlotte & Hext.  On account of the Measles being at Mamma�s, this is the first time Hext has been there since you left.  I told Lindy to do her best, for we were obliged to hire her out, as we had too many servants, & they must make something for us.  Though I did not intend to hire her out until her child was older, only to accommodate Mamma & let her go now, & if she did well it would be a good place for her.

	Tonight the servants here give a party.  Becky I believe is the one, & as she is a Methodist, it will be quiet, no dancing or noise.  There is to be a show here next week of animals & a Circus which the children are expecting with great pleasure.  I am glad Eliza is having Fanny�s cloak made.  Beg her to send it up by the first opportunity, either Butler Thompson or anyone Mary Crayton knows is coming.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  I am pleased at the high opinion they have of you, & hope you will continue to merit it.  Write me everything that interests you.  I write so often, Willie thinks it no use for him to write.  Mrs. Robinson & Butler Thompson go down next week, & today I am going to pack my Cloak to be ready for her to carry, & if she can take them, your bonnet, apron, & flannel petticoat.  I must now close.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.
