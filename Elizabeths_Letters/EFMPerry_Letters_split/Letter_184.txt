Letter 184

Thursday 2 oclock, 27 November [1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I was really disappointed I did not hear from you last night, & uneasy as I cannot conceive why you did not write, for Monday night you would have spared a few moments to me.  This is the fifth day since you left, & I have not received one letter, & this is the fifth I have written to you.  Mr. Elford did not hear either, which makes me more uneasy.  I hope I will hear tonight.

		An extra of the Southern Patriot was issued today, containing the Governor�s Message.  I see he still thinks Secession the rightful remedy.  I hope there�a division still, will make your independence conspicuous.  I was afraid you would be lost sight of in the mingling of parties, but I hope you will in the end be rewarded, though I am afraid the ambitious & aspiring will outstrip you.

		I have just finished putting down the carpet.  It looks quite handsome.  I am afraid it will be injured before you return.  It makes the rest of the house look shabby.  I have not made the carpet for the little room yet.  Aunt Mary sent 2 peices of binding more than was necessary, & the thread we paid 50 cts for never came, so 2 dollars we might have saved, was spent.

		Charles has staid at home today for the first time.  Mamma no longer needs him.  He is now spading the garden, Reuben is hauling wood.  Tomorrow I will tell him to drive off the Cows.  He ought to have done it today.   The weather is now good, & much warmer & pleasanter than it has been.  Today Willie & Frank go to school the last time for 4 weeks.  Anna will not have holiday yet for 2 weeks to come.

		Mamma is better, but we are all so busy we have not been able to see each other.  I have no news to tell you, as I have not been out, & have seen no one.  

		We are all pretty well.  Willie will write to you now [that] he has holiday.

		Charles says Burrill Ferguson who has only a Wife & two children would like to rent your Farm & that he would make a good crop for you [&] would cultivate your swamp land, that he would do better than Mr. Collins, who has so many children.  I think the dreadful sight of the unfortunate child would be objection enough to them.

		I must now close, & you scarcely deserve this letter but I return you�for evil.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
