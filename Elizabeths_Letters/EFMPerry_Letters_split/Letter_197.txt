Letter 197

Saturday night, 8 oclock, 13 December [1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a short letter from you.  I was in hopes to hear you were quite well, & am uneasy at your saying, your cold & feverish symptoms were not much better.  I hope Lee�s pills which you say you were to take again, will do you good.  I write tonight because tomorrow I go to church.  I may not have time.  I hope & trust this is my last letter to you for a long time.  If we had arranged it beforehand, I would have written a letter to you at Newberry Wednesday evening or wherever you will be that evening, but it is now too late for that.  I am glad your speech had effect & was listened to with attention.  I hope the exertion will not injure you.  Tomorrow you can have a quiet day, free from fatigue & excitement.

	I am glad you think you will gain your Rail Road cases.  Mrs. Elford was uneasy at not hearing from Mr. Elford, but tonight she has heard, & he is well.  At 9 oclock I will send to the Patriot office for the paper, & read your letters which give me great pleasure.  No one enjoys the Patriot more than I do.  

	Mr. N� tonight sent me a Jury ticket to send to you, & get you to bring him up the money.  I enclose it in this letter, & hope you will receive it in time to get the money for him.

	This morning I went to see Mrs. Elford, Mrs. Harvey Cleveland, & Mrs. Col. Irvine.  The latter lady was out.  Mrs. Elford says Mrs. Bruce had engaged Mrs. Pearsons servant Maria, so Mamma will be obliged to give her up & hire Mrs. Town[e]s� who has children.

	A great trial has been going on today in Mr. Stokes Office, of negroes for gambling.  Mr. Erwin Jones watchman Lem, Mr. Douglas man, Mr. Washington Green�s, Mr. McBee�s & others.  Some were found innocent, some whipped & dismissed, others sent to jail.  Mr. Elias Alexander had his man Adam tried, & it was said, if he was whipped Mr. Alexander would have gone crazy.  I believe he was cleared.  Cass with the wooden leg was also cleared.  

	Maj. Earle Mamma tells me is ill, perhaps near his end.  How he has destroyed himself.

	I rode in the Buggy this afternoon to see Mrs. Brooks & afterwards to Mamma�s, so I am visiting in earnest.  I long to get through, & be able to stay at home as much as I please.  I hope to finish almost before you return & then devote myself to you.

	Hext tomorrow is six months old.  He is now seated in Lindy�s lap by the fire.  I am writing upstairs in my chamber.  The children are all asleep.  Fanny has not progressed much in her book.  Anna gave her two almonds in advance to learn a lesson, which she has not learnt yet.  She would be a good little girl, if it were not for the teasing of the servants & children, which ruins her temper.  Anna has been busy making a quilt, so stays satisfied at home.  Willie has been hauling wood again today.  Frank knows all the hogs that have been killed, the negroes whipped &c.  It is worth leaving home to have the pleasure of returning to it as you will have.  You leave it often enough to value it.  I stay at it too much, to value it.  In future you will have to carry me to Columbia with you, then you will be satisfied.  Next winter the Rail Road will be so far advanced, the journey will be nothing.

	The weather tonight is quite cold.  The meat is safe.  Several persons killed today.  Mr. Foster has sent 3 loads of Corn, 8 barrels in each load, the servant says.  Mr. Brooks told me Mr. Furman would most likely be elected to the Baptist church as Preacher, & that he is a hot Secessionist.  Last summer, went about making stump speeches.  How weak minded ministers are.

	Mary has not brought the Patriot yet.  I will stop writing & go to bed, & finish tomorrow.  I slept very little last night.  Was kept awake thinking of you, so I am very sleepy now.  I hope tomorrow night to hear better news.
