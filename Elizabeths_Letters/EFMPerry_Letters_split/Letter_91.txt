Letter 91

Friday morning, 10 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I hope I am going to write, now, one of my last letters to you, that you will very soon be at
home.  The remainder of my letters I promise you shall be pleasant ones, for I do not intend to give you any more advice, & only wonder that I should have ever set up my will & judgement, in opposition to yours, you know you are in my opinion incomparable.  I received two delightful letters from you Wednesday night.   I wish you had written me two every Mail.  Your letters have been my chief pleasure since you left.  They compensate me a little for your absence.  I thank you for all you have got for us.  You are so generous, that when away from me, I believe there is no wish of mine you would not gratify.  I am always afraid to express a wish, knowing you will go beyond it.  You deserve a good Wife, & I will be a kind sweet wife to you.  I wish you to love your Home & those in it above every thing.  They ought to constitute your chief happiness, but your duty to your country also, must not be forgotten, & you are so well fitted to be of service to your Country, that you must be willing even at a sacrifice to your feelings, to devote your talents & all the gifts you possess for your Countrys interest.  My only fear has been, whether in going to Congress, you can still support your family, but I have thought what you made by going would compensate for what you lose in practice, & as Law business is declining, perhaps you would do just as well, as you will not make as much in future at the Law.  Except in Equity & that business, you can still carry on almost as well as if you were here all the time.  I think perhaps you can even carry your family to Washington sometimes if you are elected.  Mr. Barnwell Rhett who is very economical did.  Housekeeping is expensive, & if we give up Housekeeping a whole Winter, & hire out all our servants, except one who will stay at home to take care of the negro children & the animals, this will enable us to pay the board of our family at Washington.  However after you go on one Winter & see how matters are, you can make some pleasant arrangement I know.  One thing I am determined on, & that is not to have as many servants about us as we now have.  It is a useless expense, the feeding & clothing so many  & losing the interest on the money they cost.  I have done so well without Edward, that I will be sorry when he comes back, & I think then we must hire out Lindy, or put her out to Mary McLeod; but I must not fill up my letter with all these plans.  I only mention them, that you may know we can live more economically, if there is a necessity for it. & to beg you not to have any misgivings on your future course.  Your judgement is so good that I do not think you would have formed such plans for yourself if they have been wrong, & I am not going to worry about the election, but leave you to manage it as you think best.  Hoping that you will manage us to be successful.  You do not write a scrawl, your writing is as plain to me as print, only sometimes the name of an individual I cannot make out, but the name I asked you about I told Willie looked like Symms, you spelt it with a y , but I did not think it was Simms, because I did not know he knew much about Congress, or even knew Mr. Orr.  I had forgotten he was once a member of the Legislature himself.  Since our Hogs were killed, the weather has become warm, but many have killed, even since it became warm, so I suppose there is no danger of our Meat spoiling, & that it will turn�soon again.  Yesterday it rained, today it is cloudy & looks like rain, so our fence has not been commenced yet.  Margaret this week sent to beg me to let Eliza go & help her work.  I asked the servant who she was working for, & among others she mentioned, she was making a Wedding dress for Miss Foster.  I asked when she was to be married.  She said Christmas.  So Harriet Foster must have been accepted.  Dr. Hillhouse, so much for owning a few negroes, it makes up even for lameness.  I am glad she is to be married, for I would be sorry that a misfortune debar her of happiness in this life,  but certainly it is owing to what she has, not what she is, that she should be chosen, & it does not say much for the young man.  I have been reading the Mountaineer, but I do not take the interest in Col. Townes letters, as I did in yours for I principally wish to hear about you, & of course when you wrote, you mentioned all you did.  I see Col. Townes is going to introduce the bill I told you to, limiting the Judge to 65.  It will�the Judges feelings, & they will retire from the Bench  with honor, except, they will be apt to conceal their age & never reach 65.  Willie & Anna are at school.  Anna often lays the supper table.  The other evening after laying it, she ran in the kitchen & brought in the supper.  She said, you must write & tell papa I brought in every thing  except the Tea.  I said yes, & every thing was the hot water & bread, she said the Molasses too.  Frank repeats constantly, �why don�t Pa come.�  I told him of the pretty knife you have bought him.  He wants to know how many blades it has, is very much afraid it has not two.  He must have two blades, he says like�. as he calls Willie.  Fanny has had a cold, but it is almost well now.  She wets her clothes so from drivelling.  It is impossible to keep her from catching cold.  She presses her gums together, as if they hurt her.  I hope before long she will have some Teeth.  We were not able to go to Mrs. Perry Duncan�s Thursday, as I expected.  I do not know if we can go at all, but if possible we will go one day next week.  I want to ask Mr. & Mrs. Arthur to pass one day with me, before you return, if not after you come back.  I told her I was going to.  Cousin Isaac�s Wife is not amiable, but selfish in the extreme & so fussy.  She had a child after I left last Winter.  She did not nurse it, & now expects to have another, & Aunt Eliza says, she will not leave the house except to ride, & if she had kept her own counsel, she would have gone out some time longer, without anyone knowing even, she was in that way.  I dare say she is not an amiable wife.  She is too selfish even for that.  I expect she made cousin Isaac leave Alabama.  For Aunt Eliza�s sake, I would like him elected, his own too, as I am sorry for him.  Although you have never been a particular friend of his, you must do what you consistently can for him, but I expect no election comes on now.  I have heard of none, & I forgot I must not advise you.  I will be disappointed if I do not hear from you tonight.  Mamma is not well, the rest as usual.  Yours, E.F.P.
