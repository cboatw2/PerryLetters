Letter 141

Wednesday morning, 28 November 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

	I expect mamma, Susan & Ann to dine here today.  I have got everything ready for them, & until they come will employ my time writing to you.  I may not be able to write a long  letter.  I am anxiously looking forward to the Mails arrival tonight, bringing me a letter.  Today is rather cold, so as a good many persons are killing hogs.  Reuben & Charles have killed 5.  They intended killing all, but I think it is not cold enough at all.  Mr. Hoke is not killing & came over yesterday to say we had better not; afterwards Reuben said, he told him he might. But I know from his not killing himself, he does not think it cold enough so after killing five, I told Charles he had better not kill any more, but as soon as the weather gets a little colder, they will finish with the others, for it is better not to run a risk with all.  I would have preferred not killing at all today, because it is not as cold weather as we generally kill in, but the servants were so anxious to kill, that they would not wait.
	I was trying to pass my time pleasantly in your absence, so last night I invited Mrs. Kingsland & her Sister & the family generally to take tea with me.  Mrs. Kingsland her Sister & the children came & we spent a very pleasant evening.  Mr. Kingsland came for them, & was quite agreeable.  We looked at the books, pictures, &c.  

	Fanny Town[e]s slept with Anna last night.  Fanny this morning after she was dressed sat on the floor, & after looking quite sad, said, �I wasn�t to see Pa, Ma.�  She talks often of you & if anyone offends her, says I wont give you any cake Pa brings me.  She is now in the Piazza talking to herself, is playing with the Waiters I think, & every now & then saying �you wont do so any more?�  She can amuse herself with any thing.  I hear her now carrying on a conversation, with whatever she is playing with.
	No more letters have come for you.  I suppose persons know you are away.  Only the Charleston paper came last night.  Jim is a shabby fellow.  I sent word to Betsey his Wife, to tell him to come to me.  She sent word she did not expect to see him.  He did not come near her.  He has not been to see her since she returned, & last Sunday told Mr. Arthurs servant, who works at Mr. Rosemonds to stop for 25 cts I owed him; said he had hurt his feet, & could not come in.  I expect he supplied Betseys place, while she was away, & does not care now to see her.  
	Anna & Frank are at school.  Frank likes going very well.  I am wondering how Willie is coming on, & whether he passes his time pleasantly.  It is certainly more improving than to be at home running about the streets.  He will be more manly going about with you.  I hope he is a good boy.  You were wondering who Mr. Hopkins purchased his place from.  It was one of Pink Hawkins� places, called the Dozier place.  He gave I believe 800 dollars for it.  Mr. Beattie purchased the McClanahan place & Mr. Farr the home place.  Mrs. Hopkins Father wishes to purchase a place also, would like the place Mr. Beattie bought, as it joins Mr. Hopkins.  Dr. Simons I have not heard anything of lately.  I�say his school will succeed at first, as a new thing is apt to up here, but as he himself is so unsteady, I hope it will not last, & Mr. Stuart must not be discouraged, if Dr. Simons does for a while get a good many scholars.  Mr. Erwin wishes to rent Dr. Austins house & take boarders as well as assist Mr. Leary. 
        Before this I suppose you have seen Mr. Jones.  I am anxious to know, whether he is a candidate for Solicitor.  I expect next year he will be Candidate for Governor, & in three years for President.  If Genl Whitner is going to give up his Office, you must think of it.  You are more entitled to it, than any other Lawyer on the Circuit, & whenever he does give up, you must take the place.  He has seemed for some time to be so unwell, & take so little interest in his profession, that it seems likely he intends to resign, & Mr. Jones is aware of it.  It is really�to think of being Solicitor, when he cannot issue a Writ; he certainly is ignorant of his real worth.  He is like the ignorant man, Mr. Arthur mentioned in his last sermon, who knew so little, but his ignorance made him think he knew everything, whereas the wise man, knowing how much in reality he was ignorant of, felt humble & diffident.  I am anxious to know if Mr. Jones really is a Candidate for Solicitor, it must be a mistake.
	Our household are well.  I have very little to write you about.  I will try & go see Evel� Foster , who was married last night, if she does not leave too soon.  
	I must now close, with love to Willie & yourself.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
P.S. You must try & get the place for Mr. Markleys son.
Since finishing my letter I have seen Charles & he says he has killed all the hogs.  Susan is now here, & says Mr. Luther says it is the right weather to kill, that his Father & a great many are killing today, that though it is not very cold still this kind of weather will continue.
