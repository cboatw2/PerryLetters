Letter 50

Friday morning, 28 November 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	The great event is over, & Susan is married.  We went to the church last night between 6 & 7.  Mamma invited a few more persons than at first she intended.  Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Walker, Mrs. Dr. Earle.  Mr. McBee also invited more.  Mrs. Irvine, Mr. Swandale, Mr. Cline & some others.  Dr. Crook was there & Mr. Croft had to take your place & give away Susan after the ceremony was over.  Mrs. McBee�s family, Mr. Pinckney & his sister, Dr. Crook & myself returned to Mamma�s & spent the evening very pleasantly, in cutting up cake, wrapping it up, & directing it to our friends away, & also many in the village.  Susan has sent some by Mr. Elford this morning to Columbia to you, & also a peice to Mr. & Mrs. Martin, Mr. & Mrs. Taylor & Pinckney McBee which you must give to them.  You will not be able to eat the whole of your peice yourself, but you can divide it with your particular friends, particularly those from Greenville.  And oh! How I wish I could promise Susan so much happiness in the married state, as I have enjoyed.  I must say I have my fear, but I hope they will never be realized.  I only wish she could be as happy as she deserves to be.  No one ever deserved happiness more than she does.

	I read your letter in the Mountaineer this morning.  I liked it, except your comparison of Mr. Edwards manners to those of a womans.  I am sure women are not always mild & amiable, but I suppose you judge of all, by your wife.  You must be careful & make no statement in your letter, but what is perfectly correct.  You must write good letters, & give all the information possible.  I am sure in Greenville, we would not know what was going on in Columbia, if it were not for you.  So you must do well for your district this session.  The resolution of Mr. Henry�s about Seduction, is the one I have wished you to introduce.  Mr. Pinckney says he went to see Mr. Obed Wells yesterday, that he looks badly.  He had a relapse last Sunday.  Mr. Cleveland is very low, & it is thought cannot live very long.  I was very glad to hear from you Wednesday.  I hope to have that pleasure again tonight.  The Judges trunk had quite an amusing fate.  You may tell Mr. Martin that next winter certainly, I hope to visit Columbia & Charleston.  I am impatient to see my friends.  

	The hogs you will be glad to have heard are safely housed for the winter.  They were very small ones.  You may judge of their size by knowing, that their fat only made half a Can of good Lard & half a can of bad Lard.  Mr. Holcombe has not sent what you engaged from him.  I dare say he will soon.  

	Mrs. Griffin brought a few days ago, some Cider, which she said you engaged from her.  She had not enough apples to make the quantity you desired.  She brought only 15 gallons.  It seems good.  I have bought a new spinning wheel for Maria at 1.50 & a pr of Cards 62 ? .  I begged Alexander McBee to send me a dollars worth of Cotton.  He says they are buying it at 7 cents a pound.  Jim says one of the worst bargains, you have lately made is March [&] that of the two he would rather have James, & that James is good for nothing.  He said if March works hard for 15 minutes, he complains of being sick, & seems overcome.  He says his sickness is reality not pretence, that March says he has always been weakly.  Yesterday he was obliged to stay at home on account of pain in his stomach.  He told me this morning he was subject to it, since he was a child.  He looks weak, I am sorry for him, but still wish you to better yourself as soon as you can; exchange him if you can do no better for little negroes, as Mr. McNeely proposed.  I believe Rabe has wilfully cheated you, & if he was here you ought to see him.  After all the trouble you had about his case, you will have gained nothing.  I am provoked that you did not make him pay you.  He has money, for he had sold property.  He is a deceitful creature.  If you keep March he will be an expense to you, so you had better try & dispose of him & James as soon as possible.  I tell you this not to worry you, but as a peice of news, & you said I must tell you everything.  The children & myself are quite well.  Willie says he is learning fast so that he will be sure to have his knife.  I hope Mr. Elias Earle will be elected.  I am sorry for Mr. Ancrum too.  I do not think rich men ought to apply for office.  There should be a law against it.  

	I have no news to tell.  There is one peice of business which I would like you to attend to for me.  I would like you just to inquire the price of some fruit, & let me know.  Perhaps I might like you  to send me up a little for my party, if it is good, & cheap, but if it was dear, I would not think of getting it so don�t you get any, but in your next letter tell me the price, & also of Cocoa nuts.  I would be provoked at your getting fruit at a high price.  What was sent Mamma from Charleston, was cheap, but is all decayed.  I thought perhaps in Columbia it might be cheap also.  I only wish for the present to know the price.  Mamma intends sending to Columbia perhaps tonight a box, containing cake for our friends, which you must send by the first opportunity to Charleston.  Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P.
