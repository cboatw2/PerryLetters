Letter 50

Wednesday night, 11 December 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your two letters, one by Mr. Burt, & one by the mail.  I wrote to you last night, but I write again tonight, so that you may hear Sunday night.  Tomorrow I will not have time to write you, before I leave.  I am glad you have expressed no objection to my going, for I am now half packed up.  I will be sorry the Legislature adjourns so soon, if it prevents your passing Christmas there .  It does not seem worthwhile to be at the trouble of preparing for such a journey, & to stay less than a fortnight.  I had thought the Legislature was to adjourn the 20th & that I would be away more than two weeks, & have made my preparations accordingly.  The children were so badly off for clothes, I have been obliged to buy at once, what I intended to get at different times during the winter.  The money you left me was not sufficient, so I have borrowed from Mamma, but for the remainder of the winter, I intend really to spend little.  I have bought the children some thick clothes, to keep them warm, & which they ought to have. If it is only to save the washing.  I hope in consideration of my being such a good wife, having attended to everything so well during your absence, & having so few opportunities of recreating, that you will oblige me & pass Christmas at Mrs. Cunninghams.  It will be keeping you there only four or five days.  When we were there before,  I acknowledge I was wrong to urge you, for you had asked leave of absence of the Legislature, to come home, this time is different.  But I will not say any more about it, for I believe the less anxiety I express to do a thing the more inclined you are I should do it, & I promise you not to behave badly, but to be reasonable.  The reason I was so anxious to accept Mrs. Cunninghams invitation was, that I think it pleasant to have some place to visit for a little change, particularly pleasant for me, who have so little variety in Greenville, no changes whatever, not even one person with whom I am intimate, or can have heart intercourse with.  Mrs. Cunningham I really like.  They all seem such sincere friends of yours, that I cannot but have a regard for them.  It is a pleasant place I think to visit at, & if ever I accepted their invitation I might as well now.  Pamela�s asking me there, & I asking her here are very different.  She must have company, without having them to stay at her house, but in Greenville there are plenty of boarding houses, where she can pass her time more pleasantly than with me, & I am a young housekeeper, & her mother an old one, with every convenience for seeing company.  However if I ought to ask her, I have no objection to doing it.  As regards passing Christmas there, do not be uneasy, I will leave you to follow the dictates of your kind & generous heart.

	I am so glad the hogs are killed, the meat is salted, the sausages stuffed, the lard dried  Mr. Goodlet[t] says he will return what Corn he borrowed, so there will be enough to last until after Christmas, without hauling any more.  Elisa during my absence, will iron a little, then make hers & her childrens clothes, & if she gets through with that, help Susan work.  Minerva  will wash first, then work for herself, milk, superintend ther churning, & clean the yard.  Edward will churn, go to the spring, & take care of the little dog.  Lindy will leave with Mamma, James will cut wood & attend to the animals.  

	Mrs. Walker must be very incorrect like her dearly beloved.  I have not heard a word of Scarlet fever, & dont believe her son had it.  I dare say Dr. R� attended him, & thought he would gain credit by having recovered a patient of Scarlet fever, & therefore said it was that.  

	I am very glad you have gained Mrs. Fields case, & some others.  I suppose there is a probability you will gain them when they are tried again.
 
	I am glad you have been performing your duty to your constituents.  I am also pleased you are complimented on your good looks.  I suppose you have followed my advice, & now look less venerable than you did when you left home.  I knew Mr. Quirk had agents in Columbia.

	I dare say in the letter that has not appeared in the Mountaineer, you said something
 you ought not to, & Mr. Wells thought it would injure you if published.  If he proves his regard in this way, I will really like him.

	I am [have] been so busy I have not been able to see Mrs. Mauldin, but several messages have passed between us, & she has been very kind (as I told you) in letting her children give Anna a basket, & Willy & Frank a little Tumbler apeice.  I like his store better than any in Greenville, & he this year has beautiful goods, & he is more generous than any merchant here.  He this afternoon gave me a box of Leads, but they are too large for my pencil.  They may do for yours.  I cannot get any to fit mine, & he gave me a box to keep a cup I bought for Willy in, & in other ways he is generous.  I would like to see Mr. McWillie.  He must be handsome if he looks like Frank, my little darling.  Willy has really improved in his reading, & takes so much more interest in it, that I find it much easier to teach him.

	The weather [page torn] bright & clear, only a little too cold, but we will wrap up warm tomorrow.  Mr. Lester has drawn me a sketch of the road we must take.  I will set off on 1 oclock, & the next day very early.  

	Mr. Green, Mr. Lester�s uncle in law died this morning of Dropsy which he has had sometime.  Miss Earle was married last night.  Mr. Pinckney married her.  Neither she nor the groom knew anything of the Episcopal ceremony.  They did not know a ring was necessary, so that part had to be omitted, & the parts the couple ought to repeat, Mr. Pinckney repeated for them, & they bowed their assent, & instead of being in front of Mr. Pinckney, they were nearly at his side.  Miss Rinehart came to me this morning & told me about the wedding.

	I feel thankful whenever I think of my tooth being drawn, that I will be no more troubled with that at least.

	It is now near eleven oclock.  I have sat up till near eleven oclock every other night, to write to you.  Do you not think I am a good wife & ought to be indulged sometimes.  Do not be uneasy if you do not hear from me regularly.  I may be prevented from writing at Mrs. Cunninghams.  May you be blessed my dear husband & return & make your wife happy, Liz
