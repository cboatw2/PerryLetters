Letter 246

Thursday morning, 10 oclock, 6 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just received a letter from you, & am very glad to hear.  Your Papa is getting a great deal better & will soon I hope be quite well.  He has now rode to the Farm to fix upon a spot for Mr. Lasly to build the Log house.  When he comes back I will get some money from him to send in this letter.

	 I am glad you still enjoy yourself.  The weather is now much pleasanter; today is very fine.  Monday afternoon we had a real Snowstorm, & the snow continued on parts of the ground for several days, but has now all melted away.

	Yesterday afternoon I set off to walk to your Grandmama�s, but before I got halfway, I met Susan herself coming in, so I turned back, & was very glad to, for the ground was very damp, & I had on thin Gaiters.  

	This afternoon Jenny Carson is to have company.  Susan told me Annie was to go. & this morning, Miss Malinda, to my great surprise, sent to ask Willie & Frank to go.  I thought she would not have asked any of my family, but I am glad she did, as I hope she feels kindly to them, so I sent word Willie & Frank should go with pleasure.  They go at 4 oclock this afternoon.  

	Mr. Leary was to leave Greenville today.  Mr. Irwin told your Papa, Mr. Leary said, Willie understood what was taught him, better than any boy he knew of, & his chief regret in  going away, was leaving Willie & George Wells.  Willie was to have gone to the Baptist College but it commences in February, so in the meantime he will go to the Academy, & if he improves, I hope your Papa will continue him there.  Mr. Thomas & Mr. Hillhouse are both to be in the Academy.  Mr. Thomas teach[es] the large, & Mr. Hillhouse the small boys.  Frank is very sorry at this arrangement.  He wishes Mr. Thomas to teach him.  A Catalogue of the Students of the Furman Institution has been published & �B. Franklin Perry,� is among them.  

	Fanny has gone to school again today.  Johnny walks with her.  I think she likes it quite well.  She has bought a Copy book & a lead pencil & a Primer.  Annie came in after Fanny left with Permilla & went to school.  Julia Sharp goes to school, & the Brookes, & Eliza Lynch & a good many.  Miss Hopkins teaches in Mr. Crofts old house.  Miss Bessileau lives there now.  I have not heard how many students she has, or who they are.

	Tom Butler has sold his place to Mr. Campbell, & bought that small place of Jimmy Gallows on the Anderson road beyond Abram Willimans.

	Mr. John Jones left last night, & not the night before as I had expected.  He came in the village Tuesday evening too late for the Stage.  I hope my cloak is now on the road, & will soon be safe in Mr. Reeds store.  In future I will have to write to your cousin Eliza to shop for us.  She understands what suits us, better than Aunt Mary.  She has shopped well for you.  She & Susan are smart to be able to make bonnets for themselves.  You must learn to work for yourself in the same way. I mean as you grow older.  Velvet bonnets are very pretty & lasting.  If you make yourself useful, you will always be happy.

	Mr. Smith who was in Browning & Semans Store has returned on account of Cholera.  He must be a great coward.  He asked Willie if you had returned, said he saw you almost every day in Charleston.  He came so near death last summer with Typhoid fever, I suppose it alarmed him, & he now wishes to be very careful.  Cholera not being infectious, is not advancing as other diseases, for if a person lives prudently, there is scarce any danger of taking it.

	Mrs. Henry Earle said her son William  told her if she would ask, when you were going to return, he would drive her.  I told her you were enjoying yourself so much you had no wish to return yet, & I might have added unless her son, was a very fine young man, he need�no thought on you now or ever, for it is  much better for a lady to remain single, than to marry, unless the gentleman has every quality to make her happy, & a happy single lady is far more to be envied than an unhappy married one.  Eliza & Susan are as happy as anyone can be.   They are useful members of society. & afford pleasure to so many friends, & have so much resource, that I dare say they do not know an unhappy moment.  How much better is their situation than Mrs. Hume Simmons, your Aunt Suzy�s & many others.

	Mrs. Westfield�s mother Mrs. Stokes is dead, & was buried Tuesday afternoon.  Col. Dunham�s health is very bad, & he is not expected to live long.             
      
      I will give your love to the Mauldins.  They do not go to school yet.
      
	Your Papa has given me 40 dollars, 15 of it you must keep to pay your expenses home, which will leave 25 dollars for you to spend.  When Eliza sends another list, I will know whether this will be enough or not.  I do not think I will write for anything more.  Our Groceries set off at a time the Rail Road was out of order & brought no freight, so they were sent to Hamburg to come up in wagons which has caused their delay, the roads being so bad wagons for the present are not travelling.  The box set off about that time, & I suppose was sent also to Hamburg.  Now the R[ail] Road is in order except the bridge & freight comes more quicky, so I am sorry over Groceries & the box did not wait until now.  The freight also from Hamburg is so high, the groceries will cost a great deal.  In future we will always get in the Spring.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza & beg her to write & to Eliza & Susan & beg Eliza to write.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry
