Dear Anna

	I wrote you a long letter yesterday & did not expect to write to you today, but as tomorrow no Mail goes, I will write now.  I have just received a letter from your Papa.  He is to leave Columbia today, & hopes to be at home tomorrow evening.  He comes up on the R[ail] Road & from there in Mr. Duncans carri[a]ge.  As neither of us now have to write to him, we can write oftener to each other.  I would be glad if every morning you would write to me, & tell me everything that interests you.  You will in this way tell me more than I will otherwise hear, for you will write of what may escape your mind when you get home.    As soon as you know from Mr. Elford what time he is to return, let me know.

	Four days in this week it has rained.  Today it seems as if the weather may clear.  I hope it will.  For your Papa�s sake who is coming home, for your sake, that you may be able to go about, & for my sake that I may have the house cleaned.  It is very dirty, so much mud is brought into the house by the servants. The carpets I have had turned, & whitewashed the two Dining rooms, & bought some reasonable furniture Calico at Crittendens & made new curtains for the dining room windows.  The Calico is beautiful & was only 9 1/4 cts a yd & everything looked neat, but the rainy weather has caused so much dirt to be brought into the house, that I now have to clean it all again.  The soil here is very bad, different from the City, & there the yards & streets are generally paved, which is so neat.  We are all well except Eliza.  She is sick in bed, & has been unwell a long time.  Dr. Crooks had to come & see her today.  Becky gets along well with all the servants.  They like her, & respect her, so I hear no more abuse & quarreling among them as I used to.  Baylies has Prayer meetings every evening in his room at�it is more of family prayers for the servants in the yard.  He thinks Lindy is feeling an interest in religion.  I hope so, & that it will make her a good servant.  Next Wednesday the 22nd Rutters time is up, & as your Grandmama does not like to hire Rutter with her two children, & have to pay 1 dollar month for Catherine who does nothing for her, only minds Rutters child & cannot even talk or go on a message, she intends to let Rutter & her children go home, & try Lindy instead.  If she does well, she will keep her.  If she does not, she will look for another servant.  Priscilla is there now, & I expect will stay there for her food & clothing.  She will help mind Lindy�s child.  Aunt Annie is very poorly.  Your Grandmama is not well today.  Alex & Vardry have been there since Saturday, on account of Alex being sick with Measles.  He has worms also.  The weather has been so bad, that since you left I have been out very little, once to your Grandmama�s, three times to ride on business, & twice to church.  Susan, Annie & Susy staid with me awhile.  Becky sent in word last night to say, I must write you word not to forget her comb.  Your Aunt Susy says you must be sure & bring 4 Sugar dogs for her children, & if the 25 cts she gave you to buy them with is not enough, to get more money from Aunt Eliza, who has some of your Grandmama�s money.  She wishes pretty dogs, & the children will be very much disappointed if you do not bring them, so you must not forget it.  Your Silver comb cost so much less than I expected, that I wish you to get one for Annie just like yours.  I suppose your size she can wear now, & when she gets older too, she needs a comb always to keep back her hair.  The horn one she breaks, & one of the plated kind her Mamma got her, but it hurts her head & she cannot wear it, so as I intended to get her a cloak but now she does not need one.  I will instead get her a silver comb, which will be a lasting useful present for her.  You I expect will not have money enough to buy it, so if your cousin Eliza will add it to the list I have already sent her, I will pay for it, when I pay for the other things.  Willie & Frank have bought have bought two pigs from me.  As soon as they can get at their Bank & pay me, I will send you the money to invest in something for them, books perhaps.  The Candy & Cocoa & ground nut cakes you must not forget.  50 cts worth of Sugar ground nut cake, 50 cts worth of Cocoa nut cake, 50 cts worth of Candy of different kinds, & 50 cts worth of Cakes of different kinds.  These things are instead of buying anything here for Christmas, & if you are not here Christmas, we will put off the celebration till you return, & it will be better, for at Christmas the servants have holiday, & cannot do much for us.

	After their holiday is over, they can wait on us, & Becky will make us something nice.  So do not regret if you are not here Christmas, we will wait for you.  I want you to buy a nice little bible for yourself, a larger size I wish for Willie & Frank.  If you choose you can buy the three Bibles in town.

	Beg Eliza to have a Cloak made for Fanny & buy a pretty bonnet & all I have written for.  Fanny has no cloak to wear to church.  I wish it made up, for Eliza is sick, & cannot work, & I have no pattern to make it by.  Some little girl of Fanny�s age you will know of to fit by.  Be sure to bring the cloak made, & try & get patterns for yourself.

	Beg Aunt Anna Hayne to carry you to see her friend, & our friend Elizabeth Jones.  I did not know until you mentioned it, that the Canaries were dead.  Gine my love to your Aunts & cousins.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.
