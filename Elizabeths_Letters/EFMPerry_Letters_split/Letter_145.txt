Letter 145

My dear husband

		Though I have nothing very particular to write about, as you may be disappointed if you do not hear, I will write you again.  I expect you were surprised by the last Mail.  I have just returned from carrying Mrs. Forbes to ride to Mr. Lowndes.  The view is prettier than I ever saw it.  The whole village & all the settlements about can be seen.  I told Mrs. Forbes Mr. Stuart had resigned, & she said; so Mrs. Durb� said, & with what spirit he had acted; that she understood when he went home. & began to consider the manner in which he had been elected, & how badly Dr. Simons had been treated by the Trustees, particularly how a Committee had acted, he determined to resign.  Did you ever hear such a story, & yet there may be truth in it.  You may depend on it.  Dr. Simons has had some understanding with him.  He has written to him & given him a Statement of his treatment.  Mrs. Forbes said she heard Mr. Stuart was elected on account of his being rich, that he had plenty of negroes to bring along with him.  All this I suppose has come from Dr. Simons, & if he has not written to Mr. Stuart, at any rate these are the reasons he gives for Mr. Stuarts resignation.  I begin to think it strange in Mr. Stuart to have resigned.  He had no right to, & it was no reason to give; his Wifes ill health, for I always understood he came here on account of health, that where he had been living was sickly.  Perhaps it will all be for the best; though on account of the Organ I will also regret his not coming.  Mr. Davis has been elected.  I hope he will be a good Teacher, for the children have been sadly neglected.  Dr. Simons acted outrageously.  I think Willie learned nothing with him.  Charlotte Smith told Miss Stuart; in Charleston he is thought half cracked.  Yesterday was a gloomy day;  I sat down quite easy, though I would see no one all day.  Minerva & Mary had gone to the Spring to wash. Eliza was sick in bed, & Lindy was to be our Cook.  At 11 I heard a wrap at the door & to my surprise Miss Stuart & little Henry Thompson were there.  Miss Stuart said she was obliged to shop, & had come to my home as being more convenient to shop from, than Genl Thompsons.  I told her I was glad to have her, but she never would have found me more unprepared to entertain her well.  So she went to shop & I laid the table nicely & Lindy killed a fowl & fixed it, & we had a Fist, & with the help of raisons, Almonds, & sweetmeats, we did quite well.

		Poor Mr. Kinloch died this morning.  He has been ill a long time.  His Mother & his sister Mrs. Singleton, passed down some time ago from Flat Rock.  His cousin Mr. Middleton, Mrs. William Lowndes both staid with him to nurse him.  It seems so strange his mother did not come up to him.  He is an only son.  His parents have been separated for a long time.  When he was a little boy we used to see him in New Haven where he was going to school.  Mrs, Forbes says she has heard he was sent there to be away from his Father & as soon as he had finished school, was put in the Navy, & when he found out how his Father had been treated, & that he had been purposely kept away from him, he had a difference with his Mother on account of it.  So I suppose this is the reason his Mother has not been with him.  I expect he had great feeling.  He died of an affection of the heart.  The funeral takes place tomorrow morning at the Mansion House.  The father I believe is in the Asylum at Columbia.  His Mother is a sister of Mrs. Aiken.  I sent to Mrs. Hoke to know who bought Mr. Ed Earles place, thinking you would wish to know, & she sent word Mr. Sam Earle, & that he gave 12,100 dollars for it.  I believe it is a mistake, Mrs. Sam Earle being here.  I have not heard anything about him except that he was here.  

		We have cold weather, so the hogs were killed at a very good time.  We are all well except Eliza, who has been in bed for 3 days with pain in her side,  She is better & thinks she will be up tomorrow.

		I hope to hear tonight from you.  It is a great disappointment when I do not hear.

		Tomorrow night there is to be a Cotillion party given as a farewell compliment to Mary Bradshaw & her sister.  Frank goes cheerfully to school, & is learning to read.  Fanny is my little companion, & all I can say of her is, she is as sweet & amusing as ever.

		I paid Mr. Miller for the Potatoes & bought some more.  Reuben & Charles ploughed yesterday, & are to plough this afternoon.  I hope soon to get a long letter from Willie, & to hear good accounts of him.  He attended Commencement I suppose, & perhaps Commencement Ball.  I will now bid you adieu with love to Willie.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. Willie said Aunt Eliza wrote a note to you asking you to send him to town.  Did you answer it.  I wish he could go.
