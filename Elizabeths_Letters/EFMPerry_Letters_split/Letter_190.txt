Letter 190

Friday morning, 11 oclock, 5 December [1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received a short letter from you last night.  You mentioned your Bill for giving the Election of the President to the people was lost you did not say; you made a good speech, but I hope you were satisfied with your effort, & not mortified at your ill success.  You know nothing is to be expected from the present Legislature.  They were elected before the people were enlightened & go against all reform.  The next Legislature will be different.  You can then introduce all the reforms you wish, & be supported.  You are now rowing against the current.  Next Session the current will go along with you.

		I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am glad Dr. Thornwell was elected President of the College.  I am sorry a Baptist for Dr. Thornwell�s place was elected, for I should think he would interpret the Bible according to the Baptist creed, which of all creeds is the most illiberal, & he will pervert the minds of the Students.  It is too small a denomination to be represented in College.  The students are generally of other denominations.  Mr. Wilkes� bill to repeal the Convention I like, & Mr. Owen�s bill �that the people have declared against Secession &c.�  They are just such bills as I suppose you would have introduced.  The Secessionists had better do all they wish now before another Session.  I hope their power will have departed, & all their acts repealed.  Then I hope you will be the Leader, & for once in a majority, & I hope you will be rewarded so do not be discouraged, if now you fail in your endeavors to free the Upper Country from the bondage of the lower.  All Reformers you know have to persevere, meet with opposition at first, but in the end are appreciated.  

		Next winter I must go down with you.  I love to hear public speaking, but above all else my husband speaking.  I would like to have been among the ladies in the Gallery listening to you.  Hext will be a fine boy to introduce next winter.  He will surpass Willie & Frank.  I kissed him for you, & delivered your messages to the children.

		Willie all day is so busy hauling wood.  He has very little time left for reading, & the exercise seems to agree with him.  He looks healthy & well.  When you return he can sit in your Office & read, & resume his studies, & the 1st of January he will again go to school, & Mr. Leary will have I suppose so few scholars he can attend well to him.  Anna�s school breaks up today.  Mr. Capers sent her bill yesterday for 6 weeks, 3 dollars.  My money had not given out, but except for your timely assistance last night of 10 dollars, I would not have ventured to have paid it, but this morning as my fund was replenished, I did pay it, sent 3 dollars by Anna, & felt quite independent.  There will be so many schools to choose from, when Anna begins again, I am as uncertain who she will go to, as who will be next President.

		Mr. Chalmers being a Secessionist, I would not have listened with pleasure to his speech; the Union man only would have pleased me.  They are to be admired for their independence if nothing else.  I love the Union men, those who come out openly for the Union.  The Cooperationists & Secessionists I have no sympathy for, they are both equally bad, but the latter more dangerous.  They both act from selfish motives, for their own aggrandizement, where they do not, they are ignorant & under a delusion that amounts to derangement.

		I would be glad for you to do something for Dr. Koch�s wife, but when you return, do not let him annoy you.  He is a perfect bore.  He has been here repeatedly after wood, which he has no idea of paying for, or he would go somewhere else, tells all manner of stories about his not being able to get anyone to haul it, & came yesterday to borrow Meal.  I sent him a little sausage, said I gave it , but would spare no more, & I do not see him now when he comes.  One or two loads of wood does not satisfy him.  He wishes us to supply him altogether.  Our horses are not equal to such a task, & I am not going to send him any more.  I do not believe he has a single scholar now, & he loses them by his own misconduct.  I think him so poor a Teacher, that I would hardly consent he should teach Anna for nothing.  He has disgusted her with Music, from the really hard peices he has given her which she plays, but more as a task than anything else.  Today is very pleasant, bright & cheerful.  I hope you have the same weather.  We sit altogether in the little Dining room, which is very comfortable.  The larger room we are keeping clean for you, but I have a fire made in it every day, in case anyone calls.  Mr. Elford seemed to admire the Carpet very much.  If he writes from Charleston, & you from Columbia, the Patriot will be interesting.  Mr. Reese�s letter & Mr. F��s poetry are published in this mornings paper.  I am afraid they will be published in the Weekly if next week, too late for the Session.  They put off publishing it so long, I was afraid they were not going to publish it, so I wrote yesterday to ask them to, & accordingly they did.  I wished you to see C� Reese�s letter at once, as I knew it would gratify you.  I am still staying at home, busy all the time, not one moment to spare.  The afternoons are generally windy,, or I would go over to see Mamma.  I must soon make one desperate effort, & return all my visits, & then stay at home with a clear conscience.  I have written to you every Mail but one or two when I got Anna to write, so you have heard every Mail.  It is a great comfort, & I begrudge the not hearing Monday night.

		The children have not commenced under Mr. Tisdale.  They seem disinclined to.  When you return if he is here, they can commence.  As I have not much to write about I will conclude with some advice.  You know I am very generous to you in furnishing a constant supply free of charge.  I do not wish you to be in debt to me, as you certainly would, if I charged.  So this is it.  Do your duty as a Legislator& a Patriot a Member from the Upper Country.  Do all your Constituents expect of you, & which you are so well able to do.  Satisfy your conscience, do not be disheartened at ill success.  Expect it now, sow the seed & after awhile it will appear & yield abundantly & though I am much afraid you will never be rewarded  in a tangible form, yet I will hope even against hope, & try to think you will be.  I appreciate you, but that does not satisfy me.  I wish you to be appreciated by others, & you will never be, unless you meet with honor & Office. In Greenville Village particularly, I wish you to be held in the consideration you deserve.  I cannot bear that all should not see & be made to feel how much you are their Superior, I hope you will one day occupy a position that will make them feel it.  Then I will be satisfied, for you will then be appreciated & your children after you.  This winter you are treated better in Columbia than you were last winter, & next winter as Mr. Elford says, you will be treated still better, for those who are making themselves so important now, I hope will be at home, & an entirely different set, more of your own views will surround you, so good bye, E.F.P.
