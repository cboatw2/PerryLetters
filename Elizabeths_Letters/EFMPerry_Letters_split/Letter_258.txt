Letter 258

Saturday, 1 oclock, 7 may [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	Day after day passes, & I do not hear from you.  I begin to think you must be sick, for as you are only one days journey from me, I cannot imagine why you do not write.

	I received a long letter from Susan toda, & one from Frank.  Lindy�s baby had been unwell but was better.  The rest of the family were well.  May day she says was the poorest display she ever saw, but they had plenty to eat, & the children enjoyed themselves.

	Aunt Turnbull sent today to say she would send for me at 2 oclock to stay with her, but I wrote word I would let her know Monday, after I heard from you, how long it was probable you would be in Columbia.  If you expect to come down soon, it would not be worth moving there.  If you were not coming for me, I would perhaps go there now, but I expect you would yourself much prefer being at a boarding house, than staying at Aunt Anna�s.  You prefer being independent, & I am afraid Aunt Anna for the short time I stay there, would expect me if she comes to Greenville to invite her to pass the summer.  This makes me reluctant to stay with her, but you write me what to do.  I hope to hear from you this afternoon.  Mrs. Martin is in this house, & is very polite.  Mrs. Julius Pringle is here, & is polite, but she is not a pleasant person.

	The weather is not hot; the noise I am getting accustomed to.  Direct your letters to the care of Mr. Wm E. Martin, or Wm Ed. Hayne.  I will then be sure to get them.  I think now there must be some mistake that you have written, & the letters have miscarried.  Mrs. Pringle�s servant this morning, brought me the two from Susan & Frank, & I am surprised none from you.

	Uncle Arthur last night sent to say, he had called repeatedly to see me, but I was out.  The servants do not tell me who calls.  

After dinner
	This morning when I returned from King St. I found Uncle Arthur had called again.  Aunt Anna Turnbull sent to ask me to ride with her this afternoon to Magnolia Cemetery, & I am going with her.

	I have just received a letter from you.  I am glad you are well.  I rather think as you think you will come down next week that I will remain where I am.  If you were not coming, I would go to Aunt Anna�s or Eloisa�s, but as you are coming, I do not think you would find it pleasant at either of those places, & I expect you would not be willing to stay at a Hotel, & I at a private house.  I do not think at Aunt Anna�s you would find it pleasant.  Perhaps Monday I could go to Aunt Anna�s & stay until you write word you are coming, & then I would move back to Mrs. Davis, & be in time to meet you here.  So hat do you think; write me by return Mail.

	Anna yesterday was unwell.  The water I expect has disagreed with her, & she was just loose in her bowels, & then bound, & in great pain, & Mrs. Pringle advised me to send for a Doctor, & I sent for Dr. Geddings, & he gave her some pills which have done her great good, & by tomorrow he said she will be well.  He paid her two visits so I will have to pay his bill, & if I were to move from here, I would have to pay the bill here, so I would be very glad if you would send me some more money to prevent my feeling embarrassed.  From 20 to 50 dollars according to your liberality, the letter in which you enclose it, you can direct to the care of Wm Ed Hayne, if you think it safer.  I have received two letters from you.  If these are all you have written, then there is no risk, but I think perhaps you have written some I have not received.  I was to get money from Alston for Mama, bit I dislike asking, so if I had enough I would prefer lending her mine.  Send the money by return Mail.  Mrs. Pringles servant goes for my letters, & brings them safely.  I will get him to bring me some Stamps, so you will not have to pay postage.  I will not determine about Aunt Anna�s until I hear from you, whether you will like to stay there, or like me to return to Mrs. Davis & meet you here, or you stay at a Hotel when you come, & I at Aunt Anna�s.  She may expect me to ask her to stay with me in Greenville, & this I cannot do.  Eliza dead, my work will be unusual, & I expect to devote every moment to sewing.  I see ready made clothes for children, & that is one thing I would like to get for Willie & Frank & why I wish more money, for I will not have time to do all, & do not understand making boys clothes.  Eliza�s loss is irreparable.  I deeply deplore it.  For 11 years she has worked for me & made my dresses better than a Mantua maker.  In consequence of her death, I am having a dress made here, which I will have to pay 3.25 for, & that is thought cheap, for 5 is the price.  I am glad I have heard.  If you could get business in Charleston, I would like you to move here.  I like a City.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Anna is well, but having taken medicine cannot go out this week.
