Letter 109

Monday morning, 6 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I must write you again.  Willie just put a letter of his in the Post Office this morning for you as he went to school.  He was interrupted twice, while writing it, so at last has to finish it in a hurry.  I received one from you last night.  I thank you for the present you have bought me.  Tell Genl Martin I will wear it with more pleasure knowing that Eloisa has one like it.  I am sorry for Judge Richardson, but his family if he did not, ought to have perceived he was too old to be a Judge.  Mr. Hoke says he ought to be impeached, or at least he seemed to think it was right, but I cannot say whether it was right or not.  If he heard he was to be impeached, it seemed�he did not resign.  Perhaps he thinks the resolution will not pass.  It seems such a dishonorable ending, for an honorable life.  As regards the Mexican War, you must have told me all your doing on that subject, to make me uneasy, for you know I have always thought you too zealous about it, particularly as you are a Candidate, & it is such an unpopular War, say what you will about it.  Mr. Orr perhaps is in favor of it, but he has the good sense & prudence, not to express his opinion constantly.  By the means you have taken to spread abroad yours, you will lose the Whig votes, the Calhoun men votes, & many of the Democratic votes, for even the Democrats are opposed to the War.  You & Col. Town[e]s are almost the only persons & Mr. Ritchie & Mr. Polk in favor of it.  As for me I think this country ought not to have considered the Mexicans worth fighting, & though an inferior people, like fools, they are the hardest to deal with, & in the end we will have to give way to them.  Everybody is tired of the War, & I wish we had peace on any terms.  We have more territory now than we can manage.  Disunion is even now threatened.  Therefore we are better without more Territory, & I do not see how that is to pay back the money spent in carrying on the War, & it cannot make up for the blood spilt which is worth more than the whole of Mexico.  Candidly I have read the speeches made on both sides of the questions, & I sincerely decide against the War, & I think it most unfortunate it was ever commenced.  It would have been best not to have noticed them, like some quarrels that persons get into, which are hard to settle & could so easily have been avoided at first. It is well you say, you are happy independent of being elected or not, for I think your prospects now, if you inquire, you will find very bad.  Mr. Orr ought to be happy electioneering himself, & you electioneering for him.  If you are indifferent as to mind being beaten, you ought not to be a Candidate, for a Candidate should strive to be elected.  I will consider it a great disgrace for you to be beaten by a man like Mr. Orr.  If you had acted judiciously I am certain you would have been elected.  Mr Orr I see attends to the interests of his District.  He does not meddle with the Mexican War.  Mr. Polk who originated it, must terminate it.  I have said more than I expected, but you must recollect, in your absence, I have no one to sympathize with me, or express my thoughts & feelings to, so when I write to you, I embrace the opportunity to express them to you.  You know I love, respect & have the greatest admiration for you, but I think sometimes you try to be too independent, just to show you are independent, & I feel certain by your course on the subject I have been writing, you have weaned many from you, who would have supported you.  Tomorrow Jim & Charles will kill half of the hogs.  We can attend to half at a time much better, & have fresh meat twice.  Mr. Hoke says some of yours would do better to fatten a little longer.  He only kills half of his.  He came over this morning to see me about it.  Mamma & Susan were here this morning.  Mr. Croft also made me a visit this morning.  I was engaged talking with him very interestingly about the Cunninghams &c. when Mamma came in.  Mr. Croft says Lawyers do not make as much as they did, that the Law is getting into disrepute, so you had better when Law declines, try & secure some other way of making money for your family, so you had better in future be more prudent how you act, for I think a seat in Congress now will be very eligible.  
	I have been interrupted by Mr. Hooker who came to say he would go on putting up the fence on Wednesday, & would like Charles & Jim to help him.  It will be a great pleasure to me to see the fence continued.  I forgot to tell Mamma about Mr. Choice�s carri[a]ge, but I am certain Mr. Choice will not exchange, & his carri[a]ge I think smaller than Mamma�s.  It can hold only 2 in the�.Mamma�s though crowded can hold 4, his is the prettiest looking.  Vardry has been here.  As you are his Godfather, I would like you to bring him a present, a Toy of some kind.  Bring him a present, instead of bringing one to Susan.  I told Mr. Croft you had seen Mr. Gliddon, & that you had a book written by him, so he borrowed the book to read.  Mr. Hooker said Judge Richardson ought to be made to resign, the general impression is that he should be made.  His last Circuit I suppose showed he was incapable of performing his duties.  A certain  age 65  will have to be fixed for the Judges to continue in office.  You once before introduced some such bill.  Suppose you introduce it this Session.  I know of no news whatever to tell you.  I have had a cold, but am now quite well.  I have written in a great hurry, & often been interrupted.  Aunt Eliza wrote word that Susan on her return from Columbia lost her Trunk.  The Omnibus in which it was placed went first to the Wilmington boat, & it must have been placed on board the boat by mistake.  It contained all of Susan�s clothes, all of them new.  She had fitted herself up completely, all of their Jewels, & a valuable package for Miss Elmore, & presents made Susan in Columbia.  The loss she says is not much less than 300 dollars.  Every effort has been made to recover it but without success.  Alston�s wife she says, is a lovely gentle being, intelligent & pious.  They are all very much pleased with her.  She sent Mamma a Slice of Wedding cake.  You will be glad to hear from me, I know, though I reason with you on some of your acts.  It is all for your good.  Fanny is crying for me.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
