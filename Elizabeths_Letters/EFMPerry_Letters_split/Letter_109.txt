Letter 109

Saturday morning. 10 oclock, 1 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna


	I have just received a letter from you, & am very glad to hear.  When nothing prevents it, you must write every day, but do not let writing to me interfere with any other engagement.  I write to you every day, because I hope my letters give you the same pleasure yours do me.

	I am glad to tell you your Papa feels much better today, & has gone to his office, but he will not be well enough to go to Newberry to attend the R[ail] Road meeting Wednesday.  I wrote to Aunt Eliza & yourself yesterday, to say I was perfectly willing you should remain longer in town, even if you wished it, as long as Mary Crayton staid, as she so decidedly said, your being with her was a pleasure, & you did not incommode her at all, even if her family were larger, it was no inconvenience to her, to have you.  But if at any time you feel anxious to return before Mary Crayton does, write & tell me so, & your Papa I dare say, by that time will be well, & he will go down for you.  Now that you are to stay longer, continue to be as good a girl as you have been, & your friends will be more & more attached to you.  Occupy yourself practicing & working & reading & make yourself useful in every way you can to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  Perhaps you can learn some new peices of Music to surprise me when you return.  If it gives no trouble, get one of your friends to teach you to knit a purse, & finish the Mit, & when Aunt Ann & Aunt Martha return, go & see them frequently, & Aunt � & Aunt Anna go & see, & Aunt Harriet I hope you will see before you leave.  I know she would be sorry not to see you.  You are passing your time so pleasantly, & seeing so much that is new to you. & seemed anxious to remain, that I am sure you will be pleased that your Papa & myself are willing you should.

	Soon I am to send 49 dollars to Aunt Mary McCall, 21 for the Cloak & 7.50 for the bonnet, making $28.50 which is spent uselessly, & I would gladly have sent to you,  The rest of the money is for two dresses & trimmings, as pr velvet Cuffs, a peice of ribbon for the neck, a pr Gloves & a blue veil.  This is all.  Next week I will send you more money.  Write word how much you wish.  As soon as you get your work box, write about it, & tell me the price.  I think it will be a very suitable present to make Aunt Eliza.  So after I hear about yours, perhaps I may write to you to get her one, but do not say anything about it, until you buy it & surprise her.  Inquire the prices of neat writing desks; either a writing desk or work box, whichever she most needs will be a good present for your Aunt.  I am glad you gave the Jar of Ginger & the other presents.

	Day after tomorrow is Sale day, & your Papa will receive money, & I will be able to send you all you need.  This week he has been paying some of his debts.  Three Doctors bills Dr. Crooks 58 dollars, Dr. Earle 24, & Dr. Dean 22,  Cox & Gower 189 dollars for the carri[a]ge & repairs on Buggy &c, Mr. Westfield 44 dollars, & Mr. Heldman 54.  For the Hogs Mr. Hoke bought 10 of them, he paid 140 dollars.  It is pleasant when one goes to town & sees so many things they need & cannot get here, to have plenty of money; your Papa paying his debts, & I also having to pay a large debt, prevents my giving you as much as I would like, but when you make another visit to town, instead of having to send 49 dollars to pay for what is of no use to me, I can give it all to you, & you can gratify your feelings, of generosity, & buy presents for all who have been so kind to you.  I am well supplied with clothes for next summer, & can save all of Minerva�s wages for the next visit any of us pay to town.

	You can buy for Mary Mauldin a little China cup or basket for 28 cts, also for Sally Hoke , a Sugar figure for Fanny Hoke she will be pleased with; more ground nut cake & Candy I will send money for as presents to the children here.  I will not show them the presents in the box if possibly can help it.

	Mr. McKays school begins Monday. & we expect Fanny will commence at once.  She says she does not wish to go, but I know she will be pleased.  She will be occupied, which will make her happy as it does everybody.  Sometimes she prefers going to Miss Hopkins, & then again to Mr. McKay.  We prefer sending her to the latter, so as to be with you.  

	In the Male Academy, Mr. Thomas a young man who graduated the other day in Columbia & took the third honor, is to teach.  We will send Frank to him.  Perhaps Mr. Hillhouse will also be engaged in the Male Academy.  Willie will go to the Baptist College, which does not commence until February.  Mamma let Reitta go home, & engaged old Mrs. Greens servant Sarah to go to her today. & Sarah has disappointed her & says she cannot go yet, so I was obliged to let Lindy go.  The yard is so much pleasanter now, since Becky was here, that Lindy is very sorry to go.  I expect she feels she is not able to do as well for Mamma as she ought, for she went off wiping her eyes.  She had her child in her arms.  Priscilla who is to mind it, following with a basket & escorted by Fanny, & Charlotte & Hext.  On account of the Measles being at Mamma�s, this is the first time Hext has been there since you left.  I told Lindy to do her best, for we were obliged to hire her out, as we had too many servants, & they must make something for us.  Though I did not intend to hire her out until her child was older, only to accommodate Mamma & let her go now, & if she did well it would be a good place for her.

	Tonight the servants here give a party.  Becky I believe is the one, & as she is a Methodist, it will be quiet, no dancing or noise.  There is to be a show here next week of animals & a Circus which the children are expecting with great pleasure.  I am glad Eliza is having Fanny�s cloak made.  Beg her to send it up by the first opportunity, either Butler Thompson or anyone Mary Crayton knows is coming.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  I am pleased at the high opinion they have of you, & hope you will continue to merit it.  Write me everything that interests you.  I write so often, Willie thinks it no use for him to write.  Mrs. Robinson & Butler Thompson go down next week, & today I am going to pack my Cloak to be ready for her to carry, & if she can take them, your bonnet, apron, & flannel petticoat.  I must now close.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	No mail comes today so I have not heard from you, but I cannot let the day pass without writing to you.  We again have bad weather.  Last week was tolerably good, & yesterday we were able to go to church, but this morning after breakfast it commenced raining & has now set in for a bad day.

	Willie & Frank & Fanny all set off for school today.  Fanny went to Mr. McKay, but the day being bad only the Brooks, two of them & Rebecca Croft & Harriet Crooks were there. So Mr. McKay said school would not commence until Wednesday, for tomorrow a snow is expected to be here.

	As the Baptist college does not commence until February we sent Willie to the Male Academy with Frank, but that school does not commence until Monday.  If we like it, Willie can continue there, but if he does not improve, we will send him to the college when it commences.	  

      Mr. Hillhouse keeps school in Dr. Irvines building back of the Baptist church.  Mr. Gailliard I believe is not going to keep school.
      
      Today I intended sending or carrying my box with my Cloak to Mrs. Robinson to take to town for me, & I have enclosed in a letter to you, my gold chain, for you to wear with your Medallion, when you take tea out, & a gold pencil case I bought once for myself, but it was too large for a lady, & I have never used it.  I send it, that you may make it a present to your cousin William Edward from yourself, as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mothers roof.  If he has no gold pencil case. Give it to him. but if he has one, this will be of no use to him, so I will think of something else for you to give.  I will write you about giving Aunt Eliza a present, & also Eliza & Susan.  I will send the letter enclosing the pencil case & chain by Butler Thompson, who carries down Mrs. Robinson or by anyone I can hear of going before.  I hope I can send it soon.  I will tomorrow, if the weather permits go up to Mrs. Thompsons to carry the box & letter, & inquire when Mrs. Robinson goes.  
      
      I hope you are satisfied & not disappointed your Papa is not going down as he first intended.  His being sick, & Aunt Eliza, Eliza, & yourself all writing to ask you should stay, I have written & suppose you have received the letters, saying you might.  I hope your longer stay will enable you to see those friends, who have been in the country, & perhaps returned by this time.  What do your friends think of the Daguerreotype?  Do they think yours a good likeness?  None of the others did justice.
      
      I would be very glad if you would learn to embroider& embroider clothes for yourself, & Fanny, Hext & your Aunt Susy�s children.  If not too hard you must learn.  I wish you could learn as you grow older every kind of work, like your cousins Eliza & Susan.  It makes you so useful, & happy, & it is such a resource & makes the time up pleasantly.  I hope in time you will knit, Crochet, embroider, & do every kind of work, so if convenient, commence now, & learn as much as you can while in town.  If it does not give your cousins trouble to teach you, you are so quick in everything I think you can learn easily.
      
      You will be perfect in playing your peices on the Piano, practicing them so much, perhaps you will learn a new peice.
      
      I am afraid the box will not come for a long time.  A box your Papa packed in Columbia when he was there, has not come yet.  The bad roads cause delays.  You will have to hang up a bag for Fanny, if you expect the box of furniture to surprise her.  A stocking would be too small.
      
      Your Papa is getting a great deal better.  Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Susan, & thank them again for being so kind to you.    I am glad you were able to visit alone.  You will learn to be independent.
      
      Annie slept here night before last, but she would go home yesterday, or I would have kept her longer.  None of your Grandmama�s family were able to come in to church yesterday.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

I sent you 8 stamps.

Dear Anna


	I have been disappointed today in not hearing from you, but suppose you were prevented writing by some engagement, & as I have said before, I never wish you to write to me when anything occurs to make it inconvenient.  I received two letters from you yesterday.  I wrote to Eliza & Aunt Mary McCall, which left me no time to write to you.  I sent Aunt Mary 49 dollars to pay my bill, which I am very glad she will soon receive.  I disliked being in debt to her so long.  If your Papa comes in before I close this letter, I will get some money from him & send it to you.  I would send to his office, but persons are generally there & he dislikes being interrupted by messages.  If I do not send the money today, I will tomorrow.

	I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.  Miss Drayton has been very kind to you.  I suppose you know the Fords are cousins of yours.  You have so many relations, you might stay in town a long time, before you found them all over.  The patterns of your Cloak & dress are beautiful.  The dress much prettier than the blue one Aunt Mary sent me. & well worth 64 cts more a yard.  A Cloak as dark as yours would have just suited me.  I am very anxious to receive Fanny�s.  She has not been to church yet, for she has nothing to wear [&] if the box does not come soon, I will have to buy her a dress here.  The Cloak I hope will come by some private opportunity.  My Cloak Aunt Mary will change for a black Cape, about one yard deep, which she says will be very comfortable.  I can wear it this winter for dress, & next winter I hope get a handsome cloak.  As soon as the box arrives I will let you know.  The bad roads will delay it for a long time.  Our Groceries I dare say will not be here for weeks or months.

	Fanny went to school today.  Willie & Frank will go Monday.  Mr. Rosemond has commenced building the new kitchen.  It is to be joined to the old one, & have four rooms, two below for a kitchen & ironing room, & two above for chambers.  The kitchen we have been working in so long, will be a general sitting room for the servants, so our kitchen can be kept clean, & the Cellar will be kept as a Lumber room.

	 Lindy is still over at Mamma�s & Sarah Green is not a good servant, so your Grandmama hears, & I expect she will be obliged to keep Lindy.  Susy has the Measles.  I would be very sorry for Lindy�s baby to take it, but it must now take its chance; for I am obliged to let Lindy stay there, Mama having ho servant to cook.  R� is hired to Mrs. Charles Roberts.  	

	There was a Circus here yesterday, & an animal show.  The two shows connected together.  The children went & were delighted.  More ladies must have been at it, than I have ever known before from what the children say, & I hear Ministers even were there, Mr. Buist & Mr. Mims.  The say it was an uncommonly good performance.  I saw nothing of it.  The band did not [page torn] down the street as they generally do.

	Your Aunt Annie is as poorly as ever, & as much opposed to your Aunt Susy & the children being there.  I do not know anyone more dreadfully situated than your Grandmama.  The walking being so bad, & the horses all the time hauling wood.  I have been there very little, & your Grandmama scarcely ever can have her horses, as they are all the time hauling wood, & Aunt Annie does not like her to leave her for one moment.  

	I have not paid any visits since you left.  Writing has been my principal occupation, & Eliza being still confined to her room, I am obliged to sew.  Clara made my blue dress, not as well as Eliza, & the other one I am keeping for Eliza to make.  The baby is well, & so is Eliza, but she will not be out of her room for two weeks yet.  Clara is now working for Mamma & Ann & Susan.

	Susan Hoke says she has repeatedly written to Augustus Hoke to go & see you, & she thinks he cannot have received the letters, & so does not know you are in town, but it is no consequence  whether he goes or not, except it is rather ungrateful in him not to go & see Aunt Eliza who was kind enough to invite him to tea; but I dare say he feels awkward, not being accustomed to visit among ladies.  

      I am glad you are learning independence & visiting alone.  A little girl may be modest, & yet at the same time be easy & independent, & able to act for herself.  I am glad also you play for your friends on the Piano.  It is right to begin at once, & be obliging, & not refuse, which generally proceeds from affectation & a too great desire to please.  They refuse, because they are afraid they will not excite admiration enough, though sometimes it is from awkwardness.  I am glad to hear that you are obliged & able to entertain your friends.  I hope you will play well when you return.  It is no consequence whether you work much on your quilt now.  You will have plenty of time to finish it when you return.  
      
      Mrs. Beattie & Mrs. Henry Earle have been here since I commenced writing.  Mr. Mauldin I hear is much better.  He is still in Columbia.  Mrs. Joab Mauldin stays with Mrs. Mauldin.
      
      Sally & L� Cleveand are going to school at the Limestone Springs, & Mrs. Cleveland is going in the county.  Your Papa has not come home since I commenced writing, & I sent Fanny to his office this moment, & two gentlemen are there, so I cannot send the money today, but will soon.
      
      I hope you are behaving so well, as still to merit the good opinion of your friends.  I sent the box with the Cloak & a letter containing the chain & pencil case by Mr. John Jones last night.  I had sent the bonnet & petticoat before I got your letter saying you did not need them.  Fanny says she likes school.  There are a great many scholars, Vardry & Annie go.  Give my love to Aunt Eliza & my cousins.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have just received a letter from you, & am very glad to hear.  Your Papa is getting a great deal better & will soon I hope be quite well.  He has now rode to the Farm to fix upon a spot for Mr. Lasly to build the Log house.  When he comes back I will get some money from him to send in this letter.

	 I am glad you still enjoy yourself.  The weather is now much pleasanter; today is very fine.  Monday afternoon we had a real Snowstorm, & the snow continued on parts of the ground for several days, but has now all melted away.

	Yesterday afternoon I set off to walk to your Grandmama�s, but before I got halfway, I met Susan herself coming in, so I turned back, & was very glad to, for the ground was very damp, & I had on thin Gaiters.  

	This afternoon Jenny Carson is to have company.  Susan told me Annie was to go. & this morning, Miss Malinda, to my great surprise, sent to ask Willie & Frank to go.  I thought she would not have asked any of my family, but I am glad she did, as I hope she feels kindly to them, so I sent word Willie & Frank should go with pleasure.  They go at 4 oclock this afternoon.  

	Mr. Leary was to leave Greenville today.  Mr. Irwin told your Papa, Mr. Leary said, Willie understood what was taught him, better than any boy he knew of, & his chief regret in  going away, was leaving Willie & George Wells.  Willie was to have gone to the Baptist College but it commences in February, so in the meantime he will go to the Academy, & if he improves, I hope your Papa will continue him there.  Mr. Thomas & Mr. Hillhouse are both to be in the Academy.  Mr. Thomas teach[es] the large, & Mr. Hillhouse the small boys.  Frank is very sorry at this arrangement.  He wishes Mr. Thomas to teach him.  A Catalogue of the Students of the Furman Institution has been published & �B. Franklin Perry,� is among them.  

	Fanny has gone to school again today.  Johnny walks with her.  I think she likes it quite well.  She has bought a Copy book & a lead pencil & a Primer.  Annie came in after Fanny left with Permilla & went to school.  Julia Sharp goes to school, & the Brookes, & Eliza Lynch & a good many.  Miss Hopkins teaches in Mr. Crofts old house.  Miss Bessileau lives there now.  I have not heard how many students she has, or who they are.

	Tom Butler has sold his place to Mr. Campbell, & bought that small place of Jimmy Gallows on the Anderson road beyond Abram Willimans.

	Mr. John Jones left last night, & not the night before as I had expected.  He came in the village Tuesday evening too late for the Stage.  I hope my cloak is now on the road, & will soon be safe in Mr. Reeds store.  In future I will have to write to your cousin Eliza to shop for us.  She understands what suits us, better than Aunt Mary.  She has shopped well for you.  She & Susan are smart to be able to make bonnets for themselves.  You must learn to work for yourself in the same way. I mean as you grow older.  Velvet bonnets are very pretty & lasting.  If you make yourself useful, you will always be happy.

	Mr. Smith who was in Browning & Semans Store has returned on account of Cholera.  He must be a great coward.  He asked Willie if you had returned, said he saw you almost every day in Charleston.  He came so near death last summer with Typhoid fever, I suppose it alarmed him, & he now wishes to be very careful.  Cholera not being infectious, is not advancing as other diseases, for if a person lives prudently, there is scarce any danger of taking it.

	Mrs. Henry Earle said her son William  told her if she would ask, when you were going to return, he would drive her.  I told her you were enjoying yourself so much you had no wish to return yet, & I might have added unless her son, was a very fine young man, he need�no thought on you now or ever, for it is  much better for a lady to remain single, than to marry, unless the gentleman has every quality to make her happy, & a happy single lady is far more to be envied than an unhappy married one.  Eliza & Susan are as happy as anyone can be.   They are useful members of society. & afford pleasure to so many friends, & have so much resource, that I dare say they do not know an unhappy moment.  How much better is their situation than Mrs. Hume Simmons, your Aunt Suzy�s & many others.

	Mrs. Westfield�s mother Mrs. Stokes is dead, & was buried Tuesday afternoon.  Col. Dunham�s health is very bad, & he is not expected to live long.             
      
      I will give your love to the Mauldins.  They do not go to school yet.
      
	Your Papa has given me 40 dollars, 15 of it you must keep to pay your expenses home, which will leave 25 dollars for you to spend.  When Eliza sends another list, I will know whether this will be enough or not.  I do not think I will write for anything more.  Our Groceries set off at a time the Rail Road was out of order & brought no freight, so they were sent to Hamburg to come up in wagons which has caused their delay, the roads being so bad wagons for the present are not travelling.  The box set off about that time, & I suppose was sent also to Hamburg.  Now the R[ail] Road is in order except the bridge & freight comes more quicky, so I am sorry over Groceries & the box did not wait until now.  The freight also from Hamburg is so high, the groceries will cost a great deal.  In future we will always get in the Spring.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza & beg her to write & to Eliza & Susan & beg Eliza to write.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

Dear Anna


	I received a letter from you this morning, & was very glad to hear, you are still enjoying yourself as much as ever.  The excursion to the island will be delightful, & I hope you will have as pleasant weather, as we now have.  Today is delightful, just like Spring.  You will find it quite a novelty to be on the water.  I am glad you passed a pleasant evening at Mrs. Cunninghams.  Before you leave, you must go & see her, & give my love to her. & ask when Pamela & Mrs. Cunningham are going to return from the North.  I believe they are still there, & tell Emma you have the cup & saucer she sent you.  It is now in the Drawing room.

	I sent you yesterday 40 dollars.  I directed the letter to Eliza, but the letter was written to you.  I hope you will receive the money safe.  You ought to get it tomorrow evening, after you return from the island.  As soon as you receive it, write & tell me, as I will be uneasy until I hear.

	If your Papa has the key to the Carpet bag, I will send it by Butler Thompson.  He goes Monday I believe.  Eliza mentioned your having bought a key for the bag, so If your Papa has not the key, I hope the one you have bought will answer.

	If you would buy some of the things I have written for, & send by John Jones & Butler Thompson, I will be very glad, for I need them, the Gaiter boots, Fanny�s cloak, the 12 ? cts Calico for my dress, the Mits, the lacets for Gaiters, & as much as they can bring.  My cloak & Fanny�s cloak at any rate I hope they can bring.  Having sent for so many things, I have not bought anything here, & am in want particularly of the Calico for the dress, but if inconvenient to get & send before you come, I can wait.  Your trunk will be so full that I expect you will be glad to send beforehand as many things as possible.  Mr. Elford was to have got 13 stair case rods, but he did not.  If they could be put in your trunk. I would write for them & send the measure, but I expect you would not have room. 

	I would like you soon to get the work box for Aunt Eliza.  Get Eliza to choose it for you, & also one for yourself, but they must be useful ones, such as will really be of use to hold thread, needles & everything used in work.  Make it a present to Aunt Eliza in your name, & tell her to always keep it to remember you by.  I think it a better present than a writing desk, but you can consult Eliza.

	I hope before this you have received the box with the Cloak, & the letter with the chain & pencil.  I am sorry I sent the petticoat & bonnet, your visit being lengthened, I thought you would need them, & sent then before you wrote word I must not.

	Willie & Frank went to Mrs. McBee�s yesterday afternoon & staid until late at night.  There were a great many children there.  The boys played in the yard, & the girls in a room.  Fanny has gone to school.  Hext is quite well.  I send you a peice of poetry on the death of Mr. Elford�s children.  I do not know who wrote it.  Show it to Aunt Eliza.  Your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy have just been here.  Your Aunt Suzy begs me to ask your cousin Eliza not to forget to buy her a bag she wrote for suitable to use at church & two alpacca  Aprons, such as your cousin Susan mentioned were worn.  They all send their love. & say they would write to you, but they have nothing to write about.

	I hope you will see Aunt Harriet before you leave, but I am afraid you will not, & perhaps not see Aunt Anna or Aunt Martha either.  I am glad you have seen Aunt Susan, & that Paul & his wife you may see, as they have returned.  This season of the year almost all who can go in the country, & many pass the whole winter there.    I am glad Eloisa has returned, & that you will become acquainted with her family.  Sarah also I hope you will see.

	Your cousins Cloaks I expect are very pretty, & more useful than the light one Aunt Mary got me.  The black cape I dare say is comfortable.  That will be its recommendation, & after this winter I will wear it in common, & as I will not next winter have to get either bonnet or dress, I can afford to get a handsome cloak.

	Mr. Smith the Jeweller sent me yesterday as a present a white velvet Emory.  I will give it to you, for your work box.  I mean to put in it & sharpen your needles.  Your Grandmama says, Lindy is not able to get through her work, so she is going to hire Maria who she had once before from Mrs. Pearson.  Lindy�s baby she thinks has the Measles.  I was very sorry to let Lindy go there, feeling certain the baby would take the Measles, & knowing Lindy would not suit, but situated as your Grandmama was, I felt compelled to oblige her, & run the risk of Measles, & now after all , Lindy as I supposed does not suit.  She will have to remain there until the child gets well, for if she returns Hext & Eliza�s baby will take it, & Dr. Crooks said I must not let Hext go near them.  Little Clarissa was just beginning to grow well & improve, & has been so delicate, the Measles will go hard with it.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & beg her to write to me, & tell me all about you, & give my love to Eliza & Susan, & beg them to write, & my love to Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna.  It must have been a release to Miss Elizabeth Lee to leave this world.  Mr. Mauldin is still in Columbia.

	Your Papa is a great deal better & would write to you, but as I write every day, there seems no necessity for him to.  I generally have some business to write about.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

Dear Anna


	I have been busy all day & not able to write, but as no Mail leaves on Saturday, the Cars not running Sunday, it is no consequence my not having written today.  This letter will go tomorrow.  I send a letter every day except Saturday when no Mail goes.  This is the day you were to go to the island.  I hope you have had as pleasant weather as we have here.  It is like Spring but so warm, I am afraid it will rain soon.  You must give me an account of your experience.  I know you will enjoy it.

	I hope this evening you will have received my letter containing 40 dollars, 15 dollars of it is to pay your expenses home.  I will see from the next list Eliza sends me whether the remainder is enough to buy the things I have written for.

	There is no danger of the children seeing the toys before you return.  The roads are so bad, the box will not come for a long time.  It set off before the R[ail] Road was repaired, so had to come by way of Hamburg.  If it had set off now it would have come on the R[ail] Road to Laurens, & we would have got it sooner.  If I had known there would be such a delay, I would not have sent for so many things for myself & the children, & instead sent you the money to spend.  They will come so late, we could have done without some of the things this winter.  However I will have less to buy next winter.  I received a letter from you today.  I am always glad to hear from you.  You seem to be enjoying yourself as much as ever.  I would like to see Professor Anderson.  I wish you would get him to come here.

	You must thank Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna in my name for the books they have given you.  The Listener I think I read long ago.  I will be glad to read it again; the other book I will also like to read.

	I received today a letter from Aunt Mary McCall.  She says she has got me the black cape & had to pay 2 dollars, because the man said it was a disadvantage to change the cloaks.  The light cloak was 21 dollars.  The 2 dollars added to change it, makes the Cape 23 dollars.  Your cousin Eliza�s, you say was about 15 dollars, 8 dollars less than my Cape, so you can tell me which you think the best bargain, but I am glad to get something useful on any terms.  Aunt Mary said, the day she wrote, she intended carrying the Cape to Aunt Eliza�s.  I hope you will send it to me by the first opportunity, & Fanny�s Cloak also, by Mr. Jones or Butler Thompson, the first that returns.  I walked to your Grandmama�s this afternoon.  Willie went with me, & Reuben came for me in the carri[a]ge.  Your Aunt Annie begged me to say to your cousin Eliza that she wished all the Music she had sent, & in addition begged her to get �Nelly was a Lady,� set in a peice arranged in the prettiest way, so she writes all the Music charged to her 1 dollars worth she prefers taking it all.  It is well, for perhaps Mr. Bacon would prefer giving you peices of his own selection, but if you see any peices you would like to get, to learn after you return you can get them.

	All at your Grandmama�s were as well as usual, except Suzy.  She has had the Measles.  Alex & Vardry were there.  Clara is working for Susan & Ann.   � inquired particularly after you, & sends her treble love; all send their love.  I told � you had sent her a handkerchief.  I told Flora Hoke this morning that one was coming in the box for her.  You must get a handkerchief for each of Aunt Eliza�s women, like those you have sent, & you had better soon get the work box & give to Aunt Eliza.  Mr. John Hodges is dead.  He died of typhoid fever.  Your Papa saw him in Columbia & says he looked as well & healthy as possible.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is very sick.  I believe her lungs are affected.  I have not heard that it is so, but I know they were once, so suppose it is the case now.  I have not visited her for a long time, but as she is so sick I have some thoughts of riding tomorrow to see her, calling for your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy to go in the afternoon.  I hope Alston will name his son Robert after his father & the next one after himself.

	Lindy came home today.  The child has a cold, but I hope not the Measles.  I will let her go very often & help your Grandmama.  She can make ginger cake for her, & bread, & help in other ways.  Maria I hope will do well.  She has no child, which is an advantage.  I wish your Grandmama to have a good servant.  I did not think Lindy would do, for she is willing but not capable & efficient, & has rheumatism, so sometimes she can hardly walk, & has also to attend to her child.

	Mr. Randolph has moved into Col. Town[e]s house next door, & Col. Goodlett lives in Mr. Brooks house, where Mr. Randolph has moved from.  He is to keep a boarding house.  Col. Goodlett says Mr. Randolph left the house in such a condition, it required a hoe to scrape
the dirt from the floor.  It is well Aunt Eliza did not board with him last summer.  If she had, she would have been disgusted with Greenville.  It was fortunate she found rooms at Mrs. �.  Cornelia Ioor has sent me some Pecan nuts, by your Papa.  They are coming in a box from Columbia, but I do not know when they will reach here.  

	I am glad the ginger has proved useful.  I sent for a Jar for your Grandmama, & one for your Aunt 
.0Suzy, & one for myself.  These are my Christmas presents.  It is cheaper to buy ginger preserves, than to make preserves.  Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, & thank them for their kindness to you.  My love to Aunt Mary & Anna & all my friends.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

Dear Anna


	I received letters from your cousin Eliza & yourself yesterday.  Thank Eliza for hers, & as she says she will soon write again, beg her to, & I will write to her.  You have really passed your time pleasantly.  Your friends have been very kind to you.  I feel indebted to all of them, but more especially to your Aunt Eliza & her family.  Thanks Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna for the presents you say they have sent to the children, & thank Aunt Mary McCall for her presents.  She has been very kind.  I will send her the 2 dollars, she had to pay for changing the Cloak.  Your Aunt Suzy wishes to know the price of the black cape.  I do not know, as it cost me on account changing 23 dollars, so at Mr. Reed�s, inquire the price that I may tell Susan.  You say I had better send a list of the articles I wish purchased, so I will.  I have almost forgotten what I have written for, you can add what I have overlooked.  The work box for your Aunt & yourself you must first get, then what I have put on the list, & after that the Candy, cocoa nut cake & little presents you intended getting.  The 40 dollars I hope you have received, the 15 taken out for your expenses back leaves 25 dollars.  Eliza wrote word yesterday I must send 25, so I am glad you have exactly that sum.  It may not be enough, as I have written for knives, so if it is not let me know.  Tooth powder I cannot get here.  Be sure & bring 3 boxes of powdered Charcoal.  I used to get it 20 cts a box; not paste, but merely powdered Charcoal.  One of the boxes is for you.  If you have not got it yet, get it immediately & use, the two others bring home.  Sally Hoke came here this morning, & her teeth looked so black, it reminded me of telling you to attend to yours.  I suppose you have not needed any Sarsaparilla.  The Lacets for Gaiters though trifling is important,  for every morning now I am delayed trying to lace with a pin, & then have to give up, & wrap the lacet round the boot, the tins come off, & the tinners here put on such large ones, they will not go trough the holes.  I send a button for you to get one dozen like 18 ? cts.  Ask Aunt Mary McCall where she got it.  She did not send enough.  The Calico you sent in the box for your Aunt Annie, If it comes soon, I may take, if you are willing to make myself a dress to wear at home.  I need it very much, & your Aunt Annie has just had a worsted Gown made to wear at home. & bought a Calico one, & Clara is to make it for her.  I have made none to wear at home yet.  The two I have got, are what I sent patterns to you of.  The blue one is made & I wear to church, but if you prefer my not taking the Calico, you must say so.  I have written to Eliza to get me Calico for a dress, but it will be long before I get it, through I am very much afraid the box also will not be here soon.  

	After you have purchased my list, & sent me an account, if you remain long enough, I may write for a few more things, two nice pocket handkerchiefs, about 37 ?  apeice or the peice Susan, but cost 43 ?, & your Papa wishes Linen for shirts which I may write for.  Send up as many things as you can by private opportunities, Mr. Jones & Thompson.  I hope before this my cloak has arrived safely & that I will soon get the other one.  When the ginger gives out, if you would like it, you can get your Aunt another Jar.

	I am glad you have fine weather now.  At least I suppose you have, as we have now delightful weather like Spring.  Yesterday was cloudy & drizzly, so we did not go to church.  In the morning your Grandmama sent to ask how Mrs. Sam town[e]s was & she is very ill, & not able to see anyone.  Her lungs are affected, & she can scarcely speak.  The roads to her house are almost impassable. So we did not go to see her, but if she gets better we will go.  

	Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.  Tell her you write about others, & wish to hear from her about you.

	I hope the Cholera will not increase.  If it becomes alarming, I suppose Mary Crayton will immediately return, & you would come with her.  Let me know when you think she will return, if she will soon or not, if she will return this month.

	Willie & Frank commenced school today, both at the Academy.  Mr. Hillhouse teaches Frank, Mr. Thomas Willie.  Willie has come back already, & says Mr. Thomas, as yet has only two scholars, George Wells & himself.  He is to buy more books today, & go back again this afternoon.

	I will go to see Mrs. Mauldin, & ask when her daughters are going.  

	You say you saw pretty key baskets.  If you choose you can get one as a present to your Aunt Suzy or Annie or for yourself, or for me.  It will not come amiss.  If they are reasonable, but if you prefer it, get something else.  The�of baskets Mr. Elford has got me.  I may spare some of them to your Grandmama as presents.  I think he said he had got a nest, but I may be mistaken, for I thought he had got knives & rods which he has not.

	You must excuse my shabby looking letter.  I am busy & often write so hurriedly I am almost ashamed to send my letters.  You must take Aunt Eliza & Eliza as your examples for neat writing, not me.  My gold pen is bent, & writes badly, which is my excuse.  

	I will send the carpet bag key by Butler Thompson.  Mrs. Robinson sent word she was going Wednesday.  I suppose he will go with her.  I will write a few lines by him.  I will soon write to Eliza.  If you would like it, you can buy a pretty work basket apiece for your cousins Eliza & Susan, & not get any to bring home.  The nest of baskets will do for us.

	Give my kindest love to your Aunt & cousins & thank them for being so kind to you., & giving you so much pleasure, enough to think of & talk of a long time.  My love to my other friends.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

Buy some large sheets of letter paper & write longer letters.  Burn up my letter.

Dear Anna


	I have just received two letters from you, & must answer them immediately, for the Mail now closes at 12 oclock, & the letters must be just in sooner than heretofore.  I hear very regularly from you, every day except Monday when no Mail comes, & you ought to hear every day from me except Monday, so Monday you get no letter from me.

	Your friends have all been as kind as possible to you,  You must thank Aunt Brewton for the present you say she has sent Willie, & tell her I hope her Godson will do credit to her.  If he is as good
as he is smart, there will be no fear but what he will.  I do not say so from vanity, but from the opinion all his Teachers have expressed, & not to me, but to others have they expressed it, so I know it is their real opinion.  Your Papa also has a high opinion of Willie�s mind, & he has a good judgement, & no vanity, either for himself or his children.

	Thank your cousin Eloisa for the cup & saucer.  It is in a box of paper &c. your Papa had packed in Columbia but it has not come yet.  The roads are in so dreadful a condition no waggons are transporting goods, either from the Laurens R[ail] Road, or the box would have come on from Hamburg, where our groceries are at present & the box with them that Aunt Eliza had packed.   Today your Papa received a letter from Jeffers & Cothran the factors who are to forward the boxes, & they say since Christmas no waggons have come, that the streets present every day the appearance of the Sabbath, & from the accounts they hear of the roads, it will continue so a long time, but by the first opportunity they will send on the boxes.  If I had imagined this delay, I would have done without several things I wrote for, & sent you the money instead, or bought things for summer use.  F� & my bonnets, we will have to put up for next winter.  You will be here at the opening of the box I have no doubt, & witness the joy of the children.

	A person in Mobile is writing sketches of distinguished men, & mentions Uncle Robert.  In a Columbia paper there is an extract in which Aunt Brewton is mentioned.  It will be published in the Patriot.  I will cut it out & send to you, & you can give it to Aunt Brewton.  Perhaps she has seen it, [but] if not, it will gratify her, to see honorable mention made of one whose memory she reveres as she does Uncle Roberts.

	It was kind in Eloisa to say, she would like to have you stay with her.  I appreciate her kind intention.  You must go often to see her, & Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha & Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna Hayne, & any friend Aunt Eliza tells you to go & see.

	I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick, & Paul�s wife in delicate health.  Give my love to Aunt Emily when you next see her, & Aunt Susan, Aunt Brewton, Aunt Elizabeth & Uncle Arthur, Aunts in Logan st. & Meeting st.  

	Your Papa is now quite well.  All at your Grandmama�s are the same as usual.  Clara works every day for them.  I help them in that way, as much as I can, & work for myself.  Margaret at present can spare her.  Eliza has not worked for me since the birth of her baby, but will again next week.  Lindy is at home, at present with her child to attend to.  No one will hire her, but next summer we will get her a place.

	The new kitchen is building, & when it is done, our servants will be comfortably accommodated, & we will have a nice kitchen for our own use.  No one but the cook to stay in & an ironing room, for no purpose but ironing.  The two new chambers, Eliza & Lindy will have.  If Minerva wishes it, she can come over & sleep in the room Eliza now has.  Charles will either sleep in the cellar or the old kitchen, & the small house, you shall again have to keep as a play house.  Mr. Rosemond will repair it.  I will give Fanny the press in the little dining room as a baby house & put in the play house, all the toys you have bought her, shall stay there.  If you had kept all the presents ever given you, how many you would have had.  Begin now & keep them all carefully.  When you have bought the list I have sent you, I hope to send some more money.  Have you spent the 5 dollars you took out of your Bank.  Send as many things by Mr. Jones or Thompson as they can bring.

	I expect you spent a delightful day at the island.  Your Aunt & cousins have been so kind in trying to gratify you in every way.  You must tell them I thank them for their kindness to you.  Tell them not to give themselves any trouble on your account.  The visiting among your friends, & seeing them, is an enjoyment to you & Greenville is so quiet.  A walk up King st.  is such a contrast to a walk here that it affords you delight.  The shells we will be glad of, & something new in Greenville.  You must keep them as a curiosity.  I am sorry you have not seen your cousin Sarah Taylor yet.  If you do, tell her the Scripture Biography she gave Willie, I find very useful in reading to the children & servants on Sunday, & tell Eloisa the basket she gave me in town, I use even now as a key basket.

	I saw in the Courier that your Papa had been alluded to by Mr. John Preston.  In Columbia last winter Professor Thornwell�s brother pointed to your Papa & said �See that person, two years ago, he was avoided by Politicians as death, & now he has more influence in the Legislature, than any other Member, & more coveted by aspirants.�  Your Papa has always acted independently, & in acting as he thought right, has gone against his own interests, which proves his sincerity.  Such conduct always in the end begets esteem, & he has in his opinion the best reward, a good conscience & his own self respect.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  Their kindness I will never forget.  Ask Aunt Eliza to write to me.  I will write to Eliza tomorrow.  Go & see Mary Crayton, & let me know when she expects to return.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry

[Greenville]

Dear Anna


	I wrote you a long letter this morning.  I now write only a few lines.  I will send them by Butler Thompson & send the key you asked for.  I will send this letter to Mrs. Robinson & she will give it to Butler Thompson, who I suppose is going with her.  His father a week or two ago said he was.  

	The weather is now clouding over & we will soon have rain again.  

	Write word when Mary Crayton intends returning so I may know when to expect you.  I suppose this month she will return.  Your cousin Eliza said about the 20th of this month.  

       Fanny goes to school, but she prefers staying at home.  She will like it better when you go with her.  I sent to ask Mrs. Mauldin when her daughters were going to school & she sent word, they were not going at all.

	I sent Aunt Mary today the 2 dollars she paid for changing the Cloak.  

	I hope you have received the 40 dollars I sent you safely.

	I write so hurriedly, you must tear up my letters, tear up this one.  I write so much & have other things to do, I write in haste.  Be a good girl.  I hope Mr. Jones or Thompson will bring the Cloak.  Mr. & Mrs. Bacon came to see me this morning & inquired about you.  I told then what Mrs. O�Driscoll said, & that you practiced every day.  Mr. Bacon says he has only 3 scholars now that for a short time in summer he had 23, but he ought to have 30 scholars the whole year round to afford him a support, that if he did not get more scholars he could not live here, but this climate agreed with his health, so he hoped he could get enough to enable him to stay.  I hope he will find you improved.  He says he has no objection to your buying any pretty peices for yourself. 

	Your Grandmama & Aunts send their affectionate love.  Your Grandmama says you write wonderfully well.  She is pleased at Aunt Brewton remembering Willie.  Give my love to your Aunts & cousins, whose kindness to you has been very great, & I know you feel grateful, & will never forget it, & when in your power return it.

	Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is better & Mr. Hodges through very low, is not dead.  The report was not a mistake.

	You must soon buy the work box for Aunt Eliza as a testimony of your love for her, & a proof you feel gratified for her kindness.  Your affectionate mother, E.F. Perry
P.S.  Get a Cornelian ring for yourself & one for Fanny.  Her silver comb I will give to Annie, which is more valuable than a ring.  Buy 2 dolls for Fanny & Annie.  You can dress them when you return & a small doll to L�a knife with 2 blades for Willie & Frank, not expensive ones.

[The remainder of this text is a letter of January 1853.  These pages were mounted with the letter of 11 January.  The first sheet is not present.]

	�like to get for yourself you may.  The knives for Willie & Frank need not be fine ones, as they will soon lose them.  Put on paper a list of what I have mentioned in this letter.  Your Aunt Annie wishes �Nelly was a Lady[.�]  The 75 cts for Music that was charged to you, your Grandmama wishes to add to her bit, so that 75 cts you will have to add to your money to buy something with.  I you need a thick pr of shoes for school, you had best get them now.  I hope to be able to get some more pocket handkerchiefs, as need more.  If I write for them, I will wish some at 16 cts, for you, & marked with your name  & some for 25 cts marked with mine.

	Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & sent word she would be glad to see me.  At the time Mr. Town[e]s was abusing your papa in his paper, I would not take pleasure in visiting his family, so gave her up, but your Papa has forgiven him, & Mr. Town[e]s looks to him to do more for him than anyone. A great change has taken place & the very persons who during political excitement abuse your Papa the most, are now writing to him. to use his influence with Genl Pierce to give them Offices.  They say your Papa writes for them, would have an effect, more than anyone else.  He does for them, & those who have injured him, what he would not do for himself.

	I will go to see Mrs. Town[e]s when the roads are good.  Now they are at most impassable.  I dare say it will not be before you return.  You can go with me.

	I will call Julia Sharpe to keep the seat at her desk for you.  I am certain she will.  Except Miss Hopkins there is no other school for girls.  

	I hope Clara will be a valuable servant for you by & by; then her wages can even support you.  Margaret says she can do everything except make Pastry, & that that she would soon learn.  Our servants are so expensive now, the supporting them &c, that if it were not for the hope of future profit, we would be obliged to sell them.  Eliza�s baby is a month old Monday.  Then Sarah will go back to Margaret, who I hope will take her, through she sent word she did not care for her.  She is useless here, & get[t]ing into bad habits.  Eliza�s influence & example to her children is so bad, I would be thankful if we could get rid of her.  Johnny at present seems a good boy.

	Give my love to all my Aunts.  If Aunt Harriet is at Mr. W�, ask Aunt Eliza to write to her, & beg her to come down for one day & see you.  It is only a short ride, & I am certain if she knew you were in town, she would come & see you.  I will send you stamps in this letter.  When they give out, it would be well to buy some.

	Aunt Anna�s friend was a pious lady, & so afflicted, that her death must have been a blessing, as they have every reason I hope to think she is happy now.

	Mr. Elford has money of your Papa�s. but has had no settlement since he returned. So I do not know wat he bought for me.   

	Mr. Wm Watson I believe goes to town soon.  I had just written this sentence when your Papa came in & brought Mr. Elford�s bills.  He has bought the nest of baskets, the Calico for Comforts, the Fender, Andirons, shovel & tongs, broom & bellows, the nest of baskets is 3.87.  Mama I expect will take some of them, the Calico 6 ? a yd, the other things $18.19 cts.

	I have just heard Mr. Hodges is dead, that he was resigned, he had no children, & his Wife & himself not very happy.  Mr. Henry Thompson & your Papa got elected to Commissioner of�& he came this morning to ask if he would appoint his son Henry as keeper of the gate, which Mr. Hodges used to keep; that Henry will stay at Mrs. Hodges, keep the gate, & keep school at the same time, & attend to his studies.  He will make several hundred dollars a year, & is only 17.  You see when persons are poor & thrown on their own resource, how they manage to support themselves, & at the same time improve their Character & acquire habits of industry, they make their own fortunes, whereas, if their parents had a few hundreds to give them, they think themselves above work. & become idle & dissipated & ruined characters.  I am glad there is at last something cheering for Mrs. Thompson.  She has sent repeatedly to ask if there was bundle here for her, but I have heard of none that was coming for her, unless some of her friends intend sending one by you.  If Charlotte Smith hears of your being in town, I dare say she will send a bundle.

Sunday, Dear Anna

I have just received a letter from you & will answer it tomorrow.  Thank Aunt Brewton in my name for yours & Willie�s presents.  It was very kind, & they will be very useful.

You have so much to bring for yourself, I dare say you will not have room for Mrs. Herriot�s boxes.  If so, you must return them, & tell her you are sorry you cannot bring them.  After awhile, persons will be going down from here who can bring them for her.  Your affectionate, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have just received a long letter from you & must answer it immediately as the Stage goes now at 12 oclock.  There is one thing that I wish to get & that is a pattern for the side of an Ottoman.  Get it the length of the paper I send, & of the shape.  I have cut the paper, & one bunch of worsted like each colour in the pattern.  I have had broadcloth for you to work ottomans for your Grandmama, & this winter I would like to continue them at least.  I will teach you how to do the worsted work, & you must work a pincushion  for each friend who has shown you kindness, since you have been in town, tell them so.  I have plenty of Broadcloth & Canvass & some Worsted.  Also, buy one dozen worsted needles of different sizes, some of them very small, & you can commence when you return, & work them at your leisure.  You have made a pleasant visit.  I know you will need more money.  If I do not send what you need in time, if your Aunt advances it, I will immediately return it, as soon as I hear from you how much it is, but I much prefer your asking me for it, than getting it from anyone else.  So write & let me know what you need.  I am sorry Wm Ed had a pencil case.  Perhaps Eliza might think of something else for him, & be sure & buy the work box for Aunt Eliza, & a basket or something else for Eliza & Sue, & a handkerchief for each of the servants.

	I am glad you make yourself useful to your Aunt, & helped her fix the curtains.  I wish you would see Sarah Taylor, but if you leave before she comes, perhaps in Columbia you may have time to see her.  I am glad Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha you have seen again.  Tell them to write to me by you.  Bring as many letters as you can from our friends.  Let them know when you will leave, & beg them to write.  I suppose you have not seen K��s relations, Mary, Sarah & Edward though they are not I believe estimable characters,  Still if you could see them & tell K� you have, it would gratify her.

	I am glad Mr. Jones will return soon, & that he will bring some of the things.  I sent a letter enclosing the key yesterday to Mrs. Robinson & she had gone.  It is no consequence, for since I have heard Butler Thompson was only going as far as Columbia with them, so I will send the key in this letter.

	We all will be very glad to see you.  Mr. McKay & the oldest Miss Hayden teach the large girls; the youngest Miss Hayden teaches the small girls.  Fanny says they are not cross.  Mr. Thomas teaches Willie a great many more studies than Mr. Leary did.  He wishes Frank to learn Latin, but we prefer not.  He is too young.  You must take good care of the children at school.  Only two of the Brooks go to school.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & Mr. Hodges also.  Soon I must go & see Mrs. Mauldin & some others.  A Chinese ornament for 25 cts, or a little basket, or any little present, you can bring Mary Mauldin.

	Aunt Mary McCall today I heard from saying she had received the Check.  I hope she will receive safely 2 dollars I have since sent her.  

	Some pretty Calico get me for aprons for Fanny.  I would send you a 5 dollar bill at least in this letter, if it had not the key & paper in it, for I know you would be glad of it.  If I write tomorrow I will send it.  I hear from you regularly each day except Monday, when no Mail comes.  I am surprised you do not receive one letter each day from me, instead of so many at one time.  Your Papa says I write too often.  I suppose that you have heard that Genl Pierce�s only child has been killed on the R[ail] Road, how sad.

	I am glad you have some shells, & found it pleasant on the island.  It looks a good deal like rain again.  The roads will be worse than ever.

	Tell your Aunts you will work them a pincushion. & also Eliza & Susan.  I will help you.  I did wish you to buy some books, some of Miss Milfords & Mrs. Howitts works, but will have to put off for another time.  At the end of the year there are so many bills to pay, or I would have sent more money.  Another visit I will supply you better & not tell you to buy so many things for me.  

	I wrote to Eliza yesterday.  I do not know what our Eliza will name her baby.  Aunt Eliza has no name to�of her.  She is one of the worst servants I know of.  She has no principle, & I am afraid with such a Mother, her children will not have any.  They are corrupted from their infancy, & if it were not for Missy, who has been a faithful servant to Mamma, I would not feel it my duty to keep such a servant.

	Do not forget Becky�s comb.  She is not near as good a cook as Minerva, but she is a better servant, & makes all happier.  Minerva wishes to leave the Mansion House, says she is worked too hard, but she is always dissatisfied.
	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins, & my other Aunts.  I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick.  Let me know when to expect you.  Emily Earle & her sister go to the Academy.  It is the only female school now.

	Your Papa is quite well now.  It is no consequence when you see Augustus Hoke, & Mr. Smith must be wanting in steadiness to leave his business for such a trifling reason.  Hext is well; the other children at school.  Clara as soon as the new kitchen is finished is going to have a party or Fair.  I do not like to have such things in the yard, but disliked refusing, & if it is in the kitchen & not in the cellar, it will not distract us.  

	I hope to hear tomorrow, as soon as you have taken a list of the things you are to buy, that I have written in this letter, burn it. do not show it to anyone.  It is written so badly.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Anna Perry

{Circa late December, 1 January 1853]
[Greenville]

Dear Anna
	  
	  
	I send you my chain to wear with your Medallion,  I do not like little girls to dress too fine, but I think when you spend an evening out, the chain put round your neck twice, & the Medallion suspended to it, will look more suitable than the seven pence chain you bought in Columbia.  I do not think for such occasions it will look too fine.  The Chain your Papa gave to me before we were married, so I never expect to part with it.  Some time you can have a Daguerreotype likeness of your Papa & myself & a lock of our hair put in your Medallion.

	I send a gold pencil case which if your cousin William Edward has none, you may give to him, as a present from yourself, as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mother�s roof.  I bought it for myself, but it was too large for a lady, & I have never made use of it.  If he has a gold pencil case, this would be of no use to him, & I will think of something else for you to get, but if he has none, this he will find useful.

	The work box or writing desk for Aunt Eliza, & some present of value for your cousin[s] Eliza & Susan I will write you about before long, as soon as I hear from you about the one you are to get.  I hope to send this letter by Butler Thompson, but if I hear of any other safe opportunity sooner, I will not wait for him.
 
	If you get homesick, or anything occurs to make it inconvenient for you to be at your Aunts, write me word. & by that time I dare say your Papa will be well, & able to go down for you.  But your friends are so kind & you seem to be passing your time so pleasantly, I suppose you are not afraid of being homesick.  I hope this visit to town will improve your manners, & your character in every respect, & you will learn more than at school, even if you commenced the first day, as I had expected.  

	I have written a long letter to you today, so will now stop.  Your affectionate Mother, [E.F.P.]

Jany 1st.  I wish you many happy returns of this day and that each New Year may find you more improved in everything, that will increase your happiness here, & make you happy hereafter.

	We arrived here a short time ago & have a comfortable room at Mrs. Davis� up in the 4th story.  Mr. Arthur, Mr. Cox & Mr. Lec� took good care of us, & Mr. Pinckney who got in the Cars from Aiken at Branchville was also very kind.  Mr. Arthur hired a carri[a]ge & brought us to this house.  He is at the Charleston Hotel.  Our dinner was sent us upstairs.  I am undressed, & am very tired.  My hand is unsteady, from the motion of the Cars, & I only write to prevent your being uneasy.  I have borrowed pen ink & this half sheet of paper from Mrs. Davis.  An irish woman waits on us.  I will be glad to see you any time [page torn] come, but I do not think it worth [while] [page torn] to come down twice, unless you can remain several days each time.  I would rather you come for me & stay some time here.  Mr. Arthur says he & Mr. Cox can vote for the delegates who are absent (from Greenville) that is he�is entitled to vote for the other, so if you come here you will vote as a delegate, but if you are away. the others will vote for you, so it makes no difference of course.  I have seen none of my friends yet.  Tomorrow morning I will go & see them�.to me every day, & I will write Wednesday, if I have time, but if you do not hear, you must not be uneasy.  I missed you today.  No one can make up to me for you, but the gentlemen�very hard.  Mr. Pinckney said he would come & see me.  I paid 1 dollar for the hire of the carri[a]ge, & 50 cts to Mr. Arthur for ice creams.  He did not wish to take it, so I told him to give it to the children.  A boy has come for the�&c.  I must stop.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
