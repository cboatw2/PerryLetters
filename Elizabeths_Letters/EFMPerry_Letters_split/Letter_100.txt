Letter 100

Monday morning, 3 July 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter last night, in which you say, you may not be at home till Wednesday.  On the strength of that, I will write you a few lines to comfort you , & make you happy, as I know you cannot be, unless you are informed every day or two, of the health of your family.  We are accustomed to hear frequently from each other, that we are more uneasy from a short silence than others are from months.  You do not mention having received a letter from me Saturday, which you must have got, but in your haste forgot mentioning.  This letter you may not receive, as you may leave Laurens before it reaches there, this being the case & not knowing in whose hands it may fall, I must be particular & not write with as much freedom as I generally do.  I only write because it may be to your interest to stay in Laurens some time longer, & if you hear that all at home are well, you will be induced to stay when otherwise you will hurry home to see how matters are going on.  I was very glad to hear from you last night.  I would have been uneasy if I had not heard, for I had been looking anxiously for you.  I am sorry business should detain you, & I hope you will come home, with a fee in your pocket.  I am certain some one of your Clients can pay you, so I hope you will induce some of them to.  I am sorry it did not suit you to accept the invitations you received.  I suppose business prevented you, or you would have done so.  I have heard less about your Election than usual.  Mrs. Butler has paid me no visit lately.  I suppose she is waiting to have her budget full, before she comes.  Mamma asked Mr. Sharpe, what your prospects & he said, in Pendleton, they thought you would be elected by a majority of 1200.  Friday afternoon I went to see Mrs. Stone & Mrs. Sam Townes.  Mrs. Townes said she had recently been to Pendleton & heard very encouraging accounts, & all along the road they inquired, & they saw but one man who said Mr. Orr would be elected, & he was a barefooted ignorant person, & would give no reason for his�.  I do not like to tell you this news, for fear it may lessen your exertions which have never been great.  I would rather tell what your�friends, such as Mr. Jones, Mr. Norton & Genl Thompson say.  I am glad for your sake that you have been making friends, & yet at the same time I am vexed that your Election should be doubted, for it seems injustice to you, for a moment to think you can be beaten, by one your inferior in every respect.  I think this remark is rather free, considering my letter may be opened by those for whom it was not intended, but it is the truth, & even your enemies will allow it.  This is Sale day, but it seems very quiet, & I see no one coming in.  I am glad you are in Laurens, where there is more to be done than in Greenville.  Tomorrow is the 4th of July. But I have heard of no preparations to celebrate it.  The Sunday school children are not going to march as usual, & have a Picnic, for which I am very glad.  It was all trouble for nothing.  Only one letter has come for you, from Walker & Bradford, wishing to know what had become of their case.  I paid a very short visit to Mrs. Sam Townes.  Jim thought it was going to rain, & hurried me off, but it did not rain after all.  When you come back, you must drive me out, unless I can have the carri[a]ge & take Mamma with me.  She seems very anxious to see Mamma.  Said her sister Mrs. Burt asked her, if she had seen Mamma.  Frances�her bag fully of medicines.  I see they are medicines such as she can easily�so I have made no exertion to send them after her.  The visit passed off very pleasantly, but it was just long enough, for after she left Minerva was taken sick, in a short time her child was born of which I have written you, a girl it is.  Eliza was last week at Mamma�s.  She has now come home to assist in working, but she seems very unwell.  She begged to go to Dr. Earle.  I let her go, & he has written me a note, saying her womb is affected & unless she is examined he can do nothing.  He sent some medicine for the nettle thrash which she has.  Delia is better again.  She & Mary have gone to the Spring to wash.  John drove us to church yesterday morning, & Jim in the afternoon.  Susan is still at the Parsonage, but I expect she will be obliged to go to the house Mr. Dupree lived in.  It is a very mean one & I am afraid she will never have a better.  I tell her she is the rich man�s wife without a comfort, & I am the poor man�s wife, with every comfort.  Caroline Earle is engaged to�.  I expect when Mamma saw her, she was considering.  Mamma sent her a message by her Mother, advising her to accept him, & Mrs. Earle seemed pleased, & said she would be sure & deliver it.  Mr. McBee heard that Caroline Earle was engaged to a gentleman richer than all.  I saw Col. Dunham seated in the�of his Tin Shop yesterday.  He looked pale.  Ann heard that � Dubose was to be married.  Clara was the authority.  She may have heard it from Margaret, who generally knows of the engagements.  Aunt Anna Turnbull sent Fanny a dress by Mrs. Tom Laurens.  I expect it was 6 ? a yd., but for her it was a valuable present.  I now take the Shower bath every day, & find it very pleasant.  The first day the water was so cold, it took away my breath, & I could not stand it.  I now use water brought the day before.  Willie loves to take it, but neither of the other children.  I wonder Mrs. Cunningham & Pamela have not written me.  Stop & see Mrs. Barksdale on your way back & Capt. Conner, & others.  I hope you will receive this letter safe.  It is a medley like Aunt Harriett.  I am going to write to her now.  Stay as long as you ought in Laurens.  I wish you to be elected by an overwhelming majority not by hundreds, but thousands.  When you return you must go to Pickens & Anderson, & if you wish it I will accompany you, though I had better stay at home, & attend to your interests in Greenville.  Your ever attached Wife, E.F.P.

Mr. Croft will soon be home with his Bride, his 3d bride.
