Letter 100

Monday morning, 10 May 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	You did not seem particularly anxious to hear from me when you left, but as you may be uneasy if Wednesdays Mail carries you no letter I will write if it is only a few lines.  Yesterday when I got up in the morning I had a little headache, & as both Dr. Earle & Dr. Crook had said Calomel would not hurt me, I last night took 6 grains, & this morning some Oil.  I hope it will do me good, & prevent my taking as many Pills as I would otherwise have to take, but you may imagine having taken this medicine, today I am not much inclined to write.  I only write for fear you might be uneasy.  I do not wish you to suffer what I sometimes do.  Friday morning Susan came as she promised.  In the afternoon Mrs. Butler paid me a visit.  That evening the news came of Genl Scotts Victory, & at night there was a Torch Light procession, Music & speeches.  Mr. Walker, Mr. Elford, Mr. Town[e]s, Mr. Spears, & Dr. Crook all spoke.  Not knowing all this was to take place, we had retired early, otherwise we would have gone near your office & heard the speeches, but I dare say we did not lose much.  Some appropriate transparencies were made very quickly, one with Santa Anna running off on a Mule without his wooden leg, some�the battle the day it was fought & so on, & some made for the night previous were used.  Mr. Elias Alexander said you hit the mark exactly in your prediction.  The servants at Mamma�s came in.  They said none of the speeches came up to yours, & that one person spoke as if he had mush in his mouth.
