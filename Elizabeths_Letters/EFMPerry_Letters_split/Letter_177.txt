Letter 177

Sunday night, [1850]
[Greenville]

My dear husband
            
		I will add some more to my letter tonight as I have some more to tell you.  I went to church morning & afternoon, carried Anna this morning, & Mamma this afternoon.  Mr. Arthur did not have service Fast Day, so this morning gave us a sermon suitable for the times.  It was a very good sermon.  He attributed our troubles to national sins, which sins are a love of wealth, pride & self conceit, Infidelity, the wrong manner in which the press is conducted, influenced by prejudice & passion, & said the fanatics at the North, & the exasperation at the South went too far, & we must join in praying the evils to be averted , which would come, if our Union were�& evil war come upon us.  Altogether it was a very good sermon & would give offence to no one.  Mr. Campbell & Miss Lewis are to be married Thursday night, the 12th inst.

		Mr. Croft paid me a visit this afternoon after church.  He goes in a week.  He will take some of your prospectuses & try & get subscribers.  Mr. Pickerell today sent for some to send to Anderson.  I sent him four.  I sent him Mr. Poinsetts peice to read.  He said I must send it wherever I thought it would do good.  I sent it to Mamma; she likes it very much.

		Mr. Luther McBee & Alexander returned yesterday.  Mr. Luther called here while I was at church this afternoon, & told Anna would Frank would come home tonight with Mr. �, but you had written that he was not coming, so I do not expect him.  You must tell Willie to eat at ? past 1 with Frank, as well as at 4, for it is too long to fast, from breakfast until 4, & it will make Willie sick & he will grow thin.  I went to see Susan before church this afternoon.  Her baby is�ailing.  She says Mr. Luther says, you are almost the only true man in the State.  He said it was ridiculous to listen to Mr. Memmingers boasts of what he would do rather than submit & recollect how tamely he bore Genl Thompsons lie.  Mr. Luther dines at Aunt Eliza�s, & says Eliza & Sue are violent on Politics., that they took the first chance of saying they are for Disunion.  They would not submit to their oppressors, so he took the first chance of leaving.  Uncle Arthur called to see him, & invited him to dine, & he liked Uncle Arthurs wife.  He did not go to see Aunt Turnbull or Aunt Haynes.  His feet he said hurt him, & Paul passed him & Alexander in the street without speaking, but afterwards left his card.  That was all they saw of him, & Mr. Henry Peronneau met Mr. Luther in the street, & very�said he would be glad if he would call & see him.  Aunt Eliza sent up some little presents to the children, Bible words for Willie, a book for Frank & Fanny, some little flower pots for Anna, & a peice of ribbon for myself.  If you go to town the only persons I wish you to go & see are Aunt Anna Turnbull & my Aunt McCall.  They are my Fathers relations, & I love them.  He Mamma says was different in politics from her mothers, which was certainly in his favour.  Our family woke upon all  on the opposite side as Traitors.  I hope never mind when you see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor, that you will not 	speak to them.  Mr. Taylor has often avoided speaking to you.  Mr. Croft says Miss B� wrote word that every child in Charleston even, was a Politician.  I hope that all read Mr. Poinsetts letter.  He certainly put the State in a most �tous light, & explained California better than I have heard it yet,  & though if Genl Taylor as you thought interfered in forming it into a State, still he says, that would have made no difference.  The people would have done the same.

		When you make your speech study it well beforehand & make a good one.  Say nothing that must be borne out.  I would be very glad if your resolutions are adopted but to me it seems no use to have a Southern Convention, for the other States are satisfied, so why should there be one.  But you know best; I mention my ideas only, & I wish you to be right in all you propose.

		Mr. Croft says Genl Thompson is a compound of evil.  He said there was no confidence to be placed in him, & his friends had found it out, & therefore given him up.  He says his wife was neither handsome or rich.  I am so sorry Genl Thompson has anything to do with the paper, that he subscribed for it.  It can never get along with him as a Stockholder.  You must buy him out as soon as possible.  He will be a dead weight to the paper, & you must never allow him to write for it.  It was most unfortunate you asking him to join.  

		Last night I did not send to the office after the Augusta Mail came, so I do not know what came for you.  The weather turned very cold last night, & it continues so.  I hope tomorrow the hogs will be killed.  

		Mr. Luther bought for Susan a beautiful Carpet for her Dining room & oil Cloth for her Stair case & Entry.  Elizabeth Jones chose them.  I would much rather have such things than all the books you buy.  I would much rather have a Carpet to keep my chamber warm & comfortable, & one for
 The little Dining room which is in rags; but you will buy books, & then there is no money left for anything else.  You are not satisfied with a few, but if you begin there is no end to them.  I wish I had half the money you have spent in books, , & you have so many expenses to meet, & you do not prepare for them.  If you will spend the money, then always carry the whole of us to Columbia with you & spend your money in paying our board.

		I was sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.  I know you would have spent a pleasant day, & now he will not ask you again.  

		You will be tired of my letter, but it is a relief to me to write & now I am going upstairs to read to Mary.  Good night.  Young Barnwell who graduated is engaged already to a Miss Ball, a pious young ledy, attending his fathers church.
