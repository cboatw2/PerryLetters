Letter 146

Friday morning, 6[7] December 1849
Greenville  

My dear husband
		I received a letter from you the last Mail & it gave me great pleasure.  I am glad cousin Isaac Hayne is more cordial.  I expect his coldness at first was owing to your manner, & as I wish you to be on good terms, you must return his visit & take Willie with you.  Mr. Heyward, is Nat Heyward, who we were intimate with at New Haven, & who liked me particularly.  He is a cousin of ours.  His Mother was a Miss Barnwell.  You must be very polite to him, for our sake.  I am gratified to hear how well Willie behaves.  Mamma is afraid he looks too much like a man with his frock coat & cravat.  I hope his coat is a Sack.  I am glad you have fitted up yourself well in Clothes, for you needed them, & it gives me pleasure  to see you well dressed.  I think married persons ought to dress better after marriage than they did before,  They ought to appear as comely as possible to each other.  They have then one person at least to please, before they had no one in particular.  Susan now tells me that Mr. Jones mentioned she thinks in his correspondence to Mr. McBee, that probably in two years he will be Candidate for Solicitor, that Genl Whitner perhaps will not wish to be reelected & Mr. McBee mentioned it to her, as showing how conceited he was.  I heard it in this manner.  I said to Ann, Mr. Jones is going to Columbia, & she said yes.  He is a Candidate for Solicitor the office Genl Whitner has.  I felt certain Genl Whitner was going to resign so in two years, if you have been elected to nothing more lucrative or honorable you must think of it, but in earnest I hope someone will bring you forward as Mr. Seabrook�s successor.  All have to convince themselves & do for themselves & if you give a hint to some friend, to propose you, you will be elected, for the Legislature can appreciate you more  than the people did, & of course give you whatever you asked for, & the Upper Country ought to share the honours equally with the Lower, & Greenville has not yet had that honour bestowed on her. 

		Dr. Tiddyman has written word that the Rail Road shall not pass through his land, but that he wil sell them his place at 10,000 dollars, & you know he thought he was cheated when he gave 7000 for it.  What is the Law on the subject; cannot they have the right of way, whether he gives it or not?  How illiberal he is.  I think he is a mean old man.  Mr. Cox who gave a high price for his place, I think it was 25,000 dollars, says he will sell his place for a Depot, for 8000 dollars. 

		We attended Mr. Kinloch�s funeral yesterday at the Episcopal Church.  It was a sad funeral, only 20 persons at it, & his cousin & servant chef mourners.  I should think his Mother would never forgive herself, for not having been with her only son, the best of his name in his dying moments.  I hear he was a handsome, accomplished young man.  Every vehicle that stopped at the door, he would ask if his friends had come.  They were written for.  He afterwards felt better & came down into the Bar room, & so countermanded the order.  He rode out to try his strength, to see if he would bear the journey down, but found he could not, & became so much worse, that his friends were written for again, the�weeks he�down stairs, he was brought down a�; if he was sick enough to remain up here & his cousin obliged to remain with him, it shows that he needed his Mother, & if she had loved him she would have been with him.  Mrs. Forbes says she has heard, he was indignant at the treatment of his Father.  Mr. Croft says his Father is not in the Asylum.  He saw him in Charleston when he was last there.  It is singular that at New Haven, we should meet with the little boy he was then, every day going to school. & here in Greenville, we should be brought in contact with him again but in so sad a way,

		Mrs. Sam Jones is in the Village today, so I invited her & Mrs. Town[e]s to come & take tea with me this evening, & invited Mrs. Elford also.  They are coming,  Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon are going to spend the afternoon with me.  They are afraid to be out after dark, on account of the cold.  I have made some nice Jelly, & some Custard for them, & have sent to ask Mamma & Susan, family to come.  Anna last night took tea  with Fanny Town[e]s next door.  They are good friends again.  Miss McBee told Susan the other day, she was anxious to see her to tell what Mr. Bradshaw said of Anna.  He says, Anna is the brightest genius in his school.  She ought to be smart, if she takes after you, as you daughters do after Fathers.  I am willing all should be like you.  Miss Stuart says Fannys face from her nose down is the express image of yours.

		Ann begs me to request you, to buy for her, a large box representing an Apple such as you bought for her before.  You recollect it I suppose.  She will return the money.  As you are Vardry�s Godfather you must bring him some little present to show you think of him.  If you see nothing suitable or pretty or reasonable to buy for me, to wear this winter, I will wait until you come back, & what money you can spare, send to town  & buy something there.  In Charleston they have a great variety & you can get an article for almost any price you choose.  In Columbia everything is dear & not such a variety as in Charleston.  So if you can get nothing for me you like I prefer waiting & sending to Charleston, when I am certain I can get something pretty & reasonable.

		I wish you to do one thing in the Legislature, & that is make an alteration in the Court of Appeals.  Introduce a law to make the lower country Lawyers try their Appeal cases in Charleston, when the Court sits there, & the Upper country Lawyers try their cases only in Columbia.  As it is now, the Lower Country has more than she is entitled to, & the Upper Country entirely overlooked & unjustly treated,

		The weather continues cold, so our meat is safe.  I see Dr. Irvine has returned.  What 3 votes did Mr. Walker get?  Perhaps it would have been best for you to have voted for him, to have gained his kind feelings.  You had best be polite to Mr. Jones  Though he is so vain, how much happier he is, than if he was conscious of his real value.  I have no news to tell you.  Mrs. Turpin came to see me yesterday.  Miss Vance is married & gone.  We are all well.  Reuben & Charles are ploughing.  I paid Mr. Slatton yesterday for Flour.  He says they marked it at the Mill, Superior.  Send pamphlets home to your constituents, such as Dr. Crook who once said you did not.  You must answer Aunt Eliza�s letter, & thank her for inviting Willie.  I wish he would go down & see his friends.  Has Judge Dunkin given you the money for Mrs. D�Oyley.   Col. Irv� has gone to the West to sell a Drove of negroes, & while he is absent his Wife has gone home.  Caroline Earle went with her.  What an uninteresting employment he has.  Examine all subjects brought before the Legislature well, always be sure you are on the right side, & I hope it will happen aways to be on the popular side.  Give our love to Willie.  Grandma & all send love.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
