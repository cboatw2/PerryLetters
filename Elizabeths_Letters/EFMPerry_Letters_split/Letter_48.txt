Letter 48

24 November 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I must write you a few lines to prevent your being uneasy, but I can promise you neither a long or interesting letter, for my material for composing one, is very scant indeed.  All Saturday I staid at home.  I had a visit from Mr. Luther McBee & Mr. Erwin his cousin.  Sunday morning we enjoyed a treat in going to the Episcopal church & hearing Mr. Pinckney.  He is to preach again next Sunday, & then the church will be shut up, until a new minister comes, which I fear will be for a long time.  After�Mamma, Susan & myself rode out to Mrs. Gibbs to bid her good bye.  She leaves this afternoon, & expect[s] to reach Columbia in five days.  The place is sold to Mr. Whitefoord Smith, father of the minister of that name  2500 dollars he gave for it; including I believe, a little of the furniture.  After returning from Mrs. Gibbs, I remained at Mamma�s & spent the day.  I sent for the children.  Mrs. McBee, Miss Malinda, & Miss Reinhardt were there.  The wedding takes place Thursday evening at church.  Only a few persons will be invited.  Miss Reinhardt only will return home with Susan, so that it will be to them like any other evening.  I will not have my party for a fortnight.  The McBee�s wish it put off until then, when they expect more friends from N. Carolina, & will themselves then give a party.  A great many persons are now absent, who we wish to invite, & will have returned by that time.  I am quite satisfied, & prefer putting it off.  Mr. Pinckney in a visit to Mamma, spoke well of Mr. McBee, & seemed pleased at Susans marrying him.  I hope she will be happy, she deserves to be.

	Today is quite cold, & Jim intends killing the hogs.  Mr. Hooker brought the oats Saturday, & I paid for them.  This morning the old free black male, your client, came to see you.  He is in trouble about the money you paid him some time ago; says Willis Robinson says; you paid him too much, & wants some of it, , that he had seen you about it, & you told him to go to him.  He reminds me of Durham.  He dreads advantages being taken of him.  Only a newspaper came last night.  I have no news to tell you, & as only two days have passed since you left home, of course nothing has occurred for me to relate.  We are quite well, Willie is at school, the other children playing in the yard.  This is a pleasant day.  I hope you have the same weather in Columbia.  I miss you very much, but am so unselfish, as to prefer your being where you will be of service to your District & State than with me.  It would be a pity that the best qualified man to represent the people, should remain in seclusion at home, recollect, write me nothing about homesickness.  In the first place I don�t believe it, & in the second place do not wish my husband to be so childish this time next year.  I hope I will be with you on my way to Charleston.  I am still busy helping Susans work.  Yesterday she had a bad headache, & I am afraid she has it today.  I look forward with pleasure to hearing from you Wednesday.  I must conclude with one peice of advice.  Do not forget to send Legislative documents to your friends.  Write me of everything, take care of yourself, & be happy.  The children all sleep with me.  I will keep you informed of all going on at home, but if I miss writing by one off the Mails, know that I have nothing to write about, & I do not wish you to pay postage for a letter  containing one sentence, �we are well�.  Your affectionate, Liz

Benjamin Perry
