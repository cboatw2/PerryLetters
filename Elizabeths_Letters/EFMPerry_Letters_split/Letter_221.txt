Letter 221

Wednesday morning ? past 9, 8 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	Willie has just returned from the Post office & with no letter from you, which has disappointed me greatly.  To make up he brought me a letter from Aunt Eliza which contains a most gratifying account of Anna, & which therefore I enclose to you that you may also be gratified at the pleasing [im]pression she has made.  Though the letter contains nothing to bring tears to the eyes, yet in reading it aloud I had to stop several times.  These are feelings I suppose peculiar to a parent.  Any mention made of their children when absent from them affects them, & for the sake of the parent, children ought to try & do well.

	I am very sorry not to hear from you.  I dare say the Post Master did not Mail the letter, or you were too busy to write.  It gives me less to write about, not hearing.

	Mr. Hoke came over this morning to say, as soon as the weather cleared he would buy the hogs, that next week the moon will be on the increase, which will be the time to kill.  We have not needed Bacon, having Beef enough. & we now have more Milk which is a comfort.  The Legislature adjourns so soon, that you have not been long enough in Columbia to get tired.  You must not engage a room at Janney�s for me next winter.  It will be time enough then, & if the weather happened to be very cold & rainy, I might not wish to do down until the Spring, but it seems to me now I would like to go, so as to hear you speak in the Legislature.  That would be my purpose in going.

	I hope you will let Anna stay in town until Mr. & Mrs. Elford come up.  She passes her time so pleasantly there & her friends are so much pleased with her, that two or three weeks will not be too long for her.  I am sure she will improve.  Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote to Mamma yesterday & mentions Anna in gratifying terms & was quite affectionate.  I would like Anna to be in Charleston after Eloisa Martin goes down to see her family.

	I paid Mr. Hillhouse�s bill for Frank today.  [page torn] Mamma Susan & Ann  are here & in the room with me, so I cannot write a very long letter.  We are all well.  Reuben is hauling leaves for the stable.  I know of nothing new.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & to see the Patriot today.  I must now close & write to Aunt Eliza.  I am glad for her sake you voted for Isaac Hayne, & hope Wm Ed will retain his office, for she is kind. 

	Anna will have enough to talk of for a long time.  How much more important a visit of a girl to town, is than a boy.  Anna enjoys it more than Willie would have done.  Aunt Anna Turnbull asked Anna why Willie did not go to town, & she said Willie was quite tired of going down, not very complimentary.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
