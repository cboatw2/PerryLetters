Letter 51

Sunday night, 30 November 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter by Mr. Cox, & it has given me great pleasure.  I am surprised at your not hearing from me last Friday.  I have written every Mail since your left.  The Post Master in Columbia must be careless, or there is carelessness somewhere.  You had better always go yourself.  If you do not receive my letters it is not worthwhile for me to write, & I do not like them to fall in any other hands, but the one for whom they were intended.  Though very busy, I did not neglect you. I am glad you spent a pleasant day at Dr. Gibb[e]s.  You must accept all your invitations.  I wish I had given you the other pr of Shoes to carry down also to exhbibit.  The next time I will have something very [page smudged] to send.  I am going to work two beautiful patterns on velvet for Ottomans or stools.  Mr. Cox it is said is engaged, but not to be married for a year.  I suppose you have heard of the death of Mr. Wm Blassingame.  I believe he died of Delirium Tremens.  Mr. Murphy told me, it was the horrors, or Tremens or some such thing he heard.  You did not think when you saw him Court week, he would die so soon.  I am sorry he is dead, for he was such a friend of yours.  I think persons acting as he did, are more to be pitied, than blamed, for he certainly could not control himself.  You say I must tell you everything, so I will mention every incident.  Maria has been sick with cold, fever & pain in her head & shoulders.  Jim came for Dr. Crook to go see her.  She is now better.  March still complains of pain in his stomach, & is not able to do anything.  I expect he needs medicine; He says he ought to take Calomel; so tomorrow I will send him to Dr. Earle or Crook to know what he ought to take.  James is as bad as ever.  Whenever I tell him to cut wood, he says March cuts it when he knows March has not been able to cut it.  James will be in the kitchen doing nothing, & I not able to have any wood.  It is best to have only one man in the yard, for when there are two, each leaves the work for the other to do.  If you keep March he is so weakly, he will have to stay at home, to attend to the lot, drive the carri[a]ge & haul wood, & James must stay entirely at the farm.  I cannot bear him any longer.  If you keep him, he shall not be within my sight or call.  If he is, I will sell him without your leave.  I hope you will meet with an opportunity in Columbia of disposing of him, but I rather think you will not, & it would be difficult getting him down, unless he went in the stage.  Jim & Charles have been cutting rails.  They will sow the Oats as soon as the ground can be ploughed.  It is now frozen.  We have had most severe weather, & still have.  Yesterday Mr. Holcombe sent the hogs, 5 of them weighing altogether 983 pounds.  They are cut up, salted & put away.  There is no danger of their spoiling in this weather.  The Cider Mrs. Griffin brought is very nice.  Mr. Pinckney preached today.  He leaves with his family tomorrow.  Susan & her husband were at church.  As I looked at him at the foot of the pew, I could but contrast his appearance with yours, he looking like but I wont say it.  It is wrong to speak against my sisters husband.  I only hope she will never think of him, as I do, that she will remain blind to his failings, she must think well of him, or she would not have married him, for she is an upright, honorable, conscientious person, confiding, & generous, & deserves as good a husband as I have.  He has done well for himself, gained a comfortable home, & himself & his wife &�supported.  All he has to do is to pay his Tailors bill.  But do not my dear husband, ever breathe a word of what I say to you about him, & I wish you always to think well of him.  Sometimes I am so unhappy when I think, that perhaps Susan will be unhappy, but there is no appearance of unhappiness yet, & I hope & trust she will never repent her choice, so do not mention ever what I have said.  Susan has been very liberal in distributing cake.  She has sent to a great many in Charleston, & all of her acquaintances here.  I hope you will receive your peice tonight.  I suppose Mr. Elford will have reached Columbia this evening.  Mr. Duncan is really obstinate.  Does he wish Mr. Wells hung? Or think public opinion wishes it?  You ought to have introduced the resolution about the Chancelors decrees, for I have often heard you express that opinion, so you ought to have had the credit of it.  Any law that you think would be of advantage, you should introduce yourself, & not wait for others to.  I see the Hoar question will be brought forward again, now my dear, I beseech you not to take the part of Massachuset[t]s.  I have always been ashamed of the part you acted last winter, so do not do so again; rather agree with your state & give up your one opinion to her, than wish to bring her round to you.  The minority should yield, & it seemed so strange for you to be differing from the whole Legislature.  Massachset[t]s has no good motive in sending her agents here, & she ought not to be encouraged in it, & if turning them away is unconstitutional, it ought to be constitutional.  I am sorry I did not know this question would be brought forward & advised you before you left, & so saved my paper.  However I hope the advice will not come too late.  If you will act badly, do not �ron in the Mountaineer, but keep it to yourself.  Your bad acts I wish concealed, not published to the world.  If you wish the reputation of being independent, you have acquired that already; so need not make yourself singular for that purpose.  Above all never do anything that has the appearance of siding with the North against the South.  The people are so suspicious on that subject, & they judge from appearance, do not always understand the motive, therefore avoid the appearance of evil, acquiesce without any fuss to what the legislature determines on.  If you will object, object quietly & without any noise, but I hope you will agree with me.  I think I must have convinced you. if your good sense had not before.  You must take my advice in good part, for you know it is given for the purpose of making you act wisely & for the good of your constituents, & I being one of them, wish you to act for my good.  I do not wish for agents to be coming here from the North meddling with our concerns.  The children are well, & so am I.  Willie will write a postscript in my next letter; he is now asleep.  Frank speaks constantly of you; they all love you dearly.  You ought to have told Mr. Henry his love for his wife, was not to be compared to yours for me, for that I was a most uncommon wife, very few to be compared to me.  I am glad you asked me about the Silk dress, before buying it, for it would have been useless.  I sent to town for it when Susan did.  It is beautiful, & only 1 dollar a yd.  I am to pay Mamma gradually for it.  Instead of bringing me a dress, I would rather you give me the money to pay her at once.  I wrote to you to inquire about fruit.  I do not wish you to buy it.  I would be vexed if you did. I only wish to know the price, so if it is cheap,  & I wish it, I can send for it.  Last night I slept on a feather bed.  It is the first time I have been warm for a week.  I missed my stove, but with the feather bed I am very comfortable.  Good night, E.F.P.
