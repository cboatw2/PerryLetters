Letter 110

Wednesday morning, quarter of 7, 4 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	It is an hour before breakfast, & as I have nothing to do, I will write to you.  Last night I took tea at Aunt Haynes.  Mr. Martin came there to see me, & to ask us to stay with them.  He entertains persons constantly & Aunt Mary says it is no inconvenience to him.  If you think I had better stay, I am willing to go there, as it will save the board I am paying at this house, but if you think I had better remain where I am, I will remain.  Except the expense of boarding I would rather be here, because I feel independent, but as they are so urgent & say it will give them no trouble, if you think best I will remove to their house.

	Tomorrow I am to dine at Aunt Elizas.  I like Aunt Haynes, Uncle Arthur, & Aunt Elizabeth, Aunt Brewton, & Aunt Mary McCall the best.  Of the relations I have seen, I like Eloisa Martin, but Aunt Eliza & her family I like least & Aunt Anna Turnbull & those at her house the next least.

	I have bought nothing yet.  Charleston is not to be compared in looks to Columbia.  The Convention sits today.  It is thought no Bishop will be elected.  Mr. Martin says he has in his pocket a letter from Dr. Atkinson acknowledging his abolition principles, that Mr. Trapier & the high church ministers here, have given him up.  

	It looks cloudy, we need rain, but I will be sorry if it does, as I wish to shop.  Tomorrow as I am to dine out, I may not have time to write.

	I will now stop.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.   

After the fact.
P.S. Since writing the above Aunt Anna Turnbull has sent to ask us to dine today with her.  We are going. But first I am to shop with Aunt Mary McCall.  Aunt Mary Haynes says any evening I have no engagement I must spend with them.  Mrs. Julia Pringle is here.  I have been in the drawing room talking to her, & Mrs. Martin, & Col. Irvine who stays at Fort Moultrie is here, but goes back to the island today.  His wife stays here altogether.  She knows Uncle Arthur & Aunt Elizabeth well.  Mrs. Pringle goes to Newport in June.  Mrs. Poinsett is in Charleston at the Miss Pinckneys. Her place was sold including furniture for 5000 500 dollars.  Mrs. Pringle says it was given away.  Mr. Pringle is not here.

My dear husband

	I have just returned from shopping & will write to you.  The few lines you wrote enclosing Susan�s letter, is all I have heard from you since I left Columbia.  A servant goes to the Post Office every day.  I hope today after the Cars arrive I may hear.

	I have had to buy things for Susan Hoke, Mamma, Susan & myself, & the shopping is dreadfully fatiguing.  Yesterday & the day before after shopping, I had to dine out, so at night I was very tired.  I have almost finished shopping now, so I will not be so fatigued.  Things are higher than I expected, so I have spent much more than I had any idea of, & more than at the time I am aware of until the bills are made out, but after this, I will be economical. 

	I long to see you.  It is not worth the expense for you to come down to see me, & go back & come down for me, so one trip seems sufficient, but as soon as your business is done, come for me, & write me word when you think you will come.  I would like to know. 

	I was truly sorry to hear of Eliza�s death.  I could not realize she was going to die, & had a faint hope she would recover.  She will be such a loss to me, having for 11 years done my work, that I do not know how I can do without her.  Clara I wish to stay with Margaret until Jany to finish her trade, as this year is the most important.  She is to learn to cut & fit, but she must sleep at home every night, to attend to the baby, & I hope when I have pressing work to do, Margaret will let me have her.  I am sorry for Eliza�s children & Missy, & will do a good part by them & never part with them.  Susan�s account was quite affecting & I hope Eliza is happy now.
	I dined yesterday at Aunt Eliza�s, spent a pleasant time, & in the afternoon walked on the Battery.  Today I am at the boarding house, & am glad of a rest.

	No Bishop has been elected yet.  Mr. Leary called today while I was out, & Mrs. H� Simons, & Mrs. Bay & Mrs. Crawford yesterday, & Mrs. Henry Pinckney & family, Mrs. O�Driscoll, Mrs. Ramsay.  Persons have not yet found out I am in town.

	Yesterday Uncle Arthur intended asking me to dine but I was engaged to Aunt Eliza�s.  I saw Aunt Emily at Aunt Eliza�s.

	I will keep my letter open until the afternoon when I hope I will hear from you.  You must write of[ten] or I will get homesick.  

	As I do not know when the letters will come, I will close this.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	Aunt Anna Turnbull came here this afternoon & she says I must stay with her.  So I write at once to ask you.  I hope this letter can go by tomorrows Mail, & you answer it Sunday, for I expect I had better stay my week out here, & go to Aunt Anna�s Monday morning.  If you stay some time longer in Columbia, I expect as Aunt Anna seems so sincere in her invitation that I had better move there, but if you expect in a few days to come for me, I might as well remain where I am.  Write the instant you get this letter & tell me how long you think you will be, before you come down & my movements will depend on that.  

	Eloisa Martin has just been here, & repeated her invitation to stay with her.  You write me what I had better do.  Mr. Arthur came to see me this afternoon.  Mr. Davis of Camden has been elected Bishop, high church Mr. Arthur says.  Write me immediately how long it will be before your business is over.  I will close so as to send this letter to the office.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

Charleston

My dear husband

	Day after day passes, & I do not hear from you.  I begin to think you must be sick, for as you are only one days journey from me, I cannot imagine why you do not write.

	I received a long letter from Susan toda, & one from Frank.  Lindy�s baby had been unwell but was better.  The rest of the family were well.  May day she says was the poorest display she ever saw, but they had plenty to eat, & the children enjoyed themselves.

	Aunt Turnbull sent today to say she would send for me at 2 oclock to stay with her, but I wrote word I would let her know Monday, after I heard from you, how long it was probable you would be in Columbia.  If you expect to come down soon, it would not be worth moving there.  If you were not coming for me, I would perhaps go there now, but I expect you would yourself much prefer being at a boarding house, than staying at Aunt Anna�s.  You prefer being independent, & I am afraid Aunt Anna for the short time I stay there, would expect me if she comes to Greenville to invite her to pass the summer.  This makes me reluctant to stay with her, but you write me what to do.  I hope to hear from you this afternoon.  Mrs. Martin is in this house, & is very polite.  Mrs. Julius Pringle is here, & is polite, but she is not a pleasant person.

	The weather is not hot; the noise I am getting accustomed to.  Direct your letters to the care of Mr. Wm E. Martin, or Wm Ed. Hayne.  I will then be sure to get them.  I think now there must be some mistake that you have written, & the letters have miscarried.  Mrs. Pringle�s servant this morning, brought me the two from Susan & Frank, & I am surprised none from you.

	Uncle Arthur last night sent to say, he had called repeatedly to see me, but I was out.  The servants do not tell me who calls.  

After dinner
	This morning when I returned from King St. I found Uncle Arthur had called again.  Aunt Anna Turnbull sent to ask me to ride with her this afternoon to Magnolia Cemetery, & I am going with her.

	I have just received a letter from you.  I am glad you are well.  I rather think as you think you will come down next week that I will remain where I am.  If you were not coming, I would go to Aunt Anna�s or Eloisa�s, but as you are coming, I do not think you would find it pleasant at either of those places, & I expect you would not be willing to stay at a Hotel, & I at a private house.  I do not think at Aunt Anna�s you would find it pleasant.  Perhaps Monday I could go to Aunt Anna�s & stay until you write word you are coming, & then I would move back to Mrs. Davis, & be in time to meet you here.  So hat do you think; write me by return Mail.

	Anna yesterday was unwell.  The water I expect has disagreed with her, & she was just loose in her bowels, & then bound, & in great pain, & Mrs. Pringle advised me to send for a Doctor, & I sent for Dr. Geddings, & he gave her some pills which have done her great good, & by tomorrow he said she will be well.  He paid her two visits so I will have to pay his bill, & if I were to move from here, I would have to pay the bill here, so I would be very glad if you would send me some more money to prevent my feeling embarrassed.  From 20 to 50 dollars according to your liberality, the letter in which you enclose it, you can direct to the care of Wm Ed Hayne, if you think it safer.  I have received two letters from you.  If these are all you have written, then there is no risk, but I think perhaps you have written some I have not received.  I was to get money from Alston for Mama, bit I dislike asking, so if I had enough I would prefer lending her mine.  Send the money by return Mail.  Mrs. Pringles servant goes for my letters, & brings them safely.  I will get him to bring me some Stamps, so you will not have to pay postage.  I will not determine about Aunt Anna�s until I hear from you, whether you will like to stay there, or like me to return to Mrs. Davis & meet you here, or you stay at a Hotel when you come, & I at Aunt Anna�s.  She may expect me to ask her to stay with me in Greenville, & this I cannot do.  Eliza dead, my work will be unusual, & I expect to devote every moment to sewing.  I see ready made clothes for children, & that is one thing I would like to get for Willie & Frank & why I wish more money, for I will not have time to do all, & do not understand making boys clothes.  Eliza�s loss is irreparable.  I deeply deplore it.  For 11 years she has worked for me & made my dresses better than a Mantua maker.  In consequence of her death, I am having a dress made here, which I will have to pay 3.25 for, & that is thought cheap, for 5 is the price.  I am glad I have heard.  If you could get business in Charleston, I would like you to move here.  I like a City.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Anna is well, but having taken medicine cannot go out this week.

Sunday, 2 oclock, 8 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I went to St. Michael�s church this morning.  Aunt Elizabeth called for me.  I did not see Uncle Arthur.  He went to Grace church, Mr. Pinckney�s church to hear the new Bishop.  Mr. Arthur preached at St. Phillips.  It was an old sermon but Aunt Elizabeth liked him.  The Bishop preaches this afternoon at St. Phillips.  Perhaps I may go there.

	Yesterday afternoon Aunt Brewton called to see me.  She said I must take tea with her Monday.  Aunt Anna Turnbull then called for me & took me up to the Magnolia Cemetery 3 miles out of the City.  It is a beautiful spot on Cooper river.  The river winds along through the grounds.  A bridge is across it.  In one spot, there is a Gothic chapel in the midst, & some beautiful monuments, one recently erected to a Mr. Jones a stranger who died here, by his widow cost 6000 dollars.

	After tea last night, Aunt Mary McCall called to see me, & before she left Mr. Isaac Hayne & his wife called.  I was surprised.  I thought after my conduct to him, they would both have passed me without notice.  They were very affable, & from this time we must bury the hatchet, for really I feel sorry for him.  He has the same abstracted look Mr. Treville has, except more worried, so I have come to the conclusion, that the Attorney general�s�is never out of their minds, that as the Contest is always such a close one Mr. Treville is looking forward to getting it, but afraid he may not.  Isaac Hayne is looking forward to losing it, but hoping he may not.  His manners are not playful & lively as they once were, so I make allowances for his apparent coldness to you, & believe now, it is unintentional.  He asked about you.  He looks like his father.  

	Aunt Brewton said I must take tea with her Monday.  Aunt Elizabeth said I must dine with her Tuesday, that she was sorry she had seen so little of me.  She is the kindest of my Aunts in law.  She seems to have such a kind heart.  Uncle Arthur & herself have been repeatedly to see me, but I have been out.  Aunt Brewton said her daughter in law, Alstons wife had been, & left her card, but I never received it.  I do not know who has been.  Mr. Arthur this morning called before church.  I was very anxious to see him to know if he had received a box a Milliner was to pack & send to him, but the servant never asked him in.   	

	This is a pleasant house on account of the situation & privacy, but they have but two boys & one woman to attend to the whole house, & one little boy, so I miss not having a servant.  The board for a servant I see on the rules is 4 dollars a week.  If I had brought Clara, she would have saved me 3.25 already.  I have to pay for making a dress & would have gone on messages & shopped for me, so another time I will bring her.

	Write me word what time you think you will be down.  I wrote a note to Aunt Anna yesterday, & said if you were not coming down soon, perhaps I might go to her house, but if you were coming down, it would not be worthwhile to move, & I would give her an answer Monday.  She seemed really sincere in asking me, but I know her disposition, & she dislikes so having trouble & expense, that I am certain she would like me better if I do not stay with her, so I have no idea of leaving this house.  She has been kinder than I expected.

	Mr. Isaac Hayne says Columbia is not as hospitable a place as it used to be.  I expect as Cities increase in population & wealth, they become more fashionable & less hospitable.  

	Aunt Susan Hayne is the only Aunt I have not seen.  She lives very high up & keeps no equipage.  Anna is better, but today I thought she had better not go to church.  I expect this afternoon to go to St. Michaels again with Aunt Elizabeth, & tonight to St. Peters with Aunt Martha McCall to hear the new Bishop.  Dinner is nearly ready so I will close & hope to hear soon from you.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

I have not seen a paper since I came here.

My Dear Mamma

 	This is Sunday morning and we had intended going to church, but the rain prevented us.  It also rained last Wednesday, and I expect you do not have as much rain in Charleston as we have here.  I do not expect the Smallpox could have been bad or you would have went on.  Reuben said that you were not certain that you would go on if it was ther[e], but I never heard you say anything about it.  Mayday is past and Aunt Susan read me her letter�to you in which she told you about it.  She did not like the way Mrs. Earle did about the wreaths.  We had enough to eat upon a table in the yard, and we had enough of dancing also.  I danced some.  The dancing continued until late at night and it was twelve oclock when I got home.  Hudson stayed with me that night, and as we had holiday the next day he stayed  with me also until after dinner and then went home.  Aunt Susan likes very much.  I wrote a letter to Papa last Wednesday for one he wrote me before.  I wish you would write to me some, or as I expect you will be very busy in shopping and visiting.  You must tell Anna to write me, and tell her that if she will write to me I will write to her.  I am now writing upon that Aunt Brewton gave to me and you must tell her that I thank her very much, and give my love to all my relations.  I am writing in the Library and Aunt Susan has just come in and says that as I am writing she does not think she will as there is no use in both of us writing.  She says that I must tell you that we are getting on well considering there are so many together.  She says that Mrs. Caroline Reardon who was Miss Rinehart is coming to live in Greenville , and this is another reason that she is glad she has got out of the McBee family as Mrs. Reardon has such a tongue and temper.  And she says that Luther [McBee] contualy been sending notes and messages.  I must now stop writing.  You must excuse me for all the mistakes in this letter.  Frank has written to you but he would not let me read his letter.  Give my love to Anna.  You must bring me a pretty present.  Your affectionate son, William H, Perry

My dear husband

	I have just returned from Aunt Brewtons, & have only time to say, that if possible I prefer you coming down for me.  By next Wednesday I would like to leave here.  I think two weeks is as long as I ought to stay.  I do not intend going to Aunt Anna Turnbulls today.  If you cannot come, I will go up without you, but I have no time for more.  I received the money today.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

10 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I wrote you a few hurried lines last night on my return from Aunt Brewtons.  The 10 oclock bell was ringing, & the servant was waiting to put the letter in the Office.

	I received two letters from you yesterday, one enclosing Willie�s letter, the other 40 dollars which I thank you for.

	  I think the expense of boarding is too great for me to stay here longer than two weeks, so next�day I ought to leave, or at least Tuesday, will make it two weeks.  If your cases will not be called for before then, suppose you come down now, & when you return to Columbia, attend to your business, or cannot you beg the Court, in consideration of your wife�s waiting in town for you, to take up your cases at once, & then come for me.  I will be very glad for you to come, but if it is entirely inconvenient, then I must get Wm Ed Hayne to carry me to the R[ail] Road, pay my passage, & have my trunks marked, & in Columbia you will be ready at the Depot, to receive me.

	Uncle Arthur will be very glad to see you.  Alston Hayne also expressed a wish to see you, & all my relations I know would like to see you. so therefore there is not much to interest you here.  If you can with convenience come I would like it.

	I am to dine at Uncle Arthur�s today. He is to send his carri[a]ge for me.  Last night at Aunt Brewton�s I saw Mr. Pinckney Alston who asked after you.  Mrs. Julius Pringle is still in this house.  Mrs. Richmond Lowndes is expected today.  Her husband & family�.  She was a Miss Parker.  The company is constantly changing.  It is very private, & I feel quite at ease.  It is not so pleasant for you as the Charleston  Hotel.  You do not see so much company, & it is not known that you are in town, so you had better go there first & register your name.

	I told Aunt Anna Monday, I would let her know whether I would stay with her.  If she says nothing further on the subject, of course I wont think of going, & I dare say she will not, for as she has given the invitation, she feels she has done her duty, & I know it would give her trouble.  If she presses me as she did at first, & you are not coming for a long time, I may go, but I will let you know.

	Aunt Eliza invited me to take tea with her last night & Aunt Emily tonight, but I was engaged elsewhere.  I wish you would write every day.  I like to hear better, than when I am at home.  I long to see the children.  I suppose Hext has almost forgotten me.  I was pleased to see Willie�s letter.  I am glad Eliza�s children do not give way to grief, as it would distress me very much.  I am sure Missy feels it greatly.  Her loss is great to me.  I have not paid one cent for making my dresses for years, & now I have to pay 3.25 for one.  Washing the least peice here is 6 ? a peice.  It will be a saving another time to bring Clara to sew & wash for me.  My washing will amount to a good deal.

	If you do not come, you must write me word whether I shall get Groceries, & the Dinner Set.  I had to buy things to make me look genteel, & those who have shopped with me, think I have at least 500 to spend, & make me go beyond my means.  Hereafter I will shop alone.  Aunt Mary McCall said I must buy what would look well at the North , where they dress very fine.  I have not bought a great deal, but money in a City is soon spent, & yet very little to show for it.

	Mrs. Wilkes & Mrs. Perroneau called to see me yesterday, & Miss Drayton & her niece.  The servants are very careless, & even cards left, they do not show me, so I do not know who has called.

	As I wish you to look your very best when you appear in Charleston among a people who once abused you, you must provide yourself with a dress Sack Coat suitable for the season.  I wish them to see that you are a striking looking man, & as I am taken for a girl of sixteen, wish you to look of a suitable age for me.  If you can get a nice�Sack in Columbia get it there, if not here.  

	I will�write by return Mail, whether you will come or not, & when.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

Charleston

My dear husband

	I wrote you already today, & will now write to send by tomorrows Mail.  I went up King st. this morning before breakfast, to shop a little.  It is the best time as from after breakfast until night, the streets are crowded.

	Today I am to dine at Uncle Arthurs.  Aunt Anna Turnbull also sent to invite me, but as I was engaged to Uncle Arthur, I had to decline.  Tomorrow Aunt Mary McCall has invited me to dine at her house just opposite here, at 3 oclock.  It would take a month at least to see all my relations & to return the visits paid me.  I have not seen Aunt Susan Hayne yet.  She lives very high up, & keeps no equipage.  Anna is now quite well, only bit by muskutoes, which as yet though are not very bad.

	You must write me, whether you can come for me or I must go up without you.

	I have not much to write now, as I have written already to you today, & I wish to write to Susan.

Sunday afternoon.  Aunt Elizabeth carried me to St. Phillips to hear the new Bishop.  He was a Lawyer from North Carolina, 52 years old, seems in feeble health, not animated, but a very good plain preacher.  Mr. Arthur reaches Greenville tonight 8 oclock, left here yesterday afternoon, & had a letter from Dr. Croft for you, which he was to have put in the Post Office at Columbia.  You must write me, whether you prefer my remaining here, or wish me to go to Columbia & meet you there & stay until your business is over, with you or go on to Greenville before you.  Either way I am willing to do, if it were not so expensive, I would be willing to stay here a longer time.  It is thought perfectly safe this month & the next.  I pass my time pleasantly, but I will be glad to see the children particularly Hext; & shopping takes so much money, that it is very unpleasant to go to shop, unless I had a good deal to spend, & I buy the things perhaps I could do without, & have to go without what I need.  It is dreadfully confusing, & dreadfully fatiguing, & I believe I would rather before I come again, write for what I wish, & when I do come not enter King st., where there is so much to tempt.  

	Straw Mating, China, towels &c I have not even looked at.  I would like very much to buy a new carri[a]ge, to put our new horses to.  If you come, you must price some.  

	I will now conclude & write to Susan, & before long I must dress & go to Uncle Arthurs.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Charleston

My dear husband

	I dined at Uncle Arthurs yesterday in company with Mr. Pinckney Alston & his daughter who we saw at Greenville.  He is so pleasant; he prevents a dinner party being stiff.  In the afternoon Aunt Elizabeth took us to ride round the Battery, which is a delightful place, very much extended & improved.  That & the Magnolia Cemetery are beautiful rides.  I have to dine at Aunt Mary McCall�s today, at 3 oclock.  She has just sent to repeat the invitation.  Tonight we are to take tea at Aunt Emily�s.  

	As I was out yesterday, I expect no one asked for letters at the Post Office for me, so I will send this morning.  After breakfast I am going to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, & tomorrow I hope she will carry me to return some visits.  Augustus Hoke came to see us last night, just as I got home from Uncle Arthurs.  He looks & seems quite well & offered to escort us to the island, but I do not think we will have time to go.  Several persons called yesterday while I was out.  The weather today is very pleasant.  I have not found it hot yet.  There is generally a breeze.  Today is quite warm.  I am afraid Greenville even after the road is finished will not be patronized by the lower country.  They say it is too hot,�that when they leave Charleston, they wish for a greater change so go to Buncombe or the mountains of Georgia.  

	I have written you I believe every Mail, which is more than you have done me.  I must now prepare to go down to breakfast.

12 oclock.  I have just received a letter from you, & the boy says, there are two more, but he has to pay postage, so I sent him back with 10 cts.  I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly.  I dare say more pleasantly than you would in Charleston, for the gentlemen in Columbia are congregated together; here if you stay at this house, you would be with no gentlemen you know, & may leave before your friends know you are here.  At the Charleston Hotel, you would find it pleasanter, but at this house I find it pleasant.  This morning I went to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, Aunt Haynes, & Aunt Eliza.  Aunt Anna is expecting Mrs. Bull Friday, & that day we are to dine with her, & after Mrs. Bull leaves, she is to stay only a day or two, but I know she thinks so of trouble & expense, that I do not think I will go, particularly as I do not wish to be obligated to anyone, & for a few days stay, expect to ask them to stay with me a summer.

	If you prefer not coming down, you must write me, for I wish you to consult your pleasure, & not come against your inclination.  I will today speak to Mrs. Davis & ask her terms.  Aunt Mary said 18 a week, 12 for me & 6 for Anna.  I hope if it is not more than that, I would rather be at a boarding house on account of the independent feeling that I have.  I have just received a letter from Susan & Willie.  They are all well.  Anna is quite well now & is to dine with me today at Aunt Mary McCall�s.  Tomorrow night we take tea at Aunt Haynes.  Perhaps tomorrow morning we go to the island. 

	I would like very much to buy some Matting for our drawing room, & the large chamber.  You can get it 25 cts a yd. 10 dollars for each room.  I wish you would be so good as to send me 20 dollars, if you are wil[l]ing for me to get it.  I also would like to get some Shades for our Drawing room, 3 of them.  I suppose 6 dollars would buy them & I wish some towels & a few large Table cloths.  If you are willing for me to get these things, send me the money, but if you would rather not, you need not.  The 40 dollars you sent me will pay two weeks board, so if you are not coming down, I am afraid to spend it, therefore have nothing now to make purchases with.  The Matting looks so cool & sweet & saves scouring.

	Mama wished me to get some money from Alston which will be due in a few days, to make some purchases for her.  I spoke to Aunt Brewton about it, but Alston has not sent me any.  If I could I would lend it to her, but I have it not.  

	My relations have been quite kind to me, & it is a pleasant change to come to the City for a while.  All I regret is, I have not more money to spend.  Uncle Arthur told me he was surprised to find you were willing to accept a Judgeship, as he supposed you made a great deal more.  I told him you had never been a Candidate.  He says if you had removed to Charleston before this, Mr. King who has a great regard for you would have helped you greatly.  I wish you would move & bring the paper here.  I have not seen a paper since I left home.  I wish you would send the Patriot.  I hear nothing of it.  I suppose Mr. Elford has not been to Columbia, as you do [not] mention him.  I think there is no risk in sending money.  If you think there is, you can direct your letters to the care of Wm Ed, but when I send my name written on paper, the letters are always brought me.  Write to me every day, that I may know your movements, & buy a nice setting Sack Coat, either in Columbia or in Charleston if you come.  I will return whenever you write me.  

	I am very glad you took a pleasant ride with Gov. Manning.  Persons here are more�of their horses than anything else, & keep them for show, not for comfort.  I have walked more than I do a year in Greenville.  Dinner company seems not as common as it was.  Eloisa Martin asked me to stay with her, but has not asked me to dinner, but I suppose she will.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter in which you say we must go to Columbia Monday.  I hope you will be able to come down Saturday, & stay here Sunday & Monday, & then we will all go back Tuesday,  My two weeks will then be up, but if it is impossible for you to come down, Tuesday I will go back.  Alston today is to send me some money at least bring it at 2 oclock, & with that I will make Mamma�s purchases.  He will bring me more than 100, the interest due her in a few days.  I will spend out of it for myself what I need & you can return it to her, so that will be better than you sending me any more money.  My dear husband you are very good in supplying your wife with money.  You know it is so pleasant for one to be able to buy things when they are in a City, & see so many things they wish.  It makes me love you more & more.  Mr. Leary is very much mistaken in saying it is unsafe to be here.  There is no danger until July.  I am up in the 4th story above all impure atmosphere .  The weather I have not found at all hot.  The muskutoes  are not very bad, persons laugh at the idea of there being any danger.  Many have not even come down from the country.  Uncle Arthur comes to see me almost every day, & will be very glad to see you.  Alston said he would be very glad to see you, & I would like very much for you to see my relations, so you must come Saturday & stay a few days, & beg them not to call your cases until you return.  I will not be able to go up before Tuesday.  My dress is at a Mantua maker & I do not know how to get it from her.  I have to return visits & shop.   I have not been able to shop for fear the money I had, I would have to pay board.  I asked Mrs. Davis today her terms.  She says 12 for me 6 for Anna a week.  This is a very pleasant house for a lady to be at.  Mr. Julius Pringle came yesterday, & Mr. & Mrs. Richard Lowndes.  I dined yesterday at Aunt Mary McCall�s & drank tea at Aunt Emilys.  Tonight [I] am to take tea at Aunt Haynes & tomorrow dine at Aunt Anna Turnbulls.

	Franks is a very good letter.  He does not need a gun.  You have one at home will do for him.  Write me by return Mail whether you can come.  You will get this letter Friday afternoon.  You had better come down Sunday; if you cannot leave Saturday, stay here Monday & Tuesday & go back Wednesday & make arrangements for your cases to be called Thursday & we return to Greenville Saturday.
	
	I am glad you have bought clothes for yourself & take great pride in seeing you look well.  I am taken for a Miss in King st. by the Store keepers.  I am thought to be sixteen, so I wish you to look as if you were 30, & not be taken for my father any more.  

	A change does great good.  I will enjoy my home & have enjoyed myself here, & long to see Hext.  If you would get business I would like you to live in Charleston, but you seem wedded to Greenville.  Susan�s troubles have made me dislike Greenville.  I would be glad to go to some other place.

	I will price Clara here, & look at groceries, but hope you will be here with me to purchase them.  I am very near Klin�s.  This morning Anna & myself walked up to see Aunt Susan Hayne.  She invited us to dine Friday, but I am engaged to Aunt Anna Turnbull.  Uncle Arthur lives handsomely.  So does Aunt Mary McCall. & Aunt Emily, & all my relations live comfortably.  Aunt Anna Turnbull could live handsomely, but she is too economical.  

	Mrs. Bull comes down tomorrow[,] stays a day & then goes to Columbia.  After that Aunt Anna says I must stay with her, but I will be gone.

After dinner.  I have just sent to the office & received no letter.  Perhaps the Cars have not come.  While at dinner I received an invitation from Miss Drayton to take tea there tomorrow to meet Mrs. Ford her sister.  She invited you also, if you were here.  I have accepted it.  Will dine at Aunt Anna�s & take tea there this afternoon.  I am going to visit tomorrow.  I am going to shop before I dine out, so you see I have my hands full.  For S�day as yet I have no engagement, but dare say I will have.  Eloisa Martin invited me to stay with her, but has not invited me to tea or dinner.  Her health is bad perhaps is the reason.  Mrs. John Cunningham has been to see me but I was out.  I do not feel at all fatigued, never felt better, so you must not be uneasy.  Just suit yourself about coming down, perhaps by the beginning of next week you will get through your business & can come.

	I will now close & write to Susan.  All I say is I would rather stay here than in Columbia, & hope you can come for me.  Come down Sunday, stay a few days, & return about Wednesday or Thursday.  You had better go to the Charleston Hotel as soon as you arrive, record your name, so your friends may know you are here & then leave word you are coming to Mrs. D� M� home.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have only time to say we are well, & the weather today so cool that you need not be uneasy at thinking we will find it hot.  I did not hear from you yesterday, so do not know whether you are coming today or not.  I hope it will suit you to come down a little later.  Write me.  I have not got through my business yet.  This morning will do some of it, but cant get through all.  I paid visits yesterday, am engaged Monday to take tea with my old friend Maud Heyward.  Last night I took tea at Miss Draytons.  It was quite a party.  Tonight I take tea at Eloisa Martins.  I am not fatiguing myself.  Yesterday I got a letter from Susan.  They were well.  I have now to stop for breakfast.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

	I saw Uncle Arthur last night.  He says I must tell you, you must come for me.  That it will be very ungallant if you do not, & he is very anxious to see you, so are all of our friends, & as it will delay you only a few days longer.  After you have finished your business you must come for me.  If there is no danger you might take the night train.  I wish to go back only with you.  I don�t care to go with anyone else.  

	I will telegraph you today to know if you cannot after you have finished, come after you receive this letter as I will not have time to hear by the Mail.  Immediately telegraph me & tell me you are coming, so I may not pack tonight.  You will get back in time for Dr. Croft, Saturday evening at�we can reach Greenville, or Sunday.  I dare say you can leave Columbia Wednesday.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Uncle Arthur says he calls you a brave gentlemen has a very high opinion of you.

My dear husband

	I received at dinner your letter by Mr. Vandiver.  I am too sorry I did not see you yourself.  I cannot consent that you should not come down.  Instead of my going up Tuesday, I wish you to come down here Tuesday, stay Wednesday, & reach home Friday, & that will be exactly the 3 weeks I expected to be away.  I am very anxious to see the children, but I am equally anxious that my relations may see my noble husband so you must come if only for the day.  You will get this letter Sunday.  Write by return Mail so I may hear Monday 2 oclock that you are coming for me.  My visit will end so much more delightfully, if you come down & carry me up, & you will be delayed only a little�.  An old gentleman in this house Mr. Colbrun, is a good Union man, subscribes�your paper from the�Mr. Pettigru went to him, & he would be so glad to see you, so will Uncle Arthur, Aunt Hayne & all.  My friends have been very kind.  Mrs. Tom Lowndes sent to ask me to take tea tonight, but I was engaged to Eloisa..  Mrs. James Heyward asked me Monday.  Persons are just beginning to find out I am here, but I do not mind all this, except I want you to come, that my friends may see you.  If you cannot possibly come, I will go up Tuesday�is that I wish my friends to see you.  You are so near, & you will be delayed only two days longer from Greenville, so write me by Mondays Mail that you will come, that you will have the pleasure of coming here, & carrying me up which I prefer to Mr. Vandiver.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

 You will be only two days longer from home.

My dear husband

	I took tea last night at Eloisa�s.  Mr. Martin says on Monday he will through the Telegraph learn from you whether you can come down Tuesday to escort me up to Columbia, or whether I must leave here Tuesday, to meet you in Columbia.  I hope you can come for me.  It will be only two days longer from home. We will get there Friday night instead of Wednesday night.  If possible you must come down, but if you say it is entirely impossible, I will of course go to you Tuesday, but my visit will end so much pleasanter if you come for me, that I feel convinced if you can, you will come.  I will keep this letter open until the Cars arrive; perhaps I may hear from you, though I think I heard the Post office was not open on Sunday.  At any rate I will send & see.

	Anna & myself are quite well.  Last night Mr. Lowndes invited us to tea.   Monday night Mr. James Heyward.  My friends have been very kind.  Mrs. Poinsett went up to Columbia Friday & Mrs. Bull yesterday.  Mr. Martin says Mr. Bellinger & W. DeSaussure gained the Felder Case, & get a fee of 15000 between them.  Mama Susan & Ann have given me such a long list of things to buy for them, that I am afraid Mama�s money & mine together wont be enough to pay for what I have got, & the China & my board & passage up, & buy all Mamma wants.  If it is not, I will leave the China unpaid for.  I will pay for it as far as the money goes.  I have bought some Table cloths, Towels, Matting one peice, Servants clothes childrens clothes, Cloth for pillow cases, foot�&c.  The China I suppose will be 50 dollars, & my board about 40 & the passage up so I believe, making 100 at once.  You promised me the interest of the Bank Stocks to provide for children servants &c.  As I have spent your money in that way. You shall have the interest this time.

	Tomorrow as soon as I hear through the Telegraph whether you can come or not, I will arrange my plans.  I will be glad to correspond in so novel a way.    
  	   
 	I am going to church this morning to St. Michaels with Aunt Anna Turnbull.  Before church Mr. Vandiver is to call, but I hope I am to go up with you instead of him.  

9 oclock.  Mr. Vandiver has just been here, & says he thinks on Tuesday you will be engaged in Court in Columbia & cannot come down that day.  If this is so, let me know.  Address your communication to Mr. Martin, as I might not be at the Hotel when it is sent.  Mr. Martin will be sure to receive it & bring it to me.  If you cannot come Tuesday & prefer my going to Columbia that day, of course I will go, but I hope you will finish your business & then come.  It will delay you only a few days longer.  You will have plenty of time to attend to Dr. Crofts business before Equity Court sits.    Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Thursday morning before breakfast, [Maty 1853]
[Charleston]

My dear husband

	I write on the only paper I have to say that I dined at Aunt Anna Turnbull�s yesterday, & she was very affectionate, & said I might stay with her before I left, that she was expecting Mrs. Bull now, but when she left I must go, or at any rate, she must find room for me, so if you do not come as soon as you expected, I dare say I will stay with Aunt Anna next week.  I did her injustice, so wish to correct my error in saying, I liked her less than any other relations.  I took a long ride with her yesterday.  Today I am to dine with Aunt Eloisa.  I am quite comfortable, & except the fatigue, I feel at [page torn] might from the walking up King st.  I am quite sure today I will buy paper.  The Biship is to be voted for today. When your business is all finished, come for me.  I am going now to breakfast.  I will get also some stamps today from Wm Ed.

	I hope you are well & happy.  As I am so near you, you ought to feel happier than usual, when from home.

	My next letter shall be longer.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

2 oclock.  I have just received your letter enclosing Susans.  I am now going to Aunt Eliza�s, & have just returned from shopping & bought paper & envelopes.

My dear husband

	If you think your business will not come on for some time yet, & that I will be detained in Columbia several days suppose you let me stay here a few days longer, as I prefer being here to Columbia, & I will be very much hurried  to get through by Tuesday.  Cannot you come down Monday  stay Tuesday & Wednesday & go back Thursday.  Tell them not to call your cases until you return.  [I] would like to be here until the middle of next week, so as to be able to finish my business & return my visits, but still I wish you to come for me.  It is perfectly safe here.  Everybody laughs at your thinking there is any danger.  Mr. Leary is very foolish.  I dare say you can ascertain by looking at the docket when your cases will be called, & make your arrangements accordingly.  

	Today I dine at Aunt Turnbulls, tonight take tea at Miss Draytons, tomorrow at Mrs. Martins.  I have to return visits & shop, & would be glad if it suited you to come down the middle of next week.  I wish you to stay a few days.  I never felt better.  I wish your cases would be called the first of the week & afterwards you come down.  If I am to stay either place, it had better be here, but I am not one to stay here longer than the middle of the week.  By that time I can get through but I wish you to come for me.  So now you know my wishes.  If possible you must make your movements correspond if possible.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
