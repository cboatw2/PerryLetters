Letter 110

Wednesday morning, 8 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just put Fanny asleep, & will embrace the opportunity while she is in the cradle to write to 
you.  Yesterday was the great Hog killing day.  I changed my mind about killing only half, & had all killed
 except one that is crippled & that Jim thought ought not to be killed.  He has turned it into the Stable
 yard; one we killed after you went, so that left 12 to be killed yesterday.  Today Charles is cutting them 
up & salting them & Delia & Minerva are drying the Lard.  Unfortunately, it is a delightful mild
 day, but Charles thinks it will turn cold again, & that there is no danger of the meat spoiling.  I was glad
 to have the hogs killed so as to save your Corn.  This morning was cloudy, & looked like rain.  It was the 
day Mr. Hooker was to have continued putting up the Fence, but as the weather seemed
 unfavorable, but he told Jim, he disliked throwing down the fence in such weather, so he had better haul wood, that he might not be interrupted.  When he did commence, since then, the weather has improved, but I hope it will continue so, & that he will begin tomorrow.  Mr. Elford sent yesterday to let me know he was going to Columbia, & would take anything to you, so I sent you your purse, that you might have an opportunity of showing it, it is so pretty, but recollect that you are not to use it.  It is to be reserved for Washington, & to hold the first money that you receive there.  I wrote to Pamela, to thank her, & to tell her she must still write the note she intended to have sent with it.  Mr. Croft says Mrs. B� was at Mrs. Cunninghams.  Mr. Croft soon goes to town, to wile away he says the loneliness of the Winter.  I told him he ought to bring a companion back with him, to wile away the Winter here.  He said he was afraid his case was hopeless.  So you see he regards children & grandchildren as nothing, for he could have his daughter & her children to pass the whole Winter here with him, but he is not satisfied, he wants a Wife; no one like a Wife.  Mrs. Pearsons children are sick at present, so she cannot go when Mr. Croft does.  In January one of her brothers will come for her.  She must have found it unpleasant with her husband in Florida, or I think she would have remained, where she would have a settled home.  In the last letter I wrote you, I gave you a good deal of advice on the Mexican War.  I have since come to the conclusion not to meddle with Politics, but leave you to act as you choose, though of course hearing as much of politics as I do, I must form an opinion, but I believe my opinion is as Judge Colcocks used to be of the roads; if you take one side I am always afraid you have taken the wrong side, & that the other side is the right one so I do not like you to be too obstinate on the side you have taken, & you must promise me to think of your own interest, even while you are acting conscientiously, & I will not advise you.  Aunt Eliza said in her last letter said Cousin Isaac was in Columbia, with what prospect she hardly knew.  Is he a Candidate for Attorney General, & does it come on in this Session.  If it does, & he is a Candidate, without wishing to advise you, you must vote for him on account of Aunt Eliza, who I esteem as one of the best of my friends & know she would be hurt, if you did not vote for Cousin Isaac.  I am anxious what has been done with Judge Richardson.  I  have nothing interesting at all to write you.  I have not been out for a long time, & owe almost everyone visits, so I have seen very few, & am so busy working, I am glad not to be interrupted.  Writing so often to you is a great interruption.  Mr. Buist did not go to Bachelors Retreat as he expected, on account of the unfavorable weather, so I had yesterday to write to Mrs. Duloc to tell her about it.  The bundle I will have to keep I expect a long time.  Willie & Anna are at school.  Anna sometimes lays the Supper Table entirely herself, & is very proud of it, so I told her I would tell you of it.  Frank says he does not want a dog knife, wants another kind of knife.  I am anxious to see my Brooch.  When will Mamma�s chair come?  & When will the Legislature adjourn?  The village seems very dull.  I am sure it is well our happiness is at Home, for there is nothing anywhere else to contribute to it.  If you are elected to Congress, the delight of writing, will be enough to compensate for all the pain experienced by the previous absence.  I have laid out very economical plans, if you do go, in your absence to hire out Minerva, Mary & Lindy.  Minerva will bring good wages as a Cook, & even when you return, to continue hiring out Mary & Lindy.  Charlotte could now do most of what Lindy does, & Delia is to learn to cook, & Eliza can help iron.  Edward can fix the house &c. &c.  It is such a monotonous life in Greenville.  I am glad for you to have a little variety.  Mrs. Butlers son George has come on to visit her.  I have not seen Mrs. Butler for a long time.  She said I must ride & see her, but the weather has been too cold, & now it is pleasant, Jim will be engaged.  Susan stopped here yesterday for a short time.  She seems well & I think more cheerful than she was.  Mamma was not well.  As I have literally nothing to write you[.]  I might as well stop now, & Fanny is crying for me.  She woke long ago, & Lindy has been holding her.  I hope to hear tonight.  Willie was so disappointed when I read to him what you wrote about Mr. Summer�s having no Dog to give him, that he had laid down on the rug, & cried; he thought Mr. Summer had treated him very badly, but do not mention this to Willie, as he does not like things told about him.  Your affectionate & obedient Wife, Liz
