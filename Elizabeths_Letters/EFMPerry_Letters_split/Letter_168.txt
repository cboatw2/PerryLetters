Letter 168

Thursday night, 5 December 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter this morning.  I carried Mamma to see Mrs. Senious, & on our way back stopped at the Post Office & saw a good many gentlemen there.  Butler Thompson came to the carri[a]ge & spoke to us.  He looks badly, his face thin & his eyes red.  If he were not a Son of Temperance, I would think he had been indulging freely.  He says he hardly thinks he will be able to move in all winter, the roads are so shockingly bad.  He says he is glad his father is married, & he knows his sister has good sense enough  to be reconciled too.  He thinks that in 6 months the Union party in this State will be in the ascendancy, that all the firey resolutions are introduced by young men of no influence, & I thoroughly agree with him, but since your letter I think differently, as you say it is a fixed & settled purpose among the Politicians to dissolve the Union.  I think now they will go on, & that things look very gloomy.  Mamma is uneasy, for fear her little income even, may suffer in the general desolation, that the bank questions will be disturbed.  What do you think, tell me, so I can relieve her.

		So Genl Whitner is at last elected Judge.  His wishes are at length gratified & how little did he deserve it, when he is not even a superior lawyer, but perseverance will gain anything, & ambition with it, & you are wanting certainly in the latter.  So you will never be, I am afraid more�than you are now, but I do hope you will try to be on the bench the first vacancy.  I am glad the children have dined at Mr. Taylors, for I would have felt very much provoked if they had not noticed them, & thought Mrs. Taylor wanting in every feeling of kindness & gratitude.  You must do as you think best about sending Frank home, but if he is behaving well, you had better keep him as a companion for Willie, who would be entirely dependent on you, if Frank leaves, & you will feel less at liberty to go where you please.  The next winter if nothing unforeseen occurs, I will go with you, & leave the children at home.  Mamma says she will come in & take care of them.  Susan is glad to hear of Mr. McBee.  He has not written once, since he left; it is out of his way to write.  In your next, if he has not left, tell what time he will set off.  Old Mrs. Turpin is dead.  I heard it today, so if Mr. Felder wishes the land, he will have to apply to some of the family.  The old Man has been ill some time.  Miss Lewis, if is said. Is to be married the 12th of this month tonight week. She & Mr. Campbell have made quick work of it, & will get acquainted after they are married.

		We went to see Mrs. Simons this morning.  She seems in good spirits.  She says next year their boarders will be entirely a new set.  I thought to myself she would always find that the case.  Mrs. Temple she says is an old Sharper, that she sent in such extravagant bills to the Music scholars.  Dr. Simons had to interfere, that for instruction books that would get at Mr. Rowands for 50 cts, she bought at that price & charged�scholars for the Music they took.  She would charge at 5 dollars worth, when they had only taken 2 dollars worth &c, so in this instance I suppose Dr. Simons for a�was not to blame. Mrs. Choice asked Mrs. Temple to stay with her for a few days, & she took up her abode, so Mrs. Simons says, but I think Mrs. Choice could have gotr rid of her if she needed it.  She ertainly must have liked her company.

		Anna wrote a letter last night to Willie, which I enclose.  I hope you will think she has improved in penmanship.  

		Mamma got lately a letter from Aunt Eliza.  She alludes to Politics.  She forgets we were at the North during the Nullification excitement & therefore had not our feelings enlisted then as she had, & most probably we would also, having but one side, & that we are at liberty now to think for ourselves, & she is so afraid Mamma will be influenced by you & think contrary to Uncle Robert�s old sentiments, who of course none of the family ought to be presumptuous enough to differ from, that she says, �I think of those who are gone, whose feelings & efforts would have been with us at this time, & by whose�& sentiments mine were formed.  Our leading men will find it hard  to restrain the people, for they are ready every where to peril every thing rather than submit to their oppressors & the evil must be met at some time.  I know not , nor can anyone now what this lessor with bring forth.�  This is her great wisdom.  I would like to ask her one question, if the South is so oppressed why not the other Southern States feel it besides South Carolina.  They are really insensible to the great oppression they are labouring under, & are obliged to be told of it by South Carolina, but I suppose the Patriotism of the South has been monopolized so by this State, there is none left for the others.  If you make a speech in favour of your resolutions, do make a noble effort, one that will carry conviction to every mind.  As you have espoused the unpopular side, you must sustain yourself by unanswerable arguments.  The minority are not even given credit for disinterestedness, which they certainly deserve, for they lose all hopes of advancement to honour & distinction, & gain only ill will.  I am sorry now Col. Preston was reelected to the College, as he has such Disunion sentiments.  Genl Thompson is about the only Nullifier that has changed, & I wish he had not, for he has injured the cause, & I expect after all his change is from an interested motive.  I am sorry he subscribed for the paper.  Mr. Jones is not of as much importance as he thinks.  I hope Mr. Duncan will never have confidence in him again.  He ought to have had sense enough to have known before this what he was.  I suppose he will comfort himself with the idea, that if he had run, he would have been elected.  There are some persons so conceited, nothing pulls down their vanity.  I suppose he thought the head of the ticket would aspire to anything.

		I hope you dined at Col. Hamptons, that Willie did not prevent your accepting invitations, as he did last Session.	  I wrote to Aunt Mary McCall to buy me a sack or Polled�warm for the winter.  It will not amount to even 10 dollars & the shawl you bought me is too thin for the coolest weather.  I expect to pay for it out of some of the money you left me & what Reuben makes for hauling wood, so you may not feel the effects of it, & it is the only thing I am going to get this winter.  I have 3 dollars now independent of what you gave me, & I hope to make more.  Charles brought me 1 dollar for building a chimney, & Reuben 2 dollars. I wrote Aunt Mary to send it by someone going to Columbia, but if she could find no one to take it, to send it on the Rail Road to the Depository in Columbia directed to you.  She will send it I suppose the beginning of next week.  From Monday you must look in the Newspaper. Where I believe all things sent to the Depository are advertised.  The names of the persons to whom the things are sent, I believe are always mentioned, so you must be on the look out from Monday & by the first opportunity send it to me, before you know if anyone can bring it but do not trust it , except by some person sent otherwise I am afraid  it might get lost.

		Mamma wants you to inquire for her the price of nice writing desks.  Mention the different kinds you see that are very nice & the prices from 3 to 5 dollars.  She wishes to buy one, & she wishes you to buy her some Clover& Blue Grass seed, enough to plant her lawn.  You must buy me nothing at all.  I am sorry you bought me the pen & pencil.  You know I have a pencil & I do not need a pen, & I would rather you have saved your money.  I wish the men would take it back.  Tell Willie & Frank to behave well & keep themselves neat & do credit to me.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
