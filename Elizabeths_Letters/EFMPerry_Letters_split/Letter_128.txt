Letter 128

Friday morning, 1 December 1848
Greenville

		I received your letter Wednesday night, & am glad in writing this time to have a letter to answer.  Your letter as usual gave me great pleasure.  You know they are my chief source of pleasure, in your absence.  I regret, as well as the Members, that you are not in the Legislature.  It is a place suited for you, & I feel now that your talents have no field for their usefulness.  You ought to have remained there at any rate, until the Electoral Bill was passed, for you have been its great Champion, & others will take the credit from you.  As regards the Presidency of the Bank, it is a subject too important for me, to give any advice on.  Your comprehensive mind, can judge better of that, than I can.  I never could like some wives try to influence my husband against his judgment, what will effect his whole life.  You know what your prospects are in Greenville.  I have often wished you could be, where there was more congenial society for you, minds on a footing with your own, & with whom you would have pleasant intercourse.  I regret this more than you do, but such an important step , as changing your residence & your business, I cannot say one word either way.  Mr. Hooker was here today.  He says, he heard a Charleston gentleman, say at the Mansion House, last night, that Mr. Elmore wished to be Judge, when Judge Richardson resigned.  I wish you could be Judge.  I have always wished it, & when there is a chance of your succeeding, you must try for it.  The upper country Members are in the majority, & they generally would vote for you, so I think your chance would be good.  If you had thought of it in time, I would like you to have been a Candidate for Attorney General.  Being from the Upper Country, you would have beat both of the other Candidates, & that would be an eligible office, worth removing to Charleston for I wish you to get some office or other, & I hope there is still a chance at any rate of your being a Member of Congress.  You were foully treated this time.  As you say it is doubtful who will be elected Attorney, it behooves the friends of each party to use their influence, so I hope for my sake, you will speak to your friends in behalf of Cousin Isaac.  I do not wish you to make strenuous exertions, but such friends as you can influence, speak quietly to.  He will lose all the Taylor Democrats & Whig votes I expect, having taken an active part on the other side.  I am sorry to hear Sarah Taylor is sick, but hope she is better now.  The box containing the Shrimps has arrived.  Aunt Brewton sent Willie a little Gold pencil case.  A few of our other friends sent presents to the children, & Shrimps to me.  I am glad to tell you, that my Gold Thimble is found.  Night before last, Lindy took the Candle out of the Candle Stick, to grease her face, & when she was putting the candle back, in the socket of the Candle Stick she found the thimble, almost concealed by grease.  I instantly conjectured, that Frank while at the stand, the night I missed it must have put it there, & that it was the spool that dropped & you picked it up the next morning.  So in the morning I asked Frank about it, & he says yes, he put the Thimble there.  Yesterday on removing the Fender to clean it, my large scissors was found.  So Mary is no longer implicated in those supposed thefts.  I hope now, my Che�, & other lost articles will come to light.  It was natural I should suspect her, when the morning after the Thimble was lost she stole an apple & a few days after a quarter of a dollar.  I believe none of us were glad to see Jim on his return.  We had got along so comfortably without him.  He is a worthless servant.  A plank has been off the carri[a]ge house a long time, & instead of mending it he let it remain, & in his absence someone got through   & took out a peice of leather.  The person knocked off another plank.  He yesterday was wearing the nice pantaloons you gave him, instead of keeping them for his dress pantaloons all winter.  I told him to take them off.  He said he had no others to put on.  I told him he must, & he then went & put on others, & I made Elizer make him a pair.  He seems to like to destroy his clothes, & every thing about him.  He has a bad temper & is at war with the whole world.  In contrast to him stands Reuben, who though I know is not perfection, yet he cant be worse than Jim, & must be better.  The day I wrote you he hauled two loads of wood for us.  He also hauled three loads for his mistress from beyond Mr. Brooks.  That was five loads in one day, & Jim scarcely hauls 3.  Jim took all day yesterday to clean the carri[a]ge & did not do the harness.  Today I told him to do that, but he is always so mysterious, he is never to be found.  Charles this morning cut wood, got his breakfast, & went to the farm before I was dressed.  He is so different from Jim.  Indeed there is no servant as bad as Jim & I would rather be without him even if you do not purchase Reuben.  I feel happier when he is away, even if I have to give up riding but I hope tonight, to get a letter saying you will buy Reuben.  His mistress & himself today I know are very anxious, for I think Mrs. Harrison is a kind mistress, & wishes for him to get a good owner, for she sells him to you for very little 500 dollars, the interest of which is 35.  I am sorry I did not beg you to buy him, but I was afraid to, for fear you might blame me.  As soon as Jim returned as�& worthless as ever, I was sorry I did not beg you.  If what Mrs. Harrison says is so, that you told her son James, you would give 500, I suppose there is no doubt, but what your answer will be in the affirmative.  Otherwise I believe on my own responsibility I will get him, for I am so much without you, I need a good man servant.  Your first large fees you must pay for him & secure it, so he will not be taken for Mrs. Harrisons debts, & this I suppose you can do, as you did the farm.  If you will not buy him, then Charles must stay here, & Jim sold or hired out, & Charles learn to drive, or you get a buggy & drive me.  Jim knows you have thoughts of selling him & yet he does not do any better for it.  I hope my dear you will look at low Buggy�s with�, & let Jim carry your Buggy down for you, & see what you can get for it.  I am anxious you should have a nice Buggy with a cover.  You travel so much, you need a nice one, that will protect you from the rain.  I knew you would buy knives.  We would have done without large ones; small ones only we needed.  They could have been got cheaper in Charleston.  I am glad you bought clothes for you needed them.  The young�you do not need.  After being 11 years married, it is too late for that now, your habits cannot be changed, so change it for another book.  I wish �to the Married, & those contemplating marriage.�  Mrs. Cunningham wishes all females only to have it.  I am afraid the Brooches  are not very pretty, as they are as cheap.  I wished one as pretty as you got before.  If they are as pretty I will be satisfied, & as they are so reasonable would like you to get me another, to give to Ann & one of those you have got I will give to Susan.  Willie says get him a glass slate.  He is fond of drawing; bring Vardry a little present, as you are his Godfather, a trifle will do, just to show you think of him.  Thank you for the fruit.  I sent some to Susan, Ann, Mrs. Irvine & Miss Payne.  It rained yesterday all day, & is wet today.  Yours, E.F.P.
