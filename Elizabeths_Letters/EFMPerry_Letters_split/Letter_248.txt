Letter 248

Saturday night, 8 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have been busy all day & not able to write, but as no Mail leaves on Saturday, the Cars not running Sunday, it is no consequence my not having written today.  This letter will go tomorrow.  I send a letter every day except Saturday when no Mail goes.  This is the day you were to go to the island.  I hope you have had as pleasant weather as we have here.  It is like Spring but so warm, I am afraid it will rain soon.  You must give me an account of your experience.  I know you will enjoy it.

	I hope this evening you will have received my letter containing 40 dollars, 15 dollars of it is to pay your expenses home.  I will see from the next list Eliza sends me whether the remainder is enough to buy the things I have written for.

	There is no danger of the children seeing the toys before you return.  The roads are so bad, the box will not come for a long time.  It set off before the R[ail] Road was repaired, so had to come by way of Hamburg.  If it had set off now it would have come on the R[ail] Road to Laurens, & we would have got it sooner.  If I had known there would be such a delay, I would not have sent for so many things for myself & the children, & instead sent you the money to spend.  They will come so late, we could have done without some of the things this winter.  However I will have less to buy next winter.  I received a letter from you today.  I am always glad to hear from you.  You seem to be enjoying yourself as much as ever.  I would like to see Professor Anderson.  I wish you would get him to come here.

	You must thank Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna in my name for the books they have given you.  The Listener I think I read long ago.  I will be glad to read it again; the other book I will also like to read.

	I received today a letter from Aunt Mary McCall.  She says she has got me the black cape & had to pay 2 dollars, because the man said it was a disadvantage to change the cloaks.  The light cloak was 21 dollars.  The 2 dollars added to change it, makes the Cape 23 dollars.  Your cousin Eliza�s, you say was about 15 dollars, 8 dollars less than my Cape, so you can tell me which you think the best bargain, but I am glad to get something useful on any terms.  Aunt Mary said, the day she wrote, she intended carrying the Cape to Aunt Eliza�s.  I hope you will send it to me by the first opportunity, & Fanny�s Cloak also, by Mr. Jones or Butler Thompson, the first that returns.  I walked to your Grandmama�s this afternoon.  Willie went with me, & Reuben came for me in the carri[a]ge.  Your Aunt Annie begged me to say to your cousin Eliza that she wished all the Music she had sent, & in addition begged her to get �Nelly was a Lady,� set in a peice arranged in the prettiest way, so she writes all the Music charged to her 1 dollars worth she prefers taking it all.  It is well, for perhaps Mr. Bacon would prefer giving you peices of his own selection, but if you see any peices you would like to get, to learn after you return you can get them.

	All at your Grandmama�s were as well as usual, except Suzy.  She has had the Measles.  Alex & Vardry were there.  Clara is working for Susan & Ann.   � inquired particularly after you, & sends her treble love; all send their love.  I told � you had sent her a handkerchief.  I told Flora Hoke this morning that one was coming in the box for her.  You must get a handkerchief for each of Aunt Eliza�s women, like those you have sent, & you had better soon get the work box & give to Aunt Eliza.  Mr. John Hodges is dead.  He died of typhoid fever.  Your Papa saw him in Columbia & says he looked as well & healthy as possible.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is very sick.  I believe her lungs are affected.  I have not heard that it is so, but I know they were once, so suppose it is the case now.  I have not visited her for a long time, but as she is so sick I have some thoughts of riding tomorrow to see her, calling for your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy to go in the afternoon.  I hope Alston will name his son Robert after his father & the next one after himself.

	Lindy came home today.  The child has a cold, but I hope not the Measles.  I will let her go very often & help your Grandmama.  She can make ginger cake for her, & bread, & help in other ways.  Maria I hope will do well.  She has no child, which is an advantage.  I wish your Grandmama to have a good servant.  I did not think Lindy would do, for she is willing but not capable & efficient, & has rheumatism, so sometimes she can hardly walk, & has also to attend to her child.

	Mr. Randolph has moved into Col. Town[e]s house next door, & Col. Goodlett lives in Mr. Brooks house, where Mr. Randolph has moved from.  He is to keep a boarding house.  Col. Goodlett says Mr. Randolph left the house in such a condition, it required a hoe to scrape
the dirt from the floor.  It is well Aunt Eliza did not board with him last summer.  If she had, she would have been disgusted with Greenville.  It was fortunate she found rooms at Mrs. �.  Cornelia Ioor has sent me some Pecan nuts, by your Papa.  They are coming in a box from Columbia, but I do not know when they will reach here.  

	I am glad the ginger has proved useful.  I sent for a Jar for your Grandmama, & one for your Aunt 
.0Suzy, & one for myself.  These are my Christmas presents.  It is cheaper to buy ginger preserves, than to make preserves.  Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, & thank them for their kindness to you.  My love to Aunt Mary & Anna & all my friends.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry
