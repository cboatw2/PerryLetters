Letter 52

Monday morning.  The Sleet & Snow that fell yesterday is now melting, & I hope you are not detained in Columbia, but are now on your way to Charleston.  Such weather will give Willie a bad impression of traveling.  I do hope you will after this, have pleasant weather. Everything appears so much better when the sun is shining.  I hope the Judges will try your case, as soon as you are ready, & not disappoint you.  Anna says I must tell Willie, with her 25 cts to buy her a Cradle, large enough to put her baby in it.  You must write me everything.

Benjamin Perry
Charleston
