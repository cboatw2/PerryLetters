Letter 87

Saturday morning, 28 November 1846
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have heard from you but once, & this is the third letter I am writing to you, & I literally have no time to write.   I am now seated in the Dining room with my Aunts & the children who are playing about, & making a great noise.  Day before yesterday I dined at Aunt Brewtons, yesterday at Aunt Eliza�s, & today I dine at Aunt Emily�s.  I returned some of my visits yesterday, so what with visiting, Shopping & Dining out, I have no time to myself.  When Aunt Eliza thought I was to stay at the Hotel, she felt so sorry about it, that El� proposed to cousin Isaac that she should stay with him at once, & then I would have stayed with Aunt Eliza, but cousin Isaac received a letter from Richard Trapier saying he & his family were coming on, so on that account Elo� was obliged  to continue at Aunt Eliza�s.  They were glad I came to Aunt Anna�s instead of staying at the Hotel.  Aunt E� is so hospitable.  As you are the Chairman of Finance & Banks, I hope you will act as regards the Bank as the Upper Country people  wish.  I do not see your name as a Candidate for Judge.  Even though not a Candidate, you ought to have your name brought forward, for you have more right to it I am sure than Mr. Wardlaw of Edgefield.  I would rather you be a judge than anything.  I would have been delighted if you had been made President of the Senate.  My present plan is to leave here Monday week, go to Columbia & remain there Tuesday & Wednesday & then go on to Greenville & arrive there Friday.  By that time the Legislature will have sat nearly 3 weeks, so I will get home only a few days before you do.  I will write you again positively what day you must meet me at the Columbia Depository. & if you cannot afford for us to stay in Columbia, we will go on immediately to Greenville.  I am enjoying myself very much, & have been even more friendly treated by my friends, than I expected, but as I am staying with Aunt Anna, & not boarding, perhaps I had better not stay longer than Monday week.  I have been with her the two weeks, & may remain a day or two longer, but I will write you again positively what day to meet me at the cars.  If you can arrange any better plan for me than I have mentioned you must write me.  The children are quite well.  We have had some very cold weather, which I do not like at all.  I went yesterday to see Mrs. Dehon.  Mr. Trapier had some difficulty with his congregation about Confirmation.  They would not give up to him, so he sent in his resignation & they have accepted it.  He wished the old members who have been communing 20 & 30 years, & who have never been confirmed, to come forward now & have it done or he would not let them commune.  They thought it unnecessary to be confirmed at this late day, so would not consent, 20 or 30 years ago there was no Bin� in S. Carolina, so very few of the old members have been confirmed.  I am  going this morning to Klinck�s to select the Groceries.  I have not yet had a chance to do so.  I have had two dresses made up instead of one which I intended when you left.  My friends persuaded me to; thought I needed both, & wished me to look very fashionable.  My bonnet also I have been obliged to have done up, & some clothes made for Anna & Frank.  These things have taken the greatest part of my money, so that I am now quite straightened.  However I can get along, only I will not be able to carry as many presents back to Greenville as I hoped to, & would desire.  I feel grateful to you my dear husband for all your kindness to me & will try & return it by being a good wife & very economical when I go back.  All I ask of you is, to be very careful in your course in the Legislature, & do nothing to make yourself unpopular among your Constituents, & try to be a Judge�s wife, & you have as many claims to the bench as anyone else, only you must not be too modest & keep back but present your claims openly.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
I write in a great hurry, with a bad pen, & expecting Aunt Emily�s carri[a]ge every moment.  I have been able to write but once to Mamma so you must excuse this uninteresting letter.
