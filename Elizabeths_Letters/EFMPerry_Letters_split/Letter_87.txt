Letter 87

Wednesday morning, 1 December 1847
Greenville

My dear Husband

	Again am I seated at the desk to write to you, with literally nothing to write about, but that you may hear Friday night.  I must even make a letter out of nothing.  This first winter day is a bad one.  This morning early it was sleeting, & mow it is raining. So that Willie & Anna have been obliged to stay at home from School.  They have each said their lessons to me, , & Willie has been reading to me one of Miss Edgeworth�s good stories.  He has now stopped to eat with Anna & Frank Molasses & ice & bread  & I wish Until I have done writing, that they would be at School.  Lindy is holding Fanny, who is sucking a peice of Biscuit.  She looks so eagerly at the children when they are eating, that I give her a peice of biscuit , to make her think she is eating too.  Jim says Mr. Hoke says  he will kill hogs the first of next week.  This week would have been cold enough, but Jim says Charles & himself  would not have killed ours alone.  They would have been obliged to hire two hands, that it was best to wait for Mr. Hoke, & that the Hogs are so fat, they do not eat much corn.  He sold the skin of the steer at the Tan Yard for $1.05 he brought me the money.  Mr. Phillips has not brought the Meat to Mr. Goodlett�s that he intended to.  I sent to the Jail to inquire, & they sold it without bringing it here.  Our Beef will last a long time.  As Minerva wishes to make her clothes, I have Soup principally every day.  I have spent money in ways I did not expect when you left.  Some very nice Rice was brought, & as ours was just giving out, I bought between 3 & 4 bushels, more than enough to fill a barrel.  It was 2 dollars a bushel.  I let Mamma have a bushel, so that it left me not quite a barrel full.  The Servants needed more unbleached Homespun to make up underclothes so I was obliged to buy a peice of it.  Lindy needed shoes.  She had not had new ones this winter, & Minerva asked for another Homespun frock, having but one thick one, & she wished another for a change, so I gave her one.  When you went I put aside the greater part of the money you gave me, determining to spend very little, & what I saved reserve[d] for myself, with your permission, but these expenses, without my wishing it, have obliged me to draw on the Sum put aside.  I have been busy ever since you left, & still am, working for Lindy, Mary, Delia & the Children.  I make the Servants clothes much better than they do, that when I give them good clothes, it is a pity to have them spoiled by their�so I generally, even if I commence showing them how to do it, end by doing it myself.  They must learn to work from mending their clothes.  Yesterday morning I wrote to Mrs. Duloc, & in the afternoon, carried the letter, along with a package of articles she desired me to purchase, & some plants to Mr. Buist, to carry to her.  He is to go Friday, but if the weather continues as it is now, I should not think he could go.  There is to be a three days meeting of the Presbyterians at Bachelors Retreat.  Mr. Hillhouse is to be ordained.  I called for Mrs. Arthur to go with me.  When the weather is pleasant Mr. Arthur & herself to spend the day with me, & Mamma, Susan, & Ann.  Mamma & Susan Sunday stopped to see me.  Mamma said I must give her love to you.  I sent the letter you wrote to Willie, to her to read, & she said, it was a very pretty letter.  I have not seen Ann to tell her of Mr. Simms� interest in her.  I wish Mr. Simms was a single man, but I expect Ann would be shocked at my saying so, for conscientiously, I believe marrying never enters her thoughts, & it is only one who is respected by all, as ,well as herself, that she would every have thought of.  She has been particularly unwell lately, has had a Blister on, which has been very painful.  In one of your letters you mention.  In one of your letters you mention you had just seen Mr. the name that follows, I cannot make out, that he enquired after Mamma & myself, talked a great deal about Congress, & said Orr was a particular friend of his, & he had told him he ought not to have opposed you.  It is so provoking that you should have written the name so indistinctly.  I cannot tell who it is you are talking about.  In you next letter tell me who is was, & write the name, so I can read it. I merely looked over the Governor�s message, & I see he recommends taking a boundary line & defending it.  As from the character of the Mexicans, they will never make peace on our terms.  I should think this was the only plan to be adopted.  It seems useless to go on fighting them, for they do not mind defeat.  As useless as to punish Mary for stealing, she has no feeling whatever.  I believe if her hand were cut off she would not feel it, , so she must just be taken as she is, & not mind her faults, but overlook them.  So the same with the Mexicans, you must treat them differently from other nations.  Butler Thompson I expect is nearing home, I see a wagon going to Mr. Montgomery�s every now & then lately for furniture,  I went to see Mrs. Elias Earle after she had left not knowing she had gone.  Lately I have been glad to stay at home.  I have been expecting Miss [page torn] constantly, but am glad she has not come, for I have been (that Minerva may�) living plainly, & when you are away, I attend to the children, hear their lessons &c & company�  She borrowed when here last, �Washington & His Generals.�  She has not returned yet a book she borrowed when she staid with me when Mrs. Duloc was here, & has some she borrowed last summer.  I have even forgotten what they were except one �the Hungarian Tales,� Mrs. Gibbs gave me.  The others I believe were of the same nature.  I have heard of several engagements.  I believe I have not mentioned them, Eliza Earle to Mr. Breaker, & the Miss Juan who stays at Mr. Buists to Mr. Hearn Fountain Irvine, Emma Juan to Col. Irvine, Mary Long to Tom Crayton I have told you.  I do not know that any are true.  Take care of yourself my dear husband.  Frank still dreams of you.  I am so crowded between Frank & Fanny, I hardly sleep enough to dream.  Frank throws off the covering so & takes cold, that I am obliged to have him with me, to cover him,  Anna can�very prettily in different books.  I hope the Legislature with adjourn soon.  I hope also to hear from you tonight, & that today you are writing to me, so that I may hear Friday night.  I have written Pameta to thank her for your purse & the book.  E.F.P.
