Letter 268

Thursday morning before breakfast, [Maty 1853]
[Charleston]

My dear husband

	I write on the only paper I have to say that I dined at Aunt Anna Turnbull�s yesterday, & she was very affectionate, & said I might stay with her before I left, that she was expecting Mrs. Bull now, but when she left I must go, or at any rate, she must find room for me, so if you do not come as soon as you expected, I dare say I will stay with Aunt Anna next week.  I did her injustice, so wish to correct my error in saying, I liked her less than any other relations.  I took a long ride with her yesterday.  Today I am to dine with Aunt Eloisa.  I am quite comfortable, & except the fatigue, I feel at [page torn] might from the walking up King st.  I am quite sure today I will buy paper.  The Biship is to be voted for today. When your business is all finished, come for me.  I am going now to breakfast.  I will get also some stamps today from Wm Ed.

	I hope you are well & happy.  As I am so near you, you ought to feel happier than usual, when from home.

	My next letter shall be longer.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

2 oclock.  I have just received your letter enclosing Susans.  I am now going to Aunt Eliza�s, & have just returned from shopping & bought paper & envelopes.
