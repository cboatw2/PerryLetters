Letter 169

Saturday night, 7 December 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, & as usual was very much pleased to hear from you.  In the Courier that came today, I read a letter of Mr. Poinsetts.  I am delighted he is still for the Union.  That among the changes he is still the same.  How well he explains the position the State w� to assume, like a person throwing himself from a precipice with the expectation of hurting his enemy.  I sent it up tonight to Mr. Arthur to read, sent him word.  I knew he would like to read anything Mr. Poinsett wrote, & it was so good I could not keep it to myself.  He sent word he would be very glad to read it.  I carried it this afternoon to the Miss Andersons to read.  On the way I met Dr. Crook & told him I had just read a letter of Mr. Poinsett�s.  He asked on what subject.  I said the state of the times.  I wanted to add, that I was glad he was one who had remained firm, but I thought he would make me some pat answer, & the wind was blowing, & I had no time to argue.   I know he has changed thinking he is now in the majority & will be elected to the Legislature now, & while he as a Union man he was not.

		I do long for your paper to begin, to publish Mr. Poinsetts letter & other good things, that if the people would only see would prevent their going astray from the old Union way.  Old Mr. Miller was here today.  He took a Prospectus & says he is trying to make up a club, says he will certainly take the paper.  Mr. Pickerell had showed him your prospectus.  Do try & get a great many subscribers.  Do as much as you can for the paper, as you say in Greenville not many take a paper.  I am sorry you did not dine at Col. Hamptons.  You ought for once to have omitted going to the Board of Trustees.

		I cannot help feeling sorry for Mr. Burt, & after you told me he was defeated, felt glad when you told me, you had voted for him, & if you had not. & he had been beaten only by two votes, he would have felt that you were almost the cause of his defeat, that your vote might have influenced another vote, & elected him.  I dare say if he had been elected, I would have still felt vexed with him, but now I feel very sorry for him, with his large family, but he certainly in future ought to treat you better.  Frank is wise, he ought not to fast so long between dinner & breakfast.  He is right to take his lunch at ? past 1.  I hope he will get fat.  He is determined to take the worth of his board.  I am glad you have not sent him home.  He will run in the yard with John, & get ruined, & without him Willie would be lonely, & cling so to you, you could not go where you chose.  I am afraid he is a favorite with the Members.   The Ch�  Doll I expect may be for someone here, directed to me, but I do not know.  

		I am provoked you will buy so many books.  I wish several but do not get them, for fear you cannot afford it, but you buy any kind of books, you have such a�on the subject & your books are not suited for the children.  They are too deep, so in future divide the money in half, & let me select some  for myself.   I wish Mrs. Opie�s works, Mrs. Sherwood, Mrs. Howitt, Miss jewett�s Miss Bremer�s & many others.  I am saving as much as possible, to buy something warm to wear, & without any thought you lavish your money on books, half of which you do not read.  It is too provoking.

		When you come back you have Anna�s schooling to pay, which will be a very large bill.  You have butchers bills to pay.  Mr. Randolph sent in one of 5 dollars the other day.  I did not pay it.  You have Saddlers & Blacksmiths bills, Doctors bills 200 for the paper, Rail Installments 100 dollars to Mr. Rosemond.  Think of all this & wonder where the money is coming from & then perhaps you will be more prescient.  I will go with you next winter to keep your purse.

		It was just as well for you not to speak to Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.  They do not deserve it, for any attention they have ever paid you. Mrs. Taylor has slighted you always, & if I were to go to Columbia, I would take care to see very little of her myself.  When you speak on the Southern question, make a good speech, one that will do you credit. Filled with �table arguments that will settle the question at once.  Mr. Poinsett thinks the North has not augg�, even in prohibiting the Slave trade in the District of Columbia.  That is what I think.  I think there is no cause for a Southern Convention even.  Nothing has occurred as yet to call for one.  This State seems to think herself so important that it is really an honor for her to remain in the Union.  I see she is backing out.  The resolutions say, �South Carolina only remains at present in the Union, &c &c.  I feel vexed with the State, as I do with a person.  She is self conceited & vain & foolish, like one of your colleagues.  I think what Aunt Eliza wrote to Mamma about politics, was very�, knowing that you, who were so nearly connected with her, differed entirely from her.  She speaks as if of course her party was right.  I was so afraid she might think, my family always having been on the other side, that I felt mortified at your acting differently, that I wrote to Aunt Harriett McCall my views on the subject.  She has no politicians in her family, & I knew would sisters patient�, & I told her I approved of your course.  I agreed with you entirely, & if she heard anyone mention your name, to say I was with you heart & soul, & I was not ashamed of my sentiments.  I wrote her a long letter, & I wish she would show it to Aunt Eliza.  I do not wish her to think that I differ with you, & have any sympathy with her.  The North ought to make S. Carolina leave the Union, & be glad to get rid of her, important as she thinks herself.  Mr. Moses is really ready for War, talking of defending with swords, & appealing to the god of battle, & the almighty smiling on such a good cause.

		I want you to buy me some Hops in Columbia, or soon I will not be able to have bread.  Mamma & myself both wish some.  I do not see Mr. Thurston�s name mentioned as being admitted to practice Law.

		Old M� Turpin was buried yesterday afternoon in the midst of a hard rain.  The weather is now clear, the wind blowing, & it is getting cold.  Monday I hope we can kill hogs.  You must watch for my bundle, for I dare say it will be sent to the Depository, & send it to me the first chance.  A great many papers are sent now to you directed  to the Southern Baptist, some today from Louisville, the Washington Republican.  Thank Willie for his letters.  You will receive Anna�s tonight to him.  If I have anything more to add tomorrow    I will begin another sheet.  Mr. Arthur gave out, there would be service Fast day, but he had none.  I did not intend going.  E.F.P.
