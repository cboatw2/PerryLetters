Letter 267

Sunday morning, ? past 7 oclock, [May 1853]
[Charleston]

My dear husband

	I took tea last night at Eloisa�s.  Mr. Martin says on Monday he will through the Telegraph learn from you whether you can come down Tuesday to escort me up to Columbia, or whether I must leave here Tuesday, to meet you in Columbia.  I hope you can come for me.  It will be only two days longer from home. We will get there Friday night instead of Wednesday night.  If possible you must come down, but if you say it is entirely impossible, I will of course go to you Tuesday, but my visit will end so much pleasanter if you come for me, that I feel convinced if you can, you will come.  I will keep this letter open until the Cars arrive; perhaps I may hear from you, though I think I heard the Post office was not open on Sunday.  At any rate I will send & see.

	Anna & myself are quite well.  Last night Mr. Lowndes invited us to tea.   Monday night Mr. James Heyward.  My friends have been very kind.  Mrs. Poinsett went up to Columbia Friday & Mrs. Bull yesterday.  Mr. Martin says Mr. Bellinger & W. DeSaussure gained the Felder Case, & get a fee of 15000 between them.  Mama Susan & Ann have given me such a long list of things to buy for them, that I am afraid Mama�s money & mine together wont be enough to pay for what I have got, & the China & my board & passage up, & buy all Mamma wants.  If it is not, I will leave the China unpaid for.  I will pay for it as far as the money goes.  I have bought some Table cloths, Towels, Matting one peice, Servants clothes childrens clothes, Cloth for pillow cases, foot�&c.  The China I suppose will be 50 dollars, & my board about 40 & the passage up so I believe, making 100 at once.  You promised me the interest of the Bank Stocks to provide for children servants &c.  As I have spent your money in that way. You shall have the interest this time.

	Tomorrow as soon as I hear through the Telegraph whether you can come or not, I will arrange my plans.  I will be glad to correspond in so novel a way.    
  	   
 	I am going to church this morning to St. Michaels with Aunt Anna Turnbull.  Before church Mr. Vandiver is to call, but I hope I am to go up with you instead of him.  

9 oclock.  Mr. Vandiver has just been here, & says he thinks on Tuesday you will be engaged in Court in Columbia & cannot come down that day.  If this is so, let me know.  Address your communication to Mr. Martin, as I might not be at the Hotel when it is sent.  Mr. Martin will be sure to receive it & bring it to me.  If you cannot come Tuesday & prefer my going to Columbia that day, of course I will go, but I hope you will finish your business & then come.  It will delay you only a few days longer.  You will have plenty of time to attend to Dr. Crofts business before Equity Court sits.    Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
