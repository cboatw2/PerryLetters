Letter 40

Sunday night, 19 January 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I will write you a few lines tonight, as I am more at leisure than I will be tomorrow, & though I have nothing to write you about, I will be performing the promise I made you at parting.  I am seated upstairs in the chamber, which I prefer, on account of being with the children.  Anna is asleep in my bed.  Frank is going to sleep in Delia�s lap, Lindy is standing at the fire, drying some clothes for Frank.  The doors are locked, & will be opened in case James brings letters & papers from the office which I dare say he will forget to go for.
	After you & my darling Willie went off in the stage, I slept soundly until morning.  When I awoke, & recollected that my dear little boy was gone. & that I would not see his sweet face all day, or for many days, I felt as if my heart would burst, & all day I could not think of him without weeping.  I grieved for him as if he had been lost to me forever.  I did not know I would have missed him so much.  When he comes back, I think I will love & value him more than ever.  Yesterday I congratulated myself on the pleasant day you had for traveling, but this morning when I found it was sleeting, I was shocked.  How cold you must have found it today, & if the sleet has reached to Columbia, I am afraid you will not be able to continue your journey safely & comfortably, & that you will have good weather during your stay there.  I am sure you will pass your time agreeably & Willie too you must make him enjoy himself.  I long to hear of him, how he behaves, & if you find no difficulty in dressing him.  You must write me words what his friends think of him.  I am sure if you do justice to him, & see that his clothes are all put on properly, & arranged as I do, when he is with us, they cannot but be pleased with him, & as regards character & disposition, which is the most important, I think he is uncommon.  He appears even sweeter to me, now [that] he has left me, than when he was with me.  I will love him better when he comes back.  Anna repeated several times yesterday, that she wished to see Willie.  In the morning when Frank woke, I asked him where Willie was, & he got up & looked towards Willie�s bed, & now whenever I ask where Papa & Willie are, he slaps me & makes a vexed noise, as if to tell me to hush & not plague him.  Both Anna & himself I think give me rather less trouble than they did, though Anna teases Frank, almost as much as Willie teased her, but they are quieter, & I am able to pay more attention to two, than to three.  The weather being bad they have been constantly with me in the house, & I & they both feel the want of you to help caress them.  Anna constantly comes to me to take her in my lap, & as soon as she is seated, Frank comes & pulls her away, & takes her place, & then I am sure Anna misses you.  I tell her I held her when she was a baby, & now I must hold Frank while he is a baby.  They both sleep with me.  At night whenever Anna wakes, she says, �Ma put your hand on me�, she wishes to be certain I am near her.  Frank is quite well, you may tell our friends, that he is even handsomer than Will.  Anna�s colour is again returning.  You can give a pleasing account of her too, for I think she improves constantly, & is quite pretty, smart, & interesting.  I have nothing to write about so fill my letter with the children.  I have seen no one since you left, except Mr. Hendricks yesterday who brought some Corn.  I have received several messages from Mamma.  The bad weather prevented my going to church today.  I have been reading Do��s Rise & Progress, one of the Evangelical Library, which I see consists of valuable works, which I intend to read through, & hope you will read some of them to me.  

	I was yesterday looking over Miss Leslie�s House book, & reading about Carpets.  I observed she said, what I think true, that in buying a Carpet, the quality ought to be considered as well as the price, & that a cheap Carpet was often in the end the dearest.  This made me think of the Carpet you are to get, & I thought I would tell you, to get a Carpet of a good quality, that will last a long time, particularly for our dining room, which is used so much.  It will be cheaper in the end, than to buy a cheap thin one, which will last only a short time, & have to be replaced again.  Miss Leslie also said, that a Carpet that is to be much used, should have no white in it, for the white gets immediately soiled, & which gives the whole Carpet a shabby appearance.  This I think also true, & wish you to consider it, our Carpet.  I would like a dark Carpet, & bright colours, & good strong quality.  Our Entry carpet which we have had about a year only. I observe is torn in several places already.  As soon as you have bought the Carpet, you must forward it to Greenville, that I may make it up, , as the present one is threadbare, & great holes in it.  If the Carpet was not a large bundle, you might bring it up with you, though perhaps it would be dearer than by Hamburgh.

	I was looking at our Brown Sugar today, & see it will not be enough to last until Spring, so at the same time you are getting the few Groceries Mamma ordered, perhaps you had better get 60 pounds of Brown Sugar, at 6 cts which is the price at which we get it.  It would be $3.60 so much cheaper than in Greenville.  Perhaps you had also better get 3 loaves of Loaf Sugar, which would last until Spring.  3 loaves is what we get for the whole year, so 3 loaves would be sufficient, & cheaper than in Greenville.  12 ? cts is the price Porter has always asked.

	Since I commenced writing James has brought a letter containing a paper from Mark Lindsay, from Alabama, & the two Charleston papers.  The latest paper says it is thought Mr. Yancey & Clingman will certainly fight.  I suppose some papers tonight have brought definite news.  I see that your Presidential speech has been published in the Courier, as the Editor refers his readers to it.  I suppose it was published against his wishes.  I also am sorry to see Mr. James Rhett is elected.

	  I am sorry my dear husband to send you so uninteresting a letter, unless I have something particular to write about, I do not think I will write again, until I hear from you, so do not be uneasy if you do not hear.  Remember me to all of my friends, thank them for their kind remembrances to me & the children, & tell Aunt Harriett McCall , the children will value her quilt greatly, as I do now, & that I am having it quilted.  If she is in the country, & you do not see her, tell Aunt Martha or Aunt Anna Turnbull to tell her.  I am particular about it, as I believe she has never been thanked for it.  Kiss Willie for me, Lizzy

Monday morning.  The Sleet & Snow that fell yesterday is now melting, & I hope you are not detained in Columbia, but are now on your way to Charleston.  Such weather will give Willie a bad impression of traveling.  I do hope you will after this, have pleasant weather. Everything appears so much better when the sun is shining.  I hope the Judges will try your case, as soon as you are ready, & not disappoint you.  Anna says I must tell Willie, with her 25 cts to buy her a Cradle, large enough to put her baby in it.  You must write me everything.

Benjamin Perry
Charleston
