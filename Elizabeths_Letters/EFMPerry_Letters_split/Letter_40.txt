Letter 40

Sunday night, 24 November 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	Although tired as I generally am Sunday night, I will not go to bed until I have written you at least part of a letter, for I may not have time tomorrow to write you a whole one.  I will keep the letter open and add something tomorrow.  I have just been reading to Willy in the Sunday book lately given him, & trying to make  some good impressions on his mind, which if of no apparent benefit to him now, I hope at any rate in after years may be recurred to with benefit to himself.  You know Dr. Johnson says �except a man have received some early tincture of piety, he no more knows how to set about being religious, than a man who has never learned figures, can count when he has need of valuation� & I believe men who become religious, as well as great, generally give the credit of it, to their Mothers;  even Napoleon, ascribed his elevation to his Mother, so how important it is, for men when they marry, to think of their children & yet such a thing never enters their heads, certainly not the heads of great men, or they would have children more worthy of them.  I hope you with your good judgment, were not thoughtless on this point, but have been an exception to great men.

	I will tell you how I am now situated.  Anna is asleep in the cradle, Delia is putting Frank to sleep in her lap, Lindy is near her, & Willy is near them, telling them stories, & every now & then listening to one from Delia.  I am in the Rocking chair, one side of the chimney (with the desk before me, on the stand) writing to you.  When I first commenced, Willy was shaking the desk, & I threatened to tell you of it, but he begged me not to.  He dislikes very much that you should be told of his faults.  He thinks of his drum with great pleasure, & Anna tells persons you are going to bring her a baby, so I think that must be her present.  Frank is better.  The Pennyroyal has done him good.

	I will now write all that has occurred since you left, & yet nothing has occurred worth relating, but letters before have been written by very sensible people about nothing, so I will do the same.  Beau Brummel[l] has written some perfect specimens of this kind. 

	The morning after you left, I awoke with a headache from having lost so much sleep.  It went off however quite soon.  I spent the morning at home working.  In the afternoon, though very reluctant to use the carri[a]ge in such muddy streets, I rode around to see Mr. Yancey.  I took Willy & Frank with me, Anna I left asleep.  I saw Mr. Yancey as well as his wife.  They both look pretty much the same as they used to.  She very plain, he fatter & perhaps not quite as handsome as he was I asked him if he liked Alabama better than Greenville.  He said he was satisfied in Alabama, & would not move back now. But there had been times when he regretted ever having left.  He went this morning to Mr. Cunninghams, & says he will pass one day if he can in Columbia.  He says cousin Isaac Hayne is doing well, gets a fine practice, & makes money, that his reputation is high, & will in time be higher, that he would this year if he had wished it, been elected a Member of Congress.  He says cousin Isaac is often taken for him, that someone went to cousin Isaac�s office at Montgomery to see him on law business, saw cousin Isaac & called him Yancey.  I saw Miss Whitten, old Mr. Earle, Mr. Elias Earle, & a house full of children, & Mr. Jones also.  As I returned home, at V� I saw Susan.  I went in & most unexpectedly did some shopping.  I bought some servants clothes; nothing for myself but a toothbrush.  Susan remained with me until after supper, to see the torchlight procession.  I think it was pretty well for Greenville.  I dare say there wll be a glowing description of it in the Mountaineer.  They first�to have a meeting in Harley�s establishment, & speaking I suppose, for I heard clapping; then they marched out with their transparencies, & as they passed the Market house, took from a large fire burning there, their lighted torches.  They then went up the street as far I believe as Genl Thompsons.  They then turned & came back as far as Avenue at which they went up, & called I expect for Mr. Yancey.  Then they came down the st[reet] as far as Mr. Hortons, then turned & went as far as the Jail; in compliment I suppose of its being illuminated; then turned again & marched up the st[reet] on our side, & as they passed our house cried out �Hurrah for Perry a true Democrat &c.�.  They then crossed over, threw down their torchlights by the Market house, & then went into the building, out of which they had first come.  I suppose then they had a speech from Mr. Yancey, which to judge from the clapping, took well.  They had in the procession a few flags, & a dozen or more white boxes illuminated, with words painted on them, & all was accompanied by a band of Music, which was almost drowned by Hurraing, which latter I think was principally by the boys.   

	This morning I went to church & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Pinckney.  This afternoon I took a ride with Susan.  After supper I have read tonights Courier, & of course with deep interest the notice of your address.  All the Editor says is true, but he has not said enough.  He has not written as Mr. Yeadon would have done; the words talented & able would have been more appropriate than�& well written.  I think the letters you received [page torn] were more complimentary.  What a pity Mr. Yeadon should have left his port at such an important time; you must induce him to resume it again.  I also read Gov. Hammonds letter to the Jews & think it very good.

	As I know not what questions, yet will be brought before the Legislature, I will be obliged to [page torn] without giving you the benefit of my advice, except in a general way, vote with the upper country on every subject, & when your constituents are candidates vote for them.  One peice of advice or rather order I will give, & I know you will not object, as it comes within my proper sphere.  Do you furnish yourself with a watch immediately, if it cannot be procured, send to town for one.  Perhaps you had better go to town yourself for the purpose.  As a Senator I do not care for you to look so venerable as you do now; I would rather be taken for your wife which I am, than your daughter.  I have left no room to add anything tomorrow, so will close now.  I expect to pay visits tomorrow & will give an account of them in my next.  The roads are drying so I can use the carri[a]ge, which I did not today.  Susan says you must open the letter she gave you for Mr. Roper, so that you may know how much to pay Mr. Roper.  Near ten oclock, Good night, the children all asleep, & you too I expect.  Ever Yours, Liz

Benjamin Perry
Columbia
