Letter 43

Wednesday morning, 7 May 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	As I promised, I must write, but I am so busy I can hardly spare the time.  The whole family are well, except Minerva who is today sick in bed, with cold & pain in her stomach.  I have given her castor oil & Ginger tea.  Yesterday afternoon we had a delightful rain, & this morning Jim & James planted out cabbages & Tomatoes, & replanted seeds.  They have now gone to the farm, to make the Potato hills.  I have rode out once only since you left, Sunday afternoon.  The afternoons are generally so doubtful, that I am afraid to venture the carri[a]ge, not myself.  I am well enough to do a good days work.  I yesterday made a frock for Minerva, & a pr of pantaloons for James.  You may know how much work I must have, to require me to work so steadily & imagine how inconvenient it must be to me to write.  Monday, Jim carried wood to the Saw Mill.  Tuesday he hauled rock from Mr. Pikes.  He would have hauled the remainder today  if he had not been obliged to stop to plant.  Mr. Pike sent word, the rock was finished, & was in his way, that he would like it sent for.  The Miss Willifords, & Mrs. Perry Duncan have been to see me.  The latter heard I had been sick, & came to inquire after me.  I miss you greatly.  I often go in the drawing room with the children & look at your picture, which as it bears resemblance to you.  I regret it does not look more like you.  I ask Frank where Papa is, he points to the picture & wishes to shake hands with it.  When I go to town, if there is a good artist there I must have my likeness taken, for I am sure as long as it was in your possession, you could not forget me, even if I was gone, & you had so far forgotten me, as to have taken to yourself another in my place.  I would like it to be hung up somewhere, to recall to your mind now & then some of the happy days we have passed together, particularly our first wedded ones, but most especially would I wish it for the children.  I am sure as long as I have your picture before me, I could not forget you, or love anyone in your place, , or even if I were (impossible)  to love another, I would still love that picture, imperfect as it is.  Willy, the morning after you left when he woke up & found you gone, said bitterly, I told him you kissed him & bid him good bye, he said, you did not.  He seems really attached to you, & I think it would improve him to be more with you.  I hope his wish to be like you, will make him like you.  He last night took off his �coat & shirt in the way Pa took his off.  I think our children would be much better if they did not associate so much with young servants.  Our servants are too young to know how to behave themselves, or care to teach their children how to behave.  Old servants would injure them much less.  They would not be so trifling, or teach them so many bad things, but on the contrary assist in making them behave properly.  However I do not complain, we are obliged to have servants, but I am sorry associating with them is so injurious, & I wish them to make companions of them as little as possible.  My worriments now, are not servants, but War & my box.  I hope if Mr. Earle has gone to town you have requested him to bring it to Columbia.  If you can you must convey a message to Mr. Thompson�to beg him to send it to you by some opportunity, only one days journey from Charleston to Columbia.  It certainly could get there safely.  Last year you recollect writing to you at this time my theme was Texas & the election.  I feel much happier now for I am in hopes we will have no War, & that you will bring my box & what I wished then for you, you have attained.

	I have bought no flour, all the good flour like ours was sold.  Mr. Roberts had some not so good, but which I did not get, as Mamma could not have made eatable bread out of it, Hardly can with my good Flour.  It is so scarce I have been obliged to lend Mamma half of my barrel.  When we send for Groceries,  I expect we will have to send for Flour.  Mamma�s Groceries a few she sent for arrived last week, were only 5 days on the road.  That is the quickest way of getting anything from town. You have my list of purchases, so I need not mention them again.  In all probability you will not see Sarah Taylor, but if you were to tell her I ask her to send me some patterns of her childrens clothes, that I may see the fashions.  She has sent me patterns before, & I know she would have pretty ones.  Willy has outgrown his last years clothes, & I will have to make him a few for dress.

	No one has come to the house to inquire for you, & no letters came last Sundays mail.  Mr. Simpson sent you a large package of public documents.  My pen, paper, & ink are so bad I take no pleasure in writing.  I sent to your office for paper but there was none, & I thought it not worthwhile to buy for one letter, for I do not expect to write again.  Margaret will be here today & tomorrow.  I have a great deal of work on hand, particularly servants clothes, which I wish to do during your absence, that on your return I may have more time to devote to you, so if you do not hear again, you must not be uneasy.  You must if you get summer clothes, buy pretty ones.  Take care of yourself, & as the children say in their prayers, come back safe home. 

	I have told Willy he may carry my letter to the office, and Frank who is near me, says in his language, that he wishes to go too.  Anna is asleep.   She has called to me while writing to put her to sleep, & as I did not notice her, she lay down on the bed & went to sleep.  Willy went to the Sunday school last Sunday.  He was anxious to go, so I thought I would let him try it.  He was very much pleased.  Anna�s hand is almost well.  A poultice took out the inflammation.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
