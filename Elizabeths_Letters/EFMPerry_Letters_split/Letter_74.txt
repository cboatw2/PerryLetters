Letter 74

Wednesday morning, 2 December 1846
Charleston

My dear husband

	I wrote to you yesterday, but having a few moments to spare this morning, I will write again, for I expect you will not think you can hear too often.  It is before breakfast.  My Aunts have not come down yet.  Frank is upstairs with Delia, & Willie & Anna are playing about the room.  I have just been reading the Newspaper.  I see a bill has been introduced in the Senate by Mr. Manning appropriating 20000 dollars for the Volunteers.  You were one of that Committee.  I am certain your Clients will think you most extravagant, for 20,000 is too large a sum for that purpose; 5 or 10,000 would have been enough.  You must not be prodigal in spending the peoples money.  I see also a resolution has been introduced by Mr. Felder relating to the Bank.  I approve entirely of them, & recollect you said the bank ought to be divided.  I do not undertake to advise you on the subject, but I can give you a little information regarding it.  I went to see Mrs. Colcock yesterday, & speaking of Banks, she said, that her husband, though a President of the bank used to say, that Banks were a curse to the country.  I think Mr. Felder is right.  All the affairs of the Bank ought to be inquired into, who is indebted to it, & so on.  Mrs. Colcock says persons who borrow from the bank think they ought not to pay, because it is a bank, & if their property is sold to pay the debt, they get vexed.  You are Chairman of the Committee on Banks, so you must weigh well all these considerations & determine what to do.  I do not presume to advise you, but my instinct tells me Mr. Felders resolutions on will, & as womans instinct is worth a good deal.  There is nothing[page torn]present I know of  to benefit you with my counsel, so I will co�.  My situation has changed.  The children are now around me pressing me & making so much noise I will soon have to stop writing.  My Aunts also have come down, & breakfast will soon be ready.  Just after breakfast, I am going out.  So this is the only time I will have today to write.  I dined yesterday at Aunt Susan Haynes & spent a pleasant day.  In the evening Aunt Eliza & Eloisa & Sue came up & took tea with her.  Eliza dined there.  Tomorrow or the next day I dine at Aunt Eliza�s.  I have not yet determined what day to leave, but in all probability one day next week.  Cousin Isaac ought to have been in Columbia yesterday, but his wife is sick, & he does not know when he can go.  She is within 2 months of her confinement, & has been taken prematurely sick, & perhaps she may be confined shortly, so in this situation he cannot leave here.  I am sorry your bust is an ugly one, but I hope before it is finished, it will improve.  If you bust is a correct likeness, I will be glad you have had it taken, for your portrait is a poor one, but I do not admire busts, & have no wish to have mine taken.  A portrait of myself I would like to have taken very much.  I hope to hear soon from you, & must now close this letter.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
