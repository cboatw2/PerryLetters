Letter 94

Wednesday morning, 9 December 1846
Charleston

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you last night, in which you mention that Scarlet fever is prevailing in Columbia.  If you are uneasy about the children, I will pass immediately through Columbia, & to do so I must leave here Friday, so as to go in the Saturday stage to Greenville.  Frank has had the Scarlet fever, & yet the other children did not take it from him so that it is not always contagious, & if the children are kept in the house while I am in Columbia, I think they would be safe.  Still if you are uneasy, & write me by todays Mail, that you wish me to pass only the night of my arrival in Columbia, I will leave here Friday, & go on Saturday to Greenville.  So either Friday or Saturday evening I will be in Columbia.  It will depend on what I hear from you this evening.  So the election for Chancellor came off yesterday.  I expect this evening to hear of your defeat, but I cannot be surprised at it when, you say you did not mention even to the members that you were a Candidate.  You were wrong then & foolish too, for though you need not electioneer in an ungentlemanly way, still if you are a Candidate, you are justifiable  in using every honorable means for your election.  If you do not intend to try to succeed, you ought not to be a Candidate.  The world will only know of your defeat, & not know that you tried to be defeated.  Still another chance remains, the best chance you have ever had.  I hope you do not continue in the foolish notion that you are not to oppose Genl Whitner.  I don�t think either he or Col. Dawkins [are] fit to be Judges, & the Legislature will be doing injustice to the people to elect such.  Law business all say has diminished & that lawyers will never make what they have done.  It therefore behooves you to move earnestly to try & secure a way of providing for your family, so if you think you chance is better than Genl Whitners or Col. Dawkins, do try your chance.  My dear you have always acted wrong in preferring the interest of others to your own, constituted as this world is, no one can get along who does so.  If you do not try to advance yourself & family, no one else is going to.  You ought to have told all the Members you were a Candidate< & received their pledges, for you say they would have voted for you, if they had known of it in time, I am more & more provoked when I think of it, for perhaps this would have been a very good chance if you had only done as you ought to.  Mrs. Crawford says she is certain you will one day be a Judge.  So if unsuccessful now, when Chancellor Harper & Judge Richardson resign, you must get one of their places, & as it is such an advantage to be a Candidsate a long time ahead, you must present your claims now. & tell all them you are a Candidate for the next vacancy.  But I hope then to hear this week that you have beaten Genl Whitner & Mr. Dawkins.  I am prepared to hear this evening, that Mr. DeSaussure is elected.  I am provoked at the way you have acted, not even to mention you were a Candidate.  I think you carry your high notions a little too high.  You can never get along as long as you do so.  You could have been anything you pleased, if you had only acted wisely.  I have now seen all of my friends & relatives, spent all my money, & am willing to leave Charleston, so I do not care to remain longer than the time I have fixed upon.  If you write me, you think it safer not to remain in Columbia, then meet me at the Depository Friday evening, but if you say I may do as I choose, & remain two days then meet me Saturday evening.  I will go to Mrs. Lawtons today & if his goods are cheap, will get some servants clothes, & carry the bill to you.  Klinck sent his bill yesterday.  I was surprised when I saw the amount &356, but as I looked over it, I saw you had supplied yourself with Brandy, Wine, Champagne, Ale & Porter which added considerably to the amount.  The next year we can be very economical.  This year has been peculiarly expensive owing to two journeys.  This morning I am going to return 5 visits, then bid my different Aunts goodbye, then shop, & afterwards spend the day at Aunt Eliza�s.  We are all well.  You must learn from experience, & particularly in elections, you must do as others do, & electioneer for yourself as the others do for themselves.  No one will think the less of the person elected for the means he used to gain his election.  The world will only know he is elected, & honor him for it.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
