Letter 237

Tuesday morning, 10 oclock, 28 December [1852]

Dear Anna

	I have just received a very pleasant letter from you.  Your friends are very kind to you, & the enjoyment you now have, must last you a long time.  In looking back to it, you can experience it over again.  Uncle Arthur & Aunt Elizabeth are kind.  The presents I will like to see.  You must get your cousin Eliza or Susan either to show you or how to finish the Mit, or to finish it for you.  As unfinished they will be useless, & perhaps you can learn how to knit a purse with the ball of Silk.  I am glad you have seen H� Drayton.  You were right to speak to Miss Drayton, for she would have spoken to you if she had recognized you, & if you had not spoken, you would have missed seeing H�, who is a fine girl, & was kind to you in Greenville. & I am sure would have been very sorry not to have seen you.  Did you tell her the fate of the China doll? She bought? & dressed for you.

	Your dress I know is a pretty one, & you will find it useful.  You have remained so much longer in town than you expected, that your other dresses perhaps look shabby, so this new one is made just at the right time.  I am sorry you did not take down your other Flannel petticoat.  I will send you by your Papa a new Sun bonnet I have just made for Fanny, but it is large enough for you & send that blue silk apron I bought for myself at Cox & Gowers but have not worn.  Perhaps it may be useful to you, the few days you remain after you receive it  

	If Aunt Mary McCall could have returned me the money for my Cloak, I would have written to Eliza to get me one, as I need a cloak very much, but situated as I now am, with Aunt Mary�s cloak on hand, & not able to dispose of it. & having bought so many other things & a second bonnet I am not able to get another Cloak.  I hope Aunt Mary will be able to get the man to give me another Cloak this winter or next.  I am going to send it down to her.  When I first wrote to Eliza about another Cloak I thought I could dispose of the light one, but I have not been able to, so for the present I must hope Aunt Mary can do something with it.  

       I know I will like the bonnet Eliza has got.  I am glad the box was about to be sent when you wrote.  There are a few things I wished Mr. Elford to get, which his leaving town so soon, may have prevented his attending to.  If so, when your Papa goes down I will send a list not a long one, a dozen large & a dozen small knives without forks, for every day use, two peices of the cheapest Calico 4 or 5 cts a yd to make Comfortables,13 Stair case rods, are what Mr. Elford I expect has not got, & a Fender,�dogs, Shovel & Tongs, Broom & Bellows for the Dining room.  These things if your Papa cannot get, I will be glad for Eliza to, & I think she will be the best judge.  Send a list of all you have got since the last list sent.  My hair not being able to be made into chains, for a small one I wished made, for you to wear your Medallion with.  I think you need some kind of chain.  What kind would be suitable.  Ask Eliza, & what is the price, write me, so I can tell your Papa, & you can get one after he goes down.  I think the 12 ? cts chain must look very unsuitable.  A pair of India rubber shoes you must get.  One thing I wish to know is the price of a nest of baskets, beginning from the largest Market basket to the key basket.  Ask Eliza to let me know the price, so if I can get a nest I will send by your Papa for it.  Mr. Elford was to have inquired for me.

	You can work on your quilt when you return.  I am glad you practice regularly on the Piano.  I hope you will play better than when you left.  I am also thankful you do not forget to perform your religious duties, & that you have behaved so well as to gain the good opinion of your friends.  You must set a good example to the others when you return, & try to be a comfort to us & make us all happy by your good conduct.

	You are greatly indebted to Aunt Eliza as you may tell her, for it is through her kindness, you have been put in the way of receiving kindness from your other relations.  She so kindly invited you to visit her, which has given you so much enjoyment.  Willie is sorry now, he did not accept the invitation given him.  Now that he hears how pleasantly you have passed your time; he thought it would be like Columbia, where he has no acquaintances & soon gets tired of, for there he is the whole time among grown persons, his Papa�s associates. & such society improves him, so I am always well pleased to have him there.  Today Willie is not well, has a sore throat, which many are complaining of.  Mary has, & Edward & Mrs. Hoke.  Susan Hoke was here yesterday.  She said she is certain Augustus did not get her letter telling him to go & see you, & that he cannot know you are in town, or he certainly would go & see you.  It has rained almost constantly since you have been away & yesterday was the eighth day it rained without intermission, & today it is not raining, but is still cloudy & warm, & not like clearing.

	If you do not know what to buy for the servants, I can tell you.  Becky�s comb & a handkerchief apiece for the five women, two Bibles I am going to give to Reuben & Charles two of those you have bought, a Bible to Eliza, for Eliza & Lindy�s babies buy a little Worsted bonnet apiece for 25 cts, or 25 cts worth of Calico for the little servants any little thing, some Candy if you can think of nothing else.  One of the Bibles you have bought you can give to John Macbeth for the servants at Mamma�s, for Lucinda a handkerchief, for the little servants candy; Ninny a handkerchief or apron.

	Do not forget the Sugar dogs for Vardry & the others.  When I know all you have bought, I can then see whether I can get some books or not.  I hope to be able to, but having to pay for Groceries & Doctors & other bills, I cannot ask for money at this time to buy many things I would like.  It is such a good opportunity, your being in town.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & your cousins & thank them for taking such kind care of you.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna

	I have been disappointed today at not hearing from you, but I suppose you have been so much engaged shopping or seeing your friends, you were not able to write by this Mail.

	Mr. Elford went to his office today for the first time since he returned.  He told your Papa he left orders with his brother to give you any money you wished, so I hope his brother has given you some.  If he has not, you can immediately send to him & ask for whatever money Eliza needs to pay for the things she has bought for us.  I prefer her doing so to waiting until your Papa goes down, as I would like her to have the money at once.  I am glad to say that Mr. Elford bought all the things I requested him to, the Knives, Fender, Calico, & even the nest of Baskets, so I will not have to trouble your cousin Eliza to get them for me.  She has shopped so much already for me, I am unwilling to occupy her time in that way, more than I can help.

	It is reported the Cholera is in Charleston, but I hope it is a mistake.  If it were so, you would have mentioned it, & Augustus Hoke would have made it an excuse to come home.

	Willie took some pills last night, & feels better today.  He has gone to the Farm to haul wood.  Franks only amusement is to cut wood.  Fanny is trying to make herself useful.  She has been pulling Sage, then asked what next she should do.  I told her to move Hexts carri[a]ge out of the front walk, then pick up towels lying about the yard.  Hext has gone to the Mansion House to ask for a bill of some Hams we got there this Fall.	
       
	  Yesterday after I wrote the wind blew, & the Sun came out & the weather became fine, & continues so.  I hope it is the same with you, & that you will have pleasant weather the remainder of your stay in town.

	This afternoon if I can, I will go & see your Grandmama.  She is interested in all you write about, & pleased her friends have been so kind to you & that you are so affectionate in your remembrances of her, & forget no one at home.

	This visit to town is an Era in your Life.  I am sure you will never forget it, or the kindness of your friends.  I suppose you were surprised at finding how many relations you had there.  I hope you have dined with your Aunts in Meeting st.  I can imagine you spending a quiet, pleasant, improving day, seated in Aunt Mary�s chamber, working on your Quilt.  Are Mom Phillis & Minda still alive?

	Christmas has not been spent differently from any other time, except among the servants.  Mrs. Choices servants had dancing even in the day & a party takes place every evening I believe somewhere.  Even Becky last night asked to go to a Fair all the way at Mr. Goodletts.  I objected on account of the distance, for fear she would get sick. Baylis then came in to say he had procured a Buggy & intended to drive her there, & would come back soon, so I let her go.  Johnny came in for a ticket for Clara to go, said two gentlemen had come to escort her.  The two gentlemen were Genl Thompsons servants,  Tonight Dr. Irvines servants give a party, & Charlotte asked to go, & Clara wishes to have a Fair in this yard. 

	The Mauldins yesterday inquired of your Papa when you would return.  He met them in the streets.

	The Piano has not been opened (except by Mr. Wardell) since you left.  You must buy a few pretty peices of Music, simple enough for you to learn.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Sue, & beg them to write to me, & Eliza to send a list of her further purchases, my bonnet, Fannys &c.  I would like to see it, & a list of the Confectionary & toys.  I will open the box when it comes & take out the bonnet & such things, but the presents I will not take out or show the children until you return.  I hope the box will come soon.  The Rail Road being unfinished, our Groceries will come up by way of Hamburg.  The roads are so bad the freight by wagons is very high now, so we are sorry now we did not wait until Spring to get the Groceries, but often we cannot get even necessaries here, such as Rice & Salt.  At present no Salt can be got in the village.  Many persons have to keep the Hogs they have bought & feed them, until they can get Salt.  Genl Thompson is complaining of having to feed his hogs, on this account, says they are eating him out of everything.  It is near dinner time, so I must soon close.  I hope you spent a pleasant day with Miss Drayton.  In this fair weather it must be pleasant walking on the Battery.

	I hope to hear tomorrow from you.  Give my love to Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily, & Aunt Elizabeth, & my friends generally.

	I hope you will see Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha again.  I suppose you will not see Aunt Sarah & Aunt Harriet.  I am sorry you will not, & also Aunt Susan.  Thank Aunt Eliza & your cousins for their kindness to you, for which I feel very grateful, & believe me , Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. I hope your cousin Eliza received the letter containing 20 dollars I sent last week.
