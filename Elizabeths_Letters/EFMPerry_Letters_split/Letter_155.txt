Letter 155

Sunday night, 5 May [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I hope you are now safe in Columbia, & resting after your journey.  According to promise I must write & tell you all that has occurred  since the moment you left, but very little of importance have I to tell you.  Friday afternoon Mr. Richardson called & said he was just from the Mill, & Mr. Taft said your wheat only turned out 183 pounds, that I must send a bag to the Mill & get 17 pounds more.  I told him you said he was celebrated for good wheat.  He said what he had just brought was good.  That wheat you got, Mr. Taft said was not secured enough, that the wet weather had given him no chance of securing it, so from this I expect the Flour is not very good, & I observe the Biscuits look black & do not rise well.  I sent the bag & got the 17 pounds.
