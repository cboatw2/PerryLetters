Letter 247

Friday morning, 11 oclock, 7 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I received a letter from you this morning, & was very glad to hear, you are still enjoying yourself as much as ever.  The excursion to the island will be delightful, & I hope you will have as pleasant weather, as we now have.  Today is delightful, just like Spring.  You will find it quite a novelty to be on the water.  I am glad you passed a pleasant evening at Mrs. Cunninghams.  Before you leave, you must go & see her, & give my love to her. & ask when Pamela & Mrs. Cunningham are going to return from the North.  I believe they are still there, & tell Emma you have the cup & saucer she sent you.  It is now in the Drawing room.

	I sent you yesterday 40 dollars.  I directed the letter to Eliza, but the letter was written to you.  I hope you will receive the money safe.  You ought to get it tomorrow evening, after you return from the island.  As soon as you receive it, write & tell me, as I will be uneasy until I hear.

	If your Papa has the key to the Carpet bag, I will send it by Butler Thompson.  He goes Monday I believe.  Eliza mentioned your having bought a key for the bag, so If your Papa has not the key, I hope the one you have bought will answer.

	If you would buy some of the things I have written for, & send by John Jones & Butler Thompson, I will be very glad, for I need them, the Gaiter boots, Fanny�s cloak, the 12 ? cts Calico for my dress, the Mits, the lacets for Gaiters, & as much as they can bring.  My cloak & Fanny�s cloak at any rate I hope they can bring.  Having sent for so many things, I have not bought anything here, & am in want particularly of the Calico for the dress, but if inconvenient to get & send before you come, I can wait.  Your trunk will be so full that I expect you will be glad to send beforehand as many things as possible.  Mr. Elford was to have got 13 stair case rods, but he did not.  If they could be put in your trunk. I would write for them & send the measure, but I expect you would not have room. 

	I would like you soon to get the work box for Aunt Eliza.  Get Eliza to choose it for you, & also one for yourself, but they must be useful ones, such as will really be of use to hold thread, needles & everything used in work.  Make it a present to Aunt Eliza in your name, & tell her to always keep it to remember you by.  I think it a better present than a writing desk, but you can consult Eliza.

	I hope before this you have received the box with the Cloak, & the letter with the chain & pencil.  I am sorry I sent the petticoat & bonnet, your visit being lengthened, I thought you would need them, & sent then before you wrote word I must not.

	Willie & Frank went to Mrs. McBee�s yesterday afternoon & staid until late at night.  There were a great many children there.  The boys played in the yard, & the girls in a room.  Fanny has gone to school.  Hext is quite well.  I send you a peice of poetry on the death of Mr. Elford�s children.  I do not know who wrote it.  Show it to Aunt Eliza.  Your Grandmama & Aunt Suzy have just been here.  Your Aunt Suzy begs me to ask your cousin Eliza not to forget to buy her a bag she wrote for suitable to use at church & two alpacca  Aprons, such as your cousin Susan mentioned were worn.  They all send their love. & say they would write to you, but they have nothing to write about.

	I hope you will see Aunt Harriet before you leave, but I am afraid you will not, & perhaps not see Aunt Anna or Aunt Martha either.  I am glad you have seen Aunt Susan, & that Paul & his wife you may see, as they have returned.  This season of the year almost all who can go in the country, & many pass the whole winter there.    I am glad Eloisa has returned, & that you will become acquainted with her family.  Sarah also I hope you will see.

	Your cousins Cloaks I expect are very pretty, & more useful than the light one Aunt Mary got me.  The black cape I dare say is comfortable.  That will be its recommendation, & after this winter I will wear it in common, & as I will not next winter have to get either bonnet or dress, I can afford to get a handsome cloak.

	Mr. Smith the Jeweller sent me yesterday as a present a white velvet Emory.  I will give it to you, for your work box.  I mean to put in it & sharpen your needles.  Your Grandmama says, Lindy is not able to get through her work, so she is going to hire Maria who she had once before from Mrs. Pearson.  Lindy�s baby she thinks has the Measles.  I was very sorry to let Lindy go there, feeling certain the baby would take the Measles, & knowing Lindy would not suit, but situated as your Grandmama was, I felt compelled to oblige her, & run the risk of Measles, & now after all , Lindy as I supposed does not suit.  She will have to remain there until the child gets well, for if she returns Hext & Eliza�s baby will take it, & Dr. Crooks said I must not let Hext go near them.  Little Clarissa was just beginning to grow well & improve, & has been so delicate, the Measles will go hard with it.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & beg her to write to me, & tell me all about you, & give my love to Eliza & Susan, & beg them to write, & my love to Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna.  It must have been a release to Miss Elizabeth Lee to leave this world.  Mr. Mauldin is still in Columbia.

	Your Papa is a great deal better & would write to you, but as I write every day, there seems no necessity for him to.  I generally have some business to write about.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry
