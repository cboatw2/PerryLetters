Letter 193

Wednesday, 20 minutes of 2, 10 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

		I have just returned from Mrs. John Jones funeral & will write to you.  Genl Thompson it was thought would have returned last night, but he did not.  The funeral was at the Baptist church.  Mr. Hopkins preached a strange sermon for a funeral one.  It was on St. Paul, his belief in the gospel.  If you had not seen the Coffin, you would not have known it was over a corpse he was preaching.  It was a long sermon, & when he had finished it, for it was written, he closed the Bible, & made a few remarks on the character of the deceased, said she was perfectly resigned to die, & in her last moments said she was not afraid, only that she might not have patience to bear the lingering approach  of the dread monster, & begged her friends to improve her death, & prepare to follow her.  Mr. Tom Butler�s son William is dead, died last night, so Mrs. Whiteford Smith told me today.  Only one son is left & 3 daughters, & Mrs. Butler expects before long to be confined.  Mrs. Stone & some of her daughters were packed & ready to start to town when a servant being sick detained them.  Then the little boy was taken sick.  The servant got well, & the little boy died.  I know of no other sickness at present.

		Now that I think of it, do my dear husband when you return, take your seat in the safest Car.  So many Rail Road accidents are happening.  I think it dangerous traveling on the Road, & be careful also not to have your pocket picked of the little money you will have left.  I see in the last Patriot someone on taking his seat in the Cars leaving Charleston, had his pocket robbed containing 500 dollars.

		The children & myself received your letters last night & thank you for them.  They are very much pleased at the presents you have bought them, but I am not.  You must mean to make them sick with sugar plums.  I wish you would keep your money to buy necessaries we need, & to support your family, & pay your yearly bills.  So do not buy anything more for the children or myself.  I you really wish me to go to Columbia with you in the Spring, keep your money to pay any expenses, for I am afraid you will not have enough to carry me.

		Only one commission I will give you, & that is to buy me a Receipt book called �Miss Leslie�s 75 receipt book.�  By me two of them.  They are small books & do not cost much.  One of them I wish for Susan.  They are the best receipts published, so if you can get them, bring me two.  The hogs were killed yesterday.  It was so warm, we had no fire & windows up, & I disapproved entirely of having them killed, but today is rather cooler, & Charles says there is no danger of the Meat spoiling.  

		Mr. Foster sent a load of Corn today 8 barrels, so Willie says.  It came when I was away.

		You have before this received the letter in which I told you of Mr. Campbell�s impertinence, in sitting exactly in front of you.  I now seriously tell you, that unless you change your pew & take Mr. Poinsetts, I will give up the Episcopal church, for when I go to church I wish to feel pleased & composed, no disagreeable thoughts intruding themselves on my mind, & to have a person who I look upon as one of your greatest enemies, sitting exactly in front of me, so I cannot move my head, without having my thoughts disturbed by him, is out of the question, & I do not intend to put up with.  It is a peice of insolence we can render ineffective by outwitting.  He wishes to be just in front of you, that you may see him, & think of him, but he will find he is mistaken.  That your dignity is not  [to] be treated in that way by a vain, conceited creature.  Our pew is too near the Stove, which will be a good excuse for changing it, but I now say distinctly, that I give up our pew.  I am not going to occupy it again.  I read the peice of Newspaper you enclosed in your letter.  I was not pleased with it.  What it said in your favor, was so short of what you deserve, that I set no value on it, & I did not know there was such a bitter feeling against you, as the Writer states.  I thought Secession being dead, that you were looked upon with kindness, & did not know anything you proposed, would be opposed.  I hope this is not so.

		You ought to have spoken on the Convention bill, as it was of so much importance, you ought to have been able to say, that you did all you could to prevent its passing.  The older members ought to have spoken, &�left it to the younger.

		Mr. Hutson, as a boy, was a bragger & boaster & self conceited & insignificant.  My relations have been your enemies as well as ours, & my relations are the last persons I would apply to if in want. My relations I look upon as enemies, & it is they alone, that prevent my having any wish to visit Charleston.  I wish to go to New Haven, but I do not care to see Charleston.  Hext, Wilie & myself can go to Columbia with you next Spring, Willie to escort me about  when you are engaged.  Hext of necessity has to go with me.  

		I am glad you thought of Susan�s children in buying Sugar plumbs.  I am sorry for those children, & wish to give them something to show my regard.  Susan will be pleased at your remembering them.

		Frank cannot read your letter to him, but he knows what presents you have bought him, so he takes up the letter & begins, �my dear Frank, I have bought you some crackers, & a gold pen & some sugar plumbs,� & then he comes to a pause, then begins again.  Fanny is very much pleased with the Mouse, & her stomach full of sugar plumbs.

		I am going over this afternoon to help Mamma do some work.  We all long to see you.  Do not leave until the Legislature adjourns.

		I hope you do all you ought to do, & do not remain inactive, when you ought to be active.  

		You may tell Mr. Ashmore the Upper country is my home.  I go for it entirely & for the Upper country Candidates on all occasions.  I wish he had told you, the compliments the ladies paid you.  I hope Mr. Richards & the pupil are married now.  In haste, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
