Letter 253

Thursday morning, 13 January [1853]
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just received a long letter from you & must answer it immediately as the Stage goes now at 12 oclock.  There is one thing that I wish to get & that is a pattern for the side of an Ottoman.  Get it the length of the paper I send, & of the shape.  I have cut the paper, & one bunch of worsted like each colour in the pattern.  I have had broadcloth for you to work ottomans for your Grandmama, & this winter I would like to continue them at least.  I will teach you how to do the worsted work, & you must work a pincushion  for each friend who has shown you kindness, since you have been in town, tell them so.  I have plenty of Broadcloth & Canvass & some Worsted.  Also, buy one dozen worsted needles of different sizes, some of them very small, & you can commence when you return, & work them at your leisure.  You have made a pleasant visit.  I know you will need more money.  If I do not send what you need in time, if your Aunt advances it, I will immediately return it, as soon as I hear from you how much it is, but I much prefer your asking me for it, than getting it from anyone else.  So write & let me know what you need.  I am sorry Wm Ed had a pencil case.  Perhaps Eliza might think of something else for him, & be sure & buy the work box for Aunt Eliza, & a basket or something else for Eliza & Sue, & a handkerchief for each of the servants.

	I am glad you make yourself useful to your Aunt, & helped her fix the curtains.  I wish you would see Sarah Taylor, but if you leave before she comes, perhaps in Columbia you may have time to see her.  I am glad Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha you have seen again.  Tell them to write to me by you.  Bring as many letters as you can from our friends.  Let them know when you will leave, & beg them to write.  I suppose you have not seen K��s relations, Mary, Sarah & Edward though they are not I believe estimable characters,  Still if you could see them & tell K� you have, it would gratify her.

	I am glad Mr. Jones will return soon, & that he will bring some of the things.  I sent a letter enclosing the key yesterday to Mrs. Robinson & she had gone.  It is no consequence, for since I have heard Butler Thompson was only going as far as Columbia with them, so I will send the key in this letter.

	We all will be very glad to see you.  Mr. McKay & the oldest Miss Hayden teach the large girls; the youngest Miss Hayden teaches the small girls.  Fanny says they are not cross.  Mr. Thomas teaches Willie a great many more studies than Mr. Leary did.  He wishes Frank to learn Latin, but we prefer not.  He is too young.  You must take good care of the children at school.  Only two of the Brooks go to school.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & Mr. Hodges also.  Soon I must go & see Mrs. Mauldin & some others.  A Chinese ornament for 25 cts, or a little basket, or any little present, you can bring Mary Mauldin.

	Aunt Mary McCall today I heard from saying she had received the Check.  I hope she will receive safely 2 dollars I have since sent her.  

	Some pretty Calico get me for aprons for Fanny.  I would send you a 5 dollar bill at least in this letter, if it had not the key & paper in it, for I know you would be glad of it.  If I write tomorrow I will send it.  I hear from you regularly each day except Monday, when no Mail comes.  I am surprised you do not receive one letter each day from me, instead of so many at one time.  Your Papa says I write too often.  I suppose that you have heard that Genl Pierce�s only child has been killed on the R[ail] Road, how sad.

	I am glad you have some shells, & found it pleasant on the island.  It looks a good deal like rain again.  The roads will be worse than ever.

	Tell your Aunts you will work them a pincushion. & also Eliza & Susan.  I will help you.  I did wish you to buy some books, some of Miss Milfords & Mrs. Howitts works, but will have to put off for another time.  At the end of the year there are so many bills to pay, or I would have sent more money.  Another visit I will supply you better & not tell you to buy so many things for me.  

	I wrote to Eliza yesterday.  I do not know what our Eliza will name her baby.  Aunt Eliza has no name to�of her.  She is one of the worst servants I know of.  She has no principle, & I am afraid with such a Mother, her children will not have any.  They are corrupted from their infancy, & if it were not for Missy, who has been a faithful servant to Mamma, I would not feel it my duty to keep such a servant.

	Do not forget Becky�s comb.  She is not near as good a cook as Minerva, but she is a better servant, & makes all happier.  Minerva wishes to leave the Mansion House, says she is worked too hard, but she is always dissatisfied.
	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins, & my other Aunts.  I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick.  Let me know when to expect you.  Emily Earle & her sister go to the Academy.  It is the only female school now.

	Your Papa is quite well now.  It is no consequence when you see Augustus Hoke, & Mr. Smith must be wanting in steadiness to leave his business for such a trifling reason.  Hext is well; the other children at school.  Clara as soon as the new kitchen is finished is going to have a party or Fair.  I do not like to have such things in the yard, but disliked refusing, & if it is in the kitchen & not in the cellar, it will not distract us.  

	I hope to hear tomorrow, as soon as you have taken a list of the things you are to buy, that I have written in this letter, burn it. do not show it to anyone.  It is written so badly.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna
	  
	I send you my chain to wear with your Medallion,  I do not like little girls to dress too fine, but I think when you spend an evening out, the chain put round your neck twice, & the Medallion suspended to it, will look more suitable than the seven pence chain you bought in Columbia.  I do not think for such occasions it will look too fine.  The Chain your Papa gave to me before we were married, so I never expect to part with it.  Some time you can have a Daguerreotype likeness of your Papa & myself & a lock of our hair put in your Medallion.

	I send a gold pencil case which if your cousin William Edward has none, you may give to him, as a present from yourself, as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mother�s roof.  I bought it for myself, but it was too large for a lady, & I have never made use of it.  If he has a gold pencil case, this would be of no use to him, & I will think of something else for you to get, but if he has none, this he will find useful.

	The work box or writing desk for Aunt Eliza, & some present of value for your cousin[s] Eliza & Susan I will write you about before long, as soon as I hear from you about the one you are to get.  I hope to send this letter by Butler Thompson, but if I hear of any other safe opportunity sooner, I will not wait for him.
 
	If you get homesick, or anything occurs to make it inconvenient for you to be at your Aunts, write me word. & by that time I dare say your Papa will be well, & able to go down for you.  But your friends are so kind & you seem to be passing your time so pleasantly, I suppose you are not afraid of being homesick.  I hope this visit to town will improve your manners, & your character in every respect, & you will learn more than at school, even if you commenced the first day, as I had expected.  

	I have written a long letter to you today, so will now stop.  Your affectionate Mother, [E.F.P.]

Jany 1st.  I wish you many happy returns of this day and that each New Year may find you more improved in everything, that will increase your happiness here, & make you happy hereafter.
