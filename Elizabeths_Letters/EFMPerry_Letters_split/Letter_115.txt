Letter 115

Wednesday.  The sun is shining bright today.  Tomorrow I will commence working in the garden.  Today Mary is to scour your Office & the Library.  I have moved Willie�s Cot into the large room, so the Library now can be kept in order.  I hope you are well, & doing the best for yourself.  I have no doubt if you do all that ought to be done, & try as hard as your opponent you will be certainly elected.  If he is elected, it will be owing to your inactivity, inert� &c but I leave this affair in your hands. Hoping you will prosper in it.  I will write by someone going to Pickens.  This is a delightful day.  Mrs. Walker sent me word today that I must go to the W� Society, but I am too busy.
