Letter 191

Saturday, 12 oclock, 6 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received a letter from you last night, short as usual, but as I know you are busy, I will not complain.  It is a great satisfaction to hear every night.  I dare say it would surprise many old married couples to know how essential we find it to our comfort, to hear of each others welfare every day when once a week, or not at all would satisfy them, but I believe we are an exception to the general rule & our love increases, instead of diminishing.  I hope you will never find one to supply my place, & I do not think I would ever find one to supply yours.

		I am sorry you did not intend to take part in the discussion on the Convention bill.  You ought to have done what you could, & perhaps you could have said something to influence the vote, & then you would have written out your speech & published it, so the people would see it.  Your speech last winter, had not much influence in the Legislature, but when published  & read by those who did not hear it, it had its effect.  Whenever you can be of service by expressing your thoughts you ought not to remain silent.  Publish your Electoral Bill speech, & let the people read it, & they will think differently from the contemptible Politicians like Mr. Hutson, & in the end express their rights.

		I will tell Mr. Koch the terms of admittance into the Asylum when I next see him.  Susan says she hears he beats his Wife with his fist.

		I told Reuben this week to kill hogs, & he said they have not been up long enough in the pen, to make them fit to eat, that next week he would kill them.  The weather has been very suitable for killing hogs, & everybody seems to have killed.  We have not been in want of meat yet.  We have commenced today to use the Beef that was smoking & have [word faded] a little bacon & some Fowls.

		Last night I bought some Fodder from Mr. Fosters negro, 185 bundles, for $1.85 cts.  I was sorry to have to pay the money, for I need all I have to supply the family with clothes.  The clothing of a family of 19 comes to a great deal, a weight of responsibility rests on you.

		Mamma at present has a girl of Mrs. Pearsons.  She went to tea yesterday, & seems clever.  She is young & she said her wages were 6 dollars a month, but if she could not get that, they would be 5.  She looks not older than Mary, & has already been Mr. Crofts cook.  I hope Mamma can get her for 5,  It is so much better to have a servant without children, & if she does not get Mrs. Parsons servant, she knows of no other than Mr. John Town[e]s, who will have with her, a child or two.  Susan walked in this morning to shop a little & paid me a visit, but she told me no particular news that I could tell you.

		Willie is again hauling wood today.  He likes to drive the wagon very much & as exercise in this fine weather is good for him, I let him go with Reuben.  Little Annie is dining here, & Anna is busy with her, or she would write to you; perhaps she will tomorrow.  The �Cadet of Temperance� was sent here yesterday for the first time.  It is an interesting little paper.  If you have no objection I will let Willie subscribe for it.  You are entitled I suppose to it, being an Editor yourself, & as it is published in your Printing office, but as it will be an encouragement to them to have an additional subscriber, I thought I would send Willie�s name, with 50 cts.  You must notice �the Cadet of Temperance� in your paper.

		Mr. Foster I forgot to tell you will haul the Corn next week.  Our Corn has not given out yet.  Charles is still spading the garden.  We are all quite well.  I have no complaints.  I must soon stop, so I will as usual give you some advice.  I wish you to let no opportunity pass in the Legislature, when your opinion can be of service, that you do not express it.  Do what you can to benefit your Constituents.  There are not many Members from the Upper Country who are able to speak & be of service to the people, & from the lower Country there are always a plenty to stand up & encourage her in her encroachments.  So those few who are able to be of service & to speak in defense  of the Upper Country must do it, but you know your duty, & do not need me to tell you, so I must stop.

		Do not put yourself to any expense to bring presents  for the children.  They break & destroy everything so soon, & your expenses at home are so great, particularly now, provisions of every kind are high, that you must keep your money to support us.  Bring them some little things & bring the 2 pocket books & the Indian Shoes I mentioned.  Your true & faithful wife, E.F.P.
