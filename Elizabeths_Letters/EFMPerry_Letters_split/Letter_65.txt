Letter 65

Tuesday night, 2 December 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have been waiting near two hours for Willie to copy the postscript which you will see at the end of this letter.  It is his own composition as you will perceive.  I write at night, because in the day, I meet with so many interruptions.  In all probability I would seldom  be able to finish a letter before the Mail closed.  I have very little to write about.  Maria is still sick, but is better.  Jim says it is cold; that at one time she will wear Shoes stockings; & another time go barefooted; & that she is so headstrong, she will not mind him.  He went for her Grandmother to come & nurse her.  She said she would come.  I sent Lindy out yesterday to stay with her.  In a few days I suppose she will be well.  I think colds are prevalent.  March is better.  He went to the farm today.  Jim thinks he is of no account, even when well.  As long as he is so delicate, he had better stay at home & do the light work, & I will have more comfort in him as a Coachman than James.  James can stay at the farm; & under Charles & Jims superintendence he will do more work than he does here; & rid you of a great worriment.  It rained Sunday night & was thawing all yesterday; so Jim thought today he would be able to plant the oats.  He carried the seed to the farm, but the weather became so severely cold again, that the ground is frozen, & he has not been able to.  He will plant them as soon as the ground will admit of ploughing.  He & Charles say the wheat, rye & barley have come up beautifully.  The sows they turned out, & they went back with their pigs to Mr. Watson�s.  Jim went for them today.  He says he will make a pen for them outside the farm near Charles house, & let the pigs run about in the woods.  He & Charles both think when the Sows get fat they had better be killed.  For that they will continue going back to Mr. Watsons, & get lost or be stolen.  Charles says this was the case with some Mr. Rowland once bought, so you can think about it, & then determine.  This is the coldest weather I have almost ever felt.  I can do hardly anything but sit by the fire & warm myself.  Mr. Cleveland died this morning.  I have not been to Mamma�s since Friday.  I had the pleasure today of a visit from Mr. Luther.  Miss McBee sent Sunday night to know if I had heard from you, & how you & Pinckney were.  She thought of course you had mentioned him; so you had better in future say something about him; that I may be able to answer the inquiries of the family satisfactorily.  

	Have you not the least idea whether the Governor will pardon Mr. Wells.  I hope all those who promised to speak to him on the subject will not forget it.  You must do what you can.  I think Dr. Gibb[e]s has been quite attentive to you.  I do not know what is going on in the Legislature at this particular time. So will not be able to give you my usual quota of advice.  I hope you are sensible of your great loss.  I did not understand what you alluded to, in, �Mr. Calhoun�s course at the Memphis Convention.�  I have not read the proceedings of that meeting, nor Mr. Calhoun�s speech, knowing it would be very uninteresting.  Does the Legislature disapprove of his course?  I believe there is no news at all in Greenville except Mr. Clevelands death which I have mentioned.  I think the village looks very dull.  You ought to be thankful to be away at this dull season & enjoying the society of congenial spirits, a pleasure you so seldom have.  Yes my dear, I am thankful that sometimes you can associate with your equals.  Your letters give me great pleasure.  They are my comfort in your absence.  It is well they are not so few & far between as Mrs. Henry�s.  Suisan has not sent the box of cake yet that I mentioned to you.  She must soon or it will be stale.  The Miss Andersons have gone to Alabama.  They have a brother and sister in law living there, both in very bad health.  The brother wrote word that he did not think either his Wife or himself would live long, & if they died, wished his sisters to take charge of their only child, so they have gone on, to take the child if the parents die, & I suppose stay with them in the meantime.  I hope you will receive my letters more regularly.  I have written every Mail, & intend to unless I am absolutely prevented by business.  Ann has borne Susans marriage well.  Caroline Reinhardt stays with her a great deal, & she finds her a great comfort.  The children are well.  Willie was at Mammas last Sunday.  Mr. Ervin was there.  He took Willie on his knee, & said he was the best boy in school.  Frank talks sweetly.  Edward says Mr. Town[e]s is having the holes dug for the fence between our lots.  I am afraid he will dig the holes a little too near this way a few feet or so.  I expect that is the reason he is doing it while you are away.  A Museum & two English Reviews came last Mail, no letters, & no one has been to see you, but your black client & Mrs. Humphreys.  I have put down the old dining room carpet in my chamber, & it looks quite comfortable; at any rate feels so.  It is�in about 50 places.  If chance throws you in his way, or you can make the chance, you must become acquainted with my cousin Wm H. Heyward.  Uncle Arthur thinks him a remarkably fine young man, & his Mother Mrs. Keith is such an affectionate relative.  Mr. McBee told me he heard the state would take stock in the rail road, one third I believe.  You have doubtless seen many from Greenville before now.  Tom Butler, Wm Rowland, Mr. Elford , Genl Thompson & others, tell the two former & any other young men you see, to come back to attend the parties here.  Good night, Your attached wife, E.F.P.

Dear Papa I long to see you.  I want you to bring my knife & puppy.  I expect when you come back I will be far in my book.  Today Ma sent me & Anna & Frank in the piazza to bring in one log of wood.  Frank brought in one log, & I brought in an arm full & one log besides.  Lindy is gone to the farm to�Maria.  Mr. Erwin says I am the best boy in school.  Tell Mr. Summer howdye.  I hope you will come back safe.  Have you got your cake yet?  I hope you got it safe.  I hope you will get my letter safe.  Goodbye Papa.  Your affectionate son Willie.
