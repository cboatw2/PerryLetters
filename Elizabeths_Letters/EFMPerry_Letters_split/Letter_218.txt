Letter 218

Friday afternoon, 3 December 1852
Greenville

Dear Anna
	I received a letter from your Papa today, in which he mentions your having left that morning for Charleston.  That you went off in good spirits, & had enjoyed yourself very much in Columbia.  I have time now to write you only a short letter, my next one will be longer.  I was gratified to hear you had been a good girl & given your Papa no trouble.  He wrote word, you were as good a girl as he knew of.  I was sorry he bought you so useless & extravagant a present as a Medallion.  You have no chain to wear it with.  I will send you by Mr. Elford who goes down on Monday, some of my hair, that I have had a long time.  I kept it at a time when it came out very fast, to make a chain with.  You can use what is necessary to make a chain to go round your throat to wear your Medallion to, sometime.  I will have my likeness & your Papa�s taken & put it in the medallion, so it will then be valuable, more so than it is now.  Your Papa�s heart overflows so with love for his wife & children, that he would spend his last cent in gratifying even an extravagant wish of theirs particularly when he is absent from them.  He then loses his prudence, & his generosity gets the better of him.  Whatever you need in the way of clothes to make yourself neat & comfortable you must get it.  Cloak of some kind I wish you to have, a bonnet either of drab stram, or any pretty kind children of your age wear, perhaps another dress.  Shoes, gloves &c.  A Silver Comb will be useful not only to you, but also to Fanny when you are done with it. And your Earrings you can have bored & buy Earrings.  Your money I expect will not be enough.  Your Papa wrote that it was all the change he had, & you could draw on him for more.  When you have made your purchases, write me word, & then I will write for a few things for myself & the children.
