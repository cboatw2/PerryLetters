Letter 37

Sunday night, 8 December [1844]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter by Mr. Mauldin.  If you are not an abolitionist, you certainly act as if you were one, & I am surprised that you opposed to the whole Senate.  You certainly must be the wrong one.  You have already been called an abolitionist, & should be particularly careful how you act on that subject.  I believe by yourconduct now as regards Mr.  [Samuel] Hoar you have ruined yourself for life.  It will be a good tale to circulate about you.  You seem to be taking the part of the abolitionists.  I am really shocked at your conduct, & am ashamed my husband should act so.  It must have been for the sake of notoriety, for which I thought you had no desire.  You see if trouble does not come to you on account of this.  I only hope you will not mention it in the Mountaineer, so that it will not be known.  I had hopes that this session, you would act so circumspectly, that no fault would be found with you.  Abolition is such an exciting subject, that the least appearance of favoring it should be avoided, & your conduct seems to look like taking up for the Abolitionists, though in reality I suppose you do not, but I begin to suspect you myself.

.	I have tonight received a letter from Pamela, saying she hoped the death of Mr. Wm Ed[ward] Hayne would not prevent my visit; that I would be in no gayety; that they did not feel inclined for it themselves, & I must go to see old friends; that if I put off the visit for the Spring, she knew I would not be able to go.  She says I must tell you not to vote against Mr. Laurens, (who I see is elected).  I should think it probable you voted for Mr. Harl[e]ston.   Tonight you will receive a letter from me, saying if you object to my leaving home, I will not.  You were so severe to me in the first letter you wrote to me on that subject, that I really would not leave you with a light heart, & I thought it necessary to write again to say if you objected, I would not go.  I expect to receive your answer Wednesday night, & if you say, you are perfectly willing I shall go.  I will leave the next day, Thursday the 12th.  I will write you if I am not too busy twice again before I leave.  Wednesday before the Mail closes, & again Thursday before I start, & as soon as I get to Mrs. Cunninghams & will continue to write so that you may hear every Mail.  If I do not write, you must not be uneasy, but know that I have not the time.  You must write to me, for it would be pleasant to receive your letters at Mrs. Cunninghams, & write all the news, so that I may have something to tell them, which is always expected when one receives a letter.  I hope you will stop & spend Christmas there.  From your saying Jim must not leave home till the day before Christmas, you do not mean him to go to Laurens C.H. for you, but will let Mr. Cunningham & his buggy for you, which Pamela said he would do.  But you will give me particular directions in your next letter.  The weather is now cold enough to kill hogs, which Jim intends to do tomorrow.  So I am glad that will be over before I go.  He thinks if Mr. Goodlet[t] pays some Corn he owes, it will not be necessary to go for a load, but if necessary he will go.  I write, as if I were certainly going to Mrs. Cunninghams, because I do not believe you will object.  I received your letter by Mr. Butler yesterday, & a book, which I first thought was for your loving wife, until I saw your name in it.  It is a handsome book & I expect cost a great deal.  I was pleased at Mr. Butlers election; he very kindly offered his services to me during your absence.  Mr. Bee stopped for a few moments yesterday on his way to Pendleton, & said he left you well.  The Pendleton stage had not come this evening before, & he was going in Genl Thompsons buggy.  He is so kind hearted & affectionate, & so is Col. Keith , who I knew would inquire after us,  & his wife is a sweet lady.  Mamma has received a letter from both Mr. & Mrs. Roper.

	Mrs. Coleman says the Shaefer family are connected with hers.  Genl Haynes grandchildren will be connected with a good many families, who never dreamed of such an alliance.  If all his connections are as worthy & respectable as Mr. Elford & Mrs. Coleman, I will be glad.  Uncle Haynes death taking place at this time, has prevented our having an account of Mr. Sharpe from our friends.  I suppose they have not seen much of him , particularly about Aunt Eliza, whose opinion I would like to have heard.  She has such a good judgment.  Col. Bee says he is a fine young man.  I have just seen John.  He seemed pleased to hear of Thomas, says he was always a good boy.  I am quite well [and] so are the children.  Willy & Anna are remarkably well, & Frank begins to look better.  He is so affectionate.  He can say Ma, & is satisfied at night, if he is in my arms with his hand on my neck.  I must keep him as my bedfellow all winter.  Anna because she is in the bed with me, sleeps soundly all night.  Willy will have to accommodate you when you came back.  He says I must tell you he can read some stories without missing a word.  In their prayers, they beg that Pa may come back safe  home; sometimes Anna forgets It & she comes back & says �I forgot to say , bring Pa safe home�, & then kneels down & says it.  Today Willy was pla� her, & she said she was going to look for Pa�s horsewhip for me to whip him.  I think they are all fine children, & if it were not for their playing so much with servants, I could easily manage them.  You must when you return have a fence made to separate the yards, so that the servants may play in one, & my children in the other.  So much associations with servants only gives them low ideas & habits, which they will never be able to correct.  These early impressions are lasting, & having a small family & seeing no company, our children have not the advantage some others have.

	How disappointed Mr. Earle must be.  I am sorry for him, but he did not need an office.  Mamma received a letter from Aunt Eliza Friday night, the first she has received since Uncle Haynes death.  She says all of Mamma�s bonds are separate in a little tin box made for the purpose last year, that Mr. Hayne seemed to think Mamma�s business very simple to manage, & that Alston Hayne, who has the warm heart & noble nature of his father, will do anything in the way of business for her, that [page torn] him in preference to her son Wm Ed[ward], who is a minor & has not a moment to spare.  She says Mamma must advise with you & you communicate with Mr. Martin in Columbia.  Mamma does not know anything that she can do, & so leaves it to you, & if you find it not necessary  to go to town, you need not.  She mentions Uncle Haynes reason for going to Washington.  She says 2 years ago, Mr. Grayson the Collector, suggested to Mr. Hayne, that through the Southern delegation he should receive an appointment from the President in the Custom house; that Mr. Hayne would take no steps for the purpose, & therefore she herself wrote to Mr. Pickens who had always been a warm friend of the family, & to Mr. I[saac] E. Holmes, who had always been a particular friend of Uncle Wm & whose family she was intimate with.  Mr. Pickens made a personal application to the President, who said that the son of a Revolutionary Martyr, & the sister of one whose death had been a calamity to the common country, should certainly be provided for, & that an office should be given him in the Custom house, but Uncle Hayne with his usual benevolence, was not so selfish as to deprive anyone of an office on his account, but thought a vacancy would soon occur as there were 3 aged incumbents (one of them Uncle Perronneau).   In the simplicity of her heart, Aunt Eliza mentioned to Mr. Holmes the Presidents kindness.  She received a glowing letter from him, promising to do all he could &c.  2 months ago, Mr. H� died of Apoplexy, in the Custom house.  Mr. Hayne immediately walked round to Mr. Holmes, to know what measures to take & found he had gone to Washington.  The next day he heard for what purpose.  He was advised to go to Washington, & when he got there was overwhelmed with disappointment.  Mr. Tyler thought Mr. Hayne had been provided for.  Mr. Holmes represented to him that his brother had been deprived of office by Genl Jackson, & leaving it to be understood, that it was for that brother he wished the office, when it was for another.  Mr. Holmes knew Mr. Hayne was waiting to receive the first vacant office, & hurried on before even the letter announcing Mr. H�s death was written.  Mr. Barnwell as soon as he heard of the death of Mr. H� rode over from Georgetown to Washington to ask the appointment for Mr. Hayne, but arrived 2 hours after it had been given to Mr. Holmes.  The excitement disappointment &c. brought on what followed.  So far from Mr. Hayne having lost his mind as Mr. Pinckney told you.  Aunt Eliza says during his whole sickness, he was sensible, resigned affectionate, & spoke of us all, particularly Ann, & returned the pressure of her hands almost to the last.  Mr. Butler says Mr. Martin says he never witnessed such a death bed, that he was perfectly composed, looked at his watch, & mentioned the hour when he would die, he fainted, & when he recovered, he regretted his time had not come.  He had a good conscience & could well die peacefully.  Aunt Eliza says they will continue housekeeping, at any rate this year. 

        I tell you again, do not think of home, be sociable & affable, throw off your reserved familiarity, & then you will be happy in Columbia.  You must enjoy home when you have established a reputation for yourself, for while you are enjoying yourself at home, it will add to the enjoyment to think that your country thinks well of you.  You have the elements of greatness & must be a great man.  If your Wednesday night letter says you have no objection to my leaving home, I will go Thursday 12th so in future write to me every Mail if you can, at Mrs. Cunninghams.  What letters arrive here the postmaster can send to me there.  It is now 11 oclock.  Good night, Lizzy.  Monday.  Jim is killing the hogs now.  It is very cold.
