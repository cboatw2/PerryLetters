Letter 160

Tuesday [Wednesday] morning.  Last night Mrs. Blake was here, so I could not finish my letter.  She said she would stay at Mr. Crofts, if he would send her down in his carriage every evening, that the walk was too long in the hot sun & would fatigue her, & that she wished a room on an upper story.  The one they intended giving her, is on the first floor just back from the Drawing room; said she would write a note to him today, & tell him.    I will now send my letter to Col. Town[e]s.  I have not time to read it over.  Tell Frank this is his birth day, 7 years old.  If he behaves well while with you, I will on his return make him a present.  Reuben is going to the Farm today, though his knee hurts he can work.  

Write to me by someone returning before you do.  Yours truly, E.F.P.      		   

Benjamin Perry
