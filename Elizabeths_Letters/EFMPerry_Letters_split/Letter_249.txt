Letter 249

Dear Anna

	I received letters from your cousin Eliza & yourself yesterday.  Thank Eliza for hers, & as she says she will soon write again, beg her to, & I will write to her.  You have really passed your time pleasantly.  Your friends have been very kind to you.  I feel indebted to all of them, but more especially to your Aunt Eliza & her family.  Thanks Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna for the presents you say they have sent to the children, & thank Aunt Mary McCall for her presents.  She has been very kind.  I will send her the 2 dollars, she had to pay for changing the Cloak.  Your Aunt Suzy wishes to know the price of the black cape.  I do not know, as it cost me on account changing 23 dollars, so at Mr. Reed�s, inquire the price that I may tell Susan.  You say I had better send a list of the articles I wish purchased, so I will.  I have almost forgotten what I have written for, you can add what I have overlooked.  The work box for your Aunt & yourself you must first get, then what I have put on the list, & after that the Candy, cocoa nut cake & little presents you intended getting.  The 40 dollars I hope you have received, the 15 taken out for your expenses back leaves 25 dollars.  Eliza wrote word yesterday I must send 25, so I am glad you have exactly that sum.  It may not be enough, as I have written for knives, so if it is not let me know.  Tooth powder I cannot get here.  Be sure & bring 3 boxes of powdered Charcoal.  I used to get it 20 cts a box; not paste, but merely powdered Charcoal.  One of the boxes is for you.  If you have not got it yet, get it immediately & use, the two others bring home.  Sally Hoke came here this morning, & her teeth looked so black, it reminded me of telling you to attend to yours.  I suppose you have not needed any Sarsaparilla.  The Lacets for Gaiters though trifling is important,  for every morning now I am delayed trying to lace with a pin, & then have to give up, & wrap the lacet round the boot, the tins come off, & the tinners here put on such large ones, they will not go trough the holes.  I send a button for you to get one dozen like 18 ? cts.  Ask Aunt Mary McCall where she got it.  She did not send enough.  The Calico you sent in the box for your Aunt Annie, If it comes soon, I may take, if you are willing to make myself a dress to wear at home.  I need it very much, & your Aunt Annie has just had a worsted Gown made to wear at home. & bought a Calico one, & Clara is to make it for her.  I have made none to wear at home yet.  The two I have got, are what I sent patterns to you of.  The blue one is made & I wear to church, but if you prefer my not taking the Calico, you must say so.  I have written to Eliza to get me Calico for a dress, but it will be long before I get it, through I am very much afraid the box also will not be here soon.  

	After you have purchased my list, & sent me an account, if you remain long enough, I may write for a few more things, two nice pocket handkerchiefs, about 37 ?  apeice or the peice Susan, but cost 43 ?, & your Papa wishes Linen for shirts which I may write for.  Send up as many things as you can by private opportunities, Mr. Jones & Thompson.  I hope before this my cloak has arrived safely & that I will soon get the other one.  When the ginger gives out, if you would like it, you can get your Aunt another Jar.

	I am glad you have fine weather now.  At least I suppose you have, as we have now delightful weather like Spring.  Yesterday was cloudy & drizzly, so we did not go to church.  In the morning your Grandmama sent to ask how Mrs. Sam town[e]s was & she is very ill, & not able to see anyone.  Her lungs are affected, & she can scarcely speak.  The roads to her house are almost impassable. So we did not go to see her, but if she gets better we will go.  

	Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.  Tell her you write about others, & wish to hear from her about you.

	I hope the Cholera will not increase.  If it becomes alarming, I suppose Mary Crayton will immediately return, & you would come with her.  Let me know when you think she will return, if she will soon or not, if she will return this month.

	Willie & Frank commenced school today, both at the Academy.  Mr. Hillhouse teaches Frank, Mr. Thomas Willie.  Willie has come back already, & says Mr. Thomas, as yet has only two scholars, George Wells & himself.  He is to buy more books today, & go back again this afternoon.

	I will go to see Mrs. Mauldin, & ask when her daughters are going.  

	You say you saw pretty key baskets.  If you choose you can get one as a present to your Aunt Suzy or Annie or for yourself, or for me.  It will not come amiss.  If they are reasonable, but if you prefer it, get something else.  The�of baskets Mr. Elford has got me.  I may spare some of them to your Grandmama as presents.  I think he said he had got a nest, but I may be mistaken, for I thought he had got knives & rods which he has not.

	You must excuse my shabby looking letter.  I am busy & often write so hurriedly I am almost ashamed to send my letters.  You must take Aunt Eliza & Eliza as your examples for neat writing, not me.  My gold pen is bent, & writes badly, which is my excuse.  

	I will send the carpet bag key by Butler Thompson.  Mrs. Robinson sent word she was going Wednesday.  I suppose he will go with her.  I will write a few lines by him.  I will soon write to Eliza.  If you would like it, you can buy a pretty work basket apiece for your cousins Eliza & Susan, & not get any to bring home.  The nest of baskets will do for us.

	Give my kindest love to your Aunt & cousins & thank them for being so kind to you., & giving you so much pleasure, enough to think of & talk of a long time.  My love to my other friends.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry
