Letter 127

Monday morning, 27 November 1848
Greenville

My dear husband  

		According to promise I have taken my seat at the desk to write to you, & I must commence with the business part first.  Mrs. Harrison has just left here.  She came to ask if I knew if you would buy Reuben, that Reuben was anxious you should buy him, & though she would get a higher price for him, from others, she would be willing to sell him to you  for 500.  She says her son James saw you, as you were starting to Columbia, & asked you if you would buy Reuben, & you said yes, you would give 500 for him.  She begs you to write to me immediately, so that I may hear by this Friday�s Mail, for next week she is to leave for Florida, so you must be certain & let me hear Friday night, & immediately as I get the letter, I am to let her know.  She seems exceedingly anxious you should buy Reuben.  I know not what to advise you.  She speaks in the highest terms of Reuben, says she does not know his age exactly, that he is 30 certainly, how much more she does not know, that Dr. Harrison bought him when her daughter Mrs. Earle was a baby, to go to the Mill, & Mrs. Earle is nearly 26, that he was a little boy, that he is sober & industrious  & made her last summer 10 dollars a week, that Mr. Cox speaks highly of him &c. &c. &c.  Write me an answer by Fridays Mail.  I will now speak of other matters.  Fanny is a great deal better.  I have not given her any medicine.  I hope she will be quite well when you return.  The rest of the family are well except John who now has the Measles, & Delia who though complaining, is better.  She is able to hold Fanny & today is cooking while Mary & Minerva are at the Spring washing.  The weather cleared up so soon, I expect you are almost sorry you did not go down in your Buggy, but perhaps the first day you might have taken cold, so it is all for the best.  I hope you & Mr. Keith had a pleasant journey down.  I expect to hear from you by Jim.  Mrs. D� slept here Friday night, & � slept here last night & this morning went to Mrs. Service�s to prepare to start.  They were to stop to bid me goodbye, but they have not come yet, so I expect they will not leave today.  Mrs. D� had a pain in her face, which perhaps prevents her going.  The children & myself went to church yesterday morning, & Mr. Arthur preached a sermon on temperance, alluding to the Law lately passed by the Town Council, & said the community ought to sustain them.  Mrs. Tom Jones was at church.  As well as I could see, she was not remarkably pretty, looked very pale.  In the afternoon there was no service.  Mr. Arthur had a bad cold.  � the children & myself walked over to Susans house.  It is a very plain looking house, & seems built in the most economical manner, & ought to have had a chamber downstairs, which I think is essential in winter.  Mr. Hoke had a load of wood hauled Saturday for us.  It has all gone already, so Charles today has got one of Mamma�s horses & is hauling wood.  Jim cut up so little Sausage meat, that with the greatest economy, it has only lasted for 7 meals. & then we each had only two little ones, not enough to satisfy us.  I should think one hog, the trimmings from, would have furnished more meat than that.  A letter came last night from Walker & Bradford, saying they had forwarded a box to you.  It weighs a hundred pounds, the freight is 50 cts a hundred.  It is the box I suppose Aunt Eliza sent.  It will be here Friday.  A letter has come for you from Mr. Barclay who is now in Canada, patronized he says by the nobility & gentry & standing at the head of his profession.  He wrote to you for a friend who is writing a book on Indian traditions, & who wanted to know something of the Carri�, who lived in Georgia, & as you had interested yourself in Revolutionary Incidents, he thought you might be in possession of information relating  to the Indians, which might be of service to his friend.  His name is J.A. VanHeuvel, Ogdensberg, N.Y.  He was a classmate of Mr. Calhouns.  Another letter came from Mr. Berry & wished to know. If you would wish the Lumber that was at the Mill for Josiah, that Josiah had hauled off 88 cts worth more than he had paid for, & that if you needed the lumber he had, he would like for you to pay for it immediately, as he was closing his business & was going to Mississippi & that if it was not convenient to pay immediately for the lumber, he would rather keep it, that Josiah would have preferred getting it at Sh�s Mill which was in sight, but engaged it from him, thinking he would have finished it sooner.  I have no news to tell you.  The village seems very dull.  The weather is very cold.  I suppose you will wish the other hogs killed now.  You must write me by every Mail.  Your letters will be my chief pleasure in your absence.  I hope you will be able to get a new trial for Dr. Anderson.  You must speak to your friends in the Legislature for Cousin Isaac, Mr. Cannon, Col. Ware, Mr. Earle & others I am sure might be influenced by you, & do what you can for Wm Ed to retain the office of Inspector.  I am sure your speaking only to enemy would cause them to vote for Cousin Isaac, & you may with very little exertion do him good, for many would give their votes to the one who has first asked them for it, so you ought to have spoken long ago.  I am anxious Cousin Isaac should be elected, particularly for Aunt Eliza�s sake.  I have a bad pen to write with, & nothing to write about, which must be the excuse for this uninteresting letter.  When I hear from you, I will have�to write you, & I will try & get a better pen.  Anna went to school today.  I was reading a peice in the Spartan last night, which says children should not commence to learn until 7.  That those children who know the least at 12, prove in after life the smartest men, that Dr. Adam Clarke when a child was thought rather stupid, that it injures the brain to exercise it too much.  I intend Willie to write to you sometimes instead of me.  I have so much work to do, writing takes up too much time, particularly when I have nothing to write about.  

		I hope to hear certainly Friday your answer about Reuben.  Mrs. Harrison says until then, she will make no exertion to sell him.  She says Mr. Mooney offered her 6 dollars a month for him which would be 72 a year, but she does not wish to hire him out.  She seems very anxious you should buy him, says Col. Irvine would buy him  & give more than 500 but she prefers you having him, says she heard you were willing to give 550 but was advised by someone not to do it.  She says you told James before you started, that you would give 600 for Reuben.  I told her I had not heard you say anything before you left, that not hearing from her, I thought she had made other arrangements.  So my dear husband, in this instance I leave you to act as you think best, for fear that I might influence you, & then be blamed by you.  If she is correct, Reuben would be an invaluable servant, but you know we must make allowances for her representations.  She says she knows you would not sell him, you would be so much pleased with him.  I wish you could see Fanny now playing about the floor.  Our carpet is getting so old.  I am trying to save to buy one.  If I show you the 10 dollars when you return, you must let me get one either send town or get one at Mr. Nicols.  Now adieu my dear husband, recollect when I give advice, I always�you to consider it, but do as you think best.  Late events have made me lose some confidence in your judgment, & place more in mine.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
