Letter 233

Saturday morning, 18 December 1852
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just received a letter from you, & one from your Papa, the last one I will get from him for a long time, for he will reach home today.  Mr. Hoke has just sent me word, that he heard of his just having left the head of the R[ail] Road, which I was thankful to hear, as so many accidents now happen.  He comes home through Abbeville, passes Cokesbury where Mrs. Holmes lives, & was to sleep at Col. Wares last night.

	I must begin & tell you of the increases in the family which will surprise you.  Yesterday afternoon I rode over to Mamma�s, & as soon as I got back, the children came running to me, crying out, �Eliza has a baby, it is to be Hext�s maid,� & so it was.  Eliza has a girl, the baby is well, but Eliza last night was very ill.  She fainted, & was out of her head.  I went up to see her.  This morning she is better.

	Before I was out of bed this morning, Frank came running up saying �the Sow has five pigs.�  So I told him I would give each of you a pig, which you must each attend to, & when they grow up, you would sell them to your Papa.  

	Since you left two Cows have had Calves, so you see what an increase there has been in the family.  Willie & Frank will soon have to help your Papa support them.  We now have plenty of Milk & Cream.  Willie & Frank enjoy it, & have given up Tea & Coffee which I am glad of.  

	Your not coming back with your Papa will give us two pleasures.  We are now with pleasure expecting him, & afterwards we will have the pleasure of looking forward to your return.  Your Papa writes, he has directed you to get money from Mr. Elford if you need it.  Mr. Elford has money of his.  You can also tell your Cousin Eliza, that she can get money from Mr. Elford to pay for the things she buys for me.

	I know I will like your Cloak, & all you have bought.  I may before you leave write for a few more things.  I hope Eliza will have a pretty cloak made for Fanny.  I would like you to get the largest size box of Furniture  for Fanny.  I want her to have a baby house.  She gave you 2 dollars of hers.  If 150 the Furniture costs, with the 50 cts left, buy some other toy for the baby house.  I would like you to get a Bedstead for it, &   several other peices of Furniture also bring her that will be suitable for the baby house.  She is so fond of arranging things it will delight her to fix the house, & give her occupation, which we have to find for children to make them happy.

	I am glad you are making so pretty a quilt.  I wish you always to have one on hand.  Eliza said Worsted Quilts were pretty, & they must be very warm for winter & suit Greenville.  I wish you would get her to make one patch, buy several kinds of Worsted cloth, & you bring it up with you & make a quilt.  I am glad your Aunts think you behave well, & feel young again.  In being with you, interest in the young is what prevents persons feeling their age as they grow older, & it is wisely ordered.  So old age is not as sad as it otherwise would be.  We live over again in the young.  We are interested for them, as we once were for ourselves.  You must bring us any present you think proper.  I wish two pair of Mits to wear in the house & a neck ribbon to wear to church.  You may bring me these as presents.  For your Aunt Eliza�s present, ask your cousin Eliza what to get for her mother, & then ask Eliza what to get for Eliza & Sue.

	Mrs. Barnwell Rhett�s is a sad death, & she will be a great loss to her children.  Children require so the care of a Mother, that her loss is even greater than the Father.  

	Tell your Aunts Willie is not quite so ungallant as he was.  As he grows older he feels the value of the Fair Sex & pays them more respect.

	Tell Aunt Eliza, no change for the better takes place at your Grandmama, that Mammas situation is one of constant trial, & I wonder her mind & body have been able to bear it.  A living trouble like hers is worse than death.  She tries to be cheerful & to bear up, but it is hard not to despond.  Aunt Eliza must write to her & try & comfort her.  Her letters are consoling.  She must also send messages to Susan to tell her to bear up. & to Ann to acquiesce in what has happened.  You must bring your Grandmama & Aunts whatever present you choose, either something useful or pretty.  Buy for yourself a few peices of Music, easy enough for you to learn. I wish you could learn to Crochet.

	Since I commenced writing Aunt Mary McCall�s box has arrived. It stopped in Columbia & your Papa sent it on by the Stage.  Tell your cousin Eliza the bonnet is prettier & fancier than I expected.  It is a dark Straw with a feather, so I will be able to wear it to church, but it is not suitable for common occasions, so the one I wrote her to get, I will still be glad of, as I need one to wear on occasions that the other I would not wear the feather would look unsuitable, & it is very small.  Tell her the Cloak Aunt Mary has sent me is beautiful to look at, but not useful.  It is the lightest grey colour & so small, it cannot meet across the chest. So instead of the bonnet, the Cloak I must try & dispose of.  Ask her what a Cloak like the kind she is now making for herself would cost for me, the materials & the making it.  I like a dark Cloak that will not soil easily, for even our carri[a]ges here are not always clean.  I will get her to have a cloak made for me.  I am as tall as Eloisa, but much stouter across the chest particularly & back.  [E.F.P.]
