Letter 26

Sunday night, 4 December 1842
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter by Col. Townes, and read it with must pleasure.  I was disappointed at not hearing from you the last mail, but at the same time was pleased business should prevent you; for I knew that was the cause of your silence.  I am pleased that you have bought a gold pencil case for Susan.  I know she will be delighted with it, value it much, and be grateful at your attention.  I think I have heard her say she would like to have one.  Her two most valuable presents will have been given her by you, her gold thimble and gold pencil case.  You need not get one for me, another time when you can afford it better I would prefer it.

	Willy made me read over and over again what you said about his horse.  It is almost his constant theme of conversation.  His heart is set upon having one, so you must get it even at fourteen dollars.  I would rather him have his horse, than that you should bring anything for me.  Could you not box it up and send it in the stage now that it comes empty; or be on the lookout for a wagon; or make Mr. Cox bring it in his carri[a]ge.  What a pity you could not have sent it back in the empty carri[a]ge.  I would like you to bring Anna a doll, not costing much.

	I can never be reconciled to your not being a member of the Legislature.  I feel that you have lost much of your importance; and I too, since your resignation.  When so much intriguing and electioneering is going on, it shows what importance is attached to honours, and it distresses me that already your career in public life is run; and that you have quietly resigned all pretension to fame, honour, and distinction among your fellow men; and that for the remainder of your life, you are to pass only as a plodding Greenville Attorney.  I would willingly give up several hundred dollars to see your name mentioned in the paper, with honour and distinction as I used to and to read those interesting letters written by you for the Mountaineer & to know that you were a Legislator & did much credit to the position you occupied.  You must not forget to give Mr. Hayne the box from Susan.  I long to know the result of the election.  You ought to have written me if there was any chance in his favor.  Mrs. Martin I suppose is not in Columbia.  Mrs. Keith must be thankful to have Col. Keith a delegate to the Temperance Convention.  I suppose you did not see her.  She is a sweet lady.  You must let me enclose all of your briefs in future.  I pleases me to think I can be of some use to you in your business.  I am afraid Mr. Barnwell Rhett will be elected senator, and I would rather anyone than him.  He is too conceited already.  What an aspiring family they are.  I expect they will all be members of Congress.  One of them will wish to take the place of Mr. Barnwell Rhett as Representative.  Mr. Edmund and Mr. Albert the only ones we know have always been kind to us; particularly Mr. Albert who has been a true friend, and performed many acts of friendship.  He was an intimate friend of my brothers.  I would like to see him again very much. 

	Mamma thought you would know best whether George would be a good bargain.  She did not know whether the price asked for him was reasonable; and whether his age & drinking were an ins� objection.  She thought these things  you would judge of better than herself.  If I see her tomorrow, before I close this letter, I will tell her what you say & give you her answer.  She needs another man besides John to cut up wood & attend to the whole place, but she was uncertain if it was better to get George, or give a little more, for a younger & temperate man, & who would be useful for a longer time.  You ought to have written what you thought.

	I will send this letter by Mr. Duncan along with a spoon to be marked for Anna, which I forgot to give you.  He will stop at Maybin�s, & he offered to take anything to you.  Have the spoon marked �Anna Perry�.  It is the one that Martha sent the first time I was confined; as Anna has taken the place of the little girl we lost then, she is entitled to it.  I dare say Mr. Janney�s little girl is beautiful.  She is entitled to it from both parents.

	The servants are giving me no trouble.  If they go on so, they will all be entitled to presents.  James cuts wood every day, so that I have it as abundantly as when George was here.  He says the animals are all well.  Willy behaves very well.  The snow has kept him in the house for several days, & it has quite improved his character & manners.  He speaks of you with affection.  Perhaps he connects you with his horse.  Anna is well, & I think understands everything.  She does not give me as much trouble at night as when you are here.  Susan slept here last night.  Ann was suffering more yesterday than she has ever done, but she slept last night, and is therefore better today.  Dr. Wurderman in his last letter said if her bodily health was good, the irritation of her nerves would be lessened.  The sickness is not entirely nervous.  I dined at Mamma�s today.  They desired their love to you.

	Mrs. Cox has heard of the death of her son.  Mrs. Marion continues about the same as when you left.  I have not seen her lately.  You are not particularly fond of news, but I will tell you something quite so romantic for Greenville.  Dr. James Williams & Anna D�Oyley have suddenly conceived quite a passion for each other & both are anxious & determined to be married.  Mrs. Baker is opposed to it, & for fear of a runaway match, report says, has had Anna locked up.  Persons say she ought certainly to give her advice, but not attempt to control Anna, particularly as she has never control[l]ed her before in her life.  James Williams got Mr. Pinckney to go & talk with her Mrs. Baker on the subject & before Mrs. D�Oyley, she asked Anna how she could think of acting so, when she had had before her eyes, for such a long time, her father, such a wretched drunkard, & knew what a life he had led her mother.  Anna I expect is very anxious to marry, & would join her lot wth anyone.  She [page torn] out that this yea[page torn] was determined to be married, if it was even to Tench Cox.

	I will give you a list of what we wish you to buy.  Mamma wishes you to buy her a bell to hang for her dining room.  If they are not expensive she would like two; if they are expensive, only one.  Susan wishes �Miss Leslie�s seventy five receipt book� and one dollars worth of Morocco.  Get it at the same place you got it the last time, & the same thin kind of different colours  I wish a box of Tooth powder, several peices of soap  such as you bought once, of an oval form, 18 ?  cts a piece.  �Sears Bible Biography� & if you think they are not impositions & are reasonable, Rowlands Macassar oil, Rowlands Kalydon for the complexion, & Rowlands Odonto for the teeth.  You may pay for all of these things out of my quarterly allowance.  Willy wishes a horse, & Anna a doll, & we wish two bells, one for the dining room, and one for my chamber.  And after expressing my wishes, I leave them to be regulated by your purse.

	I leave my letter open to add a few lines tomorrow  A letter has come tonight for you from Augusta.  I think it is from the president of the bank of Augusta.  He says I enclose Ten Dollars amount of your fee, say Bank of Augusta Note No. 1669 Letter B Sept. 3d 1836) and with it my thanks &c., & signed Robert F. Por Prest.  There is no money enclosed so I suppose you are to draw for it & thinks you might like to appropriate it to paying part of the 500 you are to send to Augusta, I have copied it exactly, even the form of the letters.
