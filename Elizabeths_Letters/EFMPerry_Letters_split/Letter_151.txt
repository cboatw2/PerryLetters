Letter 151

Thursday night, 13 December [1849]
Greenville

 My dear husband

		I will write to you tonight, because I have quiet.  In the day I am so much interrupted , my ideas get confused.  I am sorry I have such a bad pen.  It is the only one I have given me by Mr. Dill, & every now & then he mends it for me, but I do not like to trouble him very often.  You must leave me better supplied another time.  I have had to buy paper twice.  I received your letter last night, & also Mr. Wells, which I sent to him after reading it.  As you had Sunday to write to me. I was in hopes you would have written me a long letter, of one or two sheets of foolscap, & thought Willie would have written too.  He I can see is not fond of his pen.  We had a rainy Sunday here too.  Yesterday it was very cold.  Our hogs are now all killed.  Last night I made custard thinking it would freeze, but it did not.  Still it has been quite cold, & all day raining & freezing, so the trees are covered with icicles, & some of the Cedars & Oranges bent to the ground, & I am afraid are broken.  It is very much such a day as we had 3 years ago when we were on our way from Columbia, in the stage, & had Maj. Earle as our companion; one of the most unpleasant days in my life, as any day would be spent in his company, even without Sleet & Ice. 
Reuben & Charles helped Mr. Goodlet[t] kill his hogs, which they ought to have done, as he was so good as to let our horses stay in his Stable.  At the farm they have ploughed when they could & cut up wood when  they could not.  The wood when they cut it, is just under the piazza & gets dry, so we have good fires.  I only wrote to you yesterday, so have not much to say now.  Mrs. Forbes & Mrs. Gibbon came to see me yesterday afternoon. They thought it a delightful day, do not mind the cold at all.  They will go down shortly.

		Mrs. Hayne you say looks dowdyish.  She always looked so.  She had pretty eyes & complexion, & was very lively in her manners, but she had a long face, sunk mouth, long chin, bad figure, tall & high shoulders, & her head stooping forward, & a�awkward walk.  Her eyes & her complexion were so good, that she passed for being very pretty.  She dressed badly always.  I suppose she looks pretty much the same as she did.  I would like to know if you heard anything in particular of Ann Williams.  Her Mill� was all an excuse to get to a gay place like Columbia, & perhaps make a conquest.  She was not one, who would mind being a burden on her Grandmother.  She would have assisted her Mother in taking in work in�.  Tom Butler I expect is such a successful Gambler that he always has money at�, & I suppose Richard Stone being a Bank Director can help him.  He told Mr. McBee, he saw his way clear, knew how much he owed, & could pay every cent without touching his property.  His wife seems such a contrast to himself, & the last lady he would have chosen.  Mrs. Stone made that match.  How wives deceive themselves.  I suppose the same Mail that brought me a letter, brought Mrs. Butler & Mrs. Jones most affectionate ones from their husbands, most affectionate perhaps even than mine, because not coming from the heart.  I wish Mrs. Jones could hear of her husbands conduct.  It would pull down some of her vanity, & make her less egotistic.  I will not mention it, but it ought to be known, & I hope it will get to the ears of the wives.  If a wife were even to seem pleased with the attention of a gentleman how angry the hunband would be, but the husbands are to do just as they choose.  I do not think Mrs. Butler or Mrs. Jones lack any of the comforts of life.  Their husbands must be better off than the world thinks.  I am sorry that you did not go to the Fair, that they might have seen, that you at least saw them.

		You ought to have dined with Col. John Preston.  All such invitations you ought to accept, & in future must.  They do not come so often as to inconvenience you.  You should arrange it, so that all of your shirts should not be in the wash at a time, & I thought Willie was such a little man, he had learned to attend to himself, & not oblige you to stay with him.  You were wrong not to accept the Governors invitation.  It is for your interest to mingle in such society.  I wish you had a little more of the spirit of�Butler & Jones.  You go to the other extreme & are not social; enough.   I mentioned in my last letter that you had better not buy the birds.  For fear of the cold climate, you must ascertain whether there would be any risk.  If there were not, I would like to have them, but do not bring any to Ann, as I suggested, she says she would not take care of them.   I also mentioned that Susan wished a Straw Chair such as a child uses, & you bought for Willie once.  I think the price is 1.50.  You will have to send it up by the Stage directed to Mr. McBee.  Susan will return to me whatever expenses you are at in buying & sending it up.  If you are straightened for money of course you cannot get it.

		If the Legislature adjourns next Tuesday the 18th as you think, this will be my last letter to you.  So I will mention all I wish you to get, promising that you must only get what I mention in case you have money.  Dr. Teague I believe was to pay you some & as you do not mention a scarcity, I think you must have been supplied.  If you are in funds, get for Anna the birds, if there is no risk of cold weather killing them, for Frank a trumpet or ball or some toy for Fanny & all included Cocoanut cakes; for Ann the box resembling an apple, for Vardry a little present of some kind, for me to wear with my Shawl, a bonnet costing not more than 5 or 6 dollars, if you see a pretty one, but if not, [do] not get any, & also if you see a pretty dress, worsted, at 25 or 37 1/2 cts a yd, get me enough to make dress & cape, & fringe & buttons, or any other�used.  A dress can be got here at the prices mentioned, but I would rather have one from Columbia, but not on any account with a price higher than this, at 25 or 37 ?.  All my dresses are light coloured�& thin Silks, so I used a new one to wear with my Shawl, though if you are straightened, I will do without it.  I got no new one last year.  All of my present ones except the light Cashmere, suitable only for Spring, are very shabby.  In the way of books get me �The Lady Alice or the new Una,� [�] Ernest Maltreves,� & �the Carolina Receipt book� by a Charleston lady, the price�dollars, & if you have it not to spend, I will wait for the books another time.  I expect you think I have written demands enough.  I will now close.   If tomorrow I have anything more to write I will inflict another sheet on you.  On the reception of our letters our exclamations are reversed.  I of yours, �how short,� yours  of mine, �how long�!  We are all well.  Frank says he has almost forgotten how Willie looks.  Fanny today when she was troubling me, & I said I was busy said �is Pa busy.�  She takes up a book & reads, �B.F. Perry turn into Court.�  She has not forgotten Mr. Montgomery�s call.  You must be patient, & not feel too anxious to come home.  You will have a long time to stay, & will get tired before the Circuit commences again.  So enjoy yourself now among congenial spirits.  The children are all asleep.  Good night, E.F.P.
