Letter 27

Monday morning.  I have just seen Susan.  She says as George is so old, & drinks, , they will give up the thought of purchasing him & if they buy, get a younger servant, & we all think 300 dollars too much for him.  I have known old servants to sell for 150 dollars.  George cannot cut wood well, & that is what Mamma principally wishes [page torn] servant for in winter, so she decides not to buy him, & I expect you would decide for her in the same way.  Susan is very much pleased with the Gold pencil case.  She will value it extremely.

	I will send the letter that came from Augusta last night along with this.  Do not bring me a gold pencil case.  I assure you I do not even care for one at present.  I wish Willy to have his horse very much, but if your fiends will not allow you to get the other things I have mentioned you must not.  Do not return home until you have finished all of your business.  The longer you stay away, the more business it will seem you have.  But you must not think I am not anxious to see you.  Though I would not be glad to have you come home as soon as Col. Townes has.  Judge Earle I expect is so anxious to marry, that he will address the first lady that pays him any attention, & perhaps be taken in by some one unsuitable for him.  If he has taken so long to choose, he ought to be careful in his selection.  I should think he was in a predicament.  If he remains single he expects to be unhappy; & if he marries he is equally afraid of being unhappy.  Margaret will be here the greater part of the week; so if you do not hear from me, you must know I have been prevented writing by her.  I am afraid I will not be able to write by the next Mail.  Your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
