Letter 27

Thursday morning, 7 December 1843
Greenville

My dear husband
	Your very acceptable letter arrived last night.  Talk of punishing me for not writing!  Why I think I deserve great credit for writing so often.  You must consider the difference in our situation.  You go up to your quiet room & in half an hour write a letter.  I sit down among children & servants (Willy is now talking to me) & before I have written one page have been interrupted half a dozen times.  In the first place, Master Franks wants have to be satisfied, then servants come up on Messages; perhaps old Matthias wants his meat weighed, Eggs & Butter are bought, & I have to stop to count or weigh, my table is shaken, but I have mentioned enough reasons for not writing to have satisfied you long ago.  I have almost a mind not to write you at all, as you will not aspire to the seat on the bench, of which you would be such an ornament.  I agree with Judge Richardson exactly.  A Judge with 3000 dollars is better than a Lawyer with 4.  I am willing to pay for the honour.  We get along comfortably at home.  We would not miss you at all.  Judge Perry sounds remarkably well; but Judge Perry�s wife & children sounds better.  I assure you when I married you, I had a distant thought of being a Judge�s lady.  A Judge gets his money without any trouble, but think when you left home you had money owing you to have paid for your servants, & yet you had to borrow it & pay interest, & it is such a respectable office, never mind what part of the world you go to; you would be known to occupy a high standing at home; for the sake of your wife & children you must think of it.  You are both fortunately & unfortunately situated .  You would have honours for the asking them, & yet are so situated as not to be able to ask them.  I believe I would be better satisfied  if you would not get them for then I would have no aspirations for you, but now it seems to me such a pity. That a man suited for public life, & to be of service to his country, by his character, talents, & judgment as you are should have his sphere limited to domestic life as well as public too.  You must not always �hide you light under a bushel.�  You ought to have told Judge Richardson you would aspire to his seat when he resigned.  My dear husband, I know you have said, �Pooh! Miss Vanity,� long ago, so leaving this & all other important subjects to be acted on as you think proper, I will commence another.  Frank cries so I will first attend to his wants.

	Having satisfied Frank, I will now go on.  If you had mentioned Ann in your letter last night, I would have sent it today to Mamma�s for them to read.  They would have been interested in what you said of Confirmation.  Chancellor Harper, Alston Hayne, Washington Ancrum &c.  but as you did not mention her, I could not think of sending it.  I hope for the sake of the rising generation, Mr. Maturin will be appointed to take charge of the Academy.  You must use your influence with Col. Dunham & Mr. McLeod.  But I dare say most of the Trustees not being able to appreciate him, will prefer some more inferior person.  The Oranges & Pineapples arrived safely yesterday afternoon, three dozen orange & two pineapples.  I sent a Pineapple & fifteen of the finest oranges to Ann & gave an orange & a peice of pineapple to each of the servants.  They all seemed pleased & told them very few masters thought of their servants in that way, when from home.  The servants do very well for me, but they quarrel among themselves.  Eliza & Minerva were quarreling yesterday, but it is best to leave them to themselves.  I tell them they were brought together to try their tempers.  The ground continues so wet Jim has not been able  to work in the garden much.  We have had constant rain & most gloomy disagreeable weather.  I have been out but twice since you left.  We will have to kill a hog tomorrow.  The one we killed just before you left will be gone by that time.  Jim was sent for by Mr. Hoke today to help salt his Pork.  Mrs. Duboc has been to see me.  She said Mr. Buist said it was much more economical to buy hogs than to raise them.  Of course he would do what was most economical.  Pork is selling at 3 cts.  Last year I believe it was 2 cts.

	I am glad you have kept the presents to bring with you.  Your return is looked for with great pleasure by the children, but of course you will be more welcome accompanied by so many pretty things.  Willy would be delighted with the horse, for one that can move along I think he would really like.  I would like him to have it, but you must do as you think about it.  You must not forget the Lavender water & Cocoa nuts for Ann.  There is nothing I wish for you to get for me.  As you expect to be at home the first of next week I will not write you again.  This letter will reach Columbia Sunday, & you will have left in all probability before Wednesday.  Ann is still very poorly.  Susan yesterday had a headache, Anna�s arm is getting well, Willy & Frank are quite well.  I know of no news to tell you.  Mr. Pinckney is now in Pendleton, so I suppose he will preach next Sunday.

	You must not think I desire earthly distinction only for you.  I would rather you be a good Christian above everything else, but it is not inconsistent with your character as a Christian to take advantage of the opportunities thrown in your way by Providence for advancing your temporal interests.  Genl Whitner seeks preferment, & at the same time is a good Christian.  I do not think he is entitled to seat on the bench.  He will make an inferior Judge.  You would be the best Judge on the bench; your decisions would be so just.  What I wish[page torn, word missing] you is, that your sphere of usefulness should be increased, that you may prove an ornament to the state.  But after mentioning my views on the subject, I wish you to act for yourself.  We must desire Jehovah for our portion & our children above everything else.  I have a great many good tracts I wish to read to you, & you must promise, (now that you are away you will promise anything) when you return, to read a chapter in the bible every morning & afternoon, not that I consider that the whole of our duty, but only the commencement.

	Your letters give me great pleasure, & you are very good, the very best of husbands, & deserve the very best of wives, one guided entirely by your judgement, as I always intend to be, except in a few trifles.

	I write today as I might be prevented tomorrow, or be hurried as I sometimes am to get the letter in the office before the Mail is closed.  Perhaps I may add a few lines tomorrow, but as it is uncertain I will now close by wishing you a pleasant journey home.  E.F.P.

Friday morning.  I have just been reading the Mountaineer.  How I wish I could have read a letter from you giving an account of Legislative proceedings.  You ought to be a member, if it is only to inform the people what is going on.  I am sure they must miss your letters.  How blind they are to their own interest when they do not insist on your going.  There is no one now to attend to the interests of the upper country.  If you had been a member last year, you would have prevented your circuit from being arranged as it is at present, & which has injured you so much.  I feel very uneasy, lest you should be more occupied.  If you run for solicitor, of course you will remain in Columbia until after the election.  It seems to be an advantage to let the people know, you are a candidate for an office long before[word obscured] it seems to entitle you to the office.  So as you will not be a Candidate for Judge this time [you] must inform the Legislature that you will be a Candidate at the next resignation.  Today for a �der, the sun is shining.  I expect with pleasure a letter tonight.  I am sorry you will not hear from me.  I have written every other Mail.  Willy says I must tell you, he is learning a Hymn & Catechism to say to you, & says his lesson every day.  I have not answered Pamela�s letter yet but must soon, that she can hear before she leaves home.  I long to see you again.  I think it is much better to leave home sometimes for it is such a pleasure to meet again, &  it makes us value home, to leave it occasionally.

Benjamin Perry 
Columbia
