Letter 66

Thursday night, 4 December 1845
Greenville   

 My dear husband

	Again I am seated at the desk writing to you.  I have written, I believe every other night, since you left.  If you were to peep in at me, you would find me all alone; the children have gone upstairs to bed.  I received your letter last night & was very thankful to hear from you.  I am sorry you are so homesick.  Many in your situation would be quite happy.  I wish you could enjoy the mixing with society more than you do.  I think it would be an advantage to you if you associated more with the world in general, & the more you feel disinclined to it, the more you ought to try to overcome that feeling.  I wish my dear you were more ambitious; your fault is want of ambition.  If you had had that quality, you would have been far more successful than you now have been.  I am thankful for the degree of success you have met with, but I am ambitious, & aspire to far higher ambitions, than any you have yet attained.  Still if these aspirations are not gratified, I am grateful that my wishes have in some measure been satisfied, & will be happy as long as you retain your present honors, even if they are never greater.  I admire talented & distinguished men more than any others.  I would rather be married to one of that description than a sick one.  While you are from home enjoy yourself; you know you can just as well as any others.  So instead of making yourself unhappy, why do you not determine to pass your time agreeably.  If you have nothing else to do, make new acquaintances.  You are too still & reserved & occasionally you ought to be affable & agreeable.  As for the pleasures of home & wife & children, you exag[g]erate  them.  When you are away from Home, you remember only the pleasures of it; but when you return you find it a very disagreeable place.  You Wife is cross & scolds you.  Your children behave so badly that they almost distract you.  Your servants are lazy & worry you to death.  These are the pleasures of Home.  It is well you are away half the time, for you can enjoy home in imagination, very differently from what it is in reality.  I only wish I could go from home sometimes.  I stay there until I get quite tired of it.  If I left it sometimes perhaps I would value it more.  Let me hear no more of Homesickness.  If you do, I will not write to you.  I saw Jim this morning.  He has not been able yet to plant the Oats, on account of the ground being frozen.  It rained a little last night, & it is rather mild today, so I hope tomorrow he will be able to plant them.  We have had a severe spell of weather.  Two or three thousand rails Jim says are cut.  They have not made any fence yet.  He thought it best to cut all the rails first.  March being sick, & James worthless.  Charles & Jim have been the only ones to work at the farm.  James hauls wood principally.  March is better now, & goes to the farm to work.  Maria is better; Lindy is still there.  I miss her very little, am satisfied she should be there.  I wrote you about the hogs you got from Mr. Watson.  Eliza is still at Mamma�s, & find it such a relief to be without her.  I will be sorry when she has to come back.  There is so little sewing for her to do this winter, that I would be willing for her to iron, & hire out.  Mary, Delia, Lindy & Edward are enough to wait in the house & mind the children, & one day in each week, Delia wash.  I have been to Mamma�s but twice since Susan was married, the night & the night after, so I cannot judge how they are coming on.  They have had a good deal of company calling, Mrs. McBee�s family, Mr. Erwin, Bradshaw, Croft, Henry Thompson, Sam Earle & others.  I get a note from Susan every day.  Mrs. McBee gives her party next Wednesday.  I the Friday following, tomorrow week.  As you say the Fruit is not dear, I would like you to get me a small keg of Pineapples, if they are round, & not decayed, & if the Cocoa nuts are not more than 6 ? cts  apeice send me 12.  If they are dearer send me fewer.  I will consider this as my present; you need bring no other.  Send them up in the very next stage, so that they may arrive here Wednesday, & give me time to make the Cocoa nuts into something nice.  I asked Willie what you must bring for him.  He is very reasonable.  He says a knife & puppy.  I said suppose Papa cannot get the puppy.  Then he said he can bring it the next time.  I asked Anna, she says, a baby house, chairs, sofa, table, bedstead & baby.  She is exorbitant in her demand, so you must bring what you see fit.  I asked Frank; he says, a drum & a ip, that is drum & whip.  This evening Mr. McBee when he went out, took up his whip.  Frank saw him [&] it brought something  to his mind, & he said to bring me drum; Pa bring me ip.  He understands everything.  I want you to bring a present for Susan, & buy something for me to give her, & I want you also to bring a present for Ann.  It is not the value of the present they care for, but the remembrance.  You have not mentioned any purchases you have made, anything you see & wish for yourself, & have the money to git it with you must buy.  You have not told me how your clothes�.  You must be careful & have your Wig straight.  You do not know how much your appearance depends upon having that fixed right.  How anxious Mr. Wells must be; this is now his last hope.  I hope the Governor will pardon him.  I am certain if all who promised spoke to him that he would.  I have not a particle of news to tell you.  It is so cold to stay at home entirely with the children.  You must be sure to answer Willie�s note or he will be mortified.  He takes great interest in his book, is always asking me, what words certain letters spell, & of his own accord tries to read.  You ought to be reconciled to being from home, when you remember, when you return you will stay at home long enough to get tired of it.  If you mention Homesickness again I will scold you well & then stop writing.   Be happy like Mr. Duncan, Ware, Walker & Henry.  They have happy homes, & yet are not pining for them.  Yours, E.F.P.
