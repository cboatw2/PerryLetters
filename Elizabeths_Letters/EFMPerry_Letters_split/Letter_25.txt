My dear husband

	Though very busy working, I have stopped to write you a few lines, to prevent you being disappointed Friday night & to inform you how we are coming on.  You forgot to leave me good pens.  Those in the desk are so bad, I can hardly work with them, so you must make many allowances for bad writing.  I look forward with great pleasure to hearing from you tonight.  It seems an age since you left home.

	The incident of greatest importance that has occurred, has been a visit from Delia�s mother.  She came Sunday evening in the stage & left this morning.  She said this was the time she intended visiting Delia, that her little girl made a mistake when she said Christmas, that at Christmas if convenient she would like Delia to visit her, when she expects to see some of her other children.  I was very much pleased with Milly. She was far superior to what I expected to find her, & much younger & better looking.  She seemed very much pleased to find Delia so well situated, & gave her a great deal of good advice, to behave herself well & be thankful for having such good owners.  Very differently situated did she find Caroline, who she went to see & passed one night with.  She says Mrs. Lynch gave her a most dreadful character which she does of all of her servants except one, that she gives her very little to eat, & that all the clothes she had on, would not be enough to make an apron, & after working out all day, when she comes home at night from the fields, she has to spin a card of cotton, which would take her until 10 oclock, & Mrs. Lynch wont let her have the bed clothes to sleep on, which she gave her when she was sold (her share of the family estate).  She must be treated very badly.  I have always heard Mrs. Lynch was very cross.  Milly took off one of her petticoats, & made it into one for Caroline, & made her something else out of Hom� she carried her.  She & Delia both cried at the thoughts of Caroline�s situation.  I have promised that Delia shall go to Spartanburgh at Christmas if she is a good girl.  Delia is 16 years old next July.  I will tell you all about the visit when you return.  Milly was delighted with Mamma who she went to see.  I told her she must see the old Missus as well as the young.  Miss Susan was very pretty but not prettier than me although I was married.

	Your trunk has come home & is a beautiful one.  If you had it with you where you were not known, you would certainly be taken for an old bachelor.  

	I have had no trouble with servants.  Jim is today helping John kill hogs, (Mamma bought five from Mr. McClanahan) & John says he will return the favour.  Jim I think is a very good servant.  I don�t know that you would have got a better one.  Eliza has been several days at Mamma�s working, but is now at home ironing.  Delia I hope will be better for her mothers visit.  Lindy & Edward do quite well, but are often in each others way.  Minerva I have scolded once for sitting in her room in the morning working, instead of getting breakfast & James I know nothing about.

	The children of course you wish to hear about, & in compliment to you I will commence with Frank.  He is a sweet creature, now sleeps in Delia�s lap.  I am seated in the chamber.  Anna & Will every now & then run against the table & shake it.  I give them a slap & send them off & tell them I will inform you what bad children they are.  Anna is now rocking my chair.  Well!  Frank is quite well & grows & improves.  He laughs aloud, & can almost creep.  Anna has been very unfortunate, & burnt her arm against the chimney dog.  She was standing on the Fender trying to reach something from the Mouth peice when she fell forward; fortunately she was at the side of the chimney, instead of directly in front.  So instead of her face, her arm went against the dog & was burnt.  It is getting well, & you need not be uneasy.  I am determined she shall not get burnt again.  I was near her when she fell, & pulled her out instantly.  Willy fell out of bed one night & bruised his nose.  I put him on the outside, that I might be between Anna & himself. & keep Anna covered, but after the fall I took Anna in my bed, as well as Willy, so we all now sleep together.  The Bedstead must think it a great imposition.  We have reserved the cot for you.  I am so well pleased with the present arrangement, I could not be induced to change it.  Willy one night complained of being sick. & I gave him a dose of oil.  It did him good & he is now quite well.  

	Ann has been very poorly, but the weather has been disagreeable.  I have not been able to go to see her.  It rains every night, continues cloudy through the day, & the walking is very bad.  Mamma sends messages to say I must go whenever I can.  I intended going today if the weather permitted, but it rained hard last night.  Susan bought Anna a dress last week [page torn].  Ann sleeps very little now.  I will go to see them tomorrow if I can.  I have not been out of the house ounce since you left.  I am so busy, I have not even opened Miss Bremer�s �Neighbours�.  I think it best not, for if I commence it, I cant stop until I have finished it.

	I know of nothing new to tell you.  I may not write again for several days, so do not be disappointed or uneasy, when you do not hear.  And give yourself no trouble about your large family at home.  They are getting along quite well.

	I saw the death of Mr. Cunningham bookseller in Columbia.  I suppose it is the person from whom you have bought books.  I have heard nothing more of Judge Earle.  I suppose he is still in the land of the living.

	No letters have come for you.  A paper from the commissioner of pensions has come, telling some pensioner that he has been removed from the list in this state to Tennessee I believe.  Will sends a great many messages about his cocked hat with a feather stuck up in it, his belt. Sword, gun &c. that he had new shoes, that Delia�s  ma has been here�.  And now my dear husband adieu, until tonight. When I expect to have a very pleasant, though short interview with you after the Mail comes it.  E.F.P.
