Letter 25

	Friday morning.  I hope to receive a letter from you this evening.  Willy says I must tell you he has been a good boy; but I don�t know that I can tell you the same; though he certainly is much better than he used to be.  I have not whipped him since you left.

	I suppose Columbia is as gay and lively as possible.  Susan is anxious for you to get her some Morocco, but I told her I knew you would not; you would think it was for me.  Write word if you will get it.  If not she will commission Mr. H. Thompson, but she would rather you, as the last you got was so pretty.  I would like to know the price of Rowlands Macassar, Kalydor, and Odonto, before you buy them.  If they are reasonable, I will wish them.  Your affectionate wife, Elizabeth F. Perry
