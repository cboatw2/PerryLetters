Letter 157

		Monday.  My dear husband, I will now finish my letter.  Mr.Croft has paid his visit.  He wished to know my opinion how it would do for him to ask Mrs. Blake to stay at his house & she in return teach all his grandchildren to dance 7 or 8 of them.  Her�would cost him nothing, & her teaching his Grandchildren save him 60, 70, or 80 dollars.  It would really be a bargain on his part.  He wishes me to propose it to Mrs. Blake on her arrival.  He says she will have a good school.  He does not know when his Groceries will be here, not until freight is lower, so you must be sure & buy some seed & bring with you or the birds will perish.

		Mr. Arthur only bought last week the servant who has been killed.  Paid 600 dollars for him, from Mr. Garrison.

		This is sale day, & Mr. Griggs has had his whipping, as great a crowd went to Jail for him, as if he was to be hung.

		The children are at school.  The horse sprained its ankle.  Mr. Westfield says there is no nail in it. Reuben is not using it today.  Mr. Smith will commence whitewashing tomorrow.  I hope to hear from you Wednesday & long to see you.  Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P.

There are a great many People in the village today.
