Letter 175

 Tuesday night, 17 December 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today.  I am sorry to see how anxious you are to get home, for though I wish you to love home; still I like you to pass your time pleasantly away from it, & I am afraid your great anxiety to get from Columbia, shows you are not treated well by those around you.  I expect since you have made your speech, & declared your love for the Union, you are looked coldly upon as Dr. Lieber is.  Before they knew you went for a Southern Convention & in that they agreed with you, & were disposed to treat you as a friend, but now having declared your motive for going for it, �Love of the Union,� they find it just the reverse of the reason they go for it, to �Dissolve the Union,� so they look upon you as an alien, an enemy.  I have not read the papers since you made your speech, for fear I might see you spoken of in a way I did not like.  Today I was mostly looking in the Charleston Courier for the deaths & marriages, &�glanced at a paragraph containing your name & the expressions of your attachment to the Union.  I did not care to see what followed, so closed the paper immediately.  I am sorry you did not say in your letter today, anything about publishing your speech.  I am afraid the papers have refused to publish it.  If so it is a pity you made it, as you did not say half you wished & have been misrepresented in that half.  I am very glad the Senate has passed a resolution for a State Convention, & hope it will pass the house.  I would prefer they should Secede at once, this very moment let us have the Crisis now.  Until it comes,  the people will be kept in a constant state of excitement, so I wish it to come & be over.  How unlooked for these times are.  You had just got over the Stigma attached to you as a Union man, & now your position is worse than it was then. You have fewer to bear you company.  If it had not been for Col. Memminger interfering in Greenville, things there would have been more as they were during Nullification times.  There would not have been so many renegades as there are now.  His change gave the others courage to follow.  But I must now speak of what immediately concerns yourself.  Scott is still alive, & that is about as much as I can say.  He has entirely lost the use of his hind legs.  He has been laying down for several days.  When he eats & drinks he raises himself on his front legs.  Today Reuben said he seemed liv[e]lier than usual. & if he could be raised up, & supported by ropes, he would do better, so I bought a rope & they managed to raise him up, but he had no strength in his hinder parts, & dropped down again.  It is sad to think of such a fine horse, dying as he is.  I was at the Stable yesterday & heard him groaning.  I shed tears now when I think of it; how different his situation from when I used to see you mounted on him.  I beg you ride on Byron & he the finest & largest & strongest looking horse I ever saw, & I believe his death is owing to his superiority.  He was too fat, & noble to have been worked as he was, ploughing all summer in the hot sun.  A poor, mean, thin horse could have borne it, but Scott was not born to be treated in that way, worked lightly, he would have been well now.  About a week ago during the night I could hear him knocking himself against the Stable, but now he lays perfectly quiet, so every morning, I expect to hear he is dead.  I am afraid it is the journey to & from the Rail Road that has knocked him up so completely.  After telling you how sick Scott was, I thought of your own accord, you would be afraid the other horses would be injured, & propose coming back in the Stage.  I did not like to propose it to you, for fear after being so extravagant as I knew you had been, that you might not have funds.  So I asked Reuben while I was writing to you, if the other horses were well.  He said yes, there were well.  This morning Charles came in & told me that Byron was too lame almost to go to the river.  I went to the Stable & saw him walk, & his leg seemed very lame, & when he stood still he would hold it up, as if it hurt to touch the ground & when Reuben touched the soft part of his foot above the hoof, he would wince.  Mr. Cauble shod them yesterday, & he says Byrons lameness is owing to Mr. Westfields having made the shoes too small particularly at the back foot, & that has cramped the foot & lamed it.  You know Byron has been lame for a long time & it is very provoking that it should be owing to the Shoeing, so I have told Reuben to say nothing about it to Mr. Westfield, but not to go there again to have them shod.  This morning we waited anxiously to receive your letter to know what you would direct, & finding that you still said Reuben must go for you, Byron being entirely too lame to travel 100 miles almost.  I sent Reuben to Mr. Pecks to hire a horse to put with Selim, for Selim is perfectly well, & he has hired one at 50 cts a day, & will set off Thursday morning, & meet you at Fulkes Saturday morning.  Queen Mary in writing to William� is very anxious he would approve of what she is doing. So in the same way I am anxious you should approve of my acts, but I am not in much fear of you as she is of him, & she had�too loving in her expressions, when you recollect she had a rival.

		I am sorry Willie & Frank have been so much in your way, another time you will carry only one, or carry me instead, & think you had better make it a rule, always when you go to Columbia to carry me, & what I prevent your spending extravagantly, can pay my board.

		I am very glad to tell you that I today received a letter from Aunt Mary McCall in which she says she has sent my Sacks or�to Columbia to you, by William Johnston, son of Mr. Andrew Johnston, a student in Columbia College.  She wrote Friday & said Mr. Johnston was to go to Columbia that day.  You wrote Friday & yet you do not mention having received the package so I feel quite uneasy.  It was directed to you at Maybins Hotel.  I suppose it will be sent to the bar to you, but if it is not, you must find out through Prof. Leiber or Williams where Mr. William Johnston is & ascertain from him what he has done with the bundle.  You must not leave Columbia without it.  Aunt Mary had it made after one a cousin of hers had just brought from Europe.  It cost $10.25 cts, & I have made independent of you, since you were away 8 & 9 dollars, almost enough to pay for it.  The 15 dollars you left me is barely enough for household expenses.  I wish you to live well after you return for a while at least, so I have bought 6 Turkeys, 5 ducks & plenty of Eggs.  Christmas I have invited Mamma & Susan�s families to dine with us, so you may tell them all the news.  New Years day Susan says we must dine there.  Today Mrs. Fields bought some very nice Socks 25 cts a pr & as you had only 3 pr, I bought 3 pr from her for you.  I paid Mr. Paynes bill $1.70 cts.  I bought 3 pounds of tea all Pinckney Mr. Bee has left.  I bought 150 worth of Candles yesterday; so in all these ways the 15 dollars has gone, & I was obliged to borrow 1 dollar from Mamma to add to 9 I have to enclose to Aunt Mary McCall, & for the remainder of this week I intend to spend nothing at all.

		  I will have some provisions wo� & send by Reuben for you to eat coming up; some cakes for the children & some bread & meat; & apples.  I wish you had sent the tin box back in the carriage to hold it.

		Yesterday Mary came in from the Portico & said to me Dr. Crooks asks if Fanny had ever been vaxinated.  I thought he was very officious, & I said no, & I do not wish her either.  About an hour after he made his appearance at the door & came in & asked me the same question & I asked him, if it ought to be done.  He said yes, the Small pox was at Hendersonville, & Mrs. Clayton had died of it.  Her husband had brought the infection in his goods from Hamburg & in all probability it would come here & everybody ought to be vaccinated, myself included.  I asked him where he got the matter from.  He said it was some he had had two or three years & vaccinated about 200 persons with it, & out of that number only one had taken & he kept the scab of that one.  I thought it must be very poor matter indeed to have effect in one case out of 200, & besides it was very officious in him to be prescribing unasked as if of a matter of course he was always to be one Physician so I did not encourage him to vaccinate Fanny.  He asked her if she would be frightened, & she said yes; & he said fright prevented its taking, & he would go over to Mrs. Hokes & vaccinate Sally Hoke, & if that took use matter from her sore; so he went off.  I told Mamma to ask Dr. Earle, if all to be vaccinated, & if so he can do it.  Dr. Crooks before did it so badly he made your arm so sore I was afraid it would have to be cut off, & after all I believe none he did took.  He is so deceitful & hypocritical & fawning, & pre� at the same time, that he is all openness & warmth & sincerity, that I have a perfect contempt for him.

		Mrs. Michael Hoke is at Mrs. Hokes, & tonight Mrs. Hoke asked me to take a sociable cup of Tea   with her.  I asked the servant who was going, & as soon as she mentioned Dr. Crooks name, I determined I would not go, so said I did not think I would be able to; & this afternoon I sent word I expected to be particularly engaged at home.  My engagement is writing to you, which I prefer to being in Dr. Crooks company, where I would be obliged to play the hypocrite, & listen to his hypocritical patriotism.  Mrs. Dr. Williams came to see me this afternoon.  She says Hetty D�Oyley went to see her Mother the day Anna Williams child died.  She thinks they will be reconciled now.  The little girl was 8 years old.

		Anna is now preparing for the Examination which takes place next Friday, so you will not be here.  I have been hearing Anna her lessons, to see if she knew them well enough so I would not be afraid to be present when she is examined.  This afternoon she said 20 pages in the Scholars companion which is a hard kind of Spelling with meaning, where there are two of every word that is pronounced alike.  Yet I felt difficulty, & with different meanings & she hardly missed a word, & sometimes would say a column herself, without my calling out the words she has such a good memory.  I have heard all she has been learning in History, & to every question, she gives an answer that does very well.  I am going on to hear her Geography & her other studies & if she does as well, I can go with confidence to the examination.  The Music is to be at night.  This winter will be so cold for Anna to practice in the Drawing room without fire, I think she may as well stop with her Music until the warm weather comes again.  I will make her practice what she has learnt, w[hich] she may not forget.  Both Fanny & herself long to see you.  Fanny says �Pa stays too long.�  Anna says you promised her a book.  If you choose to, you may buy her a simple book costing not much, or give one of Willie�s to her.  Write her name in it.  Tell Frank his cousin Susan Hayne has sent him a very pretty book called �Simple Ballads.�  Tell Willie I have not seen H� yet, & I expect H� has not seen the outside of the Stable.  I have neglected to tell you that one night the Calf of the white faced Cow was gored so Reuben thinks, by the Cow; that it died in consequence, but the Cow still gives Milk, & that the old Cow that for a while was left at the Farm with her Calf gives Milk now too, so when the Cow with the young Calf is milked, which will be next Tuesday, we will have the Milk of four Cows.  Some of them this winter you can dispose of.  Perhaps you can winter them at Mr. Fosters,  if not sell some.

		I will stop now it is late & finish tomorrow.  You must write me so I can hear twice more, Thursday & Saturday.  A letter came today from a Mr. Brown a merchant in Marion Alabama enclosing a note against Mr. Sam Town[e]s for 53 dollars, due for goods he had bought for himself & family.  Mrs. S. Town[e]s once told me the dearest friend she had, was in the Lunatic asylum in Columbia, & that when you went there, she would like you to go & see her & inquire about her.  I have forgotten her name.  I think she was originally from Spartanburg.  Mrs. Town[e]s became intimate with her in Alabama.  Wednesday morning Scott is still the same.   Reuben is going to set off this afternoon for you; for the journey is too long for two days, particularly if you come back in 2 days.  They must have a while to rest at Fulkes.  He will take Selim & Mr. Pecks horse.  It is strange Genl Thompson does not mention his bride.  Mr. Luther heard he bought her 2 rings in Charleston 1000 dollars apeice.  If so he was very foolish & his children ought to be angry.  I do hope in your next letter you will tell me, you have received my package, & not keep me in such suspense.  Buy the hops, a bottle of Otto of Rose for Ann.  I believe that is all; except tell Willie to buy a toy for Vardry & the blue grass & Clover seed for Mamma.  I wish you a pleasant journey.  I will expect you Sunday night, or sometime Monday.  Then you will have a long time to stay at home, & get tired of it, & scold your wife, & fret at the children.  I hope after awhile all the excitement will pass away, but I do hope the politicians will bring things to a crisis at once.  I wish them to secede.  Until they do, they will use the excitement for their own interest.  E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
