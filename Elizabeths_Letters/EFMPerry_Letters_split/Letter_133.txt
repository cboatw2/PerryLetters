Letter 133

Friday night 

My dear husband

		I did not intend writing to you by this Mail because I thought you would leave Columbia tomorrow, but as in your letter tonight you do not say when you will be at home.  I write, for fear if you do not hear, you will be uneasy, & hurry home.  Today I have been visiting.  Mamma & myself went to Dr. Butlers this morning, & Mrs. Henry Thompsons this afternoon.  Mr. Thompson said he would always recollect the interest you had taken in his election as Bursar.  I am surprised you should have voted for Thompson Earle as Messenger, when you were under no obligation to his family, but rather the reverse.  I thought you would have voted for Mr. Black.  I am glad Cousin Isaac is elected Attorney General.  Mrs. Butler said there were such reports about Dr. Griffin when he left Abbeville.  He was the last man she thought would have got an office, particularly that of Treasurer.  I hope you did not have to pay for the printing of Dr. Anderson�s briefs, & I also hope you will do your best, & get him a new trial.  I wish you had mentioned the Decisions in your cases.  Mrs. H� seemed to me a pleasant lady.  I hear Mr. Eddings your friend has taken Dr. Austin�s house.  I suppose hired it.  It is uncertain whether Mr. Bryan will leave or not.  I rather expect Greenville suits him too well, that he will remain.  I am glad you purchased Candlesticks for we need them.  We need some for the Drawing room.  China ones are used, & when we can afford it, I will get a pr.  I wish you to buy for me, �the Carolina Receipt Book,� by Miss Rutledge of Charleston.  The price in Charleston is 1 dollar, Mamma wishes it also, but as we are not certain  how we will like it, only one is enough to get.  You have not mentioned whether you have engaged the Lady�s Book. & whether Graham & that taken together would be got for 5[.]00.  Mamma wished Graham, if it would be got on those terms.  Cork Soles are worn in Shoes now.  Mrs. Arthur got a pr from Charleston.  I wish you would inquire in Columbia, & if they can be got, buy me 1 pair, & if very reasonable 2 pair.  You must bring something for the children, something that will be useful & last, not broken up immediately.  I will send this letter by Mr. Smith who leaves tonight, & get him to put it in the Post Office at Columbia.  Tomorrow I expect to finish my visiting,�8 next week.  Jim will work steadily.  I will not take him off.  I thought it best to visit while you are away, as Jim will work more steadily when you are here.  He has not given me so much trouble in getting the carri[a]ge as usual.  Franks dog is quite well.  The Baptist Convention commenced today, but I do not think many persons have come yet.  The Village looks as quiet as ever.  We will all be happy to see you, but do not come sooner than  your business permits.  I must now conclude so as to send the letter before the bell rings.  Do you not think it would be a good plan to buy you[r] seed in Columbia of Russell, that they are better than those got here, but this is, as you think.  Willie is now studying his lesson.  Fanny is asleep in the Cradle.  Anna & Frank are gone to bed.  I believe I have nothing more to write.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Recollect the pictures for Ann 3 for half a dollar, such as you got before, & something for Vardry, an Ornament such as you have sometimes got for Anna, or some little thing, I do not care what.
