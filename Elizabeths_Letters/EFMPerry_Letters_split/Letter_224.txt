Letter 224

Friday, 1 oclock. 10 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have received no letter from you today.  Nothing has come from the Post office today.  So I will write you only a few lines.  I am disappointed at not hearing, but hope you were too busy to write, that you are quite well.  Mr. Hoke today is to buy the Hogs.  There is a fine drove in the village, & he says not many more fine ones will come.  You must write now whether the carri[a]ge must be sent for you, or whether you will come in the Stage.  If it were not for bad roads, the carri]a]ge would be the pleasantest, but you will know best.  I hope to hear tomorrow.  I am very busy working.  All are well except Charles who in bad weather has Asthma.  The weather is still bad, cloudy & drizzly.  I have no news to tell you.  I write so often I have not missed a single Mail.

	I wrote to Anna yesterday, & will again tomorrow.  We get along quite well, & am glad you are at a pleasant Hotel.

	The Legislature adjourns too soon to get through with the business.  You ought to postpone it, so as to pass all your important bills.  A few days longer, so much could be done.  Those who are in such a hurry should stay at home.

	I hope we will have good weather so as to clean the house before you return.  I must now conclude.  I think of you constantly.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
