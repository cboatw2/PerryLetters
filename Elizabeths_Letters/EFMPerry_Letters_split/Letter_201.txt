Letter 201

Saturday night, 29 March [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	Mr. Elford does not go until Monday but for fear tomorrow I may not have time to write, I will tonight write as much as I can.

	I will begin by telling you the news that Lindy this morning after breakfast was taken sick, & after dinner gave birth to an infant a girl.  She suffered I expect a great deal, but I am glad the event is safely over, & hope she & her child will do well.  It is a good�baby.  Fanny wishes upon having it as her maid instead of Sarah.  I think we will name it Caroline or Emily after one of Lindy�s sisters.  I sent first for Mom Phillis, & Mom Phillis afterwards begged me to send for Dr. Crooks so he was with her.

	I received your letter this afternoon by Mr. B�.  I sent your Editorial to the Printing office.   I am very sorry you fixed upon this time to have the sale at Tugaloo, instead of coming home.  I told you it was unwise.  A Mr. Cunningham came today to see you.  He thought a case had been brought against him which he wished you to defend, but looking at the records, thinks the case has not been brought.

	You have heard I suppose of the death of Mrs. Washington Earle.  She was sick only 2 or 3 days I believe with Cholic & I heard was speechless.  These are all [the] particulars I know.

	Mamma Ann Susan & the children [page torn]were with me.  Lucinda is sick�& the servant Mamma hires from Dr. Williams is sick.  My family are all well.  Fanny still goes to school.  She knows all her letters, says she is the smartest girl in school.  Anna & Willie took tea at Mrs. Hopkins last night & enjoyed themselves so much, they staid until after 11.  Frank went to the Court House to hear a blind girl play on the piano & sing.  He had no invitation to the party.

	Mamma Susan & myself called to see Mrs. Hoyt the other day, on account of her coming from Charleston, & knowing Aunt Hayne�s well.  She calls Mr. Hoyt & herself & the young couple.  They stay at Mr. Randolph�s.

	I hear Mr. Tom Lowndes & family are not coming up next summer.  They are going to France.  Dr. Dickson it is said wishes to purchase again in Greenville near the village or in the village.

	Mr. Carson has postponed his trip to California for some months.  He cannot get a passage I believe.  Old Mrs. McBee says she does not know where he will get the money from to carry them.  I hear Chandler has returned.  Got as far as the isthmus where he found too many waiting to get across.

	I am glad to hear of your professional good luck in these hard times.  A large fee is very acceptable.  I heard Mr. Wynn was going to bring suit for his daughter, so when you mentioned you  were employed I felt glad, but that feeling has passed away, & I wish it were on the other side you were employed.  I have no patience with a bold impudent girl encouraging a young man, or at any rate yielding to his wishes, & then [page torn] round & seeing him for what she is as much to blame [page torn] girl would never be in the situation of Miss Wynn.  Her father may be good, but I expect she inherits badness from her mother.  The whole family I believe are a worthless set.  Kelly while at Mamma�s spoke of this same Miss Wynn & said her husband a Mulatto man had connexion with her, & her master had a daughter who lived with a man without marrying, had a child & the man afterwards left her & she herself she said had children by her master & her masters son.  Someone told Mamma at the time that the servants & overseers are all alike.  I expect Miss Wynns character will be proved to be so bad (for so many were named as the father of her child) that you will lose the case.  So if you bring such a case, so demoralizing  to the community, & one that makes you so many enemies, you need to make up  for all you will suffer, secure to yourself a large fee, whether you [word botted] or not, 1000 dollars if you lose, 2000 if you gain.  I think you laid the damages too high.  She is not worth paying one cent to get rid of.  Make Mr. Wynn beforehand give his note.  I hope you will gain Mrs. � case & get well paid by Mr. Brown.   Now you are an old Lawyer & of some reputation  you ought to charge high fees where you have rich clients.  Write me about Miss Wynns case whether it is for breach of marriage promise you are suing? Or what? & whether it is to be tried this Court?  Mr. Barnwell Rhett has sent you Espy�s report on Meteorology, the Smithsonian report & Patent office reports on Agriculture.  No letters have come.  You have two of Espy just alike.    You can give one away.

	Have you heard Mr. Jones is a candidate for Con[gress].  I hardly like to make him of so [page torn] to mention it, but wish to know your opinion as to whether he will be elected.  I am sure I hope not, do not you think perhaps he may, those opposed to Mr. Orr & not knowing what a contemptible character Mr. Jones is, may take him up.  This does not look as if he was humbled by your exposure of him, or his bankruptcy; but as if he would show to the world at least, that he thought more of himself than ever.  Write me your opinion on the subject, what you think his motives are in offering, if he really thinks he will be elected or thinks it will give him importance even if defeated.  Mr. Luther says at Mrs. Earles funeral he was figuring about, giving himself great a[page torn] not looking like a broken man.  

	Tomorrow we will go to church for the last time in the building we have been going to for so many years.  It is to be pulled down & Mr. Arthur will preach in the Academy or McBee�s Hall.  I am sure he is not worth building a new church for.  I am sorry you have to give one cent for a person who I do not even regard as your friend.

	Susan says Mr. Campbell & Ioor are going to Florida to speculate in lands, not to live.  I wish they were going there to live. 
  
	If I have anything new to write you tomorrow I will write again.  The children are all asleep, & I will now follow their example.  [page torn] I expect is coming on well.  Reuben & Charles [page torn] [E.F.P.]
