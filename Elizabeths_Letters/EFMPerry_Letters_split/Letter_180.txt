Letter 180

Wednesday morning, 9 April [1851]
Greenville

My dear Aunt

		Your letter to Maj. Perry enclosing mine to you arrived yesterday, & as he will [be] busy all this week Court & not be able to answer it immediately, I feel compelled to do so.  My love for him almost prompts me to remain silent & bear all the blame that has fallen on me & which though the weaker vessel I would gladly sustain for his sake; for there is no sacrifice for me to make to secure his happiness & the good opinion of others for him; but as Mr. Peronneau in his letter to Mamma said, it was sincere affection alone, that induced him  to notice what otherwise he would not, so the same feeling prompts me to place myself in a correct position before you.  Maj. Perry is at this moment in Court pleading for the life of a poor man.  I at the same time am pleading his cause & mine, & am thankful it is a more just one than he is engaged in.  It is a little singular that a discourteous act shown toward us, should be turned against us, & we made the party who has offended.  That returning a paper is a want of courtesy & not an ordinary thing, is proved by the paper not having been returned by any of the Disunionists to whom it was sent, on whom Maj. Perry had any claim, except my two cousins.  All with their exceptions have kept it; nrt do I see why they should not for what contamination is there in receiving & even reading a paper edited by a sensible, sincere & disinterested Party, one who is universally esteemed to be prompted by love of his country & acting conscientiously for her best interests, & who time will show whether he is not more correct in his views than those who op[p]ose him.  Such a paper would be read with profit, & when published by a connexion, & in a place where those dear to you live, & giving information of a most flourishing & interesting part of the State.  It seems strange when such a paper should be turned away as if it was contamination to look at it.  A paper edited by Wm Ed or any of my relations or friends in whom I felt an interest, never mind how it differed with me in Politics; I would keep out of courtesy if sent to me if from no other motive, & think I would read it with interest, & perhaps have my own views enlightened by it.  As what we look upon as a want of courtesy we find was not meant as such we are willing to forget & forgive.  I do not suppose Mr. Peronneau told Wm Henry to return the paper, but I supposed that as Wm Henry knew the paper was meant for his Father, he of course showed it to him, & told him how he intended to dispose of it, & received his Fathers�.  I tried to excuse this act to Maj. Perry, instead of irritating him, & he told me it was an act of discourtesy.  It was very strange a thing meant as a compliment, should not be taken as such.  I will now correct a mistake under which both yourself & Mr. Isaac Hayne are labouring.  You think I wrote my letter in a state of irritation caused by the attack in the Mercury on my husband, so far from it, I did not know of the peice until I was about closing my letter.  I only knew of the two slights I mentioned ; was not aware that a much greater one was even then on the way.  The Mercury need not have been�.; even if I intercepted it as supposed; for there are many Mercury�s taken here, so my husband would be sure to have seen it, & he takes it himself now.  He takes papers of both parties.  He wishes to see both sides, that his mind may be enlightened, & he be able to judge correctly, & come to right conclusions, which he could not if he confined himself to only one side of the question.  My letter need not have been returned with the idea that I was acting in an underhand manner.  For fear that I might be making the matter of too much importance I asked my husband first, if he had any objections to my writing on the subject, & he said none at all, & to be certain I had written nothing  he disapproved of, I gave it to him to read before I sealed it, & he approved of it entirely.  I hope next week he will write to you & tell you this himself, for he does not regard the case as at all difficult, or treat with the least severity, the �ullation of his Wifes feelings, & how can he, when those feelings originated from his own.  I intend however to submit this letter to him, so when you receive it you will know that he has endorsed it.  It would be a matter of pain to me, to write one line that he disapproved. To enable you to judge correctly, I will have to go as far back as your last letter to Mamma.  I read it with pleasure, & said to Maj. Perry, Aunt Eliza has sent me a kind message & begged me to write & speaks well of you.  I hardly think she knows Cousin Isaac sent back the paper.  I am sure she would not have approved of it, so I believe I will write to her & if you have no objection I will mention how hurt we have been.  He said he had none at all, so a few days after I wrote, he came in while I was writing, & I told him to whom I was writing.  He went to his Office & to my surprise returned in a very short time with a newspaper in his hand & indignation expressed in his countenance.  The Mail had just arrived & I saw he had received something that displeased him.  He said just see what an insolent peice Col. Isaac Hayne has written in reply to that incidental remark of mine about him in the Patriot, & he has sent it to me himself.  I ought to send it back to him, but that would be making it of too much importance.  I said is the peice disrespectful to you.  He said he calls the Greenville paper instead of the Southern Patriot, & instead of the Citizens of Greenville, says the Greenville people.  It is written in a sneering tone throughout, & does not contradict once the assertion I made that he was opposed to secession, but quotes long extracts from old speeches of Judge Cheves & others proving they hate the Union, which I knew before, & begs to have it published in the Southern Patriot, but of course I will not do that.  I gleaned over the peice & saw it very disrespectful, as the manner in which he asks why were not Mr. Memmingers opinions mentioned, & hinting that his could not be misrepresented as the others were, as the Greenville people had heard him themselves, so I gave the paper back & said I do not care to read it.  I am about closing Aunt Eliza�s letter.  I have no room to mention this peice & have no time to write another letter, as I wish you to read this before you go to Anderson tomorrow, so he took the paper back to his Office & I finished in a few moments my letter.  After I had done I began to think of the peice, & I was so afraid Maj. Perry would answer it & express his indignant feelings, & trouble would come, that I thought the best plan would be to treat the Mercury after the fashion the Southern Patriot had been treated.  As the views we did not concur in, & sent by me with my compliments it would not be making it a matter of too much importance or give offence either, so I sent Willie to the Office to tell his Papa to send me the paper & not reply to it in any way.  He sent me the paper & said he would not reply to it.  I sealed the paper up & put my compliments on it to show I sent it back & there the matter would rest as I hoped.  When Maj. Perry came home he asked me what I had done with the paper, I told him, & he said very well I have another at my Office if I need it.  I then gave him my letter to read & he approved it.  The next morning early he went to the Office & returned in a few minutes & asked me for the Mercury, that the one he had at his office Mr. Elford had taken away & as he did not intend to publish Col. Haynes peice in the Patriot, it would be necessary to make a few remarks about it.  I gave it to him & he afterwards returned it to me & he drew his pen across my writing to prevent he said my being indicted  for writing on a newspaper.  He that day went to Anderson, & the next day I sent the letter & paper by the same Mail.  I was sorry to send them together knowing it would be thought the letter was the consequence of the paper, but I was loth to keep the paper until the next Mail so despatched them.  When Maj. Perry returned from Anderson, he said the Lawyers & Members of the Legislature & other who were in Columbia last winter told him that it was generally understood there that Col. Hayne was opposed to Secession.  His peice was considered an evasion of the question & Mr. Burt the Editor of the Disunion paper in Pendleton said he felt inclined to give him a�himself, but as it might be the means of sending him  back to the position he first occupied he would not, for he was glad for him to come over to Secession if possible as the party was getting so weak, the whole State seemed to be changing.  I have heard also that Mr. Filmore�s Organ had published the peice & claims Col. Haynes as a Union man.  So Maj. Perry was certainly not far from wrong in the assertion he made, & none of the other gentlemen thought proper to contradict it, & if they had it would [have] been in a different tone, for they would in reality have been actuated by kind feelings & former personal relations.  So far from believing you would approve of the peice , Mamma told me I ought to send it to you to show you how disrespectful it was, & she has been constantly urging me to send you the paper, knowing as she said  you would read with interest anything Maj. Perry wrote, so little can we�of the feelings of each other.  Until you mentioned it I had no idea Wm Ed took the Mountaineer, & if he has taken it for months past, I would know you could have retained your high opinion of Maj. Perry, for until lately, ever since the Memminger meeting, it has been filled up with abuse & misstatements of Maj. Perry.  So the people at last said they were tired of the same subject, & reading the abuse heaped on one man, & many at the last Election voted for him, who never had before  because they said the Mountaineer was so unjust to him.  As you agree with that paper in principle, of course you believe all that is in it, so I am surprised you have a good opinion of one it has so misrepresented.  I am indeed astonished at Wm Ed selecting that paper & supporting it.  Maj. Perry has not admitted it into his house since the Memminger meeting.  It was supposed when he commenced his paper, he would return all the malice & abuse that had been heaped on him, but he has treated them with silent contempt, & though they felt at first relieved to escape what they were dreading, they feel now mortified at no notice being taken of them, & are compelled to be silent themselves.  It is only to know the Editors of the two papers to decide which is most worthy of patronage.  In the Southern Patriot next week there will be extracts from  25 letters from different parts of the Country showing the state of public feeling, some of them from distinguished men.  This gives a more correct idea than anything an Editor can say.  I have been led into a controversy very much against my will.  I am me, for I am no Politician, & do not pretend or wish to be one.  From hearing the subject discussed every day by my husband & others, I do understand the state of parties, & do feel very much interested on the subject, & was very anxious a paper should be established in Greenville advocating views which seemed to me correct, but I trust I am liberal to those who differ from the one I most honor.  I am sure he is, & many think he is not as staunch for the Union as he ought to be, that he speaks of the rights of the South too strongly  & ought to go for the Union above everything, but he pursues the course that he thinks will ensure justice to the South & the stability of the Union also.  

		I have now expressed the motives under which I acted, as they were sanctioned by one superior in wisdom to myself.  I hope now I will be better understood, than I have been, & I feel relieved that what by most here was considered discourteous  & uncalled for, was not looked upon in that light by those from whom the acts proceeded & whom I have been accustomed to respect & love for myself & relations alone even if a stranger to me & regarded in a sacred light & have always tried to serve.
