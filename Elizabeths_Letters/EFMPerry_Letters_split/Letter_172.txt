Letter 172

Thursday night, 12 December [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today.  I was sorry you had not made your speech, & so been able to give me an account of it.  I hope they will not cut you out, as Mr. Memminger was last year.  I see by Mr. Jones remarks he also goes for a Southern Congress, but then adds he is ready to go with the State, & can answer for his constituents.  Of course as he was head of the ticket, he does not oppose you, & as usual goes with both sides.  That is the politic way.  He always manages to keep with you, gain your friends, & have his own friends, & the other side too.  I wonder his vanity did not make him run for Solicitor.  You say the majority agree with you in reality.  It seems�then,  You should be the only one abused.  You ought then to pursue the course they do.  But what made so much opposition to you in Greenville, was your siding with Genl Thompson, & as he is here so little it is a pity, you should be injured by him, but in truth I do dislike him. & think not one of the name to be trusted.  I hope he will never pay more than 200 towards the paper, & that you will return to him as soon as possible.

		I am really sorry you will throw away your money as you do.  It gives me no pleasure to hear of your useless purchases.  A pistol you should have no use for.  The plaster of Paris ornaments we have no place in the Drawing room for. We have so many little ornaments there now, we have no use for more.  Two or three books would have been quite enough.  You never get the kind I like, & you do not read half of them yourself.  We have much need for money.  It distresses me to see you fling it away actually as you do.  I have been living with the greatest economy to enable me to save 10 dollars to buy something warm to wear when I go out this winter, & without thought you spend dollar after dollar for the most useless things.  If you were rich you might indulge your taste for books but you are not rich, & your family get more expensive every year.  But I may as well stop.  If I preached until Doomsday, it would not make you prudent & economical.  Perhaps tel[l]ing you of facts that will ere long make you feel the want of money may have some effect so listen.

		Poor Scott is in a very bad way.  Reuben says at Laurens on his return, Scott in the morning found it difficult to get up.  So when he got home he rested, & has been used I believe but once since he seems to be weak in the loins.  There is a particular spot in the small of the back, that when you touch, he winces & grunts.  Reuben washes it with salt & water, & is doing all he can for it, but he has been sick so long in this way, that I should rather think, he will not be well again, & am afraid even his days are numbered.  One morning Reuben thought he had�himself against the Stable in getting up.  His leg seemed sprained but I do not know if it was so, but I think your Stable is too small, & that may be one reason your horses are so often lame.  Often I hear them knocking against the stable.  You had better have the partition between the Stable & the cutting room taken down.  I hope Scott will get well, but it is best to prepare for the worst, & then where will be the money to get another horse.  How much better to save what you can for such emergencies.  I believe if Col. Irby were to pay you the 1100 which I hope & pray for many a long day he will not.  In a few weeks you would spend every dollar of it, & with no capital yielding interest what in future would your wife & children do, if left without you.

		As Scott is sick, Selim & Byron will have to go for you.  Reuben says they are quite well.  He thinks the journey is too long to be made in two days.  The days are short; the roads perhaps bad so that three days Reuben thinks it will take.  He thinks it was such long days rides that has made Scott so much worse.  Write me what you think.  Reuben shall go for you with Selim & Byron & if the journey shall be made in two or three days going & coming.  You will get this letter Saturday, answer it Sunday, & I will get your answer Tuesday in time to send Reuben Wednesday or Thursday whichever you say.  If I were not to hear from you, I will send him one of those days, whichever he thinks, so as to meet you at Fulkes Friday night.  Tonight Mr. Campbell & Miss Lewis are married.  I suppose by this time they are man & wife.  I had no inclination to go to the wedding, having no looking for him, or to a crowd either.  I believe they leave tomorrow for Augusta or somewhere.  I must not forget to tell you, that Susan was invited to the wedding.  The invitation was sent to old Mrs. McBee�s, & she neglected sending it to Susan, so there is an end to what would always have been a mystery to me.  When Mamma first told me of the slight I told her, she might depend upon it, it was a mistake.  The invitation had been written, & in some way mislaid,, for otherwise there was no accounting for the neglect, for Mr. Arthur would hardly be so unchristian like, as to resent a little mistake, as the Baptism was in this way, after for so long a time being friendly, & if it had been Mrs. Jones she would have influenced against you & me as well as Susan & Mr. McBee, & she is too cat like& stealthy to revenge herself openly, so I am glad it has turned out, as I first thought.

		Anna Williams has lost her oldest child her daughter.  It died yesterday.  The funeral took place this afternoon, so Mr. Arthur attended two very different ceremonies  the same evening.  Last Sunday Mrs. D� who I carried home, told me the little girl was sick with putrid sore throat.  She had the worse throat she ever saw,  In the afternoon Mrs. Williams was at church, so I thought it must be better, but yesterday it died & I dare say it is better for it.  Mrs. Williams has now only one little boy left.

		You must try & enjoy yourself the rest of the Session & it has not been as stormy for you as I supposed it would be.  Stay until the Legislature adjourns.  Do not come a moment sooner, & I will have a good Christmas dinner ready for you.  You know best how long you ought to take to travel home.  Reuben says the two horses Byron & Selim are well, so if you think so, you can come in two days.  I only thought I would tell you Reubens opinion.  We will be very glad to see you all.  Ann begs me to ask you to buy her a viol of Otto of Rose 50 cts, such as you once bought me.  I think you bought it at the Confectioners.  I hope you have looked at the Desks for Mamma, & that you will get my bundle safely Aunt Mary McCall is to send, either by private opportunity or to the Depository directed to you.

		No ploughing has been done yet.  Until this week it has rained incessantly.  Killing the hogs, cutting them up, making Sausage meat &c has taken until today.  Charles, Mary & Lindy are even now, cleaning the feet, & Scott has required attention, so I thought the rest of this week Reuben had better haul wood for us, & a few persons who had asked for it.  Then as next week, he goes for you, it is not worthwhile for so few days ploughing, so he will go on hauling wood, & plough after you come back.  I do not expect to use the horses much this winter.  Good night.  I hope your resolutions will pass, & in your next you will give me an account of your speech.  You must not let yourself be prevented from making a speech.  You do differ, how the outs, not going for Disunion, so they do not wish you to have the opportunity of expressing your opinion.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.  Howd� to Willie & Frank
