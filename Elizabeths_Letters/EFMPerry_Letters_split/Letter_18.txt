Letter 18

My dear husband 

	This is washing day & I have charge of the baby.  She has just gone to sleep & I take the opportunity while she is sleeping to write to you.  Willy woke up directly after you had gone down, before the Stage left the door, & asked where Papa was.  I told him you had gone.  He commenced crying, but stopped when I told him you would come back again.  He speaks frequently of you, which surprises me, as in your late absences from home, he never mentioned you.  He says I sorry Pa gone to Columbia, Pa come back directly.  Pa did not go in his Buggy.  Pa went in the Stage & so I think he has behaved better than usual since you were away.  Anna is quite well and as good and interesting as ever.

	Yesterday I went to church; there was no service in the afternoon as it was communion Sunday.  Susan came for me and I went with the children to Mamma�s for a little while.  Ann had not slept the night before, and felt dreadfully; she said if she slept last night and was better she would come in tomorrow and stay with me a few days, but Mamma sent word this morning she had not closed her eyes all night, and was too sick to come.  She really intended coming if she had been able.

	A Mr. Sutton brought you a letter from Mr. Miles Norton, and Mr. Hamlin brought you one from Spartanburgh from Mr. Henry.  He said he expected it was about business to be done in the Court of Appeals, so I opened it to see if it was necessary to send it to Columbia, but it was not about Law business.  It was about the Wine you promised to send for him, and Mr. Thompson.  He said he doubted whether you had remembered to write for it, and begged you to write immediately for the two quarter casks, for if they did not get it at once, it would be difficult to get it from Hamburgh or Columbia, as the season advanced, on account of the want of Waggons to haul it.  Therefore he begged you to write at once which I suppose you have done long ago.  I told Mr. Hamlin I had lost the key to my door.  He said
He had it hanging up in his store, that he picked it up near the church door, and not knowing whose it was, had hung it where it might be seen & applied for.  I have sent for it, and it is now in the door.  You will be glad to be saved the expense of buying another lock, and which I would have particularly regretted, as it would have been owing to my carelessness.  I will be careful in future. 
	Last Saturday two of Mr. Markley�s men came for the Chicken coop.  They said Mr. Stiles told them to come and take it.  I let it go as I believe you had told Mr. Stiles to send for it.  Saturday morning I heard a noise downstairs as if something had fallen.  I could not think what it was.  The doors and windows were shut so that the wind could not blow anything.  I went down and found Byron�s residence on the floor, or rather near the floor.  Its fall had been stopped by the stand.  It was stuck between the stand and the wall.  Mr. Murphy put the tack into the cord in so slight a manner, that the cord had slipped from the tack, & in that way the picture fell.  It is not at all injured.  The top of the frame has slipped down a little; but you can easily push it up.  I tacked the cord securely & hung up the picture again.
	I have had no trouble with the servants yet, and as I have determined not to be troubled by them, I do not expect to.  Everything in your household goes on as usual, not excepting Rose, who did not as usual come up last night in time to be milked.  George is complaining of a pain  in his shoulder which prevents his working as much as he usually does.
	Two Magnolia�s came last night.  The January and March numbers.  I do not know why those numbers came as you have them already.  The Herald, Courier, Mercury, & a pamphlet from Mr.   also came
	I paid Dr. Crittenden last Saturday 50 cts for the sweet Potatoes George got from him to plant.  You must not expect to hear from me again until Sunday night.  To let you hear Friday night, I would have to write day after tomorrow, and before I had heard from you it is not worthwhile writing so soon only to say we are all well.  I think it more probable Margaret will be here Wednesday & Thursday.  I will write to you Friday, so that you will receive a letter Sunday.  If you go to the Legislature again, I will write every Mail to prevent your being uneasy about home.  It was that reason that made me write to you so often last winter even when I was sick.  I [page torn] not wish anxiety about home to induce you declining to be [page torn] candidate.  I thought my letters would comfort you so, you would be willing to remain in Columbia a few weeks & acquire reputation.  I have been reading the Spartanbuergh Journal this morning.  It predicts War with both Mexico & England, & says we must particularly mark his prediction, that before the first of March, that we will be engaged in War with England, that War will be declared before Congress adjourns.  He says we have nothing to lose, but if I was to lose you, I am sure nothing would repay my loss.  If I had much faith in that Journal, I would be very uneasy.
	The baby has woke up, & needs my attention so I must now close my dear husband, Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
