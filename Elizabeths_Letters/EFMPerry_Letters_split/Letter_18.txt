Letter 18

Wednesday morning, 16 December 1840
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have taken up my pen to write you I hope my last letter, though if the Legislature does not adjourn as soon as you said & you let me know, I will write again.  I hope you will not leave Columbia until the adjournment.  I will be almost sorry to see you if you do.

	I wrote you in my last letter to price Cake Baskets.  I am sorry now that I did.  I am afraid you may think from that, that I wish them, & to please me, [you] may go & buy a pair.  I hope however you have not been so thoughtless as to buy any, for we see so little company, we have not the least use for them.  They are things that last for life, & when bought ought to be very handsome, & very handsome ones cost a great deal of money, & a great deal of money you have not at present, & I would rather you buy them some time hence, when we have more use for them, & will be able to afford to get handsome   ones.  You have bought for the house all that is necessary at present, & I hope you think so too, so trusting that all the anxiety & uneasiness about the baskets has been without foundation, I will leave the subject & turn to another.

	Miss Harrison was here this morning, & invited us all to the Wedding.  She says she wishes us to see the ceremony performed, that only a few will be present there, & the remainder of the Company will come afterwards.  She is to be married Christmas Eve.  It is not put off as we heard.  She says even if she had had a small Wedding as she first intended, she would still have had all of our family at it.  That Richard feels under the greatest obligations to you & of course she would wish you & me invited.  She is to have three Bridesmaids:  Miss Maxwell, Ann and her sister.  I do not know who are the Groomsmen.  Mr. Pinckney I believe is to marry her.

	We went yesterday to the house.  We called for Mrs. McBee & she Miss McBee & Mrs. Carson went with us, the Waggon road, that is back of their house, across to fields to Mamma�s.  Mrs. McBee wished to know if that would not be the shortest road between her & Mamma�s & the best way of communication.  It was quite muddy yesterday as it has rained lately, but in dry weather, it will be quite  a short & pleasant walk.  We afterwards went home with Mrs. McBee and took a cup of Coffee, but could not stay long as we left Ann at home quite unwell.  We were quite disappointed about the Garden fence.  The garden is much larger than we wished it, & the fence is crooked.  It is nearer the Smoke house than it is the Kitchen, and nearer the Stable than the other side of the Lot.  We had wished the house to be in the Middle, and as much of the Garden one side of it as the other.  Instead of that, the fence commences just a little beyond the Smoke house, & the other side almost touches the Stable.  By the Smoke House the fence ought to have been raised far above it.  It would have been a preetty  place for the Garden, away from the horses and pigs.  At any rate the house ought to have been in the middle as you intended, and as it is now, the fence looks quite crooked.  It slants a good deal.  I hope it will look better when it is finished next Monday.  I expect Mamma will move her Furniture.  Mr. Hoke says he will assist her.  He will get a four horse Waggon, & all that is necessary.  He will return home tonight, and with him we hope the box.

	Mr. & Mrs. Croft leave tomorrow.  I have no news to tell you.  I hope I will receive a letter from you tonight.  I have written to you by every mail but one.  I am sure not one of the Members Wives have done that much.  I think you have been very good too in writing.  I expect you have written as often in not oftener than Mr. Earle has written to Miss Harrison, and your time every moment of it occupied, and he perhaps nothing to do.  You a husband & he a lover.

	I went yesterday to see Mrs. Coleman & Mrs. Long, and Shopped also.  Will is quite well.  He is all day in the kitchen and yard.  He is so troublesome in the house having no one to mind him.  By and by when I have a smaller family, I will be able to pay him more attention, and be more careful of him.  Poor little fellow at night when he wakes puts his face against mine to know if I am near him.  He does not speak a single word.  You will not hear him call you Papa when you return.

	I have nothing more to write about, so will now close my letter with two requests, that you will go to see Aunt Brewton, if it is only for a few moments before you leave.  I know that she will be hurt if you do not, and that you will bring me some Morroco.  Believe me your ever attached Wife, E.F. Perry

P.S. I hope you have sent a great many of the Cheraw papers to Greenville.  You ought to request Mr. Wells to publish the portion relating to yourself.
