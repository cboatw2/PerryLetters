Letter 251

Tuesday afternoon, [11 January 1853]
[Greenville]

Dear Anna

	I wrote you a long letter this morning.  I now write only a few lines.  I will send them by Butler Thompson & send the key you asked for.  I will send this letter to Mrs. Robinson & she will give it to Butler Thompson, who I suppose is going with her.  His father a week or two ago said he was.  

	The weather is now clouding over & we will soon have rain again.  

	Write word when Mary Crayton intends returning so I may know when to expect you.  I suppose this month she will return.  Your cousin Eliza said about the 20th of this month.  

       Fanny goes to school, but she prefers staying at home.  She will like it better when you go with her.  I sent to ask Mrs. Mauldin when her daughters were going to school & she sent word, they were not going at all.

	I sent Aunt Mary today the 2 dollars she paid for changing the Cloak.  

	I hope you have received the 40 dollars I sent you safely.

	I write so hurriedly, you must tear up my letters, tear up this one.  I write so much & have other things to do, I write in haste.  Be a good girl.  I hope Mr. Jones or Thompson will bring the Cloak.  Mr. & Mrs. Bacon came to see me this morning & inquired about you.  I told then what Mrs. O�Driscoll said, & that you practiced every day.  Mr. Bacon says he has only 3 scholars now that for a short time in summer he had 23, but he ought to have 30 scholars the whole year round to afford him a support, that if he did not get more scholars he could not live here, but this climate agreed with his health, so he hoped he could get enough to enable him to stay.  I hope he will find you improved.  He says he has no objection to your buying any pretty peices for yourself. 

	Your Grandmama & Aunts send their affectionate love.  Your Grandmama says you write wonderfully well.  She is pleased at Aunt Brewton remembering Willie.  Give my love to your Aunts & cousins, whose kindness to you has been very great, & I know you feel grateful, & will never forget it, & when in your power return it.

	Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is better & Mr. Hodges through very low, is not dead.  The report was not a mistake.

	You must soon buy the work box for Aunt Eliza as a testimony of your love for her, & a proof you feel gratified for her kindness.  Your affectionate mother, E.F. Perry
P.S.  Get a Cornelian ring for yourself & one for Fanny.  Her silver comb I will give to Annie, which is more valuable than a ring.  Buy 2 dolls for Fanny & Annie.  You can dress them when you return & a small doll to L�a knife with 2 blades for Willie & Frank, not expensive ones.

[The remainder of this text is a letter of January 1853.  These pages were mounted with the letter of 11 January.  The first sheet is not present.]

	�like to get for yourself you may.  The knives for Willie & Frank need not be fine ones, as they will soon lose them.  Put on paper a list of what I have mentioned in this letter.  Your Aunt Annie wishes �Nelly was a Lady[.�]  The 75 cts for Music that was charged to you, your Grandmama wishes to add to her bit, so that 75 cts you will have to add to your money to buy something with.  I you need a thick pr of shoes for school, you had best get them now.  I hope to be able to get some more pocket handkerchiefs, as need more.  If I write for them, I will wish some at 16 cts, for you, & marked with your name  & some for 25 cts marked with mine.

	Mrs. Sam Town[e]s is getting better, & sent word she would be glad to see me.  At the time Mr. Town[e]s was abusing your papa in his paper, I would not take pleasure in visiting his family, so gave her up, but your Papa has forgiven him, & Mr. Town[e]s looks to him to do more for him than anyone. A great change has taken place & the very persons who during political excitement abuse your Papa the most, are now writing to him. to use his influence with Genl Pierce to give them Offices.  They say your Papa writes for them, would have an effect, more than anyone else.  He does for them, & those who have injured him, what he would not do for himself.

	I will go to see Mrs. Town[e]s when the roads are good.  Now they are at most impassable.  I dare say it will not be before you return.  You can go with me.

	I will call Julia Sharpe to keep the seat at her desk for you.  I am certain she will.  Except Miss Hopkins there is no other school for girls.  

	I hope Clara will be a valuable servant for you by & by; then her wages can even support you.  Margaret says she can do everything except make Pastry, & that that she would soon learn.  Our servants are so expensive now, the supporting them &c, that if it were not for the hope of future profit, we would be obliged to sell them.  Eliza�s baby is a month old Monday.  Then Sarah will go back to Margaret, who I hope will take her, through she sent word she did not care for her.  She is useless here, & get[t]ing into bad habits.  Eliza�s influence & example to her children is so bad, I would be thankful if we could get rid of her.  Johnny at present seems a good boy.

	Give my love to all my Aunts.  If Aunt Harriet is at Mr. W�, ask Aunt Eliza to write to her, & beg her to come down for one day & see you.  It is only a short ride, & I am certain if she knew you were in town, she would come & see you.  I will send you stamps in this letter.  When they give out, it would be well to buy some.

	Aunt Anna�s friend was a pious lady, & so afflicted, that her death must have been a blessing, as they have every reason I hope to think she is happy now.

	Mr. Elford has money of your Papa�s. but has had no settlement since he returned. So I do not know wat he bought for me.   

	Mr. Wm Watson I believe goes to town soon.  I had just written this sentence when your Papa came in & brought Mr. Elford�s bills.  He has bought the nest of baskets, the Calico for Comforts, the Fender, Andirons, shovel & tongs, broom & bellows, the nest of baskets is 3.87.  Mama I expect will take some of them, the Calico 6 ? a yd, the other things $18.19 cts.

	I have just heard Mr. Hodges is dead, that he was resigned, he had no children, & his Wife & himself not very happy.  Mr. Henry Thompson & your Papa got elected to Commissioner of�& he came this morning to ask if he would appoint his son Henry as keeper of the gate, which Mr. Hodges used to keep; that Henry will stay at Mrs. Hodges, keep the gate, & keep school at the same time, & attend to his studies.  He will make several hundred dollars a year, & is only 17.  You see when persons are poor & thrown on their own resource, how they manage to support themselves, & at the same time improve their Character & acquire habits of industry, they make their own fortunes, whereas, if their parents had a few hundreds to give them, they think themselves above work. & become idle & dissipated & ruined characters.  I am glad there is at last something cheering for Mrs. Thompson.  She has sent repeatedly to ask if there was bundle here for her, but I have heard of none that was coming for her, unless some of her friends intend sending one by you.  If Charlotte Smith hears of your being in town, I dare say she will send a bundle.
