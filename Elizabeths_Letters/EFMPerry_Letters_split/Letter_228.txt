Letter 228

Dear Anna 

	I received a letter from you this morning, & am very glad to hear from you.  I have written to you very often.  I would have written oftener, but every day I write one letter to your Papa & sometimes two.  The Mail sometimes brings no letter.  I write & tell so, & afterwards, some gentleman sends me a letter they have brought, & then I have to write again to say I have heard.  I have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read.  This is a gloomy, cold day, & I think it will cheer them up, to hear a little news from Charleston.  Vardry & Alex are over there.  Alex has the Measles.  Vardry will be glad to hear about his knife & Sugar dogs that you have not forgotten him, but I think a knife a dangerous present for so little a boy.  You had better bring him something else.  If you can think of something better, a Story book he would like.  He is fond of hearing stories read, buy some suitable play thing he would like, a little wagon or something of that kind.  Annie will be glad of the Doll.  You had better bring both hers & Fanny�s ready dressed, buy a large head for the large doll, the largest you can find I expect will not be too large.  The present head is broke, & a head for the other body that once had a China head also get.  That one will be small & not cost much & will do for Fanny to play with every day.  The doll ready dressed Fanny will use only on particular occasions.  The large doll is to teach you how to work, & as the body costs so much, it is a pity for it to be without a head, which is the reason I wish you to bring a head for it.  If your money gives out, get Aunt Eliza to lend you, & I will return it when I send money to pay for what I yesterday wrote Eliza to buy for me, or after your Papa can be done without, that it still takes a great deal more money than one at first supposes.  Now in town, it is such a good opportunity to buy what cannot be got here, & there is so much to tempt, that I am willing to gratify you now, knowing you will be willing to deny yourself hereafter.  The new bonnet you have bought will last a long time this winter, next summer & next winter you can wear it.  I am sorry your Cloak has not been made before.  You ought to have had it soon after your arrival, for the weather has been such as to make you need it.  I hope it is now made; it must be very pretty material, & your bonnet must be  very pretty also.  Tell your cousin Eliza she must get me a pretty one.  I wish you to get a new dress, & am sorry you did not get it immediately after your arrival.  You ought to have had it to wear visiting among your friends, & you must get it now & have it made up soon, so it may be of use to you before you leave.  I wish it for your dress frock all winter.  A bonnet for Fanny like yours will be pretty, & if you can find a Worsted Cloak large enough for her, get it.  I intended buying one for Annie, but Susan has had a Cloak altered for her, which will answer for the winter, & she says she prefers my giving her something else. What was the price of your Silver Comb?  I hope Eliza will write to me soon.  I have been expecting a letter from Aunt Eliza.  Ask her why she does not write.  I am glad you are enjoying yourself so much, & meet the approbation of your Aunts.  Tell Aunt Anna Hayne I am gratified at her good opinion of you.  Icey Frank as soon as he was aware he had curls begged me to cut them off, as they were too girlish for him, that he is not the pretty curly headed boy as she may see from his likeness, but a fine looking handsome manly boy, & his appearance even if he does not deserve it makes him a favorite with everyone.  Tell her the likenesses did justice to none of the children but you.  That Willie is a smart sensible boy, useful & manly, drives us, & hauls wood, & cuts wood, & then comes in the house & reads, but still has that mischievous temper that will indulge itself in teasing & playing.  He means no harm by it.  He is alive to the ridiculous, & has a satirical vein, which your Grandmama thinks he inherits from her family, and he cannot help amusing himself with his brothers & sisters but as he grows older he gets better, & your Papa says he is a good boy, & he is no flatterer.  Fanny is warm hearted & affectionate, lively, & your Papa says the prettiest & smartest of all.  She yesterday said, �if I die first, I give all my play things to Anna.�  She says she longs for you to return.  She came out of the kitchen this morning very much offended Becky had turned her out.  The Lard is drying in the kitchen & it is crowded & confused, & it is no place for her, so Becky was right, but she came in crying, & asked me if Papa had given the children to Becky. & if Dr. Irvine had built that kitchen for even Priscilla had told her to go out.  Hext is today 18 months old, a baby yet, for he is not weaned, & nurses at night more than ever.  His eye is almost well.  At least his eyebrow there will be a little mark always on his eyebrow, but it will not be observed.  He is quite well.

	Priscilla was here doing nothing, & in the way, so yesterday you Grandmama was here, & I told her she had better ask Mrs. Irvine to let her stay with her, so she did, & Mrs. Irvine said she might & this morning she went over.  She can bring in wood & wait on your Aunt Annie & come in on messages, & I hope will be useful.  Catherine is of no use at all except to mind her Mothers child, & yet your Grandmama pays 1 dollar a month for her & is obliged to, while she keeps B�.  Mary minds Isaac.  If Mama parts with � & can get no one better, I am going to let her have Lindy.  As Becky is here, we have more servants than we can afford, so will hire out Lindy to your Grandmother for less than to anyone else, so I hope she will do well, for it will be well for her to have a family servant there, & one who cares for her, & make up to us the expense of buying Becky, which was very unexpected.  Lindy still has Rheumatism in her feet, but is able to work, & by Spring I hope will be able to go to your Grandmama�s.  I received two letters from your Papa today.  He says the Legislature may not adjourn until Friday.  He says he is anxious to return home to see his Wife & children who he loves better than fame, honors, distinction, property or anything besides, that though he has been passing his time very pleasantly, after two weeks�he always gets homesick.  He mentions having heard from you.  Your visit to the City must not make you discontented with the country, but on your return you must contribute your share towards the happiness of the home circle.  Your Papa had received a large box from town.  Your have seen Mrs. Elford I expect�your clothes.  E.F.P.
