Letter 166

Sunday.  I will add a little more now, though not of much importance.  I read the services at home this morning, & sent Anna & Frank to church.  This afternoon we rode to Susans.  She is quite well.  The baby suffers a good deal with cholic.

		Charles tells me that Col. Irvine has sold Jim as a first rate Carpenter for 900 dollars, to someone in Aiken.  He forgot when he was selling him for himself of that protuberance, which would always prevent his being a Saleable negro, and he forgot he bought him from you as a learner in his trade.  How Drovers do deceive they live by cheating.

		Mr. Ford is Mamma�S first cousin.  He is very wor�, is poor, & has a large family, so vote for him, & get Mr. Duncan & Col. Brockman, & as many others as you can influence Col. Dudley & Mr. Goodwin &c.  The two Heywards who are members, are also our cousins.  If you come in contact with them, be polite.  Indeed you ought to be friendly & polite to all the Members & it will make them kindly disposed to you.

		I am afraid you will spend too much money in buying books for Willie.  I would like him gratified, but you will have need for money when you come home in paying Anna�s school bills which will be large, your Doctors bills &c.

		I forgot to tell you that Miss Anderson does not wish what Mr. Cox told her repeated.  She says he spoke rather in confidence.  Her objection to Mr. Arthur is that he leans to P�terism, but this also they told me as a great secret, so you must not repeat it.

		I am glad Col. Preston has been elected to the College, & hope Mr. Barnwell will be reelected Senator.  Mr. Rhett has tried too hard.  Mr. Barnwell is better than either himself or Mr. Hammond.  It would be very bad for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor now, as he goes so for Disunion.  

		As regards the Chancellorship, you know I would rather you be Chancellor or Judge than anything else, so when you think there is a chance of you being elected, you must for my sake, try.  I think when your friends propose it to you, you are wrong to decline, you ought to let them electioneer for you, & ascertain what your strength is, & then if you find your prospect not good, it is time enough to decline.  What I blame you for is refusing too soon, so in future act more wisely.  Others know better how you would run than you do yourself, so  you ought to let them ascertain, & then determine.  I am sure you are superior to the other Candidates, & the Upper Country needs a Chancellor.  The other two Candidates being from the lower country would divide the votes, so perhaps one from the Upper Country would run well.  Col. Dawkins & Whitner have no claims as Judge I am sure,  for they are�of them are superior.  You know how things are better than I do.  All I say is, you must not decline what honors are offered to you too soon; by waiting awhile, you might find things in your favor.  Genl Whitner did not vote for you for Congress.  It is raining now.  All day has been damp & drizzly.  The winter continues so warm, there is no prospect of killing hogs now.  I am sorry I have so bad a pen.  I dislike sending so shabby a letter.  I wish you would write me several sheets every Mail.  I long for the time when I will hear every day.  Tell Willie & Frank Howdy & to behave well.  Fanny was looking at my picture the other day, & she said, �this is Fanny�s Mother.�  Good night, your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
