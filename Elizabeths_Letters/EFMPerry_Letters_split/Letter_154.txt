Letter 154

		Monday I dined at Mamma�s.  She walked in to see me.  Fanny & myself walked back with her.  I spent a pleasant day.  Yesterday we all dined at Susans.  Willie & Frank came out after morning school.  I spent a very pleasant day.  Speaking of Mr. Erwin Jones, Mr. McBee said if he ran for the Legislature, he would not run far, & as for being Solicitor he stood no chance for the Greenville Delegation even would not vote for him, that you he knew would not, nor Col. Town[e]s &c; said if you ran for the Legislature, which he seemed to think was a thing of course, you would be elected.  I expect it is thought such a settled matter that no one has thought it worthwhile to ask you.  Frank is still head.  Fanny talks as usual of you, & we all long to see you.  I hope gain or not, Dr. Anderson will pay you some of the fee you charge that you will come home with a purse full.  I know of no news to tell you.  The rain will I hope make our seed come up, & perhaps tomorrow it will clear, & the Corn can be planted.  I wish a good deal planted as you will have 3 hands & 3 horses all summer.

		I hope to hear from you tonight, & now having said all I possibly can say except that one letter came for you last night, from a Mr. Fisher or some such name from Augusta which does not seem of much importance.  I remain your attached, dutiful wife. E.F.P.

P.S. If Dr. Anderson does not pay you, be sure & make him give you his note, which will be as well, perhaps better.

I do not wish Col. Irby to pay you, so if he offers to, decline.  I wish his note to accumulate for years as it is such a good Compound Interest�him keep it as long as he will.
