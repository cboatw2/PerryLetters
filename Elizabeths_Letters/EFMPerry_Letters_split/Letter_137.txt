Letter 137

Saturday night, 27 October 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

		Mr Elford  has just been here to say he will take this letter to you from me tomorrow, & that he believed he was the only Lawyer going.  I intended of course writing, even before he came.  It seems an age since I saw you.  If you stay away much longer, I will forget I have a husband.  Mrs. Dub� has ben with me a great deal, but still I have missed you.  You are the only one, to whom I tell all my thoughts.  Much as I miss you, I am thankful that you have business to detain you.  You cannot have too much of that, & love must be secondary to business.  We are all well.  Willie & Anna have been going steadily to school.  Frank I have kept at home a few days to rest from his studies &�, but I will send him again on Monday.  Dr. Simons moved to his Farm yesterday & gave the boys holiday, so Willie & Frank went to the Farm to dig Potatoes & earned 5 cts a peice.  The Potatoes now have all been dug.  Amounting to 1 bushel, & Ground nuts about a ? bushels.  The Corn hauled, 12 loads altogether from that field, good loads, Charles says, & the hogs today were turned in.  The rainy spell made it later, than it otherwise would have been.  I must now tell you all I have seen & done since you left.  Last Saturday Mrs. Henry L. Pinckney sent me a newspaper from the Mansion House.  It rained until Monday so I could not go to see her, but Monday afternoon I sent word I would call for herself & Mr. Pinckney to take a ride (it is the only time I�the carri[a]ge).  I did so & found them very [page torn] they enjoyed the ride extremely, were delighted [page torn] �tain scenery, the variety in the foliage &c.  The next morning they paid me a visit.  I showed them your Library, busts, pictures &c.  They admired them, & Mr. Pinckney said I had an Earthly Paradise, & asked if I did not think so.  I told him no.  He said he thought so, no one was contented.  On going away he shook me warmly by the hand, & said I must tell you, when he determined to come to Greenville.  The chief pleasure he promised himself was the seeing & conversing with you.  Mamma carried them to ride Tuesday, & to see Susan & also Ann who was with Susan.  Mr. Pinckney was quite overcome at the meeting.  They all observed it, & Mrs. Pinckney afterwards in Mamma�s presence what had affected him so.  He said �really when he thought to himself, that there before him was Susan Hayne & her children.  It brought the past so vividly to his mind, that it wholly overcame him.�  Mamma used to be intimate with him & his family, & she says the seeing her, no doubt brought his first Wife, to whom he was passionately attached to her through & that affected him.  He seems to have an affectionate heart & this visit of himself & Mrs. Pinckney was a very pleasant one & different from anything we anticipated.  They left Wednesday.  Tuesday morning I sent for Mrs. Dr. Simons to come & go with me to the Mansion House to see some of her relations who were there, some of whom we used to know, Mrs. Keating Simons & Mr. G� Simons daughters.  They returned the visit yesterday.  Mamma met Mr. G� Simon & he told her his Wife who was an old friend of hers had given him express orders to see her, when he came here.  Mrs. Dr. Simons came with the others to see me.  She seems good & I wish for her sake Dr. Simons would do well.  They intend staying at the farm the remainder of this year.  They have no equipage , so she [page torn] expect to come in at all.  Next year if they do not get the [page torn] �tend hiring Mrs. Seviers house,   She only asks�a year.  Mr. Bradshaw had engaged Dr. Austins house & had 60 Scholars pledged to him but lo! Good luck has come to him, he has had an offer from Pickensville Alabama of a school with several hundred scholars & some thousands dollars of Salary, & of course he has accepted.  Mrs. Dub� heard this.  It is well if he goes, for he would have�with the Academy & returned to stay here he said, as long as he chose.  He leaves the 1st of December, & that is before the time we paid him up to for Anna.  Miss Randolph was married Thursday night to a Mr. Jay.   Mr. Memminger is at the Mansion House.  It is pretty full, but a good many may leave on Monday.  Did you know that one of Genl Thompsons black horses was dead.  He drove them to Edgefield too hard, & then they were fed improperly, & one of them died.  How unfortunate!  I dined one day at Susans this week.  Mrs. Dub� is tonight at Mrs. Beatties.  She will return here tomorrow night, & Monday set off for Pickens.  She has staid here the greater part of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have liked of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have likedrt of her time.  It has prevented my feeling so lonely, which I have liked, but it has made my expenses greater.  I have had to buy Butter & Eggs constantly at a high price & Fowls &c so I have not been able to make your money hold out as I intended.  I was obliged to buy Shoes for Mary, & pay a dollar for Beef to a man Mr. Wade had sold for & bought a Calico dress for myself  & some Clothes for Willie & other expenses, too numerous to mention, so I borrowed a 5 dollar from Mamma.  Some of these things have been bought a little sooner than I expected, as Eliza was ready to make them.  I thought I had better buy them.  I bought Sugar, Coffee & Tea for Mrs. D�Oyley the day after you left.  I hope you will come back with a purse full.  I also paid Mr. Waddill for making my screen, which I had almost forgot to mention, so you can see I had a great deal to do with my money; bought Frank a coat also, & myself a pr of Gaiterboots.  The weather has been delightful all this week.  Reuben says next week he will build the tops you had out.  [Page torn] the next field has done well.  Our meat has given out.  Monday I must try & get some to last till you return.  Dr. Austins family are still sick, a servant died last Saturday, & a daughter is very ill.  I was disappointed you did not write me longer letters & tell me more.  I thought you would have given me the particulars of the Rail Road Meeting.  I suppose you are reserving something to tell me.  A good many letters have come for you.  I think I will send them to you by Mr. Elford.  They may interest you.  The one from Mr. Bowen was brought this afternoon.  Only one person that I know of, has been to the house to inquire for you, some one when I was away.  Col.  Dunham sent for you tonight.  I suppose there is a meeting of the Trustees.  I have been reading on in Miss P��s Loiuis 14th.  I do not like Madame Maintenon.  She was an artful woman.  Mr. Joe Long is better.  Ann� was at Mrs. Mauldins today  & went up with Betty into his room & saw there a gentleman who told her he saw you this morning, & you were well.  Fanny is as sweet & affectionate as ever.  She sleeps with me, & will not let me turn my face away from her.  She says Pa has gone to buy her Candy.  She calls Mrs. Dub��& Fel�, Delia.  The Village looks quite full.  The Yellow fever has kept the strangers a longer time than usual.  It is said to be on the increase now.  I suppose you are anxious to get home & have a little time to stay when you do come.  I believe the Dr. Crofts with their families have left.  Mr. Poinsetts & Mrs. Lowndes families are still here.  Mrs. Dub� told me she heard, Mr. Watson had decided against Miss Green in the Will case.  I hope this is so.  You must write me by every Lawyer returning from Pickens to Greenville.  The household are well, including horses, Hogs &c.  I long to ride on Horseback again & in the Buggy.  The Ladies of the Wor� Society were to meet today to determine what to do with their surplus money.  Mrs. Alston wishes it given to Mrs. Carruth  & Mary Bradshaw.  I did not attend the meeting [page torn] busy at home.  I sent word to Miss Crittenden to vote for me.  I heard she [page torn] to Mary Bradshaw.  I have finished my sheet & remain Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
