Letter 256

Friday morning, 1 oclock, 6 May 1853
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have just returned from shopping & will write to you.  The few lines you wrote enclosing Susan�s letter, is all I have heard from you since I left Columbia.  A servant goes to the Post Office every day.  I hope today after the Cars arrive I may hear.

	I have had to buy things for Susan Hoke, Mamma, Susan & myself, & the shopping is dreadfully fatiguing.  Yesterday & the day before after shopping, I had to dine out, so at night I was very tired.  I have almost finished shopping now, so I will not be so fatigued.  Things are higher than I expected, so I have spent much more than I had any idea of, & more than at the time I am aware of until the bills are made out, but after this, I will be economical. 

	I long to see you.  It is not worth the expense for you to come down to see me, & go back & come down for me, so one trip seems sufficient, but as soon as your business is done, come for me, & write me word when you think you will come.  I would like to know. 

	I was truly sorry to hear of Eliza�s death.  I could not realize she was going to die, & had a faint hope she would recover.  She will be such a loss to me, having for 11 years done my work, that I do not know how I can do without her.  Clara I wish to stay with Margaret until Jany to finish her trade, as this year is the most important.  She is to learn to cut & fit, but she must sleep at home every night, to attend to the baby, & I hope when I have pressing work to do, Margaret will let me have her.  I am sorry for Eliza�s children & Missy, & will do a good part by them & never part with them.  Susan�s account was quite affecting & I hope Eliza is happy now.
	I dined yesterday at Aunt Eliza�s, spent a pleasant time, & in the afternoon walked on the Battery.  Today I am at the boarding house, & am glad of a rest.

	No Bishop has been elected yet.  Mr. Leary called today while I was out, & Mrs. H� Simons, & Mrs. Bay & Mrs. Crawford yesterday, & Mrs. Henry Pinckney & family, Mrs. O�Driscoll, Mrs. Ramsay.  Persons have not yet found out I am in town.

	Yesterday Uncle Arthur intended asking me to dine but I was engaged to Aunt Eliza�s.  I saw Aunt Emily at Aunt Eliza�s.

	I will keep my letter open until the afternoon when I hope I will hear from you.  You must write of[ten] or I will get homesick.  

	As I do not know when the letters will come, I will close this.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.   

Benjamin Perry
