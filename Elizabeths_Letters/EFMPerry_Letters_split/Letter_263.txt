Letter 263

Thursday, 12 oclock, 12 May [1853]
Charleston
My dear husband

	I have just received your letter in which you say we must go to Columbia Monday.  I hope you will be able to come down Saturday, & stay here Sunday & Monday, & then we will all go back Tuesday,  My two weeks will then be up, but if it is impossible for you to come down, Tuesday I will go back.  Alston today is to send me some money at least bring it at 2 oclock, & with that I will make Mamma�s purchases.  He will bring me more than 100, the interest due her in a few days.  I will spend out of it for myself what I need & you can return it to her, so that will be better than you sending me any more money.  My dear husband you are very good in supplying your wife with money.  You know it is so pleasant for one to be able to buy things when they are in a City, & see so many things they wish.  It makes me love you more & more.  Mr. Leary is very much mistaken in saying it is unsafe to be here.  There is no danger until July.  I am up in the 4th story above all impure atmosphere .  The weather I have not found at all hot.  The muskutoes  are not very bad, persons laugh at the idea of there being any danger.  Many have not even come down from the country.  Uncle Arthur comes to see me almost every day, & will be very glad to see you.  Alston said he would be very glad to see you, & I would like very much for you to see my relations, so you must come Saturday & stay a few days, & beg them not to call your cases until you return.  I will not be able to go up before Tuesday.  My dress is at a Mantua maker & I do not know how to get it from her.  I have to return visits & shop.   I have not been able to shop for fear the money I had, I would have to pay board.  I asked Mrs. Davis today her terms.  She says 12 for me 6 for Anna a week.  This is a very pleasant house for a lady to be at.  Mr. Julius Pringle came yesterday, & Mr. & Mrs. Richard Lowndes.  I dined yesterday at Aunt Mary McCall�s & drank tea at Aunt Emilys.  Tonight [I] am to take tea at Aunt Haynes & tomorrow dine at Aunt Anna Turnbulls.

	Franks is a very good letter.  He does not need a gun.  You have one at home will do for him.  Write me by return Mail whether you can come.  You will get this letter Friday afternoon.  You had better come down Sunday; if you cannot leave Saturday, stay here Monday & Tuesday & go back Wednesday & make arrangements for your cases to be called Thursday & we return to Greenville Saturday.
	
	I am glad you have bought clothes for yourself & take great pride in seeing you look well.  I am taken for a Miss in King st. by the Store keepers.  I am thought to be sixteen, so I wish you to look as if you were 30, & not be taken for my father any more.  

	A change does great good.  I will enjoy my home & have enjoyed myself here, & long to see Hext.  If you would get business I would like you to live in Charleston, but you seem wedded to Greenville.  Susan�s troubles have made me dislike Greenville.  I would be glad to go to some other place.

	I will price Clara here, & look at groceries, but hope you will be here with me to purchase them.  I am very near Klin�s.  This morning Anna & myself walked up to see Aunt Susan Hayne.  She invited us to dine Friday, but I am engaged to Aunt Anna Turnbull.  Uncle Arthur lives handsomely.  So does Aunt Mary McCall. & Aunt Emily, & all my relations live comfortably.  Aunt Anna Turnbull could live handsomely, but she is too economical.  

	Mrs. Bull comes down tomorrow[,] stays a day & then goes to Columbia.  After that Aunt Anna says I must stay with her, but I will be gone.

After dinner.  I have just sent to the office & received no letter.  Perhaps the Cars have not come.  While at dinner I received an invitation from Miss Drayton to take tea there tomorrow to meet Mrs. Ford her sister.  She invited you also, if you were here.  I have accepted it.  Will dine at Aunt Anna�s & take tea there this afternoon.  I am going to visit tomorrow.  I am going to shop before I dine out, so you see I have my hands full.  For S�day as yet I have no engagement, but dare say I will have.  Eloisa Martin invited me to stay with her, but has not invited me to tea or dinner.  Her health is bad perhaps is the reason.  Mrs. John Cunningham has been to see me but I was out.  I do not feel at all fatigued, never felt better, so you must not be uneasy.  Just suit yourself about coming down, perhaps by the beginning of next week you will get through your business & can come.

	I will now close & write to Susan.  All I say is I would rather stay here than in Columbia, & hope you can come for me.  Come down Sunday, stay a few days, & return about Wednesday or Thursday.  You had better go to the Charleston Hotel as soon as you arrive, record your name, so your friends may know you are here & then leave word you are coming to Mrs. D� M� home.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
