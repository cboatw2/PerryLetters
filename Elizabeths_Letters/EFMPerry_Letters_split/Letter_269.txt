Letter 269

Friday morning, [May 1853]

My dear husband

	If you think your business will not come on for some time yet, & that I will be detained in Columbia several days suppose you let me stay here a few days longer, as I prefer being here to Columbia, & I will be very much hurried  to get through by Tuesday.  Cannot you come down Monday  stay Tuesday & Wednesday & go back Thursday.  Tell them not to call your cases until you return.  [I] would like to be here until the middle of next week, so as to be able to finish my business & return my visits, but still I wish you to come for me.  It is perfectly safe here.  Everybody laughs at your thinking there is any danger.  Mr. Leary is very foolish.  I dare say you can ascertain by looking at the docket when your cases will be called, & make your arrangements accordingly.  

	Today I dine at Aunt Turnbulls, tonight take tea at Miss Draytons, tomorrow at Mrs. Martins.  I have to return visits & shop, & would be glad if it suited you to come down the middle of next week.  I wish you to stay a few days.  I never felt better.  I wish your cases would be called the first of the week & afterwards you come down.  If I am to stay either place, it had better be here, but I am not one to stay here longer than the middle of the week.  By that time I can get through but I wish you to come for me.  So now you know my wishes.  If possible you must make your movements correspond if possible.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
