Letter 78

Monday morning, 20 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I was delighted last night to receive two letters from you.  I wish you would write to me every day.  Your letters are the brightest spot in my existence now.  Still I do not wish the writing to me, to interfere with any other engagement, particularly the writing for the Mountaineer, which I hope you continue to do.  At Washington there is so much to write about, that you ought to have written several letters from there.  You could have given such an interesting account of the distinguished men you saw,  Mr. Webster, Mr. Adams &c., & descriptions of men are always interesting.  Instead of lying on the bed all day Sunday, you ought first to have written a long letter for the Mountaineer.  I am glad you staid longer in Washington than you first proposed.  3 weeks would not have been too long, to allow you to become acquainted with all worthy of your acquaintance.  I am pleased at your seeing Commander Shubrick.  He used to be very handsome.  Mrs. Butler is so anxious you should see her brother.  She said he is in Washington, & she sent yesterday to know if I had heard from you, & if you had mentioned him.  You must certainly go to N London where you will see Mrs. Rogers, & at N Port where you will certainly go.  You must see her nephew Dr. Perry & her sister in law the widow of Commodore Perry & in writing to me mention them, for she comes often to see me, & thinks of course I have news of her friends to tell her, & I am sorry to disappoint her.  I hope the travelling with Col. Fair will not prevent your delivering your letters of introduction.  I wish you had followed the advice I gave you in my second letter & travelled alone.  A companion will certainly interfere with your movements, but as you have been so unwise to take one, you must not let him interfere, but go wherever you wish.  You must certainly see Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Wright &c., as Mr. Poinsett was so good to you.  Perhaps before you come back you had better write to him, & tell him of his friends.  My dear husband, how I wish you would always be in such good society as that at Washington, though I miss you so much.  My love for you is disinterested, that I am willing to bear the pain of separation, so that you are in a situation suited to a man of your talents & character & among friends who can appreciate you.  I am more anxious than ever that you should represent the people at Washington, for if such inferior men are sent there, how much more important it is, that there should be some among them capable of judging & acting for the best interest of the country.  You can then become a great man, or at least be known as a great man, for you have all the ingredients of one already.  Hoping my ambition is not sinful, as it is for my country, & that one day it will be gratified.  I will drop the subject.  How much you will have to tell me when you return.  It is worthwhile travelling on that account.  I wrote two letters to you at Washington, both of which you ought to have received a few days after you arrived there.  I have written to you at N York, & sent one also by Mr. Swandale, which he was to leave at the Atlantic Hotel if he found you had put up there, with Mr. Anderson, if not deposit it in the post office.  It is unpleasant writing not knowing where to direct, & I have to tell you with mentioning the purchases in every letter, for fear you may not receive any of them.  You must write me how your funds hold out, & whether travelling has been more or less expensive than you anticipated.  If I had a clue to how much money you could spare, I would regulate my commissions accordingly, as it is I mention all I wish, & leave you to get what you can afford, & also think best.  Mamma wishes you to get for her Masselons sermons, & The lady of the Manor by Mrs. Sherwood plainly bound.  She does not care for Percy Anecdotes which I mentioned in my last letter.  I wish a black or blue black silk dress.  You must get what the merchant says is fashionable, for now a particular style may be worn.  Sometimes they are striped, sometimes plain &c.  Get what is worn now, & as many yds as are sold for a dress & cape.  I mention the black silk, because I wish one, & suppose they can be got cheaper in N York than anywhere else.  I wish also a bag to put my pocket handkerchief in, & I would like you if you see pretty ones, to get a thin large shawl, what are called Barage shawls are worn here, & I believe cost 5 dollars, so in N York they would be cheaper.  I would not give more than 5 dollars.  They are generally white, with coloured or white stripes crossing each way.  I leave it to your taste to , we select a pretty one, except pink which is too fine.  You may select any other, Lilac or Blue stripes, or white stripes would be pretty.  I wish 2 pins gold or some other kind that is plain, to pin my shawl or mantle on the shoulders.  I am shamed now to go on with the Musical box & the Bracelet, which you must not get, unless you have the money & can afford, & the price is reasonable.  I would like you to bring a bag for Susan, & something for Ann, & if the money still holds out, buy a set of Coral such as baby�s wear.  It consists of a necklace for the neck, & a pr for the sleeves.  I would like to make them a present for Susan.  I have never made her a present since she was married.  Ask for �Coral beads for the neck & dress.�  Willie says bring him plenty of pretty little books with pictures.  Anna�s wishes are innumerable, like mine.  Frank wants a whip & trumpet, & they all want some candy.  Write�what is the state of your funds, that I may enlarge or contract my wishes accordingly.  My advice is after travelling, to spend the rest of your money in gratifying your taste, & buy all you can afford.  Even a Sofa, & if you see a Sofa that you would really wish to get, you may get it instead of all the things I have mentioned above, if you have not enough money to get the Sofa too.  I have now mentioned what I wish you to buy so often I am tired, & am sure you are of the subject, & after mentioning my wishes I leave it to you to make what purchases you think best.  I rode to the farm yesterday.  The Corn looked well.  They are now working the bottom corn which they expect to make something of.  They have had rain though not much.  Today it drizzles every now & then.  The weather has been excessively hot here, until within a few days it has been so cold, we have been obliged to have fires.  I hope it has been the same with you.  For my part, I prefer the hot weather to the cool change.  It is so unreasonable.  Mamma is with me & sends her love.  I have no news to tell, & no space to refer to your letter as I would wish.  I hope all you find out about your name will be in its favor.  Do write interesting letters for the Mountaineer.  Be sure to not go to Columbia.  Mr. Coleman says & everybody it would be imprudent.  I would not consent for 1000 dollars.  Bring the children something pretty & something useful.  Take care of yourself.  I am quite well.  Do not be uneasy if you do not hear.  E.F.P.

The letters I write in future I will direct to N York.  I think one more thing if you can afford.  I wish you to buy me is a little worsted muslin collar, with an under tippet to it, costing not more than 2 dollars.  You will think me unreasonable but it is only if you have the money that you must get what I mention.

Do not forget to buy the�in Fulton St. N York & go to Thorburn & make arrangements about getting�.  If you cannot buy for me all I have mentioned would rather you get a Musical box in preference to the black silk dress.  I suppose a Musical box will not cost more than 15 or 20 dollars, & if you get one you must be sure & get one that plays beautiful tunes.
