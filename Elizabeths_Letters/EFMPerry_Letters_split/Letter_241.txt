Letter 241

Tuesday, 1/2 past 9, [1852]

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter mentioning your sad accident.  Mr. Beattie a short time previous had come to show me a letter from Mr. McKay who merely mentioned you had broken your arm at 10 oclock Monday morning & were doing comfortably well.  Mr. Beattie was afraid I might hear exaggerated accounts.  I was very much shocked & grieved , but was thankful it was not fever you had.  But I am afraid this accident may bring on fever, that you ought to come home at once.  Mr. Elford has just been here, & offered to send his carri[a]ge for you, & I have accepted the offer, so hope to see you tomorrow.  I have almost a mind to go in the carri[a]ge but am afraid you may not like it.  I am thankful it is your left arm, but truly sorry, it has occurred at all.  Edward Dr. Crooks said this morning was better that he regarded him now out of danger.  The symptoms at present were all favorable.  I was just going to write you about the Election when Mr. Beattie came.   I am sorry as yet the news is not encouraging.  The voting has been so strange that almost any result may be looked for.  Pinckney McBee is ahead.  Mr. Carson has managed wonderfully.  Mr. Ware thinks you next, but the Disunionist thinks Smith & Irvine ahead of you.  John Russell has been run by them in opposition to Col. Brockman.  Until the boxes are heard from today, there is no telling what the result will be.  I would send Willie out but Mr. Elford thinks it a risk for him to go, as his tongue you know is�, & he had a little headache night before last.  I believe I would certainly go, but he says it would be unsafe also for me.

	Be sure & come home tomorrow.  I will ride & meet you if nothing prevents.  Laurens is sickly & with your accident, you will be sure to get fever if you stay there, so I will expect you certainly tomorrow.  Reuben will go any time in the stage & bring the horse & Buggy

      I am sorry the horse was foundered; how careless in the Ostler.
      
      I long to see you & help nurse your arm.  I think I will have to go on your next tour with you.  I can write for you.  I will leave Hext, be a good time to wean him.  Susan will take care of the house & children.  I hope you are doing well, & will be at home tomorrow evening.  Your sympathizing Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. The carri[a]ge will soon be here to take this letter, so I must seal it.  How kind in Mr. Elford.  Mr. Hoke says his being beat this time will do him good, make him popular hereafter.  Tomorrow I hope to see you.  Last night I dreamt of you, but was awake almost the whole night.  I must have had a presentiment of some evil.  I was crying & begging you not to go where you would get fever.

Benjamin Perry
Laurens C.H.
