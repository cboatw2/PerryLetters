Letter 205

Dear Willie

	I have just received your letter & your Papa�s last night, & this time will write to you.  I am sorry you did not write a longer letter, but thank you for the short one.  Your Papa is so busy I make allowance for his short letters.

	Mary is still sick.  As she did not get better I sent for Dr. Crooks , who I always feel has a right to be our Physician & who was out, when I first sent, which made me send for Dr. Dean.  He is now prescribing for Mary, & she says she feels better today.  Mary being sick, & Minerva hired out, & Lindy taken up with her baby, has made us all depend on ourselves for fixing the house almost entirely.  I am glad to tell you Anna has excited herself, & with Charlottes help, has fixed the whole house already, & now gone up to the Academy to help dress it with flowers.  Lindy has to finish ironing, & Charlotte has gone to the Spring to wash, & Sarah is minding Hext.  John has gone to Mama�s to carry some chickens to Susan, to bring in two Chairs to send to the Academy to dress with flowers for Fanny & Anna to sit in at Flora�s.  A Ham that was boiled yesterday will serve us for dinner, so you see even when in a straight like the present, if the children perform their duty we can get along.  The House cleaning has not commenced yet.  John Smith was engaged this week & cannot come to Whitewash until Monday, so we will have very little time to clean up before you return.  It will have to go on slowly, even after you come back.

	Frank still has the Mumps, & is very much afraid he will not be able to march tomorrow.  He plays about as usual, & this morning when I told him he must not go out, he cried & said he promised to meet Alex Hunter at some corner of the street, & he must go.  He has escaped & gone.  This morning Dr. Crooks was examining his cheeks, & Frank resisted, & Dr. Crooks said, �you must not do so, don�t you know when your Papa is gone, I am a kind of papa to you all.�  Frank says if he does not participate in the May day pleasures, he may get back his 15 cts.  If you were here, after all you might have had the Mumps, & been obliged to stay at home, for you would have been for concealing your swollen cheeks, not displaying them like Frank.

	I have not had a glimpse of Hochy since you left, but I make frequent inquiries after him, & give cautions concerning his good treatment.  I hope tomorrow he will behave himself well.  My interest will be divided between Hochy & the Flora�s.  Next year you can ride on him as a Marshall.

	Hext looks well.  He does not walk yet alone, but walks about with very little assistance.  He gets more interesting every day.  This morning I taught him how to kiss.  

	There came from the Mail this morning a long communication from Asheville, contradicting the assertion Mr. Wh� made in his Temperance lecture about the Scripture use of wine, that in some parts of the Bible it was unfermented Wine, in others fermented.  It proved from the original Hebrew, that Wine is always fermented, that there is no such thing as unfermented Wine, & where it is denounced, it is the immoderate use of it.  He says temperance is a Christian virtue, which can never be too sedulously inculcated, but the lame attempt to wrest the scriptures will injure not benefit the cause.  He says he admires St. Paul who voluntarily would abstain from anything on his brothers account, but when it was sought to ensnare his conscience, & to tamper with his Christian liberty & discretion on false grounds, he would submit, no, not for an hour.  This is my opinion, I will not take wine, on account of my childrens sake, I will voluntarily abstain from it, that they may follow my example.  I will follow the dictates of my conscience, which is more noble, than promising a few individuals, who in all probability you care not for, & whose opinion you do not respect, promise them not to do wrong.  I do not desire you should ever drink a drop of wine, & particularly until you are of your Papas age, & there is no danger of your indulging too freely.  I wish you to follow your Papas example & be actuated by a good conscience, & a sense of morality, virtue & religion.  These must govern you.  These are noble motives, & I have confidence in you, that your character is one to be influenced by such motives, & not by the far less noble of one. Of a promise to a few boys trifling ones for the most part, but I have said more than I intended & will tell you of something amusing.  Last Sunday at the Hall, I forgot to carry my prayer book so when I went in church, I took Annas from her.  While the Prayers were being read, Willie Earle who was in front of Anna, took the opportunity very slyly as he thought, to hand Anna his Prayer book, which she had the ill manners to refuse.  A short time after, she removed her seat to another desk.  I noticed Anna moved her [word faded] & wondered why, & noticed that Willie Earle looked rather vexed.  I had not seen the offer of the prayer book.  Susan saw it & told me afterwards.  Is it not amusing to see a little girl, vexed at attentions, that in a few years later, she will covet, & displaying rudeness, which before long, she will be surprised at.  I mention this little incident to amuse you.  Do not mention it, as Anna will be vexed if you do.

	Tell your Papa I am glad his resolutions were approved of.  I have seen no paper mentioning the Convention, except the Patriot.  I am sorry the Duncans have left you.  Your Papa forgot to carry down the Tea nuts for Dr. Blanding & the other gentlemen.

	I have come to the end of my sheet, so must stop.  E.F.P.
