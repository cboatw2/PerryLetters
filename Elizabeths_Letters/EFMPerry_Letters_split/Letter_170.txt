Letter 170

Tuesday night, 10 December [1850]
[Greenville]

My dear husband

		I received your letter today , & Anna Willie�s, for both of which we thank you.  I am glad to hear so many are opposed to Separate State action, but from the preparations the State is making for arms & Navies, she seems serious.  Tomorrow you think you will make your speech.  I hope it will be a good one, & that your resolutions for a Southern Convention will be carried.  You must have your speech published either in one of the Columbia papers or in pamphlet form, & send it all over the District.  It is the only way the people can know your views, for in the Mountaineer they will not publish that or anything in your favour.  I am afraid it will be a long time yet, before the Southern Patriot makes its appearance, for Mr. Elford has not even come yet.  I suppose Mr. Jones wished to make a speech, so as to turn the attention of the Legislature towards himself, & see how great a man he is, & in consequence elect him Solicitor.  He will do all Electioneering can do, to gain his ends, but I do hope he will not succeed.  He also wishes his speech published in the Mountaineer, which strange to say a vain fool like himself now rules, & Mr. Campbell to allude to it as follows, �We publish today the able & patriotic speech of our distinguished representative, who stood at the head of the ticket.�  Yesterday the invitations for Miss Lewis� wedding were sent out.  We received one.  Mamma & Ann & all of the McBee family except Susan & Mr. Luther.  They certainly seem to have slighted them intentionally, & how a Minister & his family should act so, is most unchristian like, & though of itself, it is but a little matter, still the motive is not.  They are evidently vexed with Susan & have taken this opportunity of resenting it, & she could not attend a church with pleasure, whose Minister has unjustly treated her.  At the time of the baptism as I told you Mrs. Arthur was vexed without any cause, but since then they have taken tea at Mamma�s, been invited to Susan�s, & they seemed friendly.  Mamma attributes it to Mrs. Jones, who does not speak to Mr. Luther now, because he did not vote for Mr. Jones, & Mr. Luther also (Mr. Campbell I dare say knows) has encouraged the new paper; so Mamma thinks Mrs. Jones told Mr. Campbell to tell Miss Lewis  not to invite Mr. McBee & Susan.  But it is all conjecture.  We only know from whatever came, it is unchristian like to show resentment.  A great many persons are invited.  It will be a very large wedding, & to be at home, not at church.  I never had any thoughts of going.  I have a contemptible opinion of Mr. Campbell.  He looks so vain & trifling, always laughing�.  The hogs are at Last killed.  10 were killed yesterday, & 5 today.  2 of them were so bruised & injured by the other hogs, that Charles has let them out of the pen, one small one we killed soon after you left.  I am glad now your Corn will be saved.  Mr. Foster has sent it several times.  I do not know how much.  Mr. Davis wrote a letter to you today & got Anna to put it in the Post office, about the time the examination is to take place I believe.  Susan Hoke was here last night, & she said her Father had written to you.  I hope that is a good sign, & that he has come out on your side, & it is important to gain him.  You must write to him, on the subject of Politics in general.  I sent him Mr. Poinsett�s letter to read.  I have not seen Genl Hamilton�s.  I think you say he has written one.  I thought you were going to elect Mr. Barnwell again to the Senate.  I now much prefer him to Mr. Rhett.  Mr. Rhett is too ambitious, would ruin his county to attain his object, & is too violent a Disunionist to send as Senator.  I thought also Mr. Pickens had�his claims for Governor.

		   No letters have come for you since I wrote, unless some come tonight by the Augusta Mail.  I hope you will avail yourself of the opportunity of seeing people from so many different places, & get them to interest themselves for the Southern Patriot.  Keep a list & put down the names of all the subscribers.

		You must buy some Hops for Mamma & myself, 1 dollars worth between us, if they are to be got in Columbia, also try blue grass & Clover seed for Mamma to sow her lawn, & mention the prices of writing Desks for Mamma, & buy a toy for Vardry.  As he is you Godson, you ought to remember him sometimes, and it is not the value of the present but the remembrance that Susan likes.  Susan today has dreadful headache, & her baby is sick constantly, & screams & fatigues her so.  If Mrs. Arthur knew her every trials, it would give her no pleasure to slight & mortify her, how unchristian like.  Even I felt sorry for Mr. Burt, who has for years only injured you, & you returned good for evil, so I say if Susan had offended in any way, they ought to forgive, & though it is no great thing to be invited to a wedding, still the not inviting in this instance shows a bad feeling.  The whole congregation are invited but her, even some of the children of the village, Mr. & Mrs. Davis, & young ladies, Mrs. Arthur dews not even know.  I thought on account of Mrs. Arthurs ill health, her Mother having died so recently, & in a Ministers family the wedding taking place, it would have been in church & private, but the motive in having so large a one is to make friends for Mr. Campbell.

		I am glad you were pleased with Anna�s letter.  I expect Mr. David takes more pain with her, than Mr. Irvin does with Willie, but Mr. Davis� account I know will be enormous�says Sally Crooks was more than 90 dollars, so think of this when you are buying books.  Our children are not worse I suppose than others. I wish I could bring them up well, & counteract what failings they have.  Their chief fault is quarreling with each other, so they appear worse when together, & better when separate, but this visit to Columbia will improve Willie & Frank so much, that when they return home, they will never quarrel again.  Charles says he will attend to H�, who I have no doubt will be very glad to see Willie.  I have not caught a glimpse of him since you left.  

		You must inquire for my bundle, that Aunt Mary McCall is to send me, if not by a private opportunity,  then to the Depository directed to you, so inquire at the Depository every day, unless you see the advertisement in the paper, of a bundle directed to your care.  I think they used to put them in the paper, but I am not certain.  You can send Willie & Frank to the Depository every evening.

		A letter has come tonight from Mr. Burket.  He says he has now 3 cribs full of Corn, which he thinks is 400 barrels.  He has sown his wheat, & had a fine season for it.  He has got the Cotton, & ginned 32 thousand pounds of it.  He has got up 50 head of hogs.  They are fat now, & he is going to slaughter some of them now.  He is getting timber for the Cotton screw & will try to have it done by Christmas.  He would like to buy some Pork from you & would like to know at what price.  The negroes are well, the Stocks are well; this is all the news.
