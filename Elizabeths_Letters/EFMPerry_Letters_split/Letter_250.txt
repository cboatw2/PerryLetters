Letter 250

Tuesday morning, 10 oclock, 11 January [1853]
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just received two letters from you, & must answer them immediately, for the Mail now closes at 12 oclock, & the letters must be just in sooner than heretofore.  I hear very regularly from you, every day except Monday when no Mail comes, & you ought to hear every day from me except Monday, so Monday you get no letter from me.

	Your friends have all been as kind as possible to you,  You must thank Aunt Brewton for the present you say she has sent Willie, & tell her I hope her Godson will do credit to her.  If he is as good
as he is smart, there will be no fear but what he will.  I do not say so from vanity, but from the opinion all his Teachers have expressed, & not to me, but to others have they expressed it, so I know it is their real opinion.  Your Papa also has a high opinion of Willie�s mind, & he has a good judgement, & no vanity, either for himself or his children.

	Thank your cousin Eloisa for the cup & saucer.  It is in a box of paper &c. your Papa had packed in Columbia but it has not come yet.  The roads are in so dreadful a condition no waggons are transporting goods, either from the Laurens R[ail] Road, or the box would have come on from Hamburg, where our groceries are at present & the box with them that Aunt Eliza had packed.   Today your Papa received a letter from Jeffers & Cothran the factors who are to forward the boxes, & they say since Christmas no waggons have come, that the streets present every day the appearance of the Sabbath, & from the accounts they hear of the roads, it will continue so a long time, but by the first opportunity they will send on the boxes.  If I had imagined this delay, I would have done without several things I wrote for, & sent you the money instead, or bought things for summer use.  F� & my bonnets, we will have to put up for next winter.  You will be here at the opening of the box I have no doubt, & witness the joy of the children.

	A person in Mobile is writing sketches of distinguished men, & mentions Uncle Robert.  In a Columbia paper there is an extract in which Aunt Brewton is mentioned.  It will be published in the Patriot.  I will cut it out & send to you, & you can give it to Aunt Brewton.  Perhaps she has seen it, [but] if not, it will gratify her, to see honorable mention made of one whose memory she reveres as she does Uncle Roberts.

	It was kind in Eloisa to say, she would like to have you stay with her.  I appreciate her kind intention.  You must go often to see her, & Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha & Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna Hayne, & any friend Aunt Eliza tells you to go & see.

	I am sorry Aunt Emily is sick, & Paul�s wife in delicate health.  Give my love to Aunt Emily when you next see her, & Aunt Susan, Aunt Brewton, Aunt Elizabeth & Uncle Arthur, Aunts in Logan st. & Meeting st.  

	Your Papa is now quite well.  All at your Grandmama�s are the same as usual.  Clara works every day for them.  I help them in that way, as much as I can, & work for myself.  Margaret at present can spare her.  Eliza has not worked for me since the birth of her baby, but will again next week.  Lindy is at home, at present with her child to attend to.  No one will hire her, but next summer we will get her a place.

	The new kitchen is building, & when it is done, our servants will be comfortably accommodated, & we will have a nice kitchen for our own use.  No one but the cook to stay in & an ironing room, for no purpose but ironing.  The two new chambers, Eliza & Lindy will have.  If Minerva wishes it, she can come over & sleep in the room Eliza now has.  Charles will either sleep in the cellar or the old kitchen, & the small house, you shall again have to keep as a play house.  Mr. Rosemond will repair it.  I will give Fanny the press in the little dining room as a baby house & put in the play house, all the toys you have bought her, shall stay there.  If you had kept all the presents ever given you, how many you would have had.  Begin now & keep them all carefully.  When you have bought the list I have sent you, I hope to send some more money.  Have you spent the 5 dollars you took out of your Bank.  Send as many things by Mr. Jones or Thompson as they can bring.

	I expect you spent a delightful day at the island.  Your Aunt & cousins have been so kind in trying to gratify you in every way.  You must tell them I thank them for their kindness to you.  Tell them not to give themselves any trouble on your account.  The visiting among your friends, & seeing them, is an enjoyment to you & Greenville is so quiet.  A walk up King st.  is such a contrast to a walk here that it affords you delight.  The shells we will be glad of, & something new in Greenville.  You must keep them as a curiosity.  I am sorry you have not seen your cousin Sarah Taylor yet.  If you do, tell her the Scripture Biography she gave Willie, I find very useful in reading to the children & servants on Sunday, & tell Eloisa the basket she gave me in town, I use even now as a key basket.

	I saw in the Courier that your Papa had been alluded to by Mr. John Preston.  In Columbia last winter Professor Thornwell�s brother pointed to your Papa & said �See that person, two years ago, he was avoided by Politicians as death, & now he has more influence in the Legislature, than any other Member, & more coveted by aspirants.�  Your Papa has always acted independently, & in acting as he thought right, has gone against his own interests, which proves his sincerity.  Such conduct always in the end begets esteem, & he has in his opinion the best reward, a good conscience & his own self respect.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza & your cousins.  Their kindness I will never forget.  Ask Aunt Eliza to write to me.  I will write to Eliza tomorrow.  Go & see Mary Crayton, & let me know when she expects to return.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F. Perry
