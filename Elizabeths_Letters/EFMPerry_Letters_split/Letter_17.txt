Letter 17

Friday afternoon, 10 December 1841
Greenville

My dear husband

	I am so afraid you may be uneasy if you do not hear that I am writing to you lying down.  I am on the recovery but it will be a long time before I am able to leave my bed.  Mine is a tedious kind of sickness.  I have now been 10 days in bed.  The hardness in my bosom was long coming & will  be long in going away.  I have suffered very little.  I am obliged to continue poulticing it, & the most inconvenient position is lying down & then I am less likely to take cold.  The children are well.  I am quite uneasy not having heard the last Mail from you.  I hope to hear tonight.  Everything in the household is attended to well.  I expect you home Sunday week.  Do not come beforehand.  I wish you to buy me a box of Tooth powder, a few oranges, , & the Morocco if you can get it pretty & reasonable.  When I ask you to buy me anything it is always on the condition that it is reasonable.  I would like you to bring Susan a little present that does not cost much.  Perhaps you may find something suitable & reasonable, not more than 1 or 2 dollars.  I would like you to bring Willy 1 pair of black slippers & 1 pair of booties but not so large as the pair you sent.  But my dear husband if your money is scarce do not bring anything I have mentioned.  The Shoes I think must be cheaper than in Greenville.  If you do not hear again do not be uneasy.  It fatigues my hands holding them up to write & Mamma & Susan dislike writing so, they will not write for me.  I am ashamed to have sent you such shabby looking letters.  You must make allowances.  I only write to prevent your being uneasy.  I must now close.  Believe me Ever, Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

P.S. I hope you have given up all idea of leaving the Legislature.  I cannot consent to it.
