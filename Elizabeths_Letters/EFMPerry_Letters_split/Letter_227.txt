Letter 227

Monday morning, 11 oclock, 12 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

       I have just written a long letter to Eliza Hayne, & am tired writing, but will go on & write my daily letter to you.  Tomorrow I will write again, & then I will have a long rest, which I will be glad of, for writing takes up so much of my time I can do very little else now.
       
       I wrote in a great hurry yesterday after receiving the two letters by Mr. Beattie.
       
       Aunt Mary McCall has a box in town for us waiting to send.  I am so sorry I did not tell her to send it to Columbia, & you would have sent it on by someone.  It contains my winter clothes, but it will be so late before I get it, they will be my next winter clothes, instead of this.  Mr. McKay was to have brought it up, & after all he has never gone.  Mr. Elford now will take charge of it, or it will come by Express.  I hoped to have saved money enough out of what you left me to help pay for them, but I have not been able to, so you must be so good as to lend me the money out of the Bank Interest you will receive in January, & I will give you Minerva�s wages as they are paid me, until I return you all.  I am sorry I did not keep Minerva�s wages this past summer to clothe myself with, but you were pressed for money, & so I spent it for you, which you must remember.  But I would rather feel independent in this respect, & in  future I will not place myself in the situation I am now have to ask you for money for myself.  It makes me feel mean & sometimes the bills are higher than I expect, as it is in the present case, & then I am afraid you will scold me, but you must not.  If you do, I will come down upon you about Governor & Judge & President of the United States, & perfectly overwhelm you.  But in future I intend to buy my clothes, & pay for them without your knowing anything about it.  Last winter I bought nothing, so this winter I had to buy something, so sent to town,  but they will only come in time to be ready for me next winter when I go to Columbia with you.
       
       The hogs are being killed today.  The whole household is at the river except El�, Lindy�s baby & myself.  We still have some Stake & some corn beef, but we are all tired of it.  I hope to have a plenty for you to eat on your return of Sausages, Spare ribs &c.
       
       Willie says Mr. Memminger & his family were at church yesterday, I suppose on their way down.  Eliza Hayne said Mr. Memminger had a daughter sick like Ann, cannot sleep at night &c.
       
       You must find Janney�s far pleasanter than Maybins.  I am glad the Society is so pleasant there. 
       
        I will take for granted all the sentiment & love you would like to express in your letters, & which I know is in your heart.  You are in Columbia to attend to business, & if you let me occupy you instead, it would be to the detriment of the State, of which you are the chief guardian.  If your watchful eye is moved for one instant, the State suffers; so I do not wish to interfere.
       
       I thought you were going to run Mr. Elford for Clerk of the House.  Mr. Dean perhaps being a Member could more readily be elected.  It requires a person either to be, or have been a Member of the Legislature to be elected to office.  It is a great advantage.  Several wives have been gratified unexpectedly this Session.  Mrs. Dean, Mrs. Glover, & a future Mrs. Evans, one other Wife I would name, who would like to be gratified in the same way, all she begs of her husband is when opportunities offer to advance himself, not to decline it.  The husbands may be indifferent to these things, but the Wives never are.
       
       I am sorry yourself, Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford have so misunderstood my Grocery bill.  I knew the Sugar was more than enough for one year, but I thought it would be more economical to send for a large quantity.  It saves commissions, barrels, drayage &c. , & we would not have to send for Groceries for a long time again. I am sorry it should have lead to a worse opinion of our servants characters than they deserve.  Reuben stole a ham, & I dare say, he steals your Corn, & steals our wood & sells for himself, & Mary has stolen my clothes, but the other servants I have no reason to suspect, & hardly think Mary will do the same again.  I am sorry Mr. Elford should think me so careless a housekeeper, & such a fool as not to lock up the Sugar that the simplest child would know ought to be done.  If my storehouse had groceries in it, I would never let anyone go in but myself, but it never had lard, only House Salt & such things, that it was not necessary for me to go always to take out.  So tell Mr. Elford I think as he does if Sugar was not locked up, it would go twice as fast, & if Corn was locked up, it would last twice as long.  I know of nothing new & Hext has come now to be nursed, so I must stop, & close my letter without reading it over.  The weather is cloudy & cold.  I hope you will have a pleasant journey home the roads not impassable.
       
       I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & every day till you return.  
       
       Willie & Frank are busy with the hogs.  Make Mr. Gladden & Mr. Hill pay you, & tell Mr. Watts to remind Mr. Williams of his promise.  
       
       I will now close.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
