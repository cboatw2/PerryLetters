Letter 178

Monday 8 oclock.  I will not finish, & only say once more, that I will be very thankful if your resolution for a Southern Convention is adopted, for the State will have something, & that is the safest mode of�, but I doubt if they will be adopted, but I hope it will.  

		Reuben has gone for a load of wood, & I hope by the time he returns Charles will be here to kill the hogs for it is very cold.  Charles is at Mr. Deans, & I am afraid from his not coming in, he is killing hogs for him instead, which will be very provoking.  I have sent Lindy to bring him in.  My pen needs mending.  I can hardly write.  My next shall be shorter & neater.  Lindy has just come back.  She met Charles coming in, so the hogs will be killed today.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
