Letter 7

Thursday afternoon, 12 December 1839
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received two letters from you last night.  Owing to some mistake in the Mail, I was disappointed twice last week in not hearing from you, so to make up I have received by each of the last two Mails two letters.  Last night I received a letter Dec. 2d, which ought to have been received before the letters that came Sunday night.  However it has at last come, and I dare say there will be no mistake again.  
	
	As you say my letters give you much pleasure.  I will not write to you by every Mail.  I am sorry you are tired of Columbia, and so impatient to get home.  If you know how well Will and me get along, you would give yourself not a moments concern about us.  He gives me not the least trouble.  In the day Delia attends to him entirely, except when I am nursing him, and at night I manage him so well, that I am thinking when you come back, you will be so much in the way, we will have to put you in �Old Missi�s chamber,� as Delia calls it.  Will and myself are enough to occupy one bed.  Now do not give yourself any uneasiness about us, only envy me the happiness of being able to attend to him, and administer to his little wants.  I am afraid you would be rather mortified, if you saw how happy both he and me are during your absence.  I assure you we employ out time very pleasantly, and are very happy.  I do not even feel lonely.

	I am glad you are occupied, and that you think you are gaining a little reputation.  Oh! My dear husband, I do hope you will continue in the Legislature.  It is to your interest that you should.  I think a Lawyer should desire to be a member of the Legislature more than any other person.  I do not see why Col. Brockman wishes it.  It is no advantage to him, but to you it is,, and it is the wish of my heart that you may still be a member.  I do hope you will.  The next time perhaps you will be Senator.  You must be quite happy though away from me.  If you were not sometimes absent from home, you would not know how to value it, so the remainder of your time be contented and happy.  Why do you not send papers, pamphlets &c to Dr. Crook, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Earle and all the gentleman here?  You must, If you have not already done so.  I hope Mr. Powell will not injure you.

	I would rather you have attended the Commencement of the College, and spent some other time in writing to me, for then you would have told me about it when you come home.  I mean to ask you many questions.  Miss Pinckney, Mrs. Sloane and others, say Mrs. J. Cunningham is not pretty, but that she is lively and pleasant, that she is remarkably short and thick.  It is a pity she dresses in bad taste.  Pamela is so particular and observant in dress.  John dresses well.  He ought to direct his Wife, as I did you.  You recollect what a change I made in your appearance.  By the by, have you had your hair cut?  And has the Barber disfigured you by cutting it too short?

	I have not seen anything of Mr. Blassinghame.  I went to see Miss Williford�s the other evening, and on the way stopped and showed the baby to Mrs. Curtis.  She was much gratified & praised him very�says he looks like you.  Miss Margaret Williford says he looks like Ann particularly his mouth & chin.  Mrs. Service says he looks like me.  Mrs. [word obscured] yesterday sent me some Jelly.  Mrs. Sloane this week has borrowed eggs from me.  Mrs. Hoke has sent for Milk.  Mrs. Mooney Milk, Mrs. Horton Milk and Meal twice.  I have ceased borrowing & never will again, because I have an independent spirit.  It gives me pleasure to give or lend (except to Mrs. Horton who is too en�ing).  It shows I am friendly with my neighbours, and that they think me willing to oblige, but I myself will never borrow.  The reason I wish you my dear husband to economize, is that you may put up money enough, to render us always independent.  Until this house is paid for I feel uneasy.  If you have not spent much money in books I will not scold, but you know how much [two words obscured] you have already.  I am sorry Uncle Arthur is so foolish to continue a Candidate. So Mr. McBee is president of the Rail Road Company.  Pity so rich a man should have an addition of $4000 a year.  He ought to attend to it for nothing.  Have you heard anything of William and Pamela?  Is Mr. Cunningham in Columbia?

	I always thought Mamma had about $30,000 that if divided equally among us we would have $10,000 apiece, $22,000 in money, 8000 for house and 2000 for negroes would be $32,000.  I do not see why $5,000 is too much to invest in house and lands.  The money the house sells for in town will pay for the Greenville place, and Mamma will have the same money to live on she had in town, which will go further here, and bring higher interest.  I suppose she could not build a house much cheaper, to be comfortable, than [page torn] she is to build.  It is the land that is so expensive, 50 dollars an acre, though perhaps she could not get it cheaper [word obscured].  Judge Earle�s place is too far.  Mamma would be willing to live on less every year, to enable her to get a place that she fancies, & near the village.  I wish now her land was just next Mrs. Hornbuckles, as it is, it is rather far.  However I will talk about all this; writing it takes up too much paper.  

	If Mr. Brown is in Columbia taking likenesses as he did last year, I wish you would have yours taken without your hat.  I would value it much.

	I have a commission for you, and if you wish to please me, you must execute it, if within your power.  It is this I wish you to get for me, �some pieces of Morocoo of different colours.�  You can get it at a Shoemakers or Sadlers.  I suppose you could get a good parcel for 75 cts or 1 dollar.  I do not know the price however.  I wish it to make boxes, pin cushions, needle hooks &c.  If you can get the Morocoo reasonable, do get me some, but if they ask a great deal, you need not.  At any rate inquire the price.At a Shoemakers or Sadlers, & if it is reasonable remember, get me some.  With this request my dear husband I must close my letter.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
