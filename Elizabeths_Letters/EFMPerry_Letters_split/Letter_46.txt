Letter 46

Monday night, 13 October 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	Mrs. Palmer leaves tomorrow, & I will write a few lines by her.  I hope you will be glad to receive them.  Though only two days have elapsed since you left, I have a good deal to tell you.  I went to see Mrs. Palmer this morning.  She said to me, as she did to Susan that she was very sorry not to have made your acquaintance, that she would like to have done so, for she heard you spoken of in such high terms, but she would take it for granted that all she heard was true.  I told her you were at Laurens.  She said perhaps she would see you there, as she was to pass a night there, so if you come in contact with her, you must be very polite, & if needs be, you must give up your chamber as you once did to Mrs. Alston.  Mrs. Alston leaves tomorrow also but I believe she generally goes as far as Goldsmiths only, the first day.  I supplied both Mrs. Palmer & Alston with cake to eat on the road.  I saw Mrs. Alston yesterday for a little while after church at Mrs. Longs door.  She inquired after you [&] said she would never forget your kindness at Laurens in giving up your comfortable room to her.  I told her you would be happy to oblige her again, & perhaps she may need the room this time, so if she does you must let her have it.  The Middletons leave tonight, & the Lynahs tomorrow, so that this week everybody will be gone.  I went this morning to see Miss Crittenden, Mrs. Townes who was out, & Mrs. Hoke.  Mr. Hoke came in while I was there, & said he had just made a bargain for you & himself that he had sold your land in the Mountains for 95 dollars Cash, & received nine dollars for rent.  He thought he had done well, so I hope you  will think the same; so you will have 52 dollars waiting for you on your return.  You ought to be very grateful, whenever your purse is emptied it is filled again.  Mrs. Palmer told Susan that Mrs. Gibbes wishes to sell her place, that Mr. Gibes health is worse, & that after Mrs. Poinsett leaves there is no one she could depend upon for being with her in sickness, so she would rather go back to Columbia.  I think she is mistaken, for in Greenville persons are particularly kind in sickness.           

	I saw Mr. Poinsett at the Mansion house this morning.  He said he had hoped to see you, about the Railroad business.  He had forgotten you would be at Laurens, but supposed you would be back Saturday.  He thinks there is no doubt but the stock will be taken.  

	Genl Thompson went to see Mamma Saturday in the pouring rain, said he was on his way to see Mr. Poinsett & as it was raining, thought he would stop & see her, particularly as he expected to be absent a great deal during the winter.  Mamma asked him where he was going.  He said he would be attending Courts.

	I went to the Methodist church yesterday morning & afternoon.  Heard the presiding elder Mr. Walker in the morning, & Dr. Palmer in the afternoon.  Miss Ann Gadsden dined with Mamma.  She asked me if I knew the reason Miss Crawford did not take tea with me.  I told her I thought she was rich.  She said no, she was not, that she asked her if she was coming, & she said, �no indeed!  She would not accept a 3 oclock invitation�.  Mrs. Coleman says she is the most offensively�person she ever saw, & I hear, all the gentlemen at Longs are going to present a petition to Mr. Long to turn her away.  March Jim & James all worked at Mamma�s today.  James says they have got through.  Charles said yesterday he wants to finish their room now as his time was up & Jim told him he was anxious to have him, to help with the Cotton lands.  Jim drove the Cows home last night after I had gone to bed, & tonight long after supper.  In future he must be earlier.

	No one has inquired for you & no letters have come.  We are all pretty well.  Willie has written you a note which he says I must be sure & not forget to send you.  Miss Crittenden says Mr. Adam Summer has gone on to Portland, Maine, to be married, that the other one of whom Cornelier Crittenden has been joked, she Cornelier has seen very seldom & does not like, he has never been attentive to her, but has spoken well of her.

	And now my dear husband, you will think you are reading one of Aunt Harriets letters such a medley, but I thought all events I would fill my sheet.  I hope you will be grateful to me for passing the evening writing to you�be grateful instead of working on my Quilt, which I was strongly tempted to do.  I told Mrs. Poinsett today that Pamela was very glad to see that she was a subscriber to her book.  She said she had not subscribed & that she would not.  Good night, Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
