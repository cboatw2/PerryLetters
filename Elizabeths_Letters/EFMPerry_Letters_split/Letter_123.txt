Letter 123

Monday morning, 17 July 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

	            	I did not expect to write to you when you left, but I feel now so uneasy about you, that I cannot avoid writing a few lines to express my uneasiness.  I went to see Mamma yesterday afternoon after church,& she said you looked so bilious when you stood at her carri[a]ge Saturday Afternoon, speaking to her, that both Ann & herself observed it, that she was sorry you had taken the Calomel, for Dr. Horlbeck in Charleston, told her once, it was very wrong in hot weather, to take a large dose of Calomel.  It was apt to bring on Typhus fever, that it stirred up the Bile.  You know I wished you to take it, & thought Mamma of all others would approve of it.  So I feel now very wretched.  You should have taken Salts & S�. Mamma says.  When I think how well you looked when we paid our visit to Mrs. Burt, & how badly you looked yesterday morning as you made off, & that you have gone to a sickly place, that you are weaker, have been excited, & will be excited this week & fatigued my uneasiness is great.  So I beg you my dear husband, to be particularly careful of yourself, eat only wholesome well cooked food, , & take pills, & come back to me safe & well, & write so I may hear Wednesday�s Mail, & relieve me by assuring me you feel better.  Today is quite cool, so I hope in Laurens, it is cool also, & that, that will be one thing in your favor, & do not allow yourself to be excited wither by Politics, or Law.  I send you a letter which was brought to you this morning while we were at breakfast.  I did not see the person.  It contains important news, so I wish you to see it at once.  The Col. H. mentioned, I have often heard you say was your friend.  The writer of the letter seems your true friend.  I wish you had many such.  Last night there came for you, a Union, Carolinian, & Courier, & two letters from Mr. Boyce, about a pension I expect, & the other from G. Foster saying that 2200 dollars had at last been paid into the hands of Mr. Graham the Lawyer, & that out of that he Mr. Graham intended to keep 500 as his Fee (what cheats the Alabama Lawyers are) & out of the remaining 1700, one seventh was to be divided between you, my brother & sister, so as well as I can understand it, 60 dollars will be your portion.  It is a trifle, but as soon as you receive it, pay it to Mr. Hoke, & by that time I hope you will have received more to add to it.  I dare say you will from Mr. Berry certainly.  Fanny seems better.  I have determined to continue nursing her, for it is her only comfort, for I dare say now that she has cut two more teeth, she will be better.  Today Delia & Mary  have gone to the Spring to wash & as you are not here Lindy will be�.  I saw �yesterday.  She was no better.  Dr. Earle says she does not improve as he hoped.  I saw Mrs. Choice�s carriage with Mrs. Choice & Mrs. Thurston in it, returning in front of the Augusta Stage.  They had gone to meet Mr. � I suppose.  It is said Mrs. Thurston is engaged to him, that her wedding dress is even made.  He has not arrived though.  The report of the rich Mexican lady, must have been false.  I went to church yesterday morning & afternoon.  Mr. Walker who I believe is the Minister at Edgefield, preached for us.  I hope you received my letter that has been so long at Laurens, & that you burned it without reading & for all that was in it you knew & now my dear husband for my sake, take care of yourself.  If you do not get fatigued, & take pills, I think you will return quite well, but having taken the calomel which has stirred up the Bile, you must be particularly careful.  If you had remained at home, it would have been well to have followed up the Calomel with more medicine, so as to have carried off the Bile entirely.  You ought to consult a Physician about the itching you always have, after taking medicine.  This is a delightful day.  Your attached & devoted Wife, E.F.P.
