Letter 265

Monday morning, [16 May 1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I saw Uncle Arthur last night.  He says I must tell you, you must come for me.  That it will be very ungallant if you do not, & he is very anxious to see you, so are all of our friends, & as it will delay you only a few days longer.  After you have finished your business you must come for me.  If there is no danger you might take the night train.  I wish to go back only with you.  I don�t care to go with anyone else.  

	I will telegraph you today to know if you cannot after you have finished, come after you receive this letter as I will not have time to hear by the Mail.  Immediately telegraph me & tell me you are coming, so I may not pack tonight.  You will get back in time for Dr. Croft, Saturday evening at�we can reach Greenville, or Sunday.  I dare say you can leave Columbia Wednesday.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

Uncle Arthur says he calls you a brave gentlemen has a very high opinion of you.

Benjamin Perry
[Columbia]
