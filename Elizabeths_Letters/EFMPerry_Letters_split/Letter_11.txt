Letter 11

Saturday morning, 28 November 1840
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have taken up my pen to write a few lines, as the Mail does not go again until Tuesday.  I will not hurry, but write at my leisure between this and then.  I received your first letter last night. It gave me much pleasure, but it also has given me so much uneasiness, that I cannot rest until I have opened my mind to you.  You said you were busily engaged in the Legislature, making speeches on the Richland election.  I thought of course your speeches would be in favor of the Democratic Candidates, but in looking over the little pamphlet you sent, I saw that it was Mr. Rhett who introduced the resolution that Mr. Adams, Black &c. should take their seats, and as you had been speaking on Mr. Rhett�s side, I found to my utter astonishment that you had been making speeches in favor of the Whigs.  Your political course has really been inconsistent.  You are for Van Buren, yet against the Sub Treasury, a Democrat, yet making speeches in favor of the Whigs.  You ought to be careful how you act.  In the part you have taken in the discussion, they will have two subjects of complaint, first, that you have taken the part of the Whigs, and secondly, that you were on the same side in the discussion with the lower country members.  For instead of being on the side with Mr. Wardlaw, Henry, Thompson &c. you were on the side with Mr. Rhett, Phillips and others from the lower country.  You know Greenville is prejudiced against you, on the latter account, & I am afraid the prejudice with be increased.  I am afraid also you will be claimed by neither party, and supported by none at the next election.  You are really so calculated to distinguish yourself in public life; that, that is the reason I am anxious you should continue in the Legislature, and be careful how you act;�not offend your constituents, and cause them not to vote for you again.  You go to the Legislature, distinguish yourself, yet find it hard to be elected again while Earle, Smith  & Ware who I do not suppose will open their mouths except to say aye or no, will be again elected without the least difficulty.  The course they pursue, and perhaps the only one they could pursue, though without honour to themselves, is certainly the safest for a reelection, but your course is different; you make speeches & distinguish yourself, but as it is impossible to please everyone, each speech you make displeases someone & in that way you make more enemies, than those harmless quiet ones do.  The long & the short of  [word obscured] this I wish you to remain in the Legislature.  I think it is a field whereon you can distinguish yourself.  I therefore wish you to be careful in the course you pursue that you may not offend your constituents and cause them not to vote for you again.  Always take the side of the upper country.  Do not  speak when it is unnecessary, and you may get yourself into trouble; recollect to introduce the resolution to repeal the fee bill; do not let anyone get the start of you.  I will stop writing for the present, with this advice after all act as you think best, but give my advice consideration.
