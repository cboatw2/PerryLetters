Letter 11

Sunday morning, 6 December 1840
Greenville

My dear husband

	I am alone & disengaged, therefore will take this opportunity of writing to you.  Mr. Pinckney being away there is no service at his church, and Mr. Croft proposed reading the services and a sermon, at his house and inviting a few friends to join with him.  He invited all of us to attend and to pass the remainder of the day with them.  Mamma Susan & Ann have gone.  I have remained at home with Willy.  This latter personage I have just dispatched to the kitchen with Delia, that I may have a little quiet to enable me to write to you.  The weather is quite gloomy.  It snowed last night & the sun has not shone today.  For a few days past we have had considerable rain. 

	I have been reading for a few days past, �The Young Lady�s Friend�.  I think it a valuable book, & will take many useful hints from it.  It recommends Mrs. Hamiltons �Letters on the Elementary Principle of Education,� and �Hints on Nursery Discipline.�  The first I have often heard highly spoken of, and the latter, the Author says, is a valuable little book.  If you can find them I would like you to buy them for me.  They may assist me in bringing up Willy well.

	I hope you are against Mr. Henry�s resolutions.  I think the Legislature has no right to instruct Senators.  If they elect them, they ought to let them act as they think best; if they disapprove of their conduct, they need not elect them again.  I am sorry you introduced the Resolution to vote for VanBuren & Johnson as only half the resolution was adopted, & it will just get you into trouble for nothing.  It will make you more unpopular with the Whigs.  You had much better have let someone,  who has not such fault finding constituents as you have, or whose constituents have not such high opinions of themselves and more confidence in their representatives than yours have in you.  I hope you will not introduce the Penitentiary again.  It is of no use.  It is an unpopular subject, & will seem like obstinacy in you to be pressing it on the people.  A Penitentiary  wont do for this State at any rate at present.  The State cant afford it; it will be an expense.  There are not criminals enough to support one.  There are only two persons now in Greenville jail, & if the Penitentiary reforms society as you say it does, why then there will be fewer criminals than there are now.  There will be nobody to put in , & it will be a useless building.  After all the money expended on it, it will do where crime increases, not decreases.  Do don�t introduce the subject at pre�.  Some years hence will do.  The Rail road I expect is as great an embarrassment now as the state can bear.  I am sorry you did not introduce the Fee bill.  I told you not to let anyone get the start of you, but my dear I will stop giving advice.  I promised not to give anymore, & you are perfectly competent to judge for yourself.  I would not give you any if I thought you were influenced by it.  I only think by opening my mind to you, I may suggest some ideas that may not have occurred to you before.  I think your judgement perfect, & all others so imperfect that they generally think contrary to you, & that you know ought to be taken into consideration before you act.  I expect I am the most presuming wife there ever was, but you are the most indulgent of husbands.  Remember act as you think best, but I hope you are against Istruction (you are too noble & independent for that) (except from me).

	I forgot to tell you in my last letter when I requested you to buy the dozen large & dozen small knives without forks, to buy also a pair of Salt spoons.  We have but one, the other is broken.  If silver is expensive, buy Mother of Pearl.  They answer just as well, perhaps better, or buy any kind you think best.

	I am quite uneasy until I hear how your cold is; do take care of yourself.  I hope to get a letter from you this evening.  I sent James to Dr. Crook�s today to have a plaster put on his back.  The Doctor told me to send him.  He is better but not well yet.  I do not let him ride the horse.  John waters him.  The Doctor said he must keep quiet until he was quite well.  Mr. Hoke went to town Saturday morning.  He is to bring up the box from the Miss Seabrooks. A glass for Mamma�s picture &c.  He was very obliging, said he would do anything, if it was only put  down in writing, that he might remember better.  Mrs. McBee invited us all to tea Thursday night to meet Mrs. Croft.  Susan & Ann went & spent a pleasant evening.  I have not yet heard who is elected Commissioner in Equity. Mr. Townes or Mr. Butler.  I will stop writing for the present until I hear from you tonight.

Sunday night.  My dear husband, I have just received your letter, & it has given me great pleasure.  It also removed any uneasiness, as you do not mention your cold incommoding you.  Mamma has not yet returned from Mrs. Crofts so I will write until she comes.  As you took my advice in such good part, instead of ceasing I will continue giving it, on this condition, that you do not follow it unless you choose to.  Perhaps it may profit you.  I was just wondering before I received your letter whether you saw as much of Mr. Burt as you used to & whether Mrs. Burt or any of the members wives dictated to them as I do to you.  I dare say you are the only one who are so much favored; how thankful you ought to be.  I am glad you remembered me to Mr. Burt.  You may remember me to whoever you think proper.  I think you must pass your time quite pleasantly, & would like you to spend it so for years to come, but that is as you think.  I shall never advise you again on this subject, at least so urgently as I did before, as my advice [word obscured] to have proved so fatal.  I hope while you enjoy pleasant company, you are not inattentive to your Colleagues.  Do be kind to them, or when they come home they will tell the people you are proud, & as you are not proud, you may not make that impression.  You can gain & lose by them than all the other Members put together.  It is your Interest to be kind to them.  Give them no reason for speaking against you here.  I hope they will not be jealous of you; if you are attentive they will not.  I hope you send pamphlets, papers, reports & all sorts of things to your constituents, Whigs & Democrats.  They will then see that you have not forgotten them but are thinking of them all the time.  Do not return home until the Legislature adjourns.  Stand at your post until the last moment.  But I hope all this advice is needless.

	The books you mention as having bought do not suit my taste, except Moore�s Life of Bryon, Nicholas Nickleby.  I am glad to have if it was cheap, but the others you mention are mere trash.  I would rather have the works of Bulwer, that you have not got.  I like them very much, & twenty volumes for $2.50!  I never heard of anything so cheap.  Do keep the set you have bought already for yourself, or get another set like them.  Mamma will either take the numbers you do not wish, or those you have now at home.  I would like to have twenty volumes all alike, & so cheap too.  You have none of Bulwers last  works & I would like to have them.  The Pickwick papers nobody likes & the others from their very names must be as worthless.  I like Bulwers writings & that long list I sent you & �Madame D�Arblay�s Life of Dr. Burney,� which I have heard was very interesting.  Those are the kind of books that I like, at least if they are cheap.  I don�t wish them if they cost much.  I hope you will buy your books at Auction, & then as Bargains; but my dear husband don�t buy too many & in those you do buy make a good selection.  I like not trash, nor valuable books, but pretty books.  The Pickwick papers are trash; the Family Library are valuable books.  Neither of them do I expect to read, but the pretty, light works I like.  But even in books I leave it to your judgement.  I suppose you will select well.

	Mamma has come home.  She with all of us were Surprised to hear that Mr. Rhett should think the Friendship with him had ever been broken off.  Mamma was not aware that anything had ever occurred to interrupt it.  Mamma says that she is Surprised & grieved to hear that he should be under the impression that their had ever been any interruption to the friendship except the circumstance of their living in different places & consequently but seeing very little of each other for some years past, & that though it interrupted their intercourse,  produced no change in [word obscured] towards him.  Tell him since their friendship first commenced, Mamma has never changed or ceased to have the greatest regard for him.  She considers him one of the best & most disinterested friends she every had.  Uncle Roberts feelings & behaviour to him  would not in the slightest degree have influenced her.  The Friendship she has for him will continue through life, even if they never meet again. & she hopes he knows there was no real interruption to their feelings of regard except in his imagination, that the friendship which she hopes he still feels for her will always continue.  There are such sacred feelings connected with him  & his regard for our family that nothing could make us change in our feelings towards him.  The advice he alludes to as having given was on this occasion; when my brother returned from the North in bad health, when he recovered, his Uncles did not wish him  to go back again, but Mr. Rhett advised that he should return & finish his Collegiate course.  Mamma followed his advice.  She sent him back & when his health again became bad, Mr. Rhett went on for him, brought him home, carried him to Beaufort & kept him there for several months pursuing his studies.  Uncle Robert was not offended at his advising differently from himself.  Mamma says she knows he was not.  Miss Cheves [word obscured] might have had something to do with his coldness.  She was staying at his house when Mr. Rhett became engaged to her.  Aunt Brewton at first wished the match very much & I believe assisted in different ways conveying notes &c.  Afterwards when Miss Cheves broke off the match from fear of her father, she misrepresented him & spoke against him.  I believe she denied that she had been engaged to him when he said she was (& of course they were engaged).  These things perhaps prejudiced Uncle Robert & Aunt Brewton against him.  Mr. Rhett I believe thought Aunt Brewton afterwards took Miss Cheves part & perhaps influenced her.  This made him dislike Aunt Brewton & treat her with neglect, & she thought he had treated her ungratefully.  I do not know if you understand it, but what I mean is that if Uncle Robert behaved coldly this affair might have had something to do with it, & Uncle Robert I believe thought he was conceited & turbulent & [word obscured].  Do tell what I have told you to Mr. Rhett, or else he will think we have been very ungrateful.  Tell him Mamma always has & always will have the greatest regard for him.   There never was any interruption to their friendship on her part.  It was only a suspicion of his, for Uncle Roberts feelings would not have influenced her.  She considers him of the best & most disinterested friends she ever had, & hopes his friendship will always continue for her even if they never met again.  I have always liked & admired him very much & take the greatest interest in him.  I would like to see him again.  Mamma regrets they have been able to see so little of each other for the last years.  Remember & tell him all I have said.  [word obscured] word about Miss Cheves if you would rather not, but tell the first part & the last part.  Mamma requests it & it must seem to him so ungrateful, that anything should cause Mammas friendship for him to cease.  Ann is delighted with the [word obscured] box, Susan with the Gold thimble.  They would rather have them than anything.  Bring Mamma a butter knife like ours instead of a book.  She will be very much pleased with it.  If you see no hat suitable for Will it is no consequence.  I can make one or send to town for one where they will be cheaper than in Columbia.  If you see a suitable one it is dear I would rather not have it.  I wish you to bring me no present.  Those things you have bought for the [word obscured]  particularly the silver forks I will consider as my present.  You cant afford to buy so many different things, so I would much rather you buy nothing more for me.  Next year when money is more plenty, you can bring me a thimble or music box or something of the kind, so I pray you buy nothing more for me.  The butter knives & forks & other things I regard as presents.  If you see no cheap hat for Will just bring him a little trifle.  All the money saved  now will go towards �ing for the house next year.  Bring Mamma a butter knife like ours, the Musical box to Ann & thimble to Susan, yourself & the books to me.  Do not send them by anyone beforehand; wait & bring them yourself.  E.F. Perry

I have broken open my letter to tell you that though I give you advice I do not wish you in the least to be influenced by me, against your judgement, for you I believe have as good a judgement as anybody, better than mine.
