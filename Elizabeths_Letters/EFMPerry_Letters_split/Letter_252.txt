Letter 252

Sunday, Dear Anna

I have just received a letter from you & will answer it tomorrow.  Thank Aunt Brewton in my name for yours & Willie�s presents.  It was very kind, & they will be very useful.

You have so much to bring for yourself, I dare say you will not have room for Mrs. Herriot�s boxes.  If so, you must return them, & tell her you are sorry you cannot bring them.  After awhile, persons will be going down from here who can bring them for her.  Your affectionate, E.F.P.

Anna Perry
