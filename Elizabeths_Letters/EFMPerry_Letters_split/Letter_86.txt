Letter 86

Greenville

My dear husband

	I received your second letter Wednesday night, & was very much pleased to hear from you.  It would have been a great disappointment if Mary had returned from the office without a letter, for a letter from you now is the principal incident in our lives.  You say I must write if it is only to say we are all well.   I have not much more of interest now to tell you, so you must blame circumstances & not me, if you receive uninteresting letters.  I wrote you Monday.  I must now think of all that has happened since Tuesday & Wednesday.  It rained incessantly, so that Willie & Anna were obliged to stay from school, but they each said their lessons to me.  They are both smart children, & learn with great ease.  Willie learns now a history lesson every day.   Wednesday Jim killed the smallest hog.  He said the other hogs would kill it, if he did not.  They fought it constantly so I made no objection, & we now have some fresh meat to eat.  I sent a peice to Mamma .  It is very fat meat.  The weather has not continued long enough to kill all of the hogs.  Mr. Phillips has not sent any hams yet.   Wednesday Mr. Croft sent me some Packages from Pamela.  He had just returned, & had passed one night at Mrs. Cunningham�s on his return.  Pamela sent your books �Moultrie�s American Revolution,� �Drayton�s Memoir,� �Hallam�s Literature�.  She sent you a beautiful�& Mrs. Cunningham sent me a small book, called �Woman�s Mission.�  Pamela wrote me a letter.  They had but recently arrived at Rosemonte, & she had been sick with Chill & Fever.  She had intended going to the Lower Country this month, but as she had just reached home, she did not know now when she would go; perhaps not until the Spring, when she expected again to go to the Island.  The purse, she said she finished the very day Mr. Croft arrived.  She intended writing a note with it, but Mr. Croft was�so short of time, she was not able to, so I must present her kind regards & beg you to accept this simple offering of her conviction of your honesty & purity of purpose in public life, & whenever you looked at it in Washington (that den of corruption) it must serve to remind you that your fiends look to you on all occasions to display that love of Country, which disregards party interests & individual aggrandizement!  I wish I was as certain my dear husband that you will have the opportunity of so acting as she is.  I am afraid this Rail Road business will injure you greatly in Anderson, but even if it has injured you there, I know your first duty was to Greenville, therefore it cannot be.  I only hope Mr. Orr is as much injured in Laurens as you are in his District & that you are at any rate even, (but here comes the suggestion).  Mr. Orr has been successful in his efforts for the Road, & you have not been.  Mr. Orr�s friends will be so grateful they will do all they can to elect him, however I will not worry.  I know you act as duty inculcates & I hope in the end you will be rewarded.  I hope you have not estranged Genl Thompson & Mr. Read from you.  It is well if you can, to retain them as your friends, as they are the leading Whigs in this Congressional District.  The Canvas in which you are now engaged is so extensive & so important, that great circumspection is required to ensure success.  You know I always wish you to act honorably & independently.  All I ever fear is, that when there is no reason for it, you will act independently, & without cause injure yourself, just to show your independence.  I think you are justified in honorably doing all you can to retain & make friends, but ! will go on to other subjects, that I know you think more within my sphere.  The Book Mrs. Cunningham has sent me, Pamela says they had read & were very much pleased with, that they knew I would like it, it would give me many ideas as to governing children.  

       I was interrupted in my letter by a visit from Mr. & Mrs. Rowland.  Mr. Rowland said as the Greenville & Laurens Stockholders withdrew , from the Convention, those who were left, applauded them, that they were treated with no respect.  I am very sorry the Convention should so have ended & that Greenville should have lost the road.  What do you think now will be done. Will Greenville do anything again toward having a Road?  Yesterday morning Jim cleaned out the Stable yard & in the afternoon I rode with the children to Mr. Buists�s to know when he was going to Bachelors Retreat.  Mrs. Doloc wishes me to send something by him.  He is going there to assist in the ordination of Mr. Hillhouse.  They are to have a 3 days meeting.  I had not been on the Spartanburgh road since I paid a visit to Mr. Buist with you years ago.  This morning Jim is hauling wood  & this afternoon, I intend going to see Mrs. Pearson.  Fanny is sweeter than ever & gets more interesting the older she grows.  She knows me now, & I love her so, when she cries to come to me.  She also knows Delia, & sometimes likes to go to her from me.  She is my little comfort at night.  A father is necessary to a child, when she is looking & behaving so sweetly.  I always wish you were here to see her.  Frank is shaking my desk, & saying he wishes Pa would come.  Almost every morning & in the middle of the night, when he wakes, his first exclamatiion is �has Pa come�?  I say no, he says, �well then I dreamt he had come�.  One morning he said,  �I dreamt Pa was baptized�.  I asked him who baptized him, he said, �he baptized himself�.  When the children behave badly, I tell them I will write & tell you, & it distresses them very much, & they beg me not to.  I think they have behaved pretty well, since you left.  The servants do as usual.  Minerva ought to be satisfied.  I have as little cooking as possible, so as to allow her plenty of time to make her clothes.  I have been very busy making Delia Mary & Lindy�s clothes.  I have not touched the Worsted work.  Except going behind the Carri[a]ge, I do not miss Edward in the least.  Lindy with ease does what he did.  I would like when he returns, to put Lindy with Mary McLeod to learn to wash iron & cook, so that she may be a useful servant.  She has a good temper & I want to make her a valuable servant.  At Mamma�s they are as usual.  Susan has had headache lately.  Mamma says she would like you to get a chair like ours, even if you had to give more.  I must now close & will only say if I have given more advice than you care for.  You must  consider it only as a vent to my thoughts, that I have no one to listen to me as you do, & that I have perfect confidence in my dear husband that he always acts as duty & honor dictates, & that his good judgement will carry him safely through life.  I hope even to a better world , in spite of his wifes interference.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

	If Fanny will permit me I wish to write to you this morning.  I have the charge of her, Delia & Mary having gone to the Spring to wash.  She is now lying on the floor, but does not seem satisfied with her position.  I received a letter from you last night, & Willie also received one.  He answered his immediately, so you will get two letters again the next Mail, but I know it will not be too much of a good thing for you.  I must give you a scold, for breaking your word & being extravagant when you promised you would not.  It is well for you to say, you got the books to send to me this winter.  Your conscience told you, you must give me some excuse, for doing exactly what you told me you were not going to do.  There are more books in the Library now, than I can expect to read, & until we have read those, there is no necessity to buy any more.  There is no room in the Library even to place them.  Those that Pamela sent back, I cannot find a place for.  If you buy books to please me, I would like Mrs. Opie�s, Mrs. Sherwood�s, Miss R��s works , & others of the like kind.  Novels, I do not care for, but such works as I have mentioned, are improving & interesting & light, serve to wile away an hour agreeably.  Your books, almost all of them are too deep & solid, for the general reader.  Yesterday Mamma & Susan stopped on their way from church to see me, & they went in the Library to choose a book for Ann, & except two or three little books I had bought there was scarcely one suitable for her, who was sick & wished something amusing & interesting.  There are so many things we need for the house, necessities that we will be obliged soon to supply, that we ought both to deny ourselves of whatever we can do without, that we may have money to supply those wants.  We now need many things, Staircase Carpet, Waiters, Face Towels, Cups & Saucers, Dinner set &c&c, but even these things we must try & do without as long as we can.  It must be a�tation to you, when in Columbia, & particularly in a Book store, to forget all of your economical resolutions.  I cannot blame you, in Charleston last winter I saw so many things I wished to get, & it was such a good opportunity to supply all my wants that I could not but regret that my means did not allow me to, & I did spend to the very last cent almost, all that you gave me.  I would never go to town again, unless I had plenty of money, as I know that will never be the case.  I for my part need not regret the Rail Road failure.  It would have been no immediate benefit to me.  It would have brought crowds of friends to see us, but not carried us to see them in return.  It would not have cheapened the price of board in Charleston, & would have made things dearer here.  I am not so selfish as to begrudge to others the benefit they would have received, so if the failure of the Road is an injury to my State,  I do regret it, but I do not regret it for myself.  Genl Whitner is really anxious to be elected Judge, & I am sure he has no claims to it, for he is not I believe, even a good Lawyer.  He would make a poor Judge.  Honour has certainly something more fascinating in it, than money, for Col. Memminger I suppose makes a great deal more as a Lawyer, than he will as Judge, but he wishes the honour of being a Judge.  I have always felt so.  I would not wish the honour with no money, but I am satisfied  with less money & some honour.  You tantalize when you say, Col. Martin says if you continued in the Senate, you would be elected President of it.  If I were certain of that I would wish you to continue, for you would then still practice Law, & the position would be just as honorable & even more so than if you were in Congress.  I suppose though it is entirely uncertain if you would be elected President, & at any rate it is too late to change for Col. Brockman considers perhaps himself as in the field.  I believe if you are confident you can be elected to Congress, & at the same time practice Law, & support your family, though you have to give up half you make to a partner, I am satisfied I would have liked you to have been a Judge above all things, but there are so many aspirants for that office, & would be also for the President of the Senate that I need worry myself, that you will lose all chance of ever being elected to those offices.  In a few years as our young servants grow up, we must�or sell some of the older ones & make something in that way.  When Edward can drive, we can sell Jim, & when Lindy is older we can sell Mary & Minerva & Lindy herself or hire them out.  I would like now to hire out some of them.  I am glad you have heard good news from Stephens, & that Genl Thompson is interested in your election.  As you are a Candidate, I wish you elected.  Mrs. Duloc wrote me word you had a great many warm friends in Pickens.  Willie was very much pleased with your letter.  As I read it to him, the tears came into his eyes.  Every evening I hear him his lessons, & after that he reads to me or asks questions.  We sit up till 9 oclock, & I am so busy working I am sorry then to go to bed.  I have�now for all of my learning.  Woman�s Mission, which Mrs. Cunningham sent me, I find I have read.  Aunt Eliza sent it to Susan; in it, I recollect reading to you, that Mothers must recollect they were to be the Mothers of grown up men, as well as children, & must improve their minds, to keep pace with them respect them.  Saturday Jim & Charles killed the Steer.  It is not very nice meat, tastes poor, however it is some help; the hog also that was killed, was�by the other hogs so I do not eat the meat with much pleasure, but it makes no difference with the servants.  As regards the presents you are to bring us, I wish you to be economical & bring trifles.  I assure you we do not care for valuable presents.  Bring Susan & myself a string of Black beads, such as you got us before.  I think the price was 621/2 cts.  Bring Ann a basket if you see a pretty one to put her knitting in, if not some little trifle.  Bring Anna a Match to her China Doll, bring Willie a Knife, bring Frank some Marbles he says & a knife.  He needs a cap for the Winter, but I expect I could get a cheaper & prettier one in Charleston.  I could send for one, but do as you think about the Cap.  Bring Fanny a Straw Rattle; in Charleston they cost�so I can send for one, if there are none cheap in Columbia, & bring her an Ivory ring if you see them cheap.  I mention these things, but you can bring whatever you think best, provided they cost little.  We are counting the days until you return.  You must write every Mail, if it is only a line.  Willie says I must tell you to be sure, and ask Mr. Summer for his dog.  Since I began writing, I have held Fanny repeatedly, & have now put her to sleep.  She is more & more interesting.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry

P.S. I do not�to scold you for buying books.  You must get whatever you wish, but I like lighter works�.
