Letter 266

Saturday afternoon, [May 1853]
[Charleston]

My dear husband

	I received at dinner your letter by Mr. Vandiver.  I am too sorry I did not see you yourself.  I cannot consent that you should not come down.  Instead of my going up Tuesday, I wish you to come down here Tuesday, stay Wednesday, & reach home Friday, & that will be exactly the 3 weeks I expected to be away.  I am very anxious to see the children, but I am equally anxious that my relations may see my noble husband so you must come if only for the day.  You will get this letter Sunday.  Write by return Mail so I may hear Monday 2 oclock that you are coming for me.  My visit will end so much more delightfully, if you come down & carry me up, & you will be delayed only a little�.  An old gentleman in this house Mr. Colbrun, is a good Union man, subscribes�your paper from the�Mr. Pettigru went to him, & he would be so glad to see you, so will Uncle Arthur, Aunt Hayne & all.  My friends have been very kind.  Mrs. Tom Lowndes sent to ask me to take tea tonight, but I was engaged to Eloisa..  Mrs. James Heyward asked me Monday.  Persons are just beginning to find out I am here, but I do not mind all this, except I want you to come, that my friends may see you.  If you cannot possibly come, I will go up Tuesday�is that I wish my friends to see you.  You are so near, & you will be delayed only two days longer from Greenville, so write me by Mondays Mail that you will come, that you will have the pleasure of coming here, & carrying me up which I prefer to Mr. Vandiver.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

 You will be only two days longer from home.
