Letter 77

Monday morning, 6 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband
	
       I received your letter written at Columbia last night, & it gave me unfeigned pleasure.  I was in hopes you would write, yet feared you might not have the time.  Do write to me whenever you can. But still do not let it interfere with your writing to others, or any other engagement you may have.  When I read to Willie & Anna what you said of them, the tears came into Willie�s eyes, & Anna cried & said, �I want Pa.�  Frank not long before, while laying by my side, had said, �I want Pa to come now.�  So you see they all cherish for you a deep affection, & it would be long indeed before they would forget you.  You have told one peice of news I am sorry for, that is that Col. Fair, Mr. Caldwell, and Mr. Vance are going to the North.  Now though at one time I thought it would be pleasant for you to have a travelling companion, I now decidedly think it would be pleasanter to be without one.  You will interfere with each other, one will wish to go one way & one another, alone, you can do just as you please.  Besides you have so many letters of introduction, the others I suppose have none, & you being with them, you may be induced not to deliver them.  You say you wish to look at the country, more than to become acquainted with people.  Now I have sent you to the North to become acquainted with people, as well as to look at the country, & all of these persons to whom you carry letters will assist you to see the country to better advantage.  Mamma expects you to deliver all of hers. So does Mrs. Butler.  She will be gratified at your seeing her friends, who are even of the same name with yourself, & as soon as you do see them, you must write me word that I may have the pleasure of telling her.  At any rate some of them you must see.  You must be sure to deliver all of Mr. Poinsetts.  It will not put you to inconvenience to do so, for you intend visiting all the places where his friends are.  This is perhaps the only time you will ever be able to go to the North it is just as important you should see the great men as the country.  Therefore I wish you to become acquainted with them, & they with you.  In my opinion you are greater than any of them & I wish them to see you.  It will be a pleasure to you I know to see persons of whom you have heard of for so long a time , & I will be mortified, & never forgive you, & scold you well, if you return home without availing yourself of the opportunity afforded you of becoming acquainted with persons.  Therefore, that you may have it in your power to go where, & do as you please, travel alone, & not bind yourself to the company of anyone.  You can see & be with Col. Fair as much as you wish next winter in Columbia.  Another thing I wish to tell you is, not to return home too soon, as you are not going to Columbia, there is no reason you should hurry, travel at your leisure, & see everything worth seeing.  Be sure to go as far as Niagara.  I must [page smudged] description of it from you.  The Catskill mountain house 3000 feet [page smudged].  Hudson, where there is one of the finest views in the world, must be worth visiting, in short go everywhere.  I am sure your money is enough.  If not contract your purchases, & then you will certainly have enough.  I will not expect you home, till the middle of September.  Mamma says you need not be uneasy about me, she will take good care of me.  She has been with me constantly since you left.  She was gratified at your remembrance of Susan, Ann & herself.  You must always mention them.  They think so highly of you.  They value your remembrance.  Mamma desires the best love.  I must tell you John�s opinion of you.  He said as he drove from the door the last evening you were here , �Major Perry is the finest gentleman I ever knew, although he is not a Christian.�  I am happy to tell you we have had rain.  It commenced raining yesterday afternoon , & continued raining all night in a gentle manner, which must have done good, without washing the land.  March says they expected to finish ploughing today, but the ground is too wet.  He says a great deal of the corn is tasseling, & that it is clean, & free of grass.  As the horses are at leisure, I intend riding out this afternoon for the first time.  I will go to the farm & send your directions.  Today is a fortnight since I lay in bed sick & suffering, & at night met with such a disappointment.  You do not know how great it was.  I feel it still.  Yesterday I went down stairs for a little while, & I could not think how differently I had gone down from what I expected.  But I am thankful I am now almost well, & have no sufferings to look forward to.  I feel now for Susan, who can have no idea what she is to go through.  Willie this morning said, I must beg you to bring him some books particularly one called �Mother Goose�s Melodies,� which he once owned, but it is torn up, so bring that, & a few simple books with pictures.  Frank wants a whip [page torn] a doll, & other things innumerable.  I told her you will not have room to bring [page torn] said you must get someone else to bring them for you.  With regard to the Music box, I would like one if you can get it reasonable, a large one, & it is not beyond your means.  It must play beautiful tunes.  You must get a better judge of Music than you are to select it.  But if on enquiry you find they are dear, more than you can afford, you must not think of bringing me one.  Another time when  you can better afford it, I would get one.  Now I wish you to spend as much money as you choose in travelling, & not deny yourself in that way at all.  The next thing I would like after a Musical box is a Bracelet if they are worn & I believe they still are.  Alex McBee brought Caroline Reinhardt one.  It was very showy with stones in it , & cost $6.50.  That is not the kind I wish.  I wish a plain genteel one suitable to wear to church & visiting.  Inquire of a Jeweller which kind are fashionable & select a plain genteel but pretty one.  I suppose such a one would not at the utmost cost more than 5 dollars, & I would like you to buy me two gold pins, to pin my Mantle on at each shoulder.  All of these things are only mentioned, supposing your money holds out, a Large Music box in Charleston costs 20 dollars.  In New York I suppose they would be much less.   Mamma wishes you to buy for her Masselon�s sermons.  She thinks them the best she has ever read.  If they are not too dear, you might bring them to her as a present.  Bring also a present for Susan & Ann, however trifling.  They would value it as coming from you.  I will direct this letter to Washington, & hope it will reach there, before you leave.  4th of July was celebrated here by the Sunday school teachers & scholars marching from the church to the academy, there listening to Addresses by Mr. Capers & Spears, the latter Willie said 2 hours long & then eating.  I have not a particle of news to tell.  I appreciate all you said in your letter of your wife & children, & can only say I wish my husband was as blessed in his wife, as his wife is in her husband.  When you return I promise to do all I can to merit the love of such a noble being.  Your letter was indeed precious to me, one of the most valuable I have ever received.  As you say I have influence over you , follow my advice to your travels, travel alone, so as to be at liberty to go everywhere, & see all the persons you wish.  I assure you you will see persons & things, to much greater advantage.  Your attached wife, E.F.P.
