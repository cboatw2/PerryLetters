Letter 95

Saturday night, 1 April 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will write you a few lines tonight, to send by Mr. Elford tomorrow.  I wrote you a long letter by Mail, a few days ago, directed it to Anderson, thinking you would be there Thursday, to receive it, but in your letter to me, you mentioned you expected to leave Anderson, Wednesday morning.  If you did, you cannot have received my letter, & I am very sorry for it.  I would be sorry for it never to be read by you, for whom it was intended, & very sorry it should be read by anyone else.  It contained all that occurred Sunday Monday & Tuesday after you left.  It mentioned a visit Mr. Croft paid me, & his conversation, & had some advice in it, that I think might be of benefit to you for life.  I do not like to repeat over again in this letter, what I said in that, for you may perchance have received it, but if you have not, you must write to the Post Master to forward it to you immediately.  Perhaps some are going to Pickens might carry it to you.  If not, have it sent by Mail.  I received your letter by Mr. Elford, & it gave me great pleasure, particularly as it contained good news.  I only hope you are not deceiving  yourself, as you think Mr. Orr is himself, but it seems to me so impossible that Mr. Orr should be preferred to you, that I cannot but think you will be elected.  Mr. Orr I expect is like one of the Candidates for Sheriff at the last Election here.  He you know was confident of being elected, until Mr. Goodlett came out. He had such a high opinion of his own merits, he thought the people must have the same. But he was greatly mistaken, & I hope in this instance someone will [page torn]  themselves greatly mistaken too.  It would rejoice me so to have this�person beaten & badly beaten, for daring to oppose you, who is so much better fitted than he is, to assist in the councils of the nation, & so much better entitled to it.  You must my dear try your best, do not deceive yourself, & if unsure, you must as Mr. Croft said, make assurance doubly sure.  Papers have come for you, & only two letters which I send to you.  Mrs. Thompson continues the same.  I hear the Doctors say, though so low, she may linger yet several weeks.  Mrs. Hay is very ill with Consumption, so of course she cannot get well..  Mrs. James Williams (Ann D�Oyley) has a son, & Mrs. Barnard Cleveland an infant.  I first hear it was a daughter, then a son, so I do not know which it is.   Mrs. Bryan & Henrietta D�Oyley came to see me yesterday.  I sent Mrs. D�Oyley this week, four of the largest of Mrs. Griffins Hams.  They weighed 62 ? pounds.  Miss Williford & Emma Service came to see me day before yesterday.  They asked if you would take a bundle to Pickens for Mrs. Duloc.  I said you were not here, but I intended writing by Mr. Elford, & expected he would take the bundle, so I sent to him to know & he said yes, anything he would take.  So I send the bundle, & you must give it to someone to carry to Mrs. Duloc.  They are things she wrote to Miss Wiliford to buy for her.  I have been busy in the garden all this week, & have almost got it into order.  Mary only has been working in it.  Delia has pain in her chest & neck, so does not seem to be of much use there.  Mary is a first rate hand.  I have let Lindy go to the farm to�Corn.  Mary shall go next week, but she ought not to work too hard now.  Minerva says she herself expects to be confined in June, so Mary I expect I should think expected much sooner.  The garden looks very nicely.  I have planted some of all the seeds.  Miss Williford said they were planting their second crop of Squashes, Cucumbers, Okra &c. so I thought it high time our first crop should be planted.  I looked at the plants today Mrs. Cunningham gave me, & they are most of them putting out leaves already.  The Mountain Ash,�&c. so I hope all will live.  The incident you mention of Esquire Long, his saying I asked him if I was not as good looking as Susan, is quite a mistake.  I have such a good memory, that such a thing I would not have forgotten, & besides it does not sound like me.  It seems to ne I recollect Susan�s saying someone praised me, & added by way of complement, so that she might not be offended, that she was almost as good looking.  Something of this kind I think occurred.  I walked to Mamma�s this afternoon with all the children.  In my other letter I mentioned going there last Monday afternoon.  They inquired after you.  Mrs. Butler stopped one day & left Headleys �Washington & His Generals�, & asked for the second vol.  She expected to meet Behethland here, but Behethland had not come.  She did not come in.  She said I must go & see her.  She was going to be ceremonious.  I have been out only 3 times since you left, once to church & twice to Mamma�s.  Willie is still head.  He will soon finish his History book, & then he wishes to commence Geography.  Anna is full of May day.  Monday they are to elect their Queen.  Frank & Fanny are well.  I know of no news to tell you.  I long to hear from you again.  After Pickens Court is over, you had better employ the remainder of the week, in travelling over the District, going to places you may not be able to go to when Musters, or other gatherings take place, when perhaps you will be attending meetings in the other Districts, & you cannot like Mr. Orr divide yourself in half, & be in both places at once.  Make sociable calls at as many houses As you can, before you come home again.  Mrs. Bowen the person I bought Eggs & onions from once & made such bad bargains, was here today.  She says her husband is Robert Bowen & lives in Anderson.  Miss Williford says Dr. Alston left 60000 dollars to be divided among his 3 grandsons, & Mrs. Alston�s property is larger than his, so when she dies they will have more.  Mrs. Walker sent me word, she would have been to have seen me, but she had to walk now.  They had sold their horses.  I asked the servant why they sold them.  She said they were old, & her Master wanted to buy a better pair.  This is Saturday night.   The children are asleep, & I must now go upstairs.  Adieu, my dearest.  Ever Your obedient. faithful, & loving Wife, E.F.P.
