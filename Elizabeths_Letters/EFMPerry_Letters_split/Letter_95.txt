Letter 95

Wednesday night, 9 December 1846
Charleston    

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you tonight, & though I wrote to you today, I will write again to tell you, that I will go up Friday.  Col. Isaac Hayne goes that day, & I will go under his protection, & it will then be optional with us whether to go on to Greenville Saturday morning, or remain in Columbia until Tuesday morning.  If I go Saturday I will be obliged to wait in Columbia until Tuesday, but going Friday will allow me to do as I choose, & if you think there is the least risk of the Scarlet fever, I will go on at once.  I am prepared to hear of your defeat.  I cannot but be provoked that you should have suffered your name to be used, & then done not the least thing to be elected.  I must say it was foolish conduct, & in future I hope you will never apply for an office, unless you intend to try to get it.  I think it is perfectly right to use honorable means to ensure success.  You suffered your name to be used, & yet acted in the very best way not to get votes.  Why whoever heard of such a thing. I could not help scolding, for indeed you deserve it.  The world will think we are mortified not knowing how you acted.  But you must not give up, another time I dare say you will succeed.  I spent today after shopping & visiting at Aunt Eliza�s.  My most pleasant days have been spent with her & Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna, & also a delightful day I spent with Aunt Emily & Aunt Sarah.  The other days I spent out were also quite pleasant.  Mamma�s Sisters are uncommonly fine ladies; they have noble qualities.  When I returned home tonight, I found that Aunt Mary McCall had been to see me & left me a beautiful China Ink stand.  E� gave us some presents today.  I assure you I have been most kindly treated by my friends.  Aunt Eliza was regretting today that I would not have staid with her.  She is a cheering lady, & more congenial with me than those with whom I have been staying, but my Aunts have been�& considering the close disposition that one of them has, I have been made more welcome that I thought I would be, but still knowing that failing, it makes me feel badly as myself & family being here, must be a little extra expense & that little expense, I know must be regretted.  I have been glad whenever I had an invitation out, so as to be as little expense as possible.  If I had been at Aunt Eliza�s, I would have staid until the adjournment, & let you come down for me, but Aunt Anna is not prepared to entertain gentlemen, & you would not have found it pleasant.  I think I have now staid long enough with her, & I will be delighted to see you, & happy to be at home.  Though my visit has exceeded my expectations, I have had real heartfelt pleasure in being with my friends, a feeling I have not had for years, for in Greenville there is nobody with the exception of Mamma�s family who love me, but here there are many.  I assure you no body in Charleston has more sincere friends than Mamma, & loving her, makes them take an interest in me.  I am sorry Mamma ever left Charleston.  She would have been saved many troubles if she had not, & it is more respectable for persons to be among their relations.  Mrs. Whitefoord Smith who in Greenville seems to be thought nothing of, in Charleston would be respected if it was only [on] account of her son, who is said to be the most distinguished preacher in the city.  Persons advanced in life at an age that you are not apt to contract friendships, ought to remain where they are brought up.  Aunt Mary really wishes me to leave Anna with her, but Anna will not consent, or I would do it.  Aunt Mary loves little girls.  Aunt Eliza says she would be a little treasure among [word obscured] all.  You must not be mortified  at your [two words obscured] , & I suppose you are not, for from the way you acted you must have wished to be mortified.  Good night.  Your affectionate & wise better half, E.F.P.

P.S. I would like to stay at the Congaree House, & I should think you would prefer it, for otherwise you will have to leave your lodgings, or be away from me.  I am not mortified at your defeat, & I am sure it has done you no harm, & perhaps good, as you may be thought of in future for the bench.  Still I wish you had thought soon of coming forward & been on a footing with the others & tried as hard as they did, then you might have succeeded, & I am certain you would have beat �.
