Letter 203

Wednesday morning, 20 minutes of 10 oclock, 28 April 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just read your letter to Anna.  She is at school, & will be pleased when she comes home to hear from you.  I write only because later in the day, I am generally interrupted.

	I am glad to tell you that the blacks portion of your household are almost well.  Minerva yesterday after dinner, returned to the Mansion House where I hope she will remain.  Charlotte recovered entirely of her pain.  Mary while I was writing I believe stopped ironing. & lay down, & looked so stupid�& complained of the pain in her chest. & the medicine not acting much, I sent for Dr. Crooks.  He was at Laurens so I sent for Dr. Dean, & he said the pain proceeded from improper eating, that it was not Pneumonia, & he gave her Blue pills, prescribed Mustard plaster & Sage tea, & this morning she is up, & says she feels well.  I always like Dr. Deans prescriptions.  He says he would rather treat any disease than Pneumonia, that the lungs are effected (or affected) a vital part, & before you are aware the Patient is in danger, he dies.

	This morning Frank while dressing came into the room crying, with his face swollen, & said his cheeks being�, I expect he has the Measles which are all about.  So I have not sent him to school, but he is playing now, & seems in no pain.  He was afraid at first, they would kill him.  If the children will only wait & take them after May day I will not be sorry, as it is as well to have them now, as any other time, but I have fitted them in clothes for May day, so do not wish to lose my trouble.  Frank I expect will be well by then, so I am not troubled on that account.  He is grieving over the loss of his last pigeon which Charlotte with delight told him Minervas cat had eaten.

	Fanny complained of costiveness last Saturday, & I gave her a dose of Oil & last night again, & I gave her Rhubarb.  I am afraid at school she does not go out as often as she wishes, which will be very bad for her, so I dare say I will keep her at home, if she complains often in this way; otherwise she is well.  I have kept her at home today.

	Hext is quite well & steps about holding to something.  He crawled upstairs yesterday.  I followed after him.  He had a flower he wished to put in his mouth, & was going upstairs where I would not see him, & when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the flower, a fit emblem of what comes often in life.  I believe I have no news at all to tell you.  Except to church I have not been out.  Mrs. Col. Irvine & Susan Hoke are the only persons who have been to see me.  I owe almost everyone visits, so I expect few visitors until I visit myself.   

	I am glad everything in the Convention goes on well, that the Members are cordial to you, & you are passing your time agreeably.  If you are enjoying yourself & treated with the respect you deserve, it is all I wish, I am happy.  I would be willing to be shut up in the Penitentiary you wish to build, if at the same time, you were receiving some deserts from your fellow men; but what makes me unhappy, is, that you should be unrewarded, & others so far your inferiors, in merit & ability should receive the prize you have won.  My. Orr so much your inferior in every respect, beat you for Congress & so it will be to the end of your life.  I must see you rewarded with some high Office or Honour before I leave this world.  I am thankful however for my many blessings, & first of all for my dear kind husband.  You have not mentioned Judge O�Neal[l] & your Daguerreotype.  How is your life & likeness progressing.  I hope you will have a good Daguerreotype taken  to transmit your intellectual features to posterity & that Judge O�Neal[l] will do your character justice & write with more warmth & spirit than you did of yourself & as regards one incident of your life, explains it in such a way as to exonerate you from blame, more than you did yourself.

	From what you say yourself & the Greenville Delegates except old Mr. McBee must be rooming together.  Is it so.  Mr. C� ought not to be unwell.  I suppose the life he now leads is so new to him, it does not agree with him.

	The poem you mention ought not to class you with Mr. Memminger Butler Orr & such who are influenced only by personal feelings, to keep themselves in power & gain Office & honor.  You stand apart, one the only one of prominence, who have acted from disinterested motives.  You lose everything, gain nothing, & have the independence to be stigmatized as a Submissionist, which deprives you of all hope of advancement & which str� prevents the others coming out as Union men.  I do hope though such nobleness will be rewarded.  

	I saw Genl Thompson�s carri[a]ge pass out of the village this morning, I suppose going to bring up himself & family.  I am sorry, wish he would always remain away, particularly now he courts you, & you are so foolish as to unite your prospects with his.  No one likes him, & it is his going over to your side that caused all the excitement at the Memminger meeting, & your predicted downfall.  He will never be of any good to you.  In his�he would not advance you if he could.

	I am glad Willie is enjoying himself.  It is a great pleasure to hear from you, but if you are too busy to write, let Willie write one line, to say you are well.  Truly, E.F.P.
