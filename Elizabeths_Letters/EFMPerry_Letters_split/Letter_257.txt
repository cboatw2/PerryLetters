Letter 257

Friday night, 6 May [1853]
Charleston

My dear husband

	Aunt Anna Turnbull came here this afternoon & she says I must stay with her.  So I write at once to ask you.  I hope this letter can go by tomorrows Mail, & you answer it Sunday, for I expect I had better stay my week out here, & go to Aunt Anna�s Monday morning.  If you stay some time longer in Columbia, I expect as Aunt Anna seems so sincere in her invitation that I had better move there, but if you expect in a few days to come for me, I might as well remain where I am.  Write the instant you get this letter & tell me how long you think you will be, before you come down & my movements will depend on that.  

	Eloisa Martin has just been here, & repeated her invitation to stay with her.  You write me what I had better do.  Mr. Arthur came to see me this afternoon.  Mr. Davis of Camden has been elected Bishop, high church Mr. Arthur says.  Write me immediately how long it will be before your business is over.  I will close so as to send this letter to the office.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
