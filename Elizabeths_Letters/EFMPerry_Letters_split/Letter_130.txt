Letter 130

Monday morning, 9 oclock.  Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a visit.  She is very anxious, that I should take Reuben, with the bill of Sale, & on your return if you do not wish him, let Mr. Beattie have him, or she says, or perhaps she may let Mr. McBee have him at once.  I told her I proposed that to Mr. Beattie but he said the other was the best plan.  I suppose Mr. Beattie in taking him now & selling him to you would have his debt paid, but otherwise he would not.  I cannot buy Reuben on my own responsibility, for I do not know whether you wish to buy him or not, so I will not take any step.  You write me word so I can hear Friday, whether you prefer buying him. Or prefer not.  Just tell me what you wish, & I will do exactly as you say.  Mrs. Harrison will be here I expect then, & then I can give her the answer.  I preferred waiting until you returned, that we might have a long talk on the matter, but I expect it will have to be settled now.  Mrs. Harrison asked who was elected Messenger to carry votes.  I told her I expected Mr. Black would be & told his motive for going.  She said he ought to be elected.  She says Mr. Jones is a candidate for Treasurer of upper division.  I hope he will not be elected.  You need not do anything for him.  I am going to his house today, but I am sorry to have to.  Mrs. Harrison has just paid me a second visit to say Mr. Nichols says he knows you will be willing to buy Reuben.  You write me word distinctly what to do, whether to buy him or not.  I will do just as you say.  Mr. Cox says he likes him.  Mr. Hoke & Dr. Crook say they do not.  You know what Jim is, & I expect you have some idea of what Reuben is, so just do as you think best.  Mrs. Kerrison is so anxious you should take him.  She seems averse to Mr. Beatties taking him, but you must do as you think best.  Do write me exactly what your wish is, so that I may not have to act on my responsibility, but yours.

		I have not said all I wished, so will write a little more.  If you have good news for Mr. Henry Thompson, you must write & tell him.  I am going soon to see his Wife.  Mrs. Tom Jones sees company, so Susan & myself are going to see her.  I suppose Genl Thompson has gone on to Washington to get an office.  He is well situated now, for his disposition, able to go wherever he pleases.  I do not think he is suited for domestic life.  As Mrs. Pattersons expectations were so large, I hope she got something, at any rate enough to make her lead a virtuous life, & not be the means of leading many a young man astray, as I expect she now does.  I wish my dear husband you would be elected Senator.  I have such aspirations for you.  I believe I would be happier, if you were a stupid ignorant man, for then I would expect nothing for you, & would be satisfied, but as it is, my opinion of you is so exalted,  my expectations for you are great, & as they are not realized, I am unhappy.  I am not envious of others, but I am provoked, when those, so far your inferior, triumph over you.  I never can forgive the people of Pickens, Anderson, & Laurens for letting Mr. Orr beat you, when they knew what low means, he was using, & should have made them feel a contempt for him, instead of that to put him in such an honorable position, as he now holds.  Mr. Burt acted basely, & I hope he may never succeed in obtaining an office again, but he is so mean I dare say he will.  Col. Irby, Mr. Sullivan the Pendleton people & others, I think are contemptible, & yet such a man as Sullivan, can get forward better than you, & I dare say will be a Member of Congress some day.  If you can do nothing better, you must go back in the Legislature, which I am sorry you quitted, for another time you might have been elected to Congress.  It was most unfortunate you should have come out when you did.  I wish you had staid 4 years more in the Senate, & then run for Congress.  When I think of these things I am so unhappy.  I cannot feel as happy as I once did.  I have a bitter, mortified feeling, which I will never get over, until you have triumphed over your enemies, & made them see, that they cannot always pull you down.  Then again I will be happy, & I hope that time will come.  It is too bad to think that such men as Garvin, Reid, Whi�, headed by Calhoun, just as mean as they are, should succeed in preventing your obtaining the place, that Providence by giving you the proper qualifications for, meant you to have.  I hope they will yet be mortified, by seeing you successful.  I hope experience will teach you in future to manage better, for you are greatly to blame yourself.  Your publishing your peice, your controversy with Sullivan occasioned your defeat, & now that it is over, the speeches we can see helped to it, but I know  you acted for the best, though unwisely, so now I will stop.  Fanny is better & looks better & prettier than I ever saw her.  Write me every Mail.  The rest of us are well.  It has been a relief to me to write what I have done.  You know I must express my thoughts to you, & it is my high opinion of you that makes me feel you have been so illy treated.  Your defeat is astonishing.  I cant understand how you could have been except there are too many Mr. Burts.  I hope Mr. Burt will be defeated.  He is one of your worst enemies, & pretending to be a friend.  Mrs. B�. who you & Mr. Beattie & other denominations have to support, immediately after Mr. Beattie had paid 5 dollars on Mr. Elfords subscription, went into Mr. Beatties store & bought 16 dollars worth of velvet to make herself a V�, supported by C�, & then to be so extravagant, more so than the wives of those who support me.  Tell Col. Evans & Mr. Elford of this.
