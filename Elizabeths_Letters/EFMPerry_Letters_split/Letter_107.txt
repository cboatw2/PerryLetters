Letter 107

Wednesday, 1/2 past 12, 24 November 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I take up my pen to write to you, with very little to write about.  We are all well.  Nothing more from the Post office this morning for you, a letter from Aunt Mary McCall to me, & letters from Aunt Eliza & Alston to Mamma is all that came.  Aunt Eliza is expecting Anna down, & says Mr. Taylor & Sarah requested her, to ask you to carry her to stay with them.  If they ask her in Columbia, let her stay with them.  Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Isaac Hayne are to be in Columbia & if they are at Sarahs, Anna will find it pleasant having companions among their children, & less lonely than at the boarding house, where she will be alone, while you are away all day.

	Col. Town[e]s came this morning for your office key.  He has brought it back again.  He says he sets off for Columbia tomorrow with his brother Augustus in a private conveyance, so he will not get as quickly as the Mail, or I would write by him.

	The Spotted Cow has a Calf, a few days old.  Charles says he will let it remain at the Farm until we can use the Milk.  Charles is today hauling wood with Mamma�s horse.  I suppose Reuben will be back tomorrow.  I hope you have arrived safely in Columbia & feel better than when you left.  I am glad you now have fine weather.  Today I hope you are going on safely to the end of your journey.

	Write me how Anna behaves, & if she enjoys herself.  Willie�s school breaks up tomorrow.  I will ride to Mr. McClanahans & pay him as soon as the horses have rested on their return.  

	I have no news to tell you.  Write me everything you know I am interested in all that goes on.  I will have more to write about when I hear from you.    I will then give you advice, which I know you are longing for.

	We are getting on quite well.  I hope Anna & yourself are also.  I write only to keep you from being uneasy, for I have literally nothing to write about.  I hope tomorrow or the next day to hear from you or Anna.  My love to her.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	This is a bad day.  It commenced raining all day.  Reuben got home last night about Supper time.  The horses are quite well.  He says you set off before he left & you were quite well.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow morning.  Anna�s first day in Columbia has been a gloomy one.  But I hope she will pass her time pleasantly.  She can commence her quilt if she remains long in Columbia.  I hope she may stay with Sarah Taylor, but she may not like your not carrying her to her house at once, & therefore may not ask her again.  Your first appearance in the Legislature has been in bad weather.  I hope you are comfortably situated at your Hotel & able to get along with convenience though with a broken arm.

	Willie has come from school.  He has now done with Mr. Leary.  He brought his bill 10.25 which I will pay.  Frank is the only one who will be going to school.  Fanny�s breaks up tomorrow.  She staid at home today on account of the rain.  Nothing came from the Post office this morning.  I have no news to tell you.  Mamma & Susan came in yesterday.  They are well.  Reuben is cleaning carriage & harness, Charles shelling corn.  As soon as Reuben returned, Charles accused him of carrying off one night last week a load of Potatoes. But it turned out to be a load of�he was carrying over to Minerva to fix up a Stove in her room.  Mr. Lasly is cutting down the timber at the Farm to build the house.

	I will stop now & write a few lines to Anna.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

My dear husband

 	I was disappointed not to hear from you this morning, but I know you had not time to write the evening of your arrival in Columbia.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow morning.

	This is a bad day again.  Charles says it will rain until the moon changes.  Willie says a man in N. Carolina (so Mr. Leary told him) has predicted another freshet before Christmas worse than the late one.  It seems as if this prediction may come to pass.

	I am glad to tell you the missing Heifer came up yesterday, little aware of its fate, & at this moment the rain having ceased awhile Charles, Reuben & Willie are all engaged dispatching it.  Our last Ham gave out at breakfast so we were absolutely in need of meat.  This now will last us a long time.  We will with the different Beeves we can kill, have a supply for a long time.  Nothing came from the Post office this morning.  

	As Willie will have holiday for some time, I have told him he ought to improve his time systematically, read something improving first, then something interesting & afterwards making himself useful in cutting wood, hauling it &c., so he has commenced Bancrofts History of the United States, & read a good way in it.  

	John wets himself going to the Spring. & takes off his Shoes constantly, so he has taken cold, & Minerva makes such a fuss about him.  Came over late last night & early this morning, that I sent for Dr. Crooks.  He said he only had bad cold, must take Castor oil & Toddy & that was all that was necessary.  So he is in the cellar today.  But when the weather is good, he will come out.  The shoes you gave him, have shrunk so he cannot get them on.  I gave him a pr of Franks, & when they go will have to buy him a pr.

	I sent for Mr. Chandler to look at the leak in the floor of the balcony.  He says he will put a peice of tin against the house where the floor of the balcony joins & that will stop the leaking.

	I know of nothing new to tell you.  I have not been out since you left, & seen no one but Mamma & Susan once, & Col. Town[e]s for a few moments.

	I am afraid Anna has not enjoyed herself yet. As the weather if it is as bad in Columbia as here must prevent her going out.

	Fanny would not go to school today on account of the rain.  Frank has just returned.  He says Mr. Hillhouse the boys say is to be married to a Lady in Union.  I believe I have nothing more to write about.  This is the fourth letter I have written & have not heard once yet.  I hope you are well, & getting along comfortably.  I have put by two Patriots.  There was not as much Editorial as usual.  I will now close with love for Anna.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	This is a bright pleasant day, but as I am not altogether prepared to go to church, I will stay at home, write to you, take care of Hext, as Charlotte is going to church, & read the services to Fanny.  Willie & Frank are going to church.

	 I have not received a line from you yet.  Yesterday I expected certainly to hear but did not.  Today I supposed I would but no Mail came from beyond Newberry.  Tomorrow no Mail comes at all, so until Tuesday, the ninth day since you left, I will not hear, but I bear it patiently, hoping it is your business, that has prevented your writing, or the irregularity of the Mail that has prevented my receiving what you have written.  It will be a great satisfaction when I do hear that you have arrived safely in Columbia & are well & Anna enjoying herself.  This is the fifth letter that I have written, so you have heard every day since you reached Columbia.

	The weather cleared Friday evening & is now very fine.  Charles is anxious for you to buy some Kentucky hogs before you come back, says those that pass by now are better & cheaper than they will be later.  Shall I tell Mr. Hoke to buy some? or wait until you return.  He has not bought the Hog yet.  We do not need it for immediate use, as we have a supply of Beef.  It would only be to put away for future use,  John is better of his cold, & was out yesterday, but complaining of Earache, which he sometimes has.  He is going to church this morning, so must feel well.  The rest of us are well.

	Fanny amuses herself as well as she can, but often wishes someone to play with, but is better alone, as she then cannot quarrel.  Yesterday she & Hext went up to Mrs. Hopkins to carry two little presents to Miss Eliza & Rosa.  She returned with two presents for herself, a pincushion & little tiger, & is anxious to give more presents, that she may get a return.  She wishes Anna had gone long ago & come back so as to show her all the pretties.  Nothing at all has come from the Post office for you since you left. 

	I have nothing new to tell you, have not been out once, & seen no one but those I told you of before.  I am busy working all the time for the servants.  Baylis & Becky have Prayer meetings every night in their room, except Friday night, when they have it in Eliza�s room.  I hope they will cause a reformation in the yard.

	You must write me everything, whether you think Jones will be elected Treasurer.  I wont feel easy until he is beaten, for he is too unprincipled to be rewarded, & if he is, I will think it only requires a person to be vain, presumptuous, a fool & unprincipled to succeed in this world, for never has a man been more undeserving of success than him.  Merit & deserts do not meet with their reward & are not appreciated; that I know & feel from your experience, but I trust & hope, you will even yet be rewarded not by you own conscience alone, but that the consciences of others will make them honor you, in some tangible shape, give you an office or Honor that will show the whole world you have been appreciated.

	Give my love to Anna.  She forgot her Veil.  She must buy one.  I hope she is pleased, not disappointed in her anticipations, & able to get along alone, & been a good girl.

	Hext is now pulling me, & crying for me to take him, so I must stop.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have nothing to write about except to say we are all well.  Tomorrow I hope to hear certainly from you.  I have not heard yet.  When I do hear I will have more to write about than now.

	I am going to ride to Mr. McClanahan�s this afternoon to pay him.  Today Willie carried Mr. Leary his money.

	Yesterday I read Robert Halls life.  He thought Grey�s Elegy the finest thing ever written.  He recommends Jeremy Benthams writings to all Legislators.  

	Mr. Hoke bought some hogs today.  I don�t know whether he bought the one for us you told him to.

	I hope you are well, & Anna also.  I am in hopes Anna is by this time in Charleston.  I know of nothing new, have seen no one, & except the Patriot, seen no newspaper.  I must now close.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter & Anna�s & am very glad to hear from you.  I am glad you arrived safely, for I think there is great danger in the boat conveyance.  I am sorry you have so little time for writing to me, but that is only of secondary importance, & I wish you to neglect nothing else to write.  I am sorry you should have to make your own fires.  Another time you had better take a servant with you, Reuben to wait on you.  You ought to attend to your comfort when you leave home.  Charles can attend to us here.

	Tell Anna I am glad to hear from her.  I dare say she will receive no message from Mrs. Taylor.  She is sick in bed, has recently for the fifth time lost an infant at its birth.  Aunt Eliza said both Mr. Taylor & herself requested you to take Anna to their house & not doing so, they may not think it necessary to send to ask her, particularly if it is true as Mrs. Thomas told me that Sarah was hurt at Willie�s not going to stay with her, when he first went to Columbia.  We are all well.  John is well again.  The horses are quite well. & the stock generally I believe.  I will give particular directions about Genl Thompsons Heifer.  I rode yesterday to Mr. McClanahan�s & paid the money.  He was not at home & his daughter said, her Mother instead of receipting the bill, which I asked her to do, would send a receipt today,
	
	Yesterday old Mrs. John Stokes brought me some Butter 15 cts a pound, & the servant said, she would engage it to me all winter at that price, & I said I would be glad to.  Mrs. McClanahan asks 20 cts, , & does not send it.  So I will take from Mrs. Stokes.

	If Judge Evans is elected Senator, a judge will be elected in his place.  I wish you would be a Candidate.  My ambition is to be a Judges wife.  It will be easier for you to be elected to that office, than  to any political one, as a Judge has not much to do with politics, & then I can go to Charleston with you every year, so get some friends to interest themselves for you.

	The ride I took yesterday was quite pleasant. Susan, Ann & Fanny went with me.  This evening I intend to take another.  Reuben drives us.  I am sorry to mortify Willie, but I am afraid to trust him with the two horses.  Bill starts constantly, & it requires a a strong hand to keep him in.  You will have to buy a horse for Willie�s especial use.

	I will be very glad for you to pay Dr. Irvine for Becky.  It will save interest, & like you I like to pay my bills immediately, & if possible never go in debt.  He soon goes to Florida.  You had better send the Check at once.  Dr. Irvine I can beg to leave your note with someone, so it will be paid even in his absence.  I dare say he would like the money before he goes to Florida, as he is going there to purchase land.  When Mr. Hamilton pays you. you must pay all your debts, & then invest the rest profitably.  You see I was right.  Mr. Williams has not paid you what he promised.

	Willie says the Mountaineer office is removed to that small house by Rutledge Stables, that Mr. Long had built over his Ice House.  I cannot say I am sorry for Mr. Sam Town[e]s sickness.  I instinctively dislike him.  He & Mr. Burt, both make a tool  of you for their own interest, but whenever an opportunity offers they injure you.  For 100 dollars a year Mr. Town[e]s would abuse you as much as your enemies would wish, but when he wishes you to write his book for him his abuse then stops for the time.  Mamma says she hears he is going to purchase the house Mr. Lynn Watson is building near her.

	Luther lately wrote a note to Susan begging her to return, but she declined.  He told her not to mention to anyone, particularly to Mamma, that he had written.  She told it to me in confidence, & I tell it to you as we are one.  

	I know of nothing new to tell you.  An Eclectic is all that has come for you.  Tell Anna I will write soon to her.  I hope she will go to Charleston before long.  Yours, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I received two letters from you this morning, & one from Anna.  I was very glad to hear from you.  Your letters are the only comfort I have while you are away.  I was really provoked to hear that Jones was elected by the Legislature, Treasurer.  If anyone deserved defeat it was him.  It has given me a bad opinion of mankind, for I see now that duplicity, want of principle, meanness, vanity, presumption, & being a fool, is all that is needed now to succeed in this world; that merit & good conduct & sense stand no chance.  I would have given a large sum to have defeated Jones.  I believe how he will appropriate the money he receives in his Office to his own use, pay his debts, live in style, & never breaks, & even if he does this, I suppose he will be elected again.  He is now made for life, & will hold his head higher than ever.  I am sorry too, your enemy should have succeeded.  It seems as if your exposure of him failed of its effect.  I thought he was put down forever, instead of which he has risen higher than ever, & your judgement too is out, for you thought he stood no chance of success.  What a pity Mr. Ashmore or some prominent man had not been a Candidate.  

	What a dreadful Rail Road accident.  I am afraid for you to come back on it.  You must hire a hack or have the carri[a]ge sent down for you.  The Rail Road will never be safe.  It will be constantly under �ing.  All the rains will injure it.  At the South they cannot manage as at the North.

	Isaac Hayne�s election was really close.  You were obliged on account of my relation to Aunt Eliza to vote for him, but I would not have been sorry if he had been defeated.  You are the only magnanimous  person I know of, & the only one that meets with no reward.  It makes me heartsick to think of Jones election.  He deserved defeat so.  Dr. Crooks says he borrowed one thousand dollars to pay for his Piano & Carriage, that he cannot hold up much longer, & that John Jones will break along with him, for he is security for all his debts, but I do not believe either will break.  

	Mr. Hopkins has just brought me a letter from you.  I will stop & read it.

	I have read your letter & am very glad to hear again from you.  I hope Anna has gone to Charleston by this time, as she will have so short a time to stay, if she remains longer in Columbia.

	The white faced Cow has a calf also.  Reuben says they had better all remain in the field, that there is plenty there for them to eat.  They were brought home yesterday & Charles has carried them back today.  In two weeks the oldest Calf & Cow will be brought home & milked.  John is quite well now, Edward goes to his work, Mary is well, & Lindy seems pretty well, hobbles a little.  I would be thankful if I could get rid of Eliza.  She calls Joe Powel her husband, says she has been living with him five years, sends her children on messages to him, abuses me, wont let her children work for us, & she is an abominable creature, a pollution to any yard, & Mary could & would have married, if it had not been for Eliza�s abusing her, to those who wished to marry her, but these things we will speak of on your return.

	I am glad Anna is behaving well & enjoying herself.  I will write to her when she gets to Charleston, & she must write to me often, & do you write whenever you can.  I have written by every Mail.  I know of nothing new at all.  The village seems very quiet.  When you are away, I hear nothing.  I have nothing at all to write about.  Becky is ding well.  If I can get rid of Eliza, & take home Clara as the seamstress, I think then our yard will be purified.

	I am sorry the Mails are so irregular.  I will be very uneasy when you are coming home  I would rather send the carriage for you all the way to Columbia.  The road curves so.  I think the Cars will constantly run off.  How sad for Col. Singleton & his Grandson to be killed.  The road must be badly managed, & I suppose the freshet undermined it so, that many parts will yet give way.  Next winter I will go with you. Hext will be weaned, & I would like to stay in Mrs. Janney�s room as Anna does, not go to the public table.  I am glad she does not.  She is too young to go much into public.  Mrs. Janneys family have been kind.  I rode yesterday to Mrs. Dr. Williams to carry home her Can she had sent for.  She has had 30 cases of sickness.  She expects to be confined.  What a pity.  She is having her house plastered, & going to add an addition in front.  We rode also to the College Hill, & saw the building more than 3 stories high.  I do not hear of any sickness now in Greenville.  I hope it will be healthier.

	I am glad you are treated with respect.  That is all the reward you will meet with.  I wish you would be Judge.  If you think you can be elected you must try for it.  The Legislature would be inclined perhaps to bestow the honor on you, for your disinterested conduct, through life, but you have no ambition.  I wish you honored for your childrens sake.  It will be an advantage to them.

	Write me long letters, & tell me everything.  All the letters I received today were dated 27th.  You must have written one on Sunday.  I now see your last was Sunday, but you dated 27th instead of 28th.  This is the first winter day, & quite warm.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you.  I am pleased at your being thought of as Governor, & provoked that you should decline the honor.  If you ran & were not elected this time, you might be another, & it would then seem as if you had at last been so rewarded & appreciated by your State.  Your position in the State for yourself & family would be established forever.  You would then be ranked among the highest.  Why do you act so strangely, & not avail yourself of the offers made to honor you.  You are always holding back, & let others take, what you could easily have.  Why do you not think of your own & your wife & childrens interest.  It has provoked me ever since I have been married, this disposition of yours, to do for others, what you wont do for yourself.  As your honors all end in nothing, it is tantalizing to me, only to have suggestions made & not carried out, that it gives me no satisfaction.  I would be much happier if you had some ambition.  I have, & your not having any, is a constant source of annoyance to me.  You had better for my sake be elected to some Office.  Until you are I will give you no peace.  I will then get over my disappointment at your Congressional defeat.  You ought to have said yes you would run for Governor.  You know you deserve it, & would discharge the duties better than anybody & in Greenville where so many look down on you & dislike you, I would be so pleased to make them henceforward feel differently.  I hope you will be elected; for my sake do, it will make me so happy.  I will never worry at anything again, & I will feel so pleased at your being appreciated, & after the term is over you can practice law again.  It will cause you to have higher honors & make your children stand so high in the world; for their sakes, consent to run.

	I am glad Anna is enjoying herself, & that Mrs. Martin asked her to stay with her.  I suppose she is today in Charleston.  I am sorry you bought her so useless & extravagant  a present as a medallion.  A Silver comb which is ornamental & useful I wished her to get.  She has no chain to wear the Medallion with.  Do not spend your money so uselessly.  All of mine here goes for servants clothes.  In winter it costs a great deal to clothe them & I only give them what is absolutely necessary but try to provide for one a great many.  I try to save but it is no use, what I save, you throw away.  We are all well.  Mrs. Stuart was here yesterday, came to borrow books.  She said she wished Mr. Thompson would get an Office; that he wished to be Superintendent of roads, that the present incumbent did not wish the Office.  I told her you were going to try & get it for Mr. Thompson.  You must not forget it.  When you are Governor you can give him an Office.  How delightful to have it in the power to help others.  Susan Hoke says Mrs. Trimmier was a run away match; says the family are so small in size, dwarfs I should think.  I am sorry Anna witnessed such boldness.  I hope to hear every day from you.  It is my only comfort.  I have nothing new to write about.  

	I would be very sorry if the Commons in College is dispensed with.  I think the young men should eat & sleep in the College.  If the Fare is bad, make them pay more, & have better.

	Isaac Hayne�s was really a close vote.  If the Greenville Delegation had not voted for him, he would have been defeated.  I am really sorry Jones was elected, but if you are elected Governor, I will be able to get over Jones undeserved reward.  It worries me so, the fear that you will not run, that I am almost sorry you mentioned the subject to me.  From Mr. DeTrevilles vote there must be a great many Secessionists in the Legislature.  You will get also the Union & some of the Cooperationists, so if you will only run, you will certainly be elected, so I will live on hope & do you run I never will again repine at you not hav[ing] been rewarded as you deserve if you Are Elected Governor.  It seems to me if you are only a Candidate, the Legislature will be glad to show their esteem by electing you.  So I new certainly look forward to my dear husband being a Governor, not that it will make him higher in my esteem, but in the World it will, & will be a mark of esteem he deserves & merits, & through the whole United States he will be honored, but alas I fear my wishes will not be realized.  If not, a Seat on the bench is what next I wish.

	I will write soon to Anna.  I hope she will pass her time pleasantly in Charleston.  I am glad she behaves well.  Willie reads, & hauls wood.  He misses the driving the carri[a]ge, & wont drive one horse unless he can drive both.  Frank goes to school.  Fanny & Hext�amuse themselves at home.  Fanny also goes to Mamma�s. & Annie comes here.  I am too busy to visit, have rode out twice only.  I am glad you are employed, but wish you had a little more time to write.  Write every day.  I miss your letters if you do not.  Ever yours, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter mentioning Anna had left, & I am very glad to hear from you.  I hope the Mail will continue to come regularly, & you to write every day.  If you do not, I will miss the letters so much.  It gives me something to think of each day, but you must not again mention honors offered you, & declined by you.  You must if it is only for my sake, accept them, for you know I expect to be unhappy, until you are elected to some Office, that will make me feel, you are appreciated by your fellow men, that your noble independence & disinterestedness, has been rewarded.  So I hope you will be run for Governor, even if you are defeated, it will be of benefit to you at some future time.  Your name will be brought forward, & the next time you will be elected to that or some other office.  But I hope you will now be elected, & if you consent that your friends  should interest themselves for you, you will,  you must not be so indifferent to these worldly honors.  For the sake of your childrens future benefit, you should exert yourself more to advance your name & reputation.  If you had been married to a Lady like Mrs. Brockman you might remain satisfied as you are.  She would have had no aspirations  for you, & would have been contented & happy, but I am different.  My desire is to have you exalted in Station, for you are of a superior order of being, & deserve the highest honors in the gift of the people, & until you get one Honor that will show to the world, that your fellow men have appreciated you as you deserve, I cannot be satisfied.  It is not for myself that I wish it but for you.  I am contented to remain in obscurity so you meet your reward.  But I cannot be satisfied until you are rewarded in the way I wish, not as you say a good conscience, is all you look for.  I look for something more.    So I hope you will be elected Governor.  If you are not, as you have elected Judge Evans a Senator, you ought to be elected Judge in his place.  So you must return either Governor or Judge. In one other thing also you have acted as you usually do, giving place to others,  the bill giving the Presidential Election to the people, you first introduced, & have made the people determine to have this Session when the bill can pass, & you ought to have the credit of, you have let Mr. Poppenheim take from you, so instead of your name going down to posterity as the Author of this great reformation, you quietly give it to another, when you are the one who deserve it.

	I will write to Anna today.  I am glad she enjoyed herself in Charleston, & received so much kindness.  I am willing for her to remain several weeks in Charleston & even the whole winter if her friends wish it.  Two weeks is too short a time for her to stay.  You can come home, & she come up with someone who will be coming.  Mrs. Elford goes down Monday & will stay 3 weeks.  Anna can come back with her or someone else, after the trouble & expense  of getting ready & sending her down she ought to stay 3, 4, or 5 weeks at least.  I do not know when she will go again.  But I dare say Aunt Eliza will write to me about her staying, & I can then determine how long she had best stay.  I know there will be plenty of opportunities for her to return.

	I will speak to Mr. Hoke about the Hogs, & the first cold weather get him to buy some.  At present it is too warm.  It is today raining, but I dare say it will clear up cold.  We are all well, & coming on quite well.  I keep house in more comfort than I did, & when you return, hope to live systematically, & have everything in order.

	Frank goes to school.  He seems a favorite with everybody.  Willie reads & cuts & hauls wood.  I would much rather him be with you.  He would improve in character & manners more than here.  In future you had better carry him.  I dare say Mr. Janney would not charge for Willie, if he occupied the same room with you.  

	You must have been pleased at Gov. Swains remembering you so kindly.  It is a pity you had not both met as Governors.  It would have been an interesting incident.  Two school mates being elevated to the same office, & meeting after 30 years had elapsed.  

	I never know of any news to tell you.  A letter came from Mr. Hamilton today enclosing a second check for 300 dollars, In place of the one that you wrote word you had not received.  I suppose this second one will be of no use to you now.  But I will keep it carefully until you return.  If you have 400 dollars in your pocket book, & Mr. Gladden pays you 100, you can pay for Becky.  What next you receive pay your other debts with, & I hope next year being the�of debt, & even have some to invest profitably for future use.

	I am afraid the Railroad will constantly be injured by these rains.  It passes over so many water courses.  I should think it was not built well, or managed well.  You had better have the carri[a]ge sent for you to Columbia or hire a conveyance.  The horses are quite well & the animals generally.  Charles until the rain was digging ground nuts, & Reuben hauling wood.  Mr. Lasly is cutting down trees for the Log house.   

	I write to you every day.  As you were so extravagant in buying Anna a Medallion, I was induced to buy something for the house which we much need, an Entry carpet 21 yds at 1 dollar a yd.  The Oil Cloth is completely worn out, & I have bought a beautiful Carpet, only two thirds more than the Medallion cost, & will be much more useful, & add to the beauty & comfort of the house.  It would take all of my money to pay for it, so I will not pay until you return.  I have only bought what servants clothes was necessary, but it costs a great deal, & to keep the house for so large a family.  

	I am glad you are spending your time pleasantly with congenial spirits.  It is what I wish you would always enjoy.  Greenville is too little & contracted & narrow a sphere for you.  I must now conclude.  Ever Truly Yours, E.F.P.

	I wrote yo Papa yesterday and so will write to you today.  I have not written to you in a long time, because I have enjoyed myself so much that I have not had time to write to you.  I arrived here Wednesday evening safely.  I came down with Mr. & Mrs. Trimmier.  They were staying at the same Hotel with us & perhaps I will go up with them, for they will be going up about the same time that I will.  I spent Tuesday with cousin Elise Martin in Columbia.  She had just arrived two days before & came for me to go to her house.  I did not see Cousin Sarah Taylor because she was too unwell.  Yesterday I went to see Aunt Annie, aunt Mary Hayne, and aunt Anna Turnbull, and aunt Martha, but I did not see aunt Harriet.  I suppose that she had gone in the country with aunt Sarah Matthew�s.  Cousin Susan took me to see them.  I would have gone to see my other aunts if it had been a good day.  It was cloudy all day and rained some.  I also went up S� street, and I had my ear�s bored, and bought me a pair of gaiter boot�s, and a pair of gloves.  I just have finis[h]ed practicing.  I thought I would have forgotten my Tune�s, but I still knew them, and I am going to practice regularly every day.  I enjoy myself very much.  All of my aunts seemed glad to see me, and wished Fanny had come too.  They say that they would not have known me.  They do not think that I look at all like you, but the image of Papa.  I will have to write Papa sometimes too, and so you must not expect a letter every day.  You must write to me soon.  Tell Grandmama aunt Susy, aunt Annie Frank Fanny Willie all howdye for me and give Hext a kiss for me.  Tell Willie he must write to me.  Your affectionate Daughter, Anna

Dear Anna
	I received a letter from your Papa today, in which he mentions your having left that morning for Charleston.  That you went off in good spirits, & had enjoyed yourself very much in Columbia.  I have time now to write you only a short letter, my next one will be longer.  I was gratified to hear you had been a good girl & given your Papa no trouble.  He wrote word, you were as good a girl as he knew of.  I was sorry he bought you so useless & extravagant a present as a Medallion.  You have no chain to wear it with.  I will send you by Mr. Elford who goes down on Monday, some of my hair, that I have had a long time.  I kept it at a time when it came out very fast, to make a chain with.  You can use what is necessary to make a chain to go round your throat to wear your Medallion to, sometime.  I will have my likeness & your Papa�s taken & put it in the medallion, so it will then be valuable, more so than it is now.  Your Papa�s heart overflows so with love for his wife & children, that he would spend his last cent in gratifying even an extravagant wish of theirs particularly when he is absent from them.  He then loses his prudence, & his generosity gets the better of him.  Whatever you need in the way of clothes to make yourself neat & comfortable you must get it.  Cloak of some kind I wish you to have, a bonnet either of drab stram, or any pretty kind children of your age wear, perhaps another dress.  Shoes, gloves &c.  A Silver Comb will be useful not only to you, but also to Fanny when you are done with it. And your Earrings you can have bored & buy Earrings.  Your money I expect will not be enough.  Your Papa wrote that it was all the change he had, & you could draw on him for more.  When you have made your purchases, write me word, & then I will write for a few things for myself & the children.

	I would like to know the price of a hat for Fanny either beaver or a bonnet.  Inquire the price of a dinner set of China for children.  Let me know how much a bracelet of hair could be made for, & a long chain & a short chain for the neck.  Your cousin Eliza beg[s] to let me know.

	I hope you will be a good girl, & return improved & benefitted, & pass your time pleasantly among friends.  Give my love to all of my Aunts, & particularly Aunt Eli�, Eliza & Susan.  Tell Aunt Eliza I am wondering why she has not written to me.  I expect she does not think my letters worth answering.  I write in such a hurry generally, that I am really ashamed to send my letters.  After writing to your Papa as I do every day, I am tired & hurried, for I am very busy now making clothes for the servants.  Your Aunt Susan is with me today, Annie & Fanny are playing about the room, & Hext as usual making a noise, & trying to break the window glass with a yd stick.  Poor little fellow.  I have not told your Papa because I knew it would make him so unhappy, more than he ought to be, but I will tell you that the other day I had a great fright about him.  He was at the wood pile, & Frank was cutting wood, & not seeing him behind him, raised his axe & struck him above his Eye, exactly across his Eyebrow.  He was brought in moaning, with his eye covered with blood, & I was afraid to look to see what injury was done, but the eye was not at all injured & Dr. Dean put Court plaster on the cut, & it is almost well.  I would have told your Papa, but he is so anxious about us all when he is away, that he would be needlessly made unhappy even miserable, & imagine the accident worse than it was, & perhaps even hasten home to see about it.

	I have written you a long letter.  Your Aunt is kind to have asked you to visit her, & you must behave yourself so as to not make her regret it.  If you can in any way make yourself useful to her you must Perform all of your duties.  Begin the day by praying to be kept from evil, & directed in the right way & reading in your Prayer book if it is only a few verses.  Give all of my messages to your Aunt & cousins, but I have written so hurriedly, I prefer their not reading my letter.  Write me of everything that interests you, & of all of my friends.

	Your Grandmama stays constantly with your Aunt Annie who is very poorly.  

	Mr. Hopkins has returned.  Fanny speaks constantly of you, & wishes you would return with her Sugar dogs.  Annie & herself wish you to buy them a doll.  They have a great many wishes.  I must now close, in great haste.  Your attached Mother, E.F. Perry

My dear husband

	I have come from church, eaten dinner & will now write to you.  I received a letter from you this morning dated Dec. 3rd.  Yesterday I did not hear, which disappointed me greatly.  But your todays letter pleases me, with the exception that you ought to express a wish to be Governor, for if you wished for success, you would be apt to be successful, though personally you should do nothing, you should get some friends to do for you.  I am certain if you let your friends interest themselves for you you will be elected.  Either this, or if you fail here, an office from the President you must have.  Judge I suppose you are not going to try for, though I would like that too.

	The letter you mention Mr. Keith would bring, Mr. Hopkins brought to the door.  I did not see him, but suppose Mr. Keith & himself had come in the Stage together, & Mr. Keith was hurried & begged Mr. Hopkins to deliver the letter.  Perhaps he did the same with your letter to the Patriot.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage.  I will write by them again to Anna.  They remain from one to three weeks in Charleston.  It will be a good opportunity for Anna to come back, but if she enjoys herself I am willing she should stay longer.  Mamma got a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday.  In the beginning she expresses a wish that Anna may arrive that day with Judge Butler who was expected, says Sarah Taylor intended sending for Anna as soon as she heard of her arrival in Columbia, though very feeble, that Mr. Taylor was not in Columbia, & that Eloisa also intended to take charge of her.  Aunt Eliza said they were thankful Isaac Hayne was reelected , but were still anxious about the office that they were more immediately interested in.  At the close of the letter, Aunt Eliza says Anna has just arrived looking well & pretty, & she makes Anna sign her name that I may see it.  

	I am not worrying about servants.  When I wrote Eliza had been very impertinent, seated in the kitchen all the time cursing & swearing & abusing me to Becky, refusing to work for Reuben & Charles, & if she did making the clothes so that they ripped immediately, not letting Edward work for them & preventing Johnny doing anything for us.  I called in Becky & told her, Eliza she must not let sit in the kitchen & behave so, for it would make her even disrespectful to me.  I told Eliza to go up & stay in her room, called Johnny in to wait, & my noticing her conduct has done good.  Johnny now comes in every day without being called, & I do not hear of Eliza�s speaking so impertinently.  I do think it is�to have a character like her in the yd.  She ruined Lindy, & will her children, but I hope so pious a person as Baylis & as I hope Becky is will soon counteract Eliza�s example.  Becky says she thinks Lindy & Edward are trying to be good.  Charles is delighted with her, says he does not hear himself cursed & abused as formerly, & gets plenty to eat, even say for to go to his supper.  I hope our yard will be happier & better now.  I dare say Becky has faults, & that I will find them out, but I think to be at the head of the servants, she will do much better than Minerva or Lindy.  I am not worrying, except about honors for you, & your not warmly interesting yourself to get them, or getting your friends to.

	I am glad you have become acquainted with Mr. Ravenel.  He is a good man, an old friend of Mamma�s.  He is a widower who has not forgotten his Wife.  They were attached to each other as children, & she said if she died, she knew he would have to marry again, because he was so domestic but he has not married.  He has no daughter, only sons.  His daughter in law keeps house for him.  One of his sons was engaged to Uncle Arthur�s daughter but died.

	I am pleased at Mr. Thompsons making you a present of boots.  Keep your money to pay your debts.  Dr. Irvine has not gone to Florida yet.  

	You must get the Black Dye for your Whiskers.  I think Mr. Cox�s at church this morning looked dyed.

	I am glad you made a good speech.  When published you must send it to me to read, & you must publish it in the Patriot.  I would like to have heard you deliver it.  How does Pinckney McBee come on.  How sad for Mr. Mauldin to be as he is.  How afflicted his family must be if true. As you were the originator of the Electoral bill, you ought to make a speech on it.  You ought to have introduced the bill this Session.  You must make Mr. Gladden pay you, & you ought to get Mr. Watts to tell Mr. Williams that he ought to pay you the 500 & am surprised he has not paid it. The weather is so warm Mr. Hoke had better not buy any Hogs until it becomes colder.  We are eating the Beef still.  I will have one Cow & Calf brought home tomorrow & begin to use the Milk.

	Mrs. Genl Thompson I believe is not confined yet.  Mamma thinks she never will be, that it is a mistake, which sometimes happens.  

	I know of nothing new at all to tell you, except an Eclectic & the letter from Mr. Hamilton containing the second Check, nothing has come from the Mail for you.

	Mr. Elford will be in Columbia Tuesday night.  He told me he heard from you yesterday.  He came to let me know he was going & would take anything.  The bells for church are now ringing, & I must stop & get ready to go.  

	Willie & Frank are going to ride on horseback.  Willie must in future go with you.  It improved & benefits him.

	Do my dear husband if it is only for my sake, accept any honor that is offered you.  Do not decline beforehand as you always do.  Think what gratification it would give me to see you who so well deserve it when no one deserves it so well as you.  Your Wife, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	Mamma received a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday, in which at the close  she mentions your having just arrived, & to prove it she made you sign your name.  I was much gratified to see it, & to hear you had reached Charleston safely, for the late R. Road accidents made me uneasy.  I appreciate the kindness of your friends in Columbia, & also those in Charleston.  This visit will be long remembered by you, & afford an interesting subject of conversation for a long time.  We were all pleased with Aunt Eliza�s letter & grateful for the kindness of herself & others near to us.

	I was in hopes to have received a letter from you by the mornings Mail, but suppose you have not had time to write.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage for Charleston.  I will write by them, & send you a pr of pantalets & a veil you left & which you may find useful.  I will also send a bundle of my hair.  If your Medallion will be wo� to a hair chain, you can have a chain made for yourself suitable for the purpose of getting your cousin Eliza to have it done.  With the hair that is left I wish a pretty chain made for Willie to wear with my watch.  I intend lending it to Willie.  If any is left have a chain made for Frank; if not enough for that, a bracelet to give to Fanny hereafter have as many things made out of the hair as it will admit, but I wish them all pretty, so if the hair will not allow of it, make only one or two of what I have mentioned.  These are presents for you to keep always in remembrance of me, & I leave it to your cousin Eliza�s taste & judgment to have the hair made in chains & bracelets as far as it will go.  Read this to her.  You can write to your Papa for what money is necessary.  Before you return I will write for several things.  

	Mrs. Elford will be in town one, two or three weeks.  It will be a very good opportunity for you to return with her.  Mr. Elford will call & see you, & you may go & see Mrs. Elford.  Anything Aunt Eliza wishes sent up Mrs. Elford will bring.  In packing up again, you can put your clothes except your dresses & thick Sashes in the carpet bag & fill your trunk with what you buy.  I leave to your judgement to get what you need.  I hope you practice on the Piano, so as not to forget what you have learnt.

	Give my love to Aunt Mary & tell her she can now perform her promise & give you the Canary birds.  I would like very much you should have a pair.  I will help take care of them, & it would delight Fanny & Hext.  Give my love also to Aunt Anna.

	Give my love to my Aunts in Logan st.  Tell my Aunt Har� she must answer my letter & beg my other Aunts also to write.  I am sorry you missed seeing Aunt Sarah Matthews.

	Each Aunt remember me kindly to & my friends generally.  Mrs. O�Driscoll you must not forget.

	When I told Fanny what Aunt Eliza wished she had gone down with you, she said, �I would be so glad, I would scream not to come back.�  She thinks her dollars you have will buy everything, a doll, & 7 Sugar dogs, a baby house furniture &c.

	Susan has been almost [every] day, & spent with me.  We work together, & Annie sometimes stays for the night, but she cries when bedtime comes.  Vardry & Alex come to the gate, but on account of the prohibitions they come no further.

	Luther has written to your Aunt Susy to return & says he will be willing to lose if she will return, & sends repeated messages.  Miss McBee wrote a note saying he was overwhelmed, & she did all she could to comfort him.  I got a letter from your Papa this morning.  He says he misses you a great deal, that you were a great comfort to him that he likes always when from home, to have someone near to him he loves.  I am always better satisfied too to have one of the children with him, to contribute to his happiness, & to their improvement.  Another time Willie must go, as he used to.  I think he�a great deal, & is one reason why he has such general information; that it has been remarked, there was no subject mentioned, that he was not informed on.  I am sorry he did not go this time.

	Frank still goes to school.  All have holiday but him.  I am very busy making servants clothes & sewing up�for comfortables, which I find are more  reasonable than blankets.  I have been out very little since you left.

	Becky & her husband have prayer meeting every night in their room, which the servants with the exception of Eliza attend.  I hope there will be a reform in the yard.  It seems purer already.  Becky I hope by her example benefit them, more than precept alone can do. 

	Mr. McKay has been prevented by a lame foot from going to town, & does not know when he can go.  Susan Hoke desired her love to you.  Said Augustus would go & see you.  

	Frank says you must write to him & he will write to you.  Fanny says you must bring her a head for her large doll.  The present head is broken.  She says you must bring her a set of furniture & a Cloak & hat.  I would like you to get a Worsted Cloak for both Fannie & Annie if they can be got of their sizes, & a hat & bonnet for Fanny.  If the Drab Beavers are not very dear & are worn, & you like them, perhaps one would be pretty, but I leave it to your taste & Eliza�s.  I wish a worsted Cloak & a hat for Hext.  Perhaps a Beaver would be pretty for him.  

	I hope you are behaving well, & performing all of your duties, & never forget that hereafter an account is to be given of all our thoughts, words, & deeds, & that we must pray for help & strength to act�, & to�even as we ought to, for our hearts by nature are sinful & need a thorough change.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, El� & Sue & W. Ed.  Write to me & believe me your attached Mother, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have written to Eliza Hayne & Anna by Mr. Elford who goes this evening & I will now write to you.  My whole time now almost is taken up in writing.

	You said I might send you a bill of Groceries, so I have made out one which I think you had better give to Mr. Elford to get for us  at the same time he does for himself.  It is much better for someone to select them than to leave it to the Grocer.  I have lost a bill I intended to make it out by.  I have put down the necessaries, & only a few of the luxuries, not as many if it were summer.  In the Spring we can get more luxuries.  We have so many servants we use a great deal of Sugar, so what I have put down is not too much but you can make any alteration you wish.  We need a pr of fine dogs, a Fender Shovel & Tongs.  Perhaps Mr. Elford had better get them.  A neat set will do, not the handsomest do I care for.  Aunt Mary McCall has a box for Susan & myself.  Mr. Elford will either send it to you to bring, or send it by someone coming before you do or bring it up himself, whichever is the quickest way for we need the box now.  It contains the only dress I intend to buy for myself this winter, & a bonnet, & a few other things, which I stand in immediate use of.  I have written to Anna that if she wishes it, she can return with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & save you going down for her, for you will be anxious to get home as soon as the Session is over, & I would like to go down with you in the Spring.  I would like Anna to be in town a few weeks longer & not return as soon as you do.  Mr. Elford may return he says in 10 days, or may stay 3 weeks.  He will go & see Anna, & she will go & see Mrs. Elford.  Aunt Eliza wrote word that she had wished that Fanny was with Anna.  It was a pity Anna could not have been with Mrs. Martin sooner in Columbia, & not only the last day; Mrs. Martin intended to have her the whole time, or she & Sarah together have her.  Mrs. Martin borrowed a house ready furnished.

	No Mail came today, so of course would not hear from you, but I hope you wrote me a long letter yesterday & that I will get it tomorrow.  I think of the contents of one letter until I get another.  The letter yesterday I liked.  I do hope either the State or the Presidency will give you some Office.  If you try you will get an Office, but you have to feel an interest in it yourself, & get others also to interest themselves also.  

	Edward mentioned at Mamma�s that Mr. Sam Mauldin was deranged & had taken Laudanum, because he thought his family all wished to get rid of him.  So I dare say there is some truth in the rumour you heard.

	I have not heard from Anna since you mentioned you had seen her off.  I hope to hear soon from her & also about her from Aunt Eliza, who I am sure will write.  I dare say she will need more money.

	This is Sale Day.  I do not know if many persons are in.  Mr. Hoke has not bought the Hogs yet.  The weather is mild & cheerful now.    We are all well.  Lindy�s baby is improving.  She has more time to attend to it, than she used to have.  When the child gets older we will not need both Charlotte & Lindy.  I wish Johnny would be put to some trade at once. But I suppose if Eliza�s child lives, he will have to mind that.  

	In these holidays Willie has so little to improve him I wish he was with you.  In future he always shall go down with you.  It improved him to associate with gentlemen. 

	I believe I have nothing new to write you.  I wrote yesterday except the Patriot I have not seen a single paper since you left.  I have rode out 3 times, & paid not a single visit.  I am busy all the time at home.  I will write again tomorrow.  After hearing from you I have more to write about.

	I hope the Secessionists will run you for Governor, vote for you & elect you.  If I were with you, to have urged your acceptance when they first proposed it to you there would have been no difficulty.  Your attached Wife, E.F. Perry

I enclose the Grocery bill & added a few things I wish Mr. Elford to get, but you can leave out anything you think best, & make any alterations.  The Calico is for comfortable.

Dear Anna


	I wrote a long letter to you yesterday, & have just written to Eliza, so can write you only a few lines.  I send you a veil & a pr of pantalets that I forgot to put up for you, & which you may even now find useful.  I am anxious to hear how you are, & how you feel, in the City, away from those you have always been with from your birth.  While in Columbia with your Papa, were not seeing him, you knew he was not far off, & did not feel lonely, but now you are even without him.  I am afraid you feel strangely.  I dare say by this time however you begin to feel at home, & are passing your time quite pleasantly, & surrounded by so many to whom you can claim relationship, gives you a home feeling.  I hope to hear a good account of you.  I would like to know what you have bought for yourself, that I may then determine what other things to get.  The silver comb if not too dear you must get.  I suppose one would be got for 3 or 4 dollars & it will last always, will be useful to Fanny after you are done with it.  Just before you leave I will write for a few presents for Christmas.  It will be cheaper buying them in town than here, particularly the Candy.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford will remain in town one two or three weeks.  That will be only a little longer than you & Papa will be in Columbia.  He will be anxious to get home as soon as the Legislature adjourns, & I would be glad for him to be saved the trip to Charleston, so you can if you like it return with Mr. Elford.  I am certain there will be opportunities constantly offering.  The Gradys I believe go down with him. 

	It is reported that Mr. Sam Mauldin is quite melancholy & took Laudanum to destroy himself under the idea that his family wished to get rid of him.  How sad for his wife & children to have him in that state.

	You must go & see Mrs. Elford if you can & Mary Crayton if she is in town.  Be a good girl.
	
	I am going to have some Ginger nuts made for you, to remind you of home, & send by Mr. Elford if they are nice.  If you do not receive them, you will know they were not made well enough to send.  Mr. Elford will send or bring anything.  Buy the�for Becky, & some little present for each servant.  Inquire the price of dolls ready dressed for Fanny & Annie, & also dolls not dressed.  

	Be a good girl.  Mr. Wardel is today fixing the peice to the Piano, Mr. Bacon spoke of.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Papa


	I wrote to Mama yesterday, & I will write you a few lines today.  I received your letter yesterday & one also from Mama at the same time.  Hers was dated the 5th so it must have had delay by the rail road accidents.  My [letter] ought to have got to you sooner than it did.  There are a great many accidents occurring at the present time, on the railroad.  I am very glad that I got down safely, & hope to get back safely also.  I am sorry that you were kept so anxious about me.  I do not think that I am worthy of so much love, but will try to be so.  If I had thought that you would be so anxious, I would have written the very evening that I arrived.  It was very late when I arrived, though no accident occurred.  I forgot to ask you for the carpetbag key before I left although I was thinking about it all of the time.  If you have an opportunity of sending it down, I would be very glad.  I hope your arm is better and that will be perfectly well when we return to Greenville.  I think those young ladies that you spoke about in your letter did not have much manners to be so noisy as that but I hope they will not annoy you so again.   When I was in Columbia I enjoyed myself quite well, but you and Mama both seem to think that I did not.  I enjoyed myself exceedingly well, and hope that I did not give you much trouble.  I enjoy myself here exceedingly well also and hope that you are enjoying yourself also.  I do not think that yours is much enjoyment for you have to attend to your business.  I am sorry that you feel lonely but I suppose as you are at the Statehouse all day you will not find much time to feel lonely.  You must write to me if you can find time  but I expect that all the time you have to spare you will write to Mama.  I think I would rather you come down after me if it would suit you.  I do not think that Mr. Trimmier will go up for two weeks to come but I will go to see him and see when he is going up, but I would rather you come down for me.  I am sorry to ask you for a little more money but if you have not got it do not worry yourself about it.  Though I have not spent all that you gave me yet I expect it will go, but if it does not go I will  give you back what is over.  I have not bought all of my clothes yet 10 dol[lars] would be enough.  I think I have been visiting my aunts almost every day.  I have been to see all but one.  I would write you a longer letter but I am going to dine at Anna Turnbull�s today and will have to stop to get ready.  This is a very long letter.  If you have time to write me only six lines I would be glad but if you have not time I will not mind it.  I hope you will continue well.  Tell all of Mr. Janney�s little girls howdye for me.  Your affectionate Daughter, Anna

P.S. All of aunt Eliza�s family are well.  Aunt Eliza thanks you & mama for letting me come down and begs to be remembered.

My dear husband

	I received two letters from you this morning. & one from Anna which I will enclose to you.  I was glad to see the one Anna wrote you.  I was reading your letter aloud to Willie but when I got in the midst of the scold, I stopped horror struck, merely glanced at it, went into the rest of the letter, & have not read the scold yet.  When you know it is my love for you, my exalted opinion of your character that is my opinion you surpass even the �Father of his Country� that is this feeling that makes me dissatisfied . that you who are so far above others have not received the rewards & honors, that your inferiors have.  You ought not to scold me, but sympathize with & try & gratify me.  I must say with the exception of scolding you wife now & then, you are the best husband that ever was.  You have retained more of the spirit of a Lover, than husbands generally do.  I feel that I am first in your heart, & perhaps if I were not quite so confident, it would be better for you, for if I were not, I would be more careful to retain your heart & perhaps would never dare to resort  to scolding, but now I am so well satisfied of your love, that I try it as I please.

	My dear husband if you had been in Congress, you would have been the admiration of the United States, & I believe you would then have aspired even to the Presidential Chair, but now what can you attain to nothing at all, & will be never more than a Member of the Legislature, & a Village Lawyer toiling for meat & clothes for his family.  This is beneath your deserts, your fellow men know it, & therefore they talk of elevating you, but never do, & I cannot help being provoked, but I wont be again.  I will live on hope.  I like Mr. Morgans feeling, & wish the people of Greenville would have heard you.  You are so well fitted to serve & benefit them, which is the reason I feel grieved when you hint at abandoning your present position.  You are by nature meant to serve your fellow�, Frank Pierces�s destiny was meant to be yours, somehow a mistake has been made, & you have not fulfilled your destiny, & I am afraid it is marrying that has prevented it.  It is the single men that are advanced most easily,  Mr. King for instance the Vice President.

	Last Sunday in church I looked at some of the Wives, & I thought to myself, none have such a husband as I have.  Mrs. Choice looked so cross & unhappy.  Mrs. Arthur looked vexed & strange.  Mrs. Butler Thompson they say has trouble with her husband; Susan at my side had so little to make her happy.  Mrs. Car� husband & indeed all so different from you.  It is your superiority that has made me repine.  I wish you in an enlarged sphere, known & appreciated.  If you would have been in a City & constantly associated with minds on an equality with your own, you would be happier.  You will call this scolding, but you have brought it forth by scolding me.  Mr. Sam Mauldins condition is truly sad.  I do not think he ought to have been left in the Asylum against his wishes.  If he is so miserable, even as to destroy himself, he would not be accountable for the act.  He could be guarded & go at large.  It seems so sad, to have him in the Asylum, when he is as conscious as he is now.  He ought to be confined in a room in his own house.  If he recovers it will make him miserable to think where he has been.  I am sorry for his Wife & children.  Mrs. Bollings daughter (Mrs. Childs) Mrs. Westfield told Ann was perfectly deranged, & is in Greenville at her Mothers.  Mrs. Hugh Stokes is very ill.  Mr. Joab Maudin is to be married at a sad time.  Mrs. Mims is getting better, but I heard had not recovered her mind yet,  Mr. Hillhouse is to be married to Mrs. Clines Sister.  Mr. W[iiia[m Easley is to be married to Mrs. Tom Sloan�s daughter at Pendleton.  I am glad, I hope he will have enough to occupy him at home, & not meddle with the business of others   The Easley you had a suit against married in Georgia & has gone to Texas.  Mrs. Rosemond  whose sister married an Easley. & cannot bear the Easleys, says they have cheated her sister, says Miss Winn is a bad girl,  Col. Town[e]s came for your office key yesterday to attend to some business he was concerned in with you, but I was out.  I see Sam Town[e]s & Campbell back again.  Tom Butler I hear has moved his family to Mrs. Stones, & Campbell has bought his place & moved to it.  I am sorry to have such a person on our Farm road.  Mr. Carson has given up going to California, & bought a Farm on the Saluda river, & going to move there the 1st of Jany.  I am sorry in your Patriot letter you mentioned Dr. �lands opinion of California.  I wish nothing said to discourage the vagrants & ragamuffins from going.  Mr. Carson I know had not energy enough to go so far.

	I will certainly go to Columbia with you next winter, & carry Willie & Anna.  Hext will then be out of the way, which he is not now as he nurses at night so much he keeps me awake.  Next Tuesday he will be 18 months old.  He is quite well, so are all the rest.  I know of no sickness now in Greenville. The two Cows & Calves are now at home, & today we commenced using the Milk of the one first Calved.  The short tailed one we expected to kill when fat, Charles says is with Calf, so we will have enough milk.  I will try & live in comfort when you come back.  

	Mrs. Westfielfd told Ann that at the Mansion house the other night Mr. Cureton said Luther & Mr. Leary were both intoxicated.  Do not mention it of  Mr. Leary, but if true, how sad.  He was not at church Sunday, which seems strange, for he is in the village.  I hope he will not give way, for he is a good man.  I will tell Willie to try & prepare for college next Fall.  Hamlin Beattie is 17, Willie only 13, but much smarter I expect than the former.

	I am glad your arm is so much better.  I suppose Dr. Kent feels proud of his in a sling, as much so as Genl Shields.  Nothing comes from the Post office for you.  I am sorry accidents come so often on the Rail Road.  Do be careful when you come up.  Take a safe seat, & be on your guard.  Bill is a noble horse & will bring you back with Selim with ease.  You must try & watch him.  If my bill of groceries is too large curtail it; leave out anything you wish.

	The 15th is so soon for Anna to leave Charleston.  She had better stay & come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.  It is not worthwhile preparing her to remain so short a time.  Mr. Elford said he would take charge if her with pleasure.  

	The weather is clouding up & looks again like rain.  It is too warm I think to kill hogs, though everybody has killed.  We have plenty of beef.  Mr. Hoke has not bought any hogs for us yet.  We do not wish them till the weather is cold.  I rode yesterday to Mr. McClanahans for the receipt, which he had not sent.  Mrs. McClanahan receipted the bill.  Charles & Reuben are cutting & hauling the wood.  The servants are doing well.  Yours truly, E.F. Perry

My dear husband

	Willie has just returned from the Post office & with no letter from you, which has disappointed me greatly.  To make up he brought me a letter from Aunt Eliza which contains a most gratifying account of Anna, & which therefore I enclose to you that you may also be gratified at the pleasing [im]pression she has made.  Though the letter contains nothing to bring tears to the eyes, yet in reading it aloud I had to stop several times.  These are feelings I suppose peculiar to a parent.  Any mention made of their children when absent from them affects them, & for the sake of the parent, children ought to try & do well.

	I am very sorry not to hear from you.  I dare say the Post Master did not Mail the letter, or you were too busy to write.  It gives me less to write about, not hearing.

	Mr. Hoke came over this morning to say, as soon as the weather cleared he would buy the hogs, that next week the moon will be on the increase, which will be the time to kill.  We have not needed Bacon, having Beef enough. & we now have more Milk which is a comfort.  The Legislature adjourns so soon, that you have not been long enough in Columbia to get tired.  You must not engage a room at Janney�s for me next winter.  It will be time enough then, & if the weather happened to be very cold & rainy, I might not wish to do down until the Spring, but it seems to me now I would like to go, so as to hear you speak in the Legislature.  That would be my purpose in going.

	I hope you will let Anna stay in town until Mr. & Mrs. Elford come up.  She passes her time so pleasantly there & her friends are so much pleased with her, that two or three weeks will not be too long for her.  I am sure she will improve.  Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote to Mamma yesterday & mentions Anna in gratifying terms & was quite affectionate.  I would like Anna to be in Charleston after Eloisa Martin goes down to see her family.

	I paid Mr. Hillhouse�s bill for Frank today.  [page torn] Mamma Susan & Ann  are here & in the room with me, so I cannot write a very long letter.  We are all well.  Reuben is hauling leaves for the stable.  I know of nothing new.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & to see the Patriot today.  I must now close & write to Aunt Eliza.  I am glad for her sake you voted for Isaac Hayne, & hope Wm Ed will retain his office, for she is kind. 

	Anna will have enough to talk of for a long time.  How much more important a visit of a girl to town, is than a boy.  Anna enjoys it more than Willie would have done.  Aunt Anna Turnbull asked Anna why Willie did not go to town, & she said Willie was quite tired of going down, not very complimentary.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you today, for which I am very thankful, for yesterday I did not hear & was getting uneasy.  I am pleased at your being made the heroe of the Poem at College Commencement.  You must get a copy of it for me to read, & publish it in the Patriot.

	I am sorry for poor Mr. Mauldin.  Is he really deranged or miserable from taking opium.  He seems too conscious to be altogether deranged & to be out in the Asylum. But I may be mistaken.  An old lady named Mrs. Wiliams who sells Butter was here yesterday & seemed to think that the whole family drank, says the Father was a dreadful man, & never drew a sober breath, & at last shot himself, that several brothers killed themselves drinking, & insinuating that all the brothers living drank, but I think this latter suspicion is not true, so only mention it to you.  

	Mr. Easley was to have been married last night to Miss Sloan of Pendleton.  I hope he will now have trouble enough at home to keep him from troubling others.  Mr. Joab Mauldin is to be married tonight.

	The Collegiates must have acted very badly at the Commencement ball.  The Ladies were not rewarded for going so far to attend a Ball.

	Mrs. Barclay was rather forward I think.  I heard Mr. Barclay had left her, & she had to take in work.  I did not know he was dead.  She is a northern lady.

	 I received a letter from Anna today.  She is well & enjoying herself very much she says.  I wrote to Aunt Eliza that Mr. Elford would be a good opportunity for her to come up, that she would be long enough in town to see all her friends, & not too long to inconvenience her.  Aunt Eliza�s letter about her was gratifying.  Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote word that Anna was so much altered & improved since her former visit, that if she had entered the room alone, she would not have recognized her, that she thought her quite pretty, & she was sociable.

	Last night it commenced raining, & today is gloomy & drizzling.  I rode to Mrs. Stokes yesterday to know if she had engaged her Butter to me, as her servant had said, & Mrs. Stokes said yes.  The road was so bad.  I thought of your journey home, & I am afraid you will find the roads after so much rain dreadful.  You must consider whether it will be best for you to come in the Stage or have the carri[a]ge sent for you.  If you come in the carri[a]ge you had best if you have heavy baggage send it in the Stage to make the load lighter for the horses.  If you feel quite well, the Stage journey perhaps will be best.  You will come quicker & save your horses, which the bad roads may injure, as they have heretofore.  

	My dear husband I think with you that our happiness depends a good deal on ourselves, but some persons have much more to make them happy than others.  I don�t think Mrs. Mauldin now can be happy.  We who are so blessed in each other, may talk of happiness, but I can mention numbers who I should think were only miserable.

	Frank at last has holiday.  His school broke up yesterday.  Willie & himself cut wood, not a very elevating employment, but very useful.  Fanny & Hext are quite well.  

	Mr. Lasly paid me a visit yesterday to consult about his house, says he will finish planting Wheat, cut logs, & commence raising the house when you return.  Dinner is now ready, so I will have to stop. I was very busy, so could not write as soon as usual.  I will write again tomorrow, & hope to hear from you again.  I want if possible to write to Anna after dinner.

	I know of no news to tell you.  I read the Patriot yesterday, was sorry you had not written on to a later date, later than you had written to me.  I think the last anecdote might have been left out, but perhaps it would please some tastes.

	 I have now done dinner.  Becky this far does well, works well, & makes the servants happy.  I hope we will find her a comfort.  The prayer meetings I hope will have a good influence on the servants.  I have not time to read over my letter.  I am so anxious to send it to the Post office in time.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I received your letter this morning, & was very much pleased to hear from you.  I would like to write you a long letter, but I have not time now.  I have been writing to your Papa, & your Grandmama,  Aunt Susy, Aunt Annie, Fanny & Annie are all in the room, & I cannot collect my ideas well.  Your Aunt Susy & Annie have .been spending several days & nights with me, & your Grandmama & Aunt Ann come in for the day.  They as well as myself are gratified to hear that you are behaving well, enjoying yourself, & kindly received by your friends.  Opportunities are constantly offering up, I expect, so exercise your own wishes about coming back.  If it is more convenient for you to return before Mr. Elford does, you must. I leave it to you & to Aunt Eliza whose hospitality you must not impose upon.  Your Papa in his letter today says you must suit your pleasure about returning, & your friends, that it will make no difference to him, if Mr. Elford does not stay longer than he told me he would.  He seems a good person for you to come back with, but I wish you to do as you & your Aunt think best.

	I wish you had written me a list of what you had bought, & the prices.  I was waiting for that to decide what to get myself.  A small pair of Cuff pins perhaps you had best get, two pr of Gaiters for yourself.  Have you bought a bonnet? & what kind?  A dress & the Silver Comb, what is the price of the Comb.  I wish particularly to know.  Buy a Cornelian ring for Fanny & Annie such as Fanny had & Mary lost.  Tell me the price of a bonnet such as little girls of her age wear & a cloak of some kind & a hat & Cloak for Hext such as the old one he wears of Franks, or any other kind.  I wish some Stockings for Hext & Fanny, two pr of �for me to wear in the house, two pr of undersleeves for me to wear to church, two aprons for myself, a pr of Gaiter boots for Fanny, & gloves, but these things I would rather know the price first, before I decide to get them.  A dress for Fanny to wear to church also I wish, & if you can bring any pretty patterns of Aprons & Sashes for Fanny & Hext you must, & any pretty apron you see for yourself, or Sashe or Sun bonnet & either buy & have made for yourself or bring the patterns; a waist apron if you wish it get.  When you return home for a long time now, you will need to buy nothing more.  You will be well supplied for an age to come.  I am thankful that your Aunt is pleased with your deportment.  Continue to act as you have done, & when you return set a good example to your brothers & sister.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza, El� & Wm Ed.  Write to me & beg Aunt Eliza & El� also to.  Your Grandmama & Aunts send their love, & say you will have a great deal to tell on your return.  I write in great haste.  Excuse all mistakes & bad writing, & write better than I do.  Do not follow my example.  I write every day to your Papa which fatigues me &�is talking in the room now, which confuses me.  Give my love to all of my Aunts & friends, & beg Aunt Mary for the Canary birds.

	Be a good girl.  You have a great deal to be thankful for.  Not many little girls have had such an enjoyment as you have at present.  It was kind in your Aunt to invite you to stay with her.  Do not forget to get a present of some kind for your Aunt, to remember you by; one according to your means, & something for Eliza & Sue.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. Give Mamma Susan & Anna love to all.  I will write you about the Candy & Cocoa next week, & also all I wish got.  I would like to hear the price of what I have mentioned first, but if I if I do not hear soon, will not wait.

Your Aunt Susan wishes two aprons of plaid Alpaca or such as your cousin Susan says are worn & a peice of black silk braid to sew round a skirt.  She wishes strings for the apron.

My dear husband

	I have received no letter from you today.  Nothing has come from the Post office today.  So I will write you only a few lines.  I am disappointed at not hearing, but hope you were too busy to write, that you are quite well.  Mr. Hoke today is to buy the Hogs.  There is a fine drove in the village, & he says not many more fine ones will come.  You must write now whether the carri[a]ge must be sent for you, or whether you will come in the Stage.  If it were not for bad roads, the carri]a]ge would be the pleasantest, but you will know best.  I hope to hear tomorrow.  I am very busy working.  All are well except Charles who in bad weather has Asthma.  The weather is still bad, cloudy & drizzly.  I have no news to tell you.  I write so often I have not missed a single Mail.

	I wrote to Anna yesterday, & will again tomorrow.  We get along quite well, & am glad you are at a pleasant Hotel.

	The Legislature adjourns too soon to get through with the business.  You ought to postpone it, so as to pass all your important bills.  A few days longer, so much could be done.  Those who are in such a hurry should stay at home.

	I hope we will have good weather so as to clean the house before you return.  I must now conclude.  I think of you constantly.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

Saturday night, 11 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received a letter about an hour ago from you.  A Servant brought it to the door & said, �Mr. Jones sends his respects, & sends you this letter.�  I took it & said nothing.  I knew he had not brought it from you that someone else had brought it, & begged him perhaps to send it to me.  In your letter you say Dr. Pasley will bring it.  I did not hear from you yesterday, nor today.  I mean this morning, no Mail it was said came from beyond Newberry, so I was glad to get the letter this evening.  I wish you had enclosed Anna�s to me.  She writes such short letters.  I would like to see all she writes to you.  Not being accustomed to writing, she finds it difficult to express herself & tell all I wish to hear, but what she does write, she writes well.  Aunt Eliza�s letter was very satisfactory, & she is fastidious & particular. & expects a good deal even from children.  So approbation from her is worth something.  This has been a fine day.  It is getting cold, & by Monday I hope will be good weather to kill hogs.  Mr. Hoke yesterday bought 10 for you weighing 2306 pounds, some of them about 200 weight, & some a good deal more, but on an average 230 pounds.  All say it is the cheapest way of getting meat, & everybody seems to have bought.  Mr. Lasly came today to offer to help kill.  He & his sons, & offered his daughter to help clean & attend to stuffing Sausages, so we will get assistance from him.  He says he will be here Monday at daylight.  We are out of lard so I am very glad to have some soon.  Lard is selling 15 cts a pd.  

	Charles has been suffering with Asthma, but is getting better & expects to be well Monday.  I told Becky to attend to him.  She said, �it was her duty to attend to Charles, for he was a good old man.�  So this shows her to be better disposed than some of our other servants.  The servants all seem happy now, & they respect Becky. & do not quarrel & abuse each other as they did.  Even Lindy�s child is beginning to thrive.  There is no complaint of not having enough to eat.  I dare say in consequence, that the eating will cost a great deal more than heretofore, but I know you will not object.     

	Susan this week spent several days & nights with me.  It was quite unexpected.  She came in to pass the day, & I felt so sorry for her, & knew it would be a relief to Ann to have her away, that I told her to stay for the night.  She, Annie, & Susy, so she staid three or four nights, & went back to Mamma�s this morning to see Vardry & Alex.  Mamma & Ann have dined with me three days so I have not been lonely this week.  I feel so sorry for Susan.  She has had a hard fate.  She is sensitive & ill fitted to endure the trials she had.  If she had been differently constituted perhaps she might, but as it is, I know of no one more to be pitied.  She said she enjoyed being with me, that I had everything to make me happy, that if it were not sinful, one might almost be envious of me.  When I think that it was just something in my person & manners that struck an old Bachelors fancy, I realize how accidental our fates in life are.

	Susan has helped me a great deal in my work.  I have been trying to make the house look more comfortable, particularly the two rooms where we sit for the winter.  I have had them whitewashed & new curtains put up.  The Sofa Mr. Wardell has finished looks very comfortable.  It will suit you exactly to lounge on these winter evenings.  The new Carpet on the Staircase & Entry looks very pretty.  These improvements were so unexpected.  My money has not held out, but as Minerva�s wages this year I have spent for you.  I know you will not begrudge returning as much of that money as I need.  Another year Minerva�s wages will appropriate expressly for my clothes & to buy things for the house I wish, & you do not care for.  This year I have spent it for every purpose but myself.  In Jan[uar]y you will receive Bank Interest which will help you to pay your debts.

	Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.  He inquired after you.  He says he went down on the R[ail] Road with Col. Dawkins last summer I think, & he was drunk the whole time.  His bold, vain aspiring Northern Wife I dare say has made him miserable.  She does not love him for himself, & therefore she wishes to gratify his vanity, that he should have honors & distinctions.  She has met with more than her deserts in marrying him & therefore she ought to be satisfied.  She ought to think that she was once a Music Teacher working for her bread, & now she has an independent fortune.  The bench must have been little in demand, so few Candidates, & such inferior ones.  I believe truly you would have been elected.  The State is beginning to appreciate you; if it does not, I hope the President will.

	Genl Thompson today sent for your office key to look at a�this afternoon.  I went to the office to shut it, & I saw Rices Digest open at a page relating to property given to children.  Mrs. Thompson is not confined yet.  I hope she will not be disappointed.  Perhaps the Legislature will not adjourn the 15th.  I almost wish you were coming in the Stage.  I am afraid the roads are so bad you will find the travelling in the carri[a]ge tedious, & the horses will get injured.  Mr. Elford would have gone down in his carri[a]ge but for the roads.  I do not wish you to follow my advice, contrary to your judgement, but I wish you to inquire on the subject, & find out whether the Stage with the night traveling, or the carri[a]ge & horses with the risk of injuring horses is best, or whether the road from Cokesbury or from Laurens is best.  Mr. Arthur says the road from Cokesbury generally travelled is very bad, that there is a more private one that is better.  The Mails are so irregular.  I hope the letter in which you tell me, how you have determined to come, will come directly to hand without any delay.  If it does not, it will be bad.  Only twice however the Mails have failed, though several times I have received no letter, but I suppose you did not write.

	Except to hear you speak, I would not care to be in Columbia during the Session.  The weather is so unpleasant, & the house so filled with ladies all seeking pleasure, but I think I will go next winter to hear you speak.  This Spring I would like to go to Charleston, when you go to Columbia, & if we are out of debt & have plenty of money, this summer we can go to the North.  You must send me a copy of your speech, �the Speech of the Session.�  I will read it with more interest now in your absence than when you are with me.  I hope you will soon have it published in the Patriot.

	I thought Anna would have to send for more money.  She will not have to buy anything again for a long time.  Going away from home, the softer sex require so many things to make them neat & comfortable, that they can at home do without, that it makes it quite expensive, but she is well fitted up & will need nothing more for some time.  I thought she would send for more than 10 dollars.

	Fanny says she longs for you to come back, but after you come back she will be sorry.  I asked her why.  She said because she would have to go out of my room, & sleep in the big room.  She already says Anna when she comes back must go up to bed with her after supper.  

	Hext is well, & when I ask where Papa is, holds up his hand as if to say gone.  Willie & frank are well.  I have rode out three times, & been to church each Sunday, the rest of the time busy at home.

	I hope to hear tomorrow, if so I will write more.  You ought to have told me what you thought of the Grocery bill.  At this moment I hear the singing in Becky�s room.  Mr. Arthur says he does not approve of it.  I am sure I do, & hope it will bring religion near to the servants, make them feel its importance, & lead them in the way they should go.

Sunday morning, 11 oclock

My dear husband.  The Mail this morning came very late, owing I suppose to the bad roads, to my great disappointment no letter has come from you.  One from Anna, & one from Aunt Mary McCall I received.  I think you must have written, but the Post master in Columbia has neglected sending it.  Tomorrow no Stage comes, so I cannot hear until Tuesday, & if you then write for the carri[a]ge, it may be too late for it to meet you.  Mr. Hoke says he thinks	the roads are too bad for a carri[a]ge to get along at all.  I wish you to come the way you prefer, but I hope you will come in the Stage.  It seems to me that will be the best way on account of the roads both for you & the horses, but if you write for the carri[a]ge I will send it, if the letter comes in time.  I am going after church to dine at Mamma�s so have to write to you now.  I am so sorry I did not hear from you.  I am afraid you were spending your evening so pleasantly with some of those bold ladies, it made you forget your Wife; perhaps Becky Sharpe you got introduced to.

	I have written to Mr. Elford to buy us a set of common knives for every day use.  Our old knives are lost & worn out, & the new set is too handsome for every day, & would soon get ruined, a common Butter knife I also begged him to get.  You  must bring us nothing at all.  Anna will bring us something.  Charleston is a cheaper place than Columbia.  The little things you get for the childrenare expensive & useless, so bring back nothing but yourself.  

	I must write to Anna now.  She says she enjoys herself more than she expected, & that she will come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & that I must write & tell you so that I can make you understand better than she can, that she is not to go to Columbia & meet you, & come up with you, but she will come all the way up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.

	I hope you will be careful on the R Road & take a safe scarf & wrap yourself up warm.
I will now conclude.  I remain Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry

I am glad you now like my letters.  I like you cannot bear to be scolded, especially by a husband.  The next time you begin, I will call in one of the servants & let you finish on one who deserves it.  But you think you are so certain of my heart, you can impose on it, but you must not venture too far.

If I had heard from you this morning I could have written you another sheet.  Now I have nothing more to write about, except to add I love you.  E.F.P.

Anna�s letter today was a long one, a whole sheet.

1 oclock, 11 December [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I had written a long letter & sent it to the Post office & wrote I had not heard from you, when Mr. Beattie sent me two letters.  I can now only acknowledge them, for I expect Susan every moment to come from church & carry me to Mamma�s�I now hear the carri[a]ge.

	I know the sugar was more than we use, but it is economy to get a large quantity at one time.  The barrels & commissions cost as much if they are small, as if they are large.  I thought & knew the Sugar would not last more than a year.  We have 14 servants.  We use more than a pound of Brown Sugar every day for them, more than a pound of white for ourTea & Coffee each day.  The loaf Sugar was for company, the Clarified for cake, the powdered for icing.  This was the reason there was such a variety.

	Susan has come & gone, & I must now get ready, for when the carri[a]ge comes back.  I will write again tomorrow.  

	Mr. Brown was not the Soul of Honour as I had thought.  I am glad you are coming up with Mr. Duncan, but think you would find it pleasanter on account of the bad roads to come in the Stage.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Monday morning, 11 oclock, 12 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

       I have just written a long letter to Eliza Hayne, & am tired writing, but will go on & write my daily letter to you.  Tomorrow I will write again, & then I will have a long rest, which I will be glad of, for writing takes up so much of my time I can do very little else now.
       
       I wrote in a great hurry yesterday after receiving the two letters by Mr. Beattie.
       
       Aunt Mary McCall has a box in town for us waiting to send.  I am so sorry I did not tell her to send it to Columbia, & you would have sent it on by someone.  It contains my winter clothes, but it will be so late before I get it, they will be my next winter clothes, instead of this.  Mr. McKay was to have brought it up, & after all he has never gone.  Mr. Elford now will take charge of it, or it will come by Express.  I hoped to have saved money enough out of what you left me to help pay for them, but I have not been able to, so you must be so good as to lend me the money out of the Bank Interest you will receive in January, & I will give you Minerva�s wages as they are paid me, until I return you all.  I am sorry I did not keep Minerva�s wages this past summer to clothe myself with, but you were pressed for money, & so I spent it for you, which you must remember.  But I would rather feel independent in this respect, & in  future I will not place myself in the situation I am now have to ask you for money for myself.  It makes me feel mean & sometimes the bills are higher than I expect, as it is in the present case, & then I am afraid you will scold me, but you must not.  If you do, I will come down upon you about Governor & Judge & President of the United States, & perfectly overwhelm you.  But in future I intend to buy my clothes, & pay for them without your knowing anything about it.  Last winter I bought nothing, so this winter I had to buy something, so sent to town,  but they will only come in time to be ready for me next winter when I go to Columbia with you.
       
       The hogs are being killed today.  The whole household is at the river except El�, Lindy�s baby & myself.  We still have some Stake & some corn beef, but we are all tired of it.  I hope to have a plenty for you to eat on your return of Sausages, Spare ribs &c.
       
       Willie says Mr. Memminger & his family were at church yesterday, I suppose on their way down.  Eliza Hayne said Mr. Memminger had a daughter sick like Ann, cannot sleep at night &c.
       
       You must find Janney�s far pleasanter than Maybins.  I am glad the Society is so pleasant there. 
       
        I will take for granted all the sentiment & love you would like to express in your letters, & which I know is in your heart.  You are in Columbia to attend to business, & if you let me occupy you instead, it would be to the detriment of the State, of which you are the chief guardian.  If your watchful eye is moved for one instant, the State suffers; so I do not wish to interfere.
       
       I thought you were going to run Mr. Elford for Clerk of the House.  Mr. Dean perhaps being a Member could more readily be elected.  It requires a person either to be, or have been a Member of the Legislature to be elected to office.  It is a great advantage.  Several wives have been gratified unexpectedly this Session.  Mrs. Dean, Mrs. Glover, & a future Mrs. Evans, one other Wife I would name, who would like to be gratified in the same way, all she begs of her husband is when opportunities offer to advance himself, not to decline it.  The husbands may be indifferent to these things, but the Wives never are.
       
       I am sorry yourself, Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford have so misunderstood my Grocery bill.  I knew the Sugar was more than enough for one year, but I thought it would be more economical to send for a large quantity.  It saves commissions, barrels, drayage &c. , & we would not have to send for Groceries for a long time again. I am sorry it should have lead to a worse opinion of our servants characters than they deserve.  Reuben stole a ham, & I dare say, he steals your Corn, & steals our wood & sells for himself, & Mary has stolen my clothes, but the other servants I have no reason to suspect, & hardly think Mary will do the same again.  I am sorry Mr. Elford should think me so careless a housekeeper, & such a fool as not to lock up the Sugar that the simplest child would know ought to be done.  If my storehouse had groceries in it, I would never let anyone go in but myself, but it never had lard, only House Salt & such things, that it was not necessary for me to go always to take out.  So tell Mr. Elford I think as he does if Sugar was not locked up, it would go twice as fast, & if Corn was locked up, it would last twice as long.  I know of nothing new & Hext has come now to be nursed, so I must stop, & close my letter without reading it over.  The weather is cloudy & cold.  I hope you will have a pleasant journey home the roads not impassable.
       
       I hope to hear from you tomorrow, & every day till you return.  
       
       Willie & Frank are busy with the hogs.  Make Mr. Gladden & Mr. Hill pay you, & tell Mr. Watts to remind Mr. Williams of his promise.  
       
       I will now close.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Dear Anna 


	I received a letter from you this morning, & am very glad to hear from you.  I have written to you very often.  I would have written oftener, but every day I write one letter to your Papa & sometimes two.  The Mail sometimes brings no letter.  I write & tell so, & afterwards, some gentleman sends me a letter they have brought, & then I have to write again to say I have heard.  I have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read.  This is a gloomy, cold day, & I think it will cheer them up, to hear a little news from Charleston.  Vardry & Alex are over there.  Alex has the Measles.  Vardry will be glad to hear about his knife & Sugar dogs that you have not forgotten him, but I think a knife a dangerous present for so little a boy.  You had better bring him something else.  If you can think of something better, a Story book he would like.  He is fond of hearing stories read, buy some suitable play thing he would like, a little wagon or something of that kind.  Annie will be glad of the Doll.  You had better bring both hers & Fanny�s ready dressed, buy a large head for the large doll, the largest you can find I expect will not be too large.  The present head is broke, & a head for the other body that once had a China head also get.  That one will be small & not cost much & will do for Fanny to play with every day.  The doll ready dressed Fanny will use only on particular occasions.  The large doll is to teach you how to work, & as the body costs so much, it is a pity for it to be without a head, which is the reason I wish you to bring a head for it.  If your money gives out, get Aunt Eliza to lend you, & I will return it when I send money to pay for what I yesterday wrote Eliza to buy for me, or after your Papa can be done without, that it still takes a great deal more money than one at first supposes.  Now in town, it is such a good opportunity to buy what cannot be got here, & there is so much to tempt, that I am willing to gratify you now, knowing you will be willing to deny yourself hereafter.  The new bonnet you have bought will last a long time this winter, next summer & next winter you can wear it.  I am sorry your Cloak has not been made before.  You ought to have had it soon after your arrival, for the weather has been such as to make you need it.  I hope it is now made; it must be very pretty material, & your bonnet must be  very pretty also.  Tell your cousin Eliza she must get me a pretty one.  I wish you to get a new dress, & am sorry you did not get it immediately after your arrival.  You ought to have had it to wear visiting among your friends, & you must get it now & have it made up soon, so it may be of use to you before you leave.  I wish it for your dress frock all winter.  A bonnet for Fanny like yours will be pretty, & if you can find a Worsted Cloak large enough for her, get it.  I intended buying one for Annie, but Susan has had a Cloak altered for her, which will answer for the winter, & she says she prefers my giving her something else. What was the price of your Silver Comb?  I hope Eliza will write to me soon.  I have been expecting a letter from Aunt Eliza.  Ask her why she does not write.  I am glad you are enjoying yourself so much, & meet the approbation of your Aunts.  Tell Aunt Anna Hayne I am gratified at her good opinion of you.  Icey Frank as soon as he was aware he had curls begged me to cut them off, as they were too girlish for him, that he is not the pretty curly headed boy as she may see from his likeness, but a fine looking handsome manly boy, & his appearance even if he does not deserve it makes him a favorite with everyone.  Tell her the likenesses did justice to none of the children but you.  That Willie is a smart sensible boy, useful & manly, drives us, & hauls wood, & cuts wood, & then comes in the house & reads, but still has that mischievous temper that will indulge itself in teasing & playing.  He means no harm by it.  He is alive to the ridiculous, & has a satirical vein, which your Grandmama thinks he inherits from her family, and he cannot help amusing himself with his brothers & sisters but as he grows older he gets better, & your Papa says he is a good boy, & he is no flatterer.  Fanny is warm hearted & affectionate, lively, & your Papa says the prettiest & smartest of all.  She yesterday said, �if I die first, I give all my play things to Anna.�  She says she longs for you to return.  She came out of the kitchen this morning very much offended Becky had turned her out.  The Lard is drying in the kitchen & it is crowded & confused, & it is no place for her, so Becky was right, but she came in crying, & asked me if Papa had given the children to Becky. & if Dr. Irvine had built that kitchen for even Priscilla had told her to go out.  Hext is today 18 months old, a baby yet, for he is not weaned, & nurses at night more than ever.  His eye is almost well.  At least his eyebrow there will be a little mark always on his eyebrow, but it will not be observed.  He is quite well.

	Priscilla was here doing nothing, & in the way, so yesterday you Grandmama was here, & I told her she had better ask Mrs. Irvine to let her stay with her, so she did, & Mrs. Irvine said she might & this morning she went over.  She can bring in wood & wait on your Aunt Annie & come in on messages, & I hope will be useful.  Catherine is of no use at all except to mind her Mothers child, & yet your Grandmama pays 1 dollar a month for her & is obliged to, while she keeps B�.  Mary minds Isaac.  If Mama parts with � & can get no one better, I am going to let her have Lindy.  As Becky is here, we have more servants than we can afford, so will hire out Lindy to your Grandmother for less than to anyone else, so I hope she will do well, for it will be well for her to have a family servant there, & one who cares for her, & make up to us the expense of buying Becky, which was very unexpected.  Lindy still has Rheumatism in her feet, but is able to work, & by Spring I hope will be able to go to your Grandmama�s.  I received two letters from your Papa today.  He says the Legislature may not adjourn until Friday.  He says he is anxious to return home to see his Wife & children who he loves better than fame, honors, distinction, property or anything besides, that though he has been passing his time very pleasantly, after two weeks�he always gets homesick.  He mentions having heard from you.  Your visit to the City must not make you discontented with the country, but on your return you must contribute your share towards the happiness of the home circle.  Your Papa had received a large box from town.  Your have seen Mrs. Elford I expect�your clothes.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just written a long letter to Anna & am tired, but will now write to you.  I was very glad to receive two letters from you today, & one from Anna.  I read Anna�s to you.  She writes well, & Aunt Anna Hayne tel[l]ing her to write me word; that she did credit to her parents, is worth something, for Aunt Anna is very particular about the behaviour of children, expects more from them, than anyone I know of.  Anna asks after Hexts eye.  She ought to say his eyebrow.  Frank one day in the yard accidentally struck him on his eyebrow, & it bled, but only for a little while, & is now quite well.  I explain, for you might wonder what Anna alluded to.  I am glad she enjoys herself so much.  I was afraid she would be homesick.  Her visit will be attended with expense, but I dare say it will be of permanent benefit to her, & she will be improved & so many relations I have in town ought to see the children to feel an interest in them.  What Anna has bought will last her next winter.  I have written to her that there is so much to tempt her wishes, if they are gratified now, she must be willing to deny herself hereafter.  I think she will need more money.  If you would send her some just before you leave Columbia, I would be pleased, & it would please her to be so thoughtfully remembered by her Father.  She will not for a long time again cause us so much expense.  I am glad you have received a box.  I hope it is the one from Aunt Mary McCall.  I would wish you to send it in the quickest way, for I ought to have had it weeks ago.  I have not made a single winter article of clothing yet.  Can it not come immediately by the Stage.  Write on the box that it must be sent by the Stage.  If you have not sent it yet, or do not until you come, be sure to bring it. If it cannot come in Mr. Duncan�s carri[a]ge, send it by someone coming in the Stage.

	I am very much pleased at the good opinion the Members have of you.  It is only for you to be known to be appreciated at a distance your character is not understood, but those who know you best, respect you most.  It requires but very little exertion on your part to be rewarded with the honors others get, for I think the prejudice against you is passing away.  I hope your friends will still as they proposed show their estimate of your character by voting for you for Governor.  I do not expect you to be elected.  It will please me though for you to receive votes.  It will make them think of you another time.

	Yesterday the hogs were killed.   Today Mr. Lasly & his daughter are helping cutting the meat, drying the Lard &c.  The daughter did not come in yesterday.  I thought she was at the river when I wrote to you.  The servants are all busy.  Mr. Lasly seems very obliging.   I have been several times to the L� house since I have been writing to you.  He says we ought to have 10 Cans of Lard, but I do not think so.   Charles says we ought to have had Becky 10 years ago, that he likes her, so do all the servants.  I have not yet seen any cause to regret buying her.  Lindy did not answer, even when she tried her best.  The servants did not respect her, so it was one constant state of confusion & Minerva who we would have been obliged to take home, makes everybody unhappy about her.  Lindy in the Spring we must hire out.  We now have plenty of Milk.   We milk three Cows, the last one only commenced today.  This winter we can either churn, or have rich Milk, Syllabub, Custard &c.  We will have plenty of Meat, Sausages, spareribs &c.  The parsnips in the Garden Becky cooks delightfully, so when you return, we will live better than when you left, particularly after our Groceries come.  If Col. Brockman & Mr. Elford let you get any Sugar, & I lock it up, so the servants cannot steal it.

	Today is cold, rainy, & gloomy.  The weather has not been suitable for cleaning the yard, scouring &c.  I will be almost glad the Legislature should sit a little longer, to allow you more time to pass important bills for the reformation of the State, & the Equality of the Upper county, & allow me more time to clean the house for your reception.  It is cold.  I can hardly write.  Hext wants me, & the children are making a noise.  I will be so glad not to have to write so much when you come back.  It takes up so much time & fatigues me, so that I can hardly do anything after but rest, but for your comfort I write every day.   I hope you dined with your old friend Mr. Hearn.  In inviting the Greenville Delegation, I think Pinckney McBee ought always to be excepted, for he would be out of his place, & would not even enjoy it, & does not deserve it either, so I hope he is not included.  
	I have not heard yet of Mrs. Thompsons being confined.  I am glad you have dyed your Whiskers.  I expect your look five years younger.  You ought to have done it when you first went down.
Anything that adds to your comfort, convenience, & good looks, you must get.

	Be sure to bring the box with you or send it by the Stage.  I will be very glad to see you.  The weather is getting bad so cold cloudy & rainy, but I hope it will clear before you set off.  Be careful & not get hurt on the R[ail] Road.

	Hext if he has forgotten you, will soon remember you.  He calls Charlotte Oh Da, & when he is in my lap, & I say Oh Da come & take Hext, he clings close to me.  

	I thought you were going to buy a new W[h]ig, but perhaps the present one will do until you go the North & get one there.

	I must now close.  I wish you could go & see Col. & Mrs. Preston before you leave.  If so give all of our love to you.

	I write in a great hurry & will write until you set off to come home.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you & I cannot help saying, I feel very sorry when you are so respected by the Members, & appreciated by them that you should not aspire to some of the honors in their gift.  Why do they elect such inferior persons to office as Mr. Glover & Manning, & not elect you who are superior to them.  I believe if you wished it they would elect you, & you ought to have been elected Judge.  The 3000 a year would be a certain income which you rarely ever make.  This Session you seem to have been better treated than usual, & you ought to have tried for something.  You seem to be more popular out of your District now, than in it, & I wish it was known in Greenville, how well others think of you, for I wish everybody in Greenville where you live, to respect & look up to you.  I will live on hope that you will not always be excepted in the distribution of honors, but it is your own fault, even Jones got what he tried for.

	This is another gloomy, rainy, cold day.  The roads will be dreadful.  It has given me no chance of cleaning the house & yard, which need it much.  I wished everything to look nice for your return.  Even the washing cannot be done in this weather, which makes us very uncomfortable, having to do without handkerchiefs, towels &c.  This is no weather to leave home, at least for ladies, so much as I would like to hear you speak in the Legislature, I do not expect to go down, unless it is to see you inaugurated.  I hope the Secessionists voted for you, & another time that they will elect you.  It is strange there have not been more Candidates this time for Judge & Governor.

	The servants say Mrs. Thompson was confined Sunday night & has a Son.  I suppose it was in expectation of that, Genl Thompson was looking in Rice�s Digest at laws respecting property given to children.

	Mr. Rosemond yesterday sent some Lumber for the kitchen. 

	Four Cans of Lard were dried yesterday, & five or six more there will be.  That alone at the price Lard is selling 15 cts a pd, is more than 60 dollars.  The Kentucky Hogs are so fat.  In future I would prefer buying a few of them expressly for Lard, the rest�meat.  We will have a good many Sausages.  The servants are stuffing them today.  We got a machine from Mr. Rutledge which grinds the meat fine instead of chopping it.  We gave Mr. Lasly some of the Back bones, Spare ribs &c.  He & two sons were here the first day; he & his daughter the second.  I would not have had him the second day, but Reuben said he himself would be obliged to haul wood, but it rained & he did not.  Mr. Lasly has 10 children, the youngest 7 months old.  They are too large a family for our small Farm.  I think he has made a good bargain.  He ought to have paid for the house himself.

	I wish you had sent me all of Anna�s letters she wrote you.  I would like to read them.  Letters are my chief comfort when those I love are absent.  My disappointed hopes make me unhappy for a while, but I get over it & hope on.  I now look to favors from the President for you.  I may not write again.  I suppose tomorrows letter will tell me when the Legislature adjourns.  If you do not hear from me again, you may know it is that I have not written, thinking you will leave Columbia before the letter reaches there.

	I do not suppose one wife besides myself has written to her husband every day as I have.  I assure you it interferes with my duties.  I am obliged often to send Hext away crying because he disturbs me, & after writing I am fatigued & unfit for cutting out work & sewing so it makes me waste my time which is precious, for there is sewing still to do for servants & children, & Eliza being near confinement, often feels unwell & has done nothing for me for weeks.  As for myself I have not done the first stick, & what I most need is in the box that has been sent to you & which I hope you will soon send up, or bring up with you.  I give up all to you, as my first wish is that you should be happy, & if I do not write every day, I know you will be uneasy.  I wish your mind also kept calm & quiet so you can attend to your Legislative duties.  Since Mr. Memminger is away, I expect you are the most important member in the house.

	This is dreadful weather, so cold & cheerless, & raining slowly which makes the roads & yards so muddy.  I am glad you have heard from Mr. Livingston.  I was thinking the books had failed, & no more numbers would be forthcoming.  Nothing comes from the Post office for you.  I suppose it is known you are away from home.

	Charles this morning was speaking of Becky in such a satisfied manner, that I told him if Baylis & Peggy were out of the way, I believe he would try for Becky.  He laughed immoderately, & said if he was young he did not know what he would do.  He told Willie Mr. Dean was going to move into the village where Mr. Bacon has been living, so Peggy would be nearer.  He will be saved his long walks.  I hope you will have a safe & pleasant journey home & pleasanter weather than we now have.

	I will now conclude.  My hands are cold & go to the fire & warm.  I hope to hear every day until you return.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

P.S.  I wish Willie had gone with you.  He always improves when with you.  I wish there were better schools than in Greenville.  The Baptist College is a poor affair.

Dear Anna


	I received a letter from you this morning, & also one from Eliza.  I received one from your Papa.  He leaves Columbia tomorrow morning, so I am not to write to him again & will be able now to write longer letters to you.  I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.  If you do not come home by Christmas, you will lose nothing, for you know at that time the servants having holiday, we live in less comfort than any other part of the year.  It reminds me of the way we are living at present.  This week Mr. Hoke bought some hogs for us, which have been killed, & instead of living in abundance as one would think, we almost starve, & have our meals irregular, all the servants being engaged drying Lard, cutting up Sausage meat, cleaning feet, stuffing sausages &c, that they have no time to attend to us, so busy preparing for our future comfort.  Susan Hoke said she would write to Augustus to call & see you, but as you have not mentioned him, I suppose you have not seen him.  She sends over to know if you mention him in your letters, for they were uneasy not having heard from him.  Fanny Hoke is quite sick with Measles & Scarletina.

	Perhaps you heard that Mr. Sam Mauldin was carried down to Columbia & put in the Lunatic Asylum.  He attempted several times to kill himself.  He took Laudanum in Greenville, going down he attempted to jump out of the Cars & when left in the Asylum, tried to beat his brains out.  He eats Opium which is worse than drink.  How sad for his Wife & family.  James Benson is married to a Lady in Abbeville. Mr. Wm Easely is married to Miss Sloan of Pendleton   Mr. Joab Mauldin is married to Miss McIver.  Mrs. Mims Sister Mrs. Genl Hampton has a Son.  This is all the Greenville news I know of to tell you.  

	Frank commenced a letter to you, but I saw it would take so long to finish it, I told him he might stop.  Willie is generally busy reading, cutting & hauling wood, & as I write so often, he thinks he would have nothing to tell you.  Hext is quite well & when I ask where Anna is, holds up his hand, as if to say gone.  Fanny speaks often of you & calls you my sister.  She longs for Papa & Sister to come back, & then adds, I will be sorry too, & when I ask why says because I will have to go out of Mamma�s room & sleep with Anna.  Now I go upstairs & sit with her at night.  Then she thinks that will be put a stop to, so she feels quite divided.  She wishes though she had gone to town with you, & says I ought to have let her.  I did not think of it, but the weather has been so bad ever since you left, that I think this is the very worst time to leave home for enjoyment.  The Spring is much pleasanter & is always the time I will choose.  

	I am glad Uncle Arthur & all of your friends are so affectionate & enquire after us all so kindly.  They are kind to you not only for your sake & mine, but for your Grandmama whom they all love.  You must go to see all of her old friends.  I often wish she would see them once more.  I know she must miss their friendship & society.  You must buy a present for each servant.  I wish this Christmas to give each of the grown servants a Bible.  Reuben, Eliza & Becky I think can read.   Charles, Lindy, Mary, Edward & Clara can bring theirs to me or you at any time to read to them.  8 Bibles plain ones I will have to get.  If Eliza could get reasonable ones in Charleston, & have them packed in the box she is to send, I would like it, but if she thinks it will take up too much room, I will get them here from Mr. Elfords book store.  A prayer book get for yourself & one for Willie, a neat plain one for him, of a convenient size to put in his pocket. Becky�s comb you must not forget & some little present for Ninny, Lucinda, John & each of our servants, either a handkerchief, apron, or something pretty if you prefer it, not the value of the  present, will they regard but your remembering them, & anything from Charleston will seem to them great.  A little present for Mary Mauldin also get.  Little China ornaments can be got for 15 cts.  Those little baskets, cups & saucers &c. that we have had, were of that price.  Get a little present for your Grandmama, Aunt Susy & Aunt Annie, also for Vardry Alex Annie & Susy, a doll for the two latter & some toy or book for the former, a dress for Lindy�s baby of cheap calico, a knife for Willie & Frank, the dolls & sugar toys for Fanny, & with the 2 dollars she gave you buy her a large box of Furniture.  I wish her to begin having a baby house, so as to keep all her things in order.  At some future time I wish you to get a dinner set of China for yourself so inquire now the price.  It will be useful when your young friends come to see you.  You can have a table set to yourselves.  I expect now you cannot afford it.  Some time hence you might get it.  If you need �rilla before you get back, you must buy some & take.  Mrs. Elford went down first, & I expect sent you the gingernuts.  Mr. Elford went down afterwards, I expect had the hair & a letter for Eliza.  You must get Eliza to buy two bottles of �preparation of Castor oil,� one for Aunt Susy [&] one for me.  I am glad you got a new bonnet.  I would like one for Fanny, if it is as pretty as any others worn by little girls of her age.  I have bought a Worsted bonnet here for Hext, & given him Fanny�s cloak, so he can do without anything.  Buy a Cornelian ring for Annie & Fanny, & one for yourself.  I wish you to buy a dress, & have any new fashioned apron; Sack or new bonnet, or anything else pretty you see made up for yourself.  All the pretty patterns you can get, bring.  I am sorry you will not see Aunt Harriet & Sarah, & that you have not seen either Aunt Emily or Aunt Susan, & that sickness is the cause of not seeing the two later.  This visit is an event in your life which you will never forget, & you are grateful I am sure to your friends for being so kind, & will always do what you can in your power to return it.  I hope you will see Eloisa�s family before you leave.  The Legislature adjourns today.  Your Papa sets off tomorrow, & will return in Mr. Duncan�s carri[a]ge, for one of the sons went down in it.  The roads must be very bad.  It is raining now, & has been for several days.  Give my love to my friends.  Go & see Mrs. Elford & write when she will return; also go & see Mary Crayton.  Your attached Mother, E.F.P.

Greenville
	      
Dear Anna


	I wrote you a long letter yesterday & did not expect to write to you today, but as tomorrow no Mail goes, I will write now.  I have just received a letter from your Papa.  He is to leave Columbia today, & hopes to be at home tomorrow evening.  He comes up on the R[ail] Road & from there in Mr. Duncans carri[a]ge.  As neither of us now have to write to him, we can write oftener to each other.  I would be glad if every morning you would write to me, & tell me everything that interests you.  You will in this way tell me more than I will otherwise hear, for you will write of what may escape your mind when you get home.    As soon as you know from Mr. Elford what time he is to return, let me know.

	Four days in this week it has rained.  Today it seems as if the weather may clear.  I hope it will.  For your Papa�s sake who is coming home, for your sake, that you may be able to go about, & for my sake that I may have the house cleaned.  It is very dirty, so much mud is brought into the house by the servants. The carpets I have had turned, & whitewashed the two Dining rooms, & bought some reasonable furniture Calico at Crittendens & made new curtains for the dining room windows.  The Calico is beautiful & was only 9 1/4 cts a yd & everything looked neat, but the rainy weather has caused so much dirt to be brought into the house, that I now have to clean it all again.  The soil here is very bad, different from the City, & there the yards & streets are generally paved, which is so neat.  We are all well except Eliza.  She is sick in bed, & has been unwell a long time.  Dr. Crooks had to come & see her today.  Becky gets along well with all the servants.  They like her, & respect her, so I hear no more abuse & quarreling among them as I used to.  Baylies has Prayer meetings every evening in his room at�it is more of family prayers for the servants in the yard.  He thinks Lindy is feeling an interest in religion.  I hope so, & that it will make her a good servant.  Next Wednesday the 22nd Rutters time is up, & as your Grandmama does not like to hire Rutter with her two children, & have to pay 1 dollar month for Catherine who does nothing for her, only minds Rutters child & cannot even talk or go on a message, she intends to let Rutter & her children go home, & try Lindy instead.  If she does well, she will keep her.  If she does not, she will look for another servant.  Priscilla is there now, & I expect will stay there for her food & clothing.  She will help mind Lindy�s child.  Aunt Annie is very poorly.  Your Grandmama is not well today.  Alex & Vardry have been there since Saturday, on account of Alex being sick with Measles.  He has worms also.  The weather has been so bad, that since you left I have been out very little, once to your Grandmama�s, three times to ride on business, & twice to church.  Susan, Annie & Susy staid with me awhile.  Becky sent in word last night to say, I must write you word not to forget her comb.  Your Aunt Susy says you must be sure & bring 4 Sugar dogs for her children, & if the 25 cts she gave you to buy them with is not enough, to get more money from Aunt Eliza, who has some of your Grandmama�s money.  She wishes pretty dogs, & the children will be very much disappointed if you do not bring them, so you must not forget it.  Your Silver comb cost so much less than I expected, that I wish you to get one for Annie just like yours.  I suppose your size she can wear now, & when she gets older too, she needs a comb always to keep back her hair.  The horn one she breaks, & one of the plated kind her Mamma got her, but it hurts her head & she cannot wear it, so as I intended to get her a cloak but now she does not need one.  I will instead get her a silver comb, which will be a lasting useful present for her.  You I expect will not have money enough to buy it, so if your cousin Eliza will add it to the list I have already sent her, I will pay for it, when I pay for the other things.  Willie & Frank have bought have bought two pigs from me.  As soon as they can get at their Bank & pay me, I will send you the money to invest in something for them, books perhaps.  The Candy & Cocoa & ground nut cakes you must not forget.  50 cts worth of Sugar ground nut cake, 50 cts worth of Cocoa nut cake, 50 cts worth of Candy of different kinds, & 50 cts worth of Cakes of different kinds.  These things are instead of buying anything here for Christmas, & if you are not here Christmas, we will put off the celebration till you return, & it will be better, for at Christmas the servants have holiday, & cannot do much for us.

	After their holiday is over, they can wait on us, & Becky will make us something nice.  So do not regret if you are not here Christmas, we will wait for you.  I want you to buy a nice little bible for yourself, a larger size I wish for Willie & Frank.  If you choose you can buy the three Bibles in town.

	Beg Eliza to have a Cloak made for Fanny & buy a pretty bonnet & all I have written for.  Fanny has no cloak to wear to church.  I wish it made up, for Eliza is sick, & cannot work, & I have no pattern to make it by.  Some little girl of Fanny�s age you will know of to fit by.  Be sure to bring the cloak made, & try & get patterns for yourself.

	Beg Aunt Anna Hayne to carry you to see her friend, & our friend Elizabeth Jones.  I did not know until you mentioned it, that the Canaries were dead.  Gine my love to your Aunts & cousins.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have just received a letter from you, & one from your Papa, the last one I will get from him for a long time, for he will reach home today.  Mr. Hoke has just sent me word, that he heard of his just having left the head of the R[ail] Road, which I was thankful to hear, as so many accidents now happen.  He comes home through Abbeville, passes Cokesbury where Mrs. Holmes lives, & was to sleep at Col. Wares last night.

	I must begin & tell you of the increases in the family which will surprise you.  Yesterday afternoon I rode over to Mamma�s, & as soon as I got back, the children came running to me, crying out, �Eliza has a baby, it is to be Hext�s maid,� & so it was.  Eliza has a girl, the baby is well, but Eliza last night was very ill.  She fainted, & was out of her head.  I went up to see her.  This morning she is better.

	Before I was out of bed this morning, Frank came running up saying �the Sow has five pigs.�  So I told him I would give each of you a pig, which you must each attend to, & when they grow up, you would sell them to your Papa.  

	Since you left two Cows have had Calves, so you see what an increase there has been in the family.  Willie & Frank will soon have to help your Papa support them.  We now have plenty of Milk & Cream.  Willie & Frank enjoy it, & have given up Tea & Coffee which I am glad of.  

	Your not coming back with your Papa will give us two pleasures.  We are now with pleasure expecting him, & afterwards we will have the pleasure of looking forward to your return.  Your Papa writes, he has directed you to get money from Mr. Elford if you need it.  Mr. Elford has money of his.  You can also tell your Cousin Eliza, that she can get money from Mr. Elford to pay for the things she buys for me.

	I know I will like your Cloak, & all you have bought.  I may before you leave write for a few more things.  I hope Eliza will have a pretty cloak made for Fanny.  I would like you to get the largest size box of Furniture  for Fanny.  I want her to have a baby house.  She gave you 2 dollars of hers.  If 150 the Furniture costs, with the 50 cts left, buy some other toy for the baby house.  I would like you to get a Bedstead for it, &   several other peices of Furniture also bring her that will be suitable for the baby house.  She is so fond of arranging things it will delight her to fix the house, & give her occupation, which we have to find for children to make them happy.

	I am glad you are making so pretty a quilt.  I wish you always to have one on hand.  Eliza said Worsted Quilts were pretty, & they must be very warm for winter & suit Greenville.  I wish you would get her to make one patch, buy several kinds of Worsted cloth, & you bring it up with you & make a quilt.  I am glad your Aunts think you behave well, & feel young again.  In being with you, interest in the young is what prevents persons feeling their age as they grow older, & it is wisely ordered.  So old age is not as sad as it otherwise would be.  We live over again in the young.  We are interested for them, as we once were for ourselves.  You must bring us any present you think proper.  I wish two pair of Mits to wear in the house & a neck ribbon to wear to church.  You may bring me these as presents.  For your Aunt Eliza�s present, ask your cousin Eliza what to get for her mother, & then ask Eliza what to get for Eliza & Sue.

	Mrs. Barnwell Rhett�s is a sad death, & she will be a great loss to her children.  Children require so the care of a Mother, that her loss is even greater than the Father.  

	Tell your Aunts Willie is not quite so ungallant as he was.  As he grows older he feels the value of the Fair Sex & pays them more respect.

	Tell Aunt Eliza, no change for the better takes place at your Grandmama, that Mammas situation is one of constant trial, & I wonder her mind & body have been able to bear it.  A living trouble like hers is worse than death.  She tries to be cheerful & to bear up, but it is hard not to despond.  Aunt Eliza must write to her & try & comfort her.  Her letters are consoling.  She must also send messages to Susan to tell her to bear up. & to Ann to acquiesce in what has happened.  You must bring your Grandmama & Aunts whatever present you choose, either something useful or pretty.  Buy for yourself a few peices of Music, easy enough for you to learn. I wish you could learn to Crochet.

	Since I commenced writing Aunt Mary McCall�s box has arrived. It stopped in Columbia & your Papa sent it on by the Stage.  Tell your cousin Eliza the bonnet is prettier & fancier than I expected.  It is a dark Straw with a feather, so I will be able to wear it to church, but it is not suitable for common occasions, so the one I wrote her to get, I will still be glad of, as I need one to wear on occasions that the other I would not wear the feather would look unsuitable, & it is very small.  Tell her the Cloak Aunt Mary has sent me is beautiful to look at, but not useful.  It is the lightest grey colour & so small, it cannot meet across the chest. So instead of the bonnet, the Cloak I must try & dispose of.  Ask her what a Cloak like the kind she is now making for herself would cost for me, the materials & the making it.  I like a dark Cloak that will not soil easily, for even our carri[a]ges here are not always clean.  I will get her to have a cloak made for me.  I am as tall as Eloisa, but much stouter across the chest particularly & back.  [E.F.P.]

Dear Mama


	We were all out this morning shopping, & that is the reason why I did not write to you.  I will not have time to write but a few lines.  Aunt Emily has invited us to drink tea this evening with her.  It has been raining & thundering today but this morning was beautiful.  Aunt Eliza says that she knows that Aunt Emily is going to send for us, if it pours down.  It  has stopped raining now.  Aunt Anna & aunt Martha are going in the country,,,that is Thursday.  They are to take tea with aunt Eliza tomorrow evening.  All of my relations are kind to me & they all send their love to you all.  Cousin Sarah Gibbes invited me to tea yesterday.  I went.  I spent a very pleasant evening.  She has three daughters & four sons.  Two of her sons are grown & one of her daughters.  The next daughter is fifteen & her next just eleven.  She sends her love to you all & says she is very sorry for Aunt Annie, & aunt Susy.  Cousin Eliza says she will try to have a cloak made for Fanny.  I saw Miss Mary Drayton in the streets this morning & she said that Mr. & Mrs. Elford  were going next Tuesday or the end of next week.  I expect that I will go up with them.  I am enjoying myself exceedingly well.  I have bought six bibles for the servants. Cousin Eliza says she will get the other two for the servants if you wish her to do so and the two for Willie & Frank.  I have just received a letter from you but have not time to answer it.  Give my love to all, especially to Papa.  Your affectionate daughter, Anna.

P.S. Aunt Eliza, Cousin Eliza, & cousin Susan send their best love to you all.

My dear Anna

	I have just received two letters from you, and one from Aunt Eliza.  I write to say as there is such a difficulty in having work done, I will give up having Fanny�s cloak made.  If the materials are bought & a pattern sent, I will have the Cloak made here.  I will make it myself.  If a ready made Worsted Cloak would have been got, it would have saved the trouble of making one.  If cloak patterns cannot be got, perhaps a S� a large one will do.  If so get [page torn] materials for a S� & a pattern.

	I wrote to Eliza to have a Cloak made for me; at least that I would wish one, but as there is such a delay, it will be best to inquire the prices of ready made Cloaks, black silk & other dark kinds.  It will be better to give more, & be saved the trouble of buying materials & waiting to have the Cloak ma[de].  There is such a delay in fitting oneself with suitable winter clothes, so that this winter I am obliged to have some things.  Last Sunday I wore a hat with a feather, & an old black Silk dress, & felt very shabby indeed.  As Eliza wil[l] be confined to her room for a month I got Margaret [to] let Clara come & make a dress for me, the first she has ever made alone.  She is now in the room with me making the dress.

	Tell Aunt Eliza Aunt Mary McCall sent me two beautiful dresses.  The blue one was got at Browning & Semans 25 cts a yd.  The whole peice looks beautiful, much prettier than yours at the same price.  The Cashmere is 75 [page torn] & is embroidered.  I send a pattern, but not of the part embroidered.  Mary said belts were not worn, the dresses were peaked, but I intend to have my dresses made my same favorite way & so need a belt for each dress.  Ask Eliza to buy me a belt for each.  They can come up in [page torn] large envelope, if no opportunity occurs.

	There are a great many stores here, but the shopping is very limited.  If we get a dress, we cannot get trimmings for it.  You would not price a pr of Gaiter boots to fit, & some simple things we cannot get, & the Stores are so frequented by Greenville Loungers, it is disagreeable  to go in them & the merchants are acquaintances , & they talk & press their goods on us, so it is very awkward to refuse.  The shopping [l]ine is more like disagreeable visiting in the City.  It is a business matter{&} I am surprised Mr. Elford did not deliver my packages immediately.  He is more careless than I thought.  He is not as punctual & exact in business as your Papa is.  

	Mr. Elford�s little daughter is not expected to live.  He has been written for & may come back before he has time to let you know, before you can get ready to come.  If so I will let you know of the first opportunity I hear of.  It may be inconvenient for your Aunt to have you longer, & I do not wish you to impose on her hospitality, so you must consult her wishes about lengthening your visit.  She has been very kind indeed to you, & has afforded you a great pleasure by introducing you to your relations.  You cannot return her kindness [page torn] it deserves, but you must show your value of it, by making her some useful present.  You must get money from Mr. Elford & pay for what I wrote for, & also if you need any.

       [G]et at Klinckes a Jar of preserved Ginger & give to your�in my name & get a present for her Eloisa & Susan.  
       
	If you buy the dress & trimmings & bring it home, Eliza can make it when she gets well.  A dress for 25 cts a yd as pretty as the blue Aunt Mary has got me at that price, & which [pagetorn]  send a pattern of will do.  Beg Eliza to get me two belts to suit [page torn] patterns I send.  I will write to Aunt Eliza soon.  Tell her I [w]ould be gratified if she would write to your Papa about you.  Your Mama, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have just written to your cousin Eliza & will now write to you.  I expected you home this morning.  I heard Mr. Elford would be here.  Last night I heard a Stage as I thought stop at the gate.  The driver called out very loud, & then blew his horn.  I thought you had come, & woke your Papa & he woke Charlotte.  By that time the horn sounded at a distance, & I discovered it was the Augusta Stage that had passed.  This morning Mr. Hoke told your Papa, Mr. & Mrs. Elford had arrived at 6 oclock.  Little Mary Elford died only a short time before.  She was at Mr. Perry Duncans.  Mr. Duncan sent in a servant to prepare Mr. & Mrs. Elford for the sad event.  The servant passed them on the road, but they were afraid to inquire of him about the child, so rode on, & knew not whether the child was alive or not until they got to Mr. Duncan�s & found it dead.  It was something like Scarlet fever, for yesterday an irruption broke out.  Fanny Hoke has also been sick in the same way, but is getting better.  How many little children have died lately in Greenville.  It must be a warning to those who are left.  Mrs. Harvey has moved into the County.  Her two oldest children will stay in the village & go to school.  Susan Hoke I see very often.  She sends her love.  She says she wrote to Augustus to go & see you, but as you have not mentioned his visit, I suppose he has not been.

	I am sorry Mr. Elford was hurried home so much sooner than he expected, & that you did not come back with him.  Do inquire of Mary C�ton & anyone else from Greenville who may be in town of some opportunity, & let you know that you may return.  If you hear of none, in a little more than a week your Papa will go down for you.  He would set off at once, if it were not for some business that detains him at home.  I proposed that Willie should immediately go down for you, but your Papa said somebody would have to go to take care of Willie.  The  children are very much disappointed at not having their Christmas presents.  I have nothing to give them.  They will have to hang their Stockings after you come back.  I am sorry you are not here.  I put off making the Hogs feet into Jelly until you returned but now it is so warm I can wait no longer & am making the Jelly today.  I am sorry also you have been obliged to stay so much longer than we intended you should, & as your aunts house will soon be full, I feel uneasy at your putting her to inconvenience.  You must write to me every day until you return.  Do not forget the Candy & Cocoa nut cake for the children.  I am getting nothing of the kind for their Christmas here.  I have sent Eliza 20 dollars, & I have troubled her so much in shopping for me that except a�for Fanny, & something for a S� or Cloak for her, & a pair of Gaiter boots for me, & a Prayer book for yourself, there is nothing more I wish at this time.  You know we pay our bills.  We have to contract during the year, at the Blacksmiths, Sadlers. Doctors &c, buy meat Corn &c, so I am more straightened than at any other time, or I would send for a great many things I need, & I have also a large bill to pay Aunt Mary McCall 21 dollars for the Cloak, which is almost white, & I never expect to wear, but I know she did the best for me, as she thought, & therefore I do not wish to hurt her feelings, & she has been kind to you, but it would have been better not to have got me my cloak.  The bonnet is too fashionable for Greenville, but I cannot dispose of it, so wear it.  If I had known there was so much difficulty in getting work done I would not have written to you to get a dress.  I am sorry I troubled your cousin so about work.

	Your friends have been kind to you, & I am sure you will never forget it.

	I hope to see you soon, & to hear from you every day.  Frank says bring him some crackers, & Willie & himself a knife.  In haste.  Your affectionate mother

	Mr. Hopkins & his family have just passed on their way to Florida.  Fanny is regretting she did not see them, & says she wishes Rosa had staid.  I think Fanny is almost crying.  She is now saying, �I want Anna.  I wish Anna would come.�

	The Silver Comb I want for Annie like yours.

Dear Anna


	This is Christmas day, & a very dull day it has been.  The weather continues very bad.  I never knew so long a spell of rainy warm weather in winter.  The streets & yards are very muddy, & the house looks as if it never could recover.  The Carpets I am afraid are ruined.  The roads must be dreadful.  Your Grandmama & family were not able on account of the weather to come in & spend the day with me.  I sent them some of our desert, as they could not come.  I let Becky have holiday, & Lindy cooked.  Tomorrow Lindy will have holiday.  The pleasure seems to be all among the servants.  Last night some of them went to a party; today they have dined out, & their having holiday seems to make them happy.  The children hung up their Stockings, so I was obliged to put something in.  I bought 5 cts worth of Candy apiece, a mug, a 5 cts doll, a cake, an apple, a switch & 10 cts apiece.  So St Nicholas they think has not forgotten them.  Fanny regrets very much that you are not here.  I hope when you return we will have pleasant cheerful weather or you will think Greenville very dull.  Your Papa will go down for you.  He may not have time to go & return before New Years day.  If he does not, he will go immediately after New Years Day & that will be as soon as Mr. Springer thinks of coming.  So by New Years day have everything ready.  I dare say he will spend a few days in town though, so you will have time to get ready after he gets down.  I expect he will take Willie with him.

	     Mary Elford was buried this morning.  I hope she has spent her Christmas in a happy world with Laura McKay, who was so afflicted, that I think it was a blessing she was taken, as her life would certainly have been one of suffering.

	Fanny Hoke is getting better.  Fanny sent her a doll & she sent Fanny a box.  Susan Hoke told me she wrote to Augustus to go & see you.  I suppose he feels awkward about visiting.  Butler Tompson told your Papa his Fathers wifes son, weighed 13 ? pounds, & his father was very proud of it.  

	I am always writing you something to get, & I expect as long as you remain in town it will be the case.  I wish you to get me a little key basket, & 1 dozen black lacets for Gaiter boots.  The tines come off so soon, & then ties cannot be laced.  Mr. Westfield puts such large tines on they will not go through the holes, & then they cannot be laced, so buy one dozen black lacets for Gaiter boots. Some neat dark Calico about 12 ?  cts a yd such as will wash I also wish, & will write for before you leave.  A good many yds I would like, but I will wait until I get Eliza�s next list.  Beg her to send me a list of the other things she has bought.  I know I will like the bonnet she has got, & will wear it constantly.  I see in my list Calico is mentioned for A� the 1.37 ? for the Calico if Eliza chooses & the 1.12 ? for Reedy House might be added to your money, & pay for some of the things you have got.

	I am obliged to your Aunts for making you such acceptable presents as the Bible & Prayer book, the very things you were going to buy.  Also to Aunt Eliza for the boxes & Aunt Emily.  Your friends are very kind & I am thankful for the good opinion they have of you.  I am greatly indebted to your cousin Eliza for all the trouble she has taken to shop for me.  I will never forget their kindness to you.  Aunt Mary McCall has been kind.  I hoped to have heard today from her about the Cloak but have not.  If the man will take it back, your Papa can carry it down, but I suppose he will not change it.  

	Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily & my other Aunts.  I wish you would see about Sarah Matthews & Aunt Harriett but suppose you will not.  Give my love to cousin Sarah Gibbes, Mrs. Irvine Keith, Mrs. O�Driscoll, & my other family.  Have you seen Elizabeth Jones?

	It is 10 oclock.  I can hardly see to write.  Hext is well & fat & lively & good, better than he used to be.  Minerva is sick, over at the Mansion House, with cold & headache.  The rest are well.  Lindy is still lame from Rheumatism, & is not going at present to your Grandmama�s.  She has engaged Nancy Greens daughter.  While Lindy�s baby is young, I know she would not do well hired out.  She can hardly work but next summer, after her child can run about she will do better.  She is now only able to help the other servants.  I will stop now & finish my letter after the candles are lit.

Dear Anna, You had better buy the dolls not dressed & dress them yourself.  I hope Aunt Harriett will come down from Mrs. Wilkes to see you if you are in town when she is there.  I am sorry you have not dined with your Aunts in Meeting St. but hope you will now.  We used to spend pleasant days with them when we were children.  I hope Alston will name his son after his father.  He lost one named Robert, but I think he ought to name another after his father, & that it would please his Mother.  I am sorry Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha have gone in the country.  I hope you will see them again, & that they will be in town when your Papa & Willie go down.  Tuesday week I expect your Papa will go down for you.  Wednesday the day after he will stop at Newberry to attend a R[ail] Road meeting, Thursday he will go to Columbia, & Friday reach Charleston.  He will remain there a few days.  It is very unexpected he is going down, but now he has determined to go, he is pleased with the trip, he is obliged to be back before the 15th Jany.  He would have gone down immediately, but all business men ought to be at home Sale Day, & he could not return in time.  So you will soon see him, & I expect Willie.  Write every day.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Greenville

Dear Anna


	I have just received a very pleasant letter from you.  Your friends are very kind to you, & the enjoyment you now have, must last you a long time.  In looking back to it, you can experience it over again.  Uncle Arthur & Aunt Elizabeth are kind.  The presents I will like to see.  You must get your cousin Eliza or Susan either to show you or how to finish the Mit, or to finish it for you.  As unfinished they will be useless, & perhaps you can learn how to knit a purse with the ball of Silk.  I am glad you have seen H� Drayton.  You were right to speak to Miss Drayton, for she would have spoken to you if she had recognized you, & if you had not spoken, you would have missed seeing H�, who is a fine girl, & was kind to you in Greenville. & I am sure would have been very sorry not to have seen you.  Did you tell her the fate of the China doll? She bought? & dressed for you.

	Your dress I know is a pretty one, & you will find it useful.  You have remained so much longer in town than you expected, that your other dresses perhaps look shabby, so this new one is made just at the right time.  I am sorry you did not take down your other Flannel petticoat.  I will send you by your Papa a new Sun bonnet I have just made for Fanny, but it is large enough for you & send that blue silk apron I bought for myself at Cox & Gowers but have not worn.  Perhaps it may be useful to you, the few days you remain after you receive it  

	If Aunt Mary McCall could have returned me the money for my Cloak, I would have written to Eliza to get me one, as I need a cloak very much, but situated as I now am, with Aunt Mary�s cloak on hand, & not able to dispose of it. & having bought so many other things & a second bonnet I am not able to get another Cloak.  I hope Aunt Mary will be able to get the man to give me another Cloak this winter or next.  I am going to send it down to her.  When I first wrote to Eliza about another Cloak I thought I could dispose of the light one, but I have not been able to, so for the present I must hope Aunt Mary can do something with it.  

       I know I will like the bonnet Eliza has got.  I am glad the box was about to be sent when you wrote.  There are a few things I wished Mr. Elford to get, which his leaving town so soon, may have prevented his attending to.  If so, when your Papa goes down I will send a list not a long one, a dozen large & a dozen small knives without forks, for every day use, two peices of the cheapest Calico 4 or 5 cts a yd to make Comfortables,13 Stair case rods, are what Mr. Elford I expect has not got, & a Fender,�dogs, Shovel & Tongs, Broom & Bellows for the Dining room.  These things if your Papa cannot get, I will be glad for Eliza to, & I think she will be the best judge.  Send a list of all you have got since the last list sent.  My hair not being able to be made into chains, for a small one I wished made, for you to wear your Medallion with.  I think you need some kind of chain.  What kind would be suitable.  Ask Eliza, & what is the price, write me, so I can tell your Papa, & you can get one after he goes down.  I think the 12 ? cts chain must look very unsuitable.  A pair of India rubber shoes you must get.  One thing I wish to know is the price of a nest of baskets, beginning from the largest Market basket to the key basket.  Ask Eliza to let me know the price, so if I can get a nest I will send by your Papa for it.  Mr. Elford was to have inquired for me.

	You can work on your quilt when you return.  I am glad you practice regularly on the Piano.  I hope you will play better than when you left.  I am also thankful you do not forget to perform your religious duties, & that you have behaved so well as to gain the good opinion of your friends.  You must set a good example to the others when you return, & try to be a comfort to us & make us all happy by your good conduct.

	You are greatly indebted to Aunt Eliza as you may tell her, for it is through her kindness, you have been put in the way of receiving kindness from your other relations.  She so kindly invited you to visit her, which has given you so much enjoyment.  Willie is sorry now, he did not accept the invitation given him.  Now that he hears how pleasantly you have passed your time; he thought it would be like Columbia, where he has no acquaintances & soon gets tired of, for there he is the whole time among grown persons, his Papa�s associates. & such society improves him, so I am always well pleased to have him there.  Today Willie is not well, has a sore throat, which many are complaining of.  Mary has, & Edward & Mrs. Hoke.  Susan Hoke was here yesterday.  She said she is certain Augustus did not get her letter telling him to go & see you, & that he cannot know you are in town, or he certainly would go & see you.  It has rained almost constantly since you have been away & yesterday was the eighth day it rained without intermission, & today it is not raining, but is still cloudy & warm, & not like clearing.

	If you do not know what to buy for the servants, I can tell you.  Becky�s comb & a handkerchief apiece for the five women, two Bibles I am going to give to Reuben & Charles two of those you have bought, a Bible to Eliza, for Eliza & Lindy�s babies buy a little Worsted bonnet apiece for 25 cts, or 25 cts worth of Calico for the little servants any little thing, some Candy if you can think of nothing else.  One of the Bibles you have bought you can give to John Macbeth for the servants at Mamma�s, for Lucinda a handkerchief, for the little servants candy; Ninny a handkerchief or apron.

	Do not forget the Sugar dogs for Vardry & the others.  When I know all you have bought, I can then see whether I can get some books or not.  I hope to be able to, but having to pay for Groceries & Doctors & other bills, I cannot ask for money at this time to buy many things I would like.  It is such a good opportunity, your being in town.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, & your cousins & thank them for taking such kind care of you.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have been disappointed today at not hearing from you, but I suppose you have been so much engaged shopping or seeing your friends, you were not able to write by this Mail.

	Mr. Elford went to his office today for the first time since he returned.  He told your Papa he left orders with his brother to give you any money you wished, so I hope his brother has given you some.  If he has not, you can immediately send to him & ask for whatever money Eliza needs to pay for the things she has bought for us.  I prefer her doing so to waiting until your Papa goes down, as I would like her to have the money at once.  I am glad to say that Mr. Elford bought all the things I requested him to, the Knives, Fender, Calico, & even the nest of Baskets, so I will not have to trouble your cousin Eliza to get them for me.  She has shopped so much already for me, I am unwilling to occupy her time in that way, more than I can help.

	It is reported the Cholera is in Charleston, but I hope it is a mistake.  If it were so, you would have mentioned it, & Augustus Hoke would have made it an excuse to come home.

	Willie took some pills last night, & feels better today.  He has gone to the Farm to haul wood.  Franks only amusement is to cut wood.  Fanny is trying to make herself useful.  She has been pulling Sage, then asked what next she should do.  I told her to move Hexts carri[a]ge out of the front walk, then pick up towels lying about the yard.  Hext has gone to the Mansion House to ask for a bill of some Hams we got there this Fall.	
       
	  Yesterday after I wrote the wind blew, & the Sun came out & the weather became fine, & continues so.  I hope it is the same with you, & that you will have pleasant weather the remainder of your stay in town.

	This afternoon if I can, I will go & see your Grandmama.  She is interested in all you write about, & pleased her friends have been so kind to you & that you are so affectionate in your remembrances of her, & forget no one at home.

	This visit to town is an Era in your Life.  I am sure you will never forget it, or the kindness of your friends.  I suppose you were surprised at finding how many relations you had there.  I hope you have dined with your Aunts in Meeting st.  I can imagine you spending a quiet, pleasant, improving day, seated in Aunt Mary�s chamber, working on your Quilt.  Are Mom Phillis & Minda still alive?

	Christmas has not been spent differently from any other time, except among the servants.  Mrs. Choices servants had dancing even in the day & a party takes place every evening I believe somewhere.  Even Becky last night asked to go to a Fair all the way at Mr. Goodletts.  I objected on account of the distance, for fear she would get sick. Baylis then came in to say he had procured a Buggy & intended to drive her there, & would come back soon, so I let her go.  Johnny came in for a ticket for Clara to go, said two gentlemen had come to escort her.  The two gentlemen were Genl Thompsons servants,  Tonight Dr. Irvines servants give a party, & Charlotte asked to go, & Clara wishes to have a Fair in this yard. 

	The Mauldins yesterday inquired of your Papa when you would return.  He met them in the streets.

	The Piano has not been opened (except by Mr. Wardell) since you left.  You must buy a few pretty peices of Music, simple enough for you to learn.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Sue, & beg them to write to me, & Eliza to send a list of her further purchases, my bonnet, Fannys &c.  I would like to see it, & a list of the Confectionary & toys.  I will open the box when it comes & take out the bonnet & such things, but the presents I will not take out or show the children until you return.  I hope the box will come soon.  The Rail Road being unfinished, our Groceries will come up by way of Hamburg.  The roads are so bad the freight by wagons is very high now, so we are sorry now we did not wait until Spring to get the Groceries, but often we cannot get even necessaries here, such as Rice & Salt.  At present no Salt can be got in the village.  Many persons have to keep the Hogs they have bought & feed them, until they can get Salt.  Genl Thompson is complaining of having to feed his hogs, on this account, says they are eating him out of everything.  It is near dinner time, so I must soon close.  I hope you spent a pleasant day with Miss Drayton.  In this fair weather it must be pleasant walking on the Battery.

	I hope to hear tomorrow from you.  Give my love to Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily, & Aunt Elizabeth, & my friends generally.

	I hope you will see Aunt Anna & Aunt Martha again.  I suppose you will not see Aunt Sarah & Aunt Harriet.  I am sorry you will not, & also Aunt Susan.  Thank Aunt Eliza & your cousins for their kindness to you, for which I feel very grateful, & believe me , Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. I hope your cousin Eliza received the letter containing 20 dollars I sent last week.

Dear Anna


	I have just written to Aunt Eliza to say, you may remain longer in town, that my only fear was, you would put her to inconvenience. & be in the way, when the family became larger, but as she says this is not the case, & you are passing your time so pleasantly, & are anxious to remain longer, we have no objection at all to your remaining, & coming up with Mary Crayton, if she does not stay longer in town, than you think you ought to stay.  Your Papa is better today, but will not be able at present to fix upon any time to go for you, & if you come up with Mary Crayton, or any other lady coming, he will not go down, as the traveling is too unpleasant at this season to visit town for pleasure.  We leave it to you now & your Aunt to return, at a suitable time.  Of course I would not object to your lengthening your visit, except that I thought you were trespassing on your Aunt�s hospitality, which she says is not the case.  I am very much pleased with the accounts Aunt Eliza & your cousin Eliza give of you, they say you have pleased all your friends, behaved exceedingly well, & have all the virtues that adorn the female character.  I hope you will improve as you grow older, & not disappoint your friends, & be a comfort to all those kind friends, who are interested in you, & set a good example to Fanny.  The character of the oldest sister has great influence over the others, & therefore a great responsibility rests on you.  I am glad you perform all of your duties so regularly & do not forget the most important, the religious one, you must keep yourself very neat, clean your teeth regularly, wash your hands, face, ears clean your nails, & be very nice in person, you know cleanliness is a virtue placed very high in the bible.  I see in the paper Charcoal recommended as the best tooth powder, buy a box & use it every morning.  If I cannot get any here, I will get you to buy some for me.  I do not need the key basket now.  Mr. Elford has bought a nest, which I suppose includes the�for keys, so if you have not got it already, you need not.

	I much prefer Fanny�s cloak being made.  I countermanded the order thinking it could not be done conveniently, but Eliza has engaged the mantua maker, & says it can be done.  I will be very glad to have it made, & of a large size, as the winter is so far advanced it will be more useful next winter than this.

	Tell Eliza by Butler Thompson I will send down a Gaiter boot, so she can know exactly the kind I wish, & I may write for a pr of India rubber shoes, & she can put them over the Gaiter.

	Mamma asks Eliza with the money she has of hers to spend 2.25 or about that, for a Silver spoon for Sarah Taft�s child.  It is named after Mamma, Susan Hayne McCall Taft.  She wishes the four Initials marked on the spoon S.H.M.T.  Eliza will know what kind of spoon will be suitable.

	I am glad you spend Christmas so pleasantly, & am sorry as you were, that you could not have been at Mr. Wm Ravenel�s where I suppose the tree was beautiful. But it was kind in Mrs. Drayton to ask you.

	I am pleased you remembered your Aunt & cousins with a little present.  If I had not a large debt to pay to Aunt Mary McCall, I would send you money to make them handsome presents.  Minerva�s wages are due in two weeks & the whole of it I have to send to Aunt Mary & more besides, & what is mortifying, the Cloak is useless, & the bonnet almost so.  I have worn it once only, & am sorry I wore it then, as Eliza has got me one I know I will like better, & Aunt Mary�s, perhaps I might have disposed of it at a low price, or kept it for you to wear at a future time, taking out the feather.  But Aunt Mary meant to please me, but Ella being so much smaller than I am, if she had thought about it, she would have known the bonnet was too small for me.  She has been kind to you, & I am grateful to her, & will not let her know my disappointment.

	Ask Eliza the price of her cloak, materials & mating.  I can better judge by the estimate she sent me, & wish to know what just such a one as hers costs.  I will be sure to get one, perhaps just like hers next winter.  Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Thompsons Aunt says she will take down mine, next week.  I will direct it to Aunt Eliza & get her to send it to Aunt Mary.  Perhaps I may send you a sun bonnet, apron, and flannel petticoat.  You may have use for them as you are to stay longer & I will send you my gold chain to wear with your medallion when you take tea out, as I think you have nothing suitable to wear with it.  I see Eliza bought you two Collars 12 ? apiece.  If you need it, get some more, & if Eliza thinks you need undersleeves, buy or make some.  Tell Eliza anything you really need, I wish her to get for you, if she can get it with convenience.

	I have written word you may get a wicker box.  If you can get one, you will find useful for every day use.  Generally they are only for show, & the scissors, thimble &c in them only for ornament.  Perhaps you can get one without thimble scissors & buy for it all that is needed, but consult with Eliza, & beg her to get you a useful one.  Another Christmas I will get you a Writing desk, as you must keep up a correspondence with the relations who have been so kind to you, & will need a desk.  Inquire the price & let me know of a neat writing desk. & when you get the�box, tell me the price.  

	You must continue to behave well as you have done, & not make your Aunt regret having to ask you to stay longer.  She is very kind to you.  Give my love to all my Aunts.  I will let you know when the box comes.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Anna


	I have just written two letters one to your Papa the other to Mr. Elford on business, & will write to you now.  My pen is bent, so I cannot write well.  I suppose you have seen Mr. Elford before this.  If he stays longer in town than you wish, or ought to stay, you can come up by any other opportunity you hear of.  He told me he might be only 10 days in town, but perhaps 3 weeks, so I thought he & his Wife would be the very best persons you could come up with, & the Stage at the time he comes, will not be so crowded, as at the time the Legislature adjourns.

	I received a long letter from you today.  I was glad to hear from you.  I am sorry your Cloak had not been made, as you must have needed it, ever since you have been in town.  I am sorry you did not mention the price of the things you bought.  I your next letter you must.  As you have written to your Papa for money I do not like you to write a second time for me so unless you have money left, I may not send for the articles I wish until he returns home, & then I will send the money.  I thought you would need more than 10 dollars.  He says you wrote for 10.  You write me if you have any money left, & then I can tell you what to get, but first get all you need, a dress frock for Fanny & a cloak for her, are what I would first get, after you have supplied yourself, a pr of gaiters for yourself, myself, Fanny & Hext I wish, such as your cousin Eliza wears.  The price of a bonnet for Fanny, I would like to know.  The Candy if you do not write in time for, you can get as much as you think best.  Buy a pretty pair of Ear[r]ings, for yourself.  Eliza had best write the list of your purchases.  If you need more money send to your Papa.  He will send it to you, & I dare say you will need it.  I do not care to send to him for money for myself, but I wish you to get for yourself all you need.  I can do without the things I intended sending for, for Aunt Maery McCall has got me what I most needed.  

	I am glad you are enjoying yourself, & that your friends are so kind to you.  Remember me to them all.  I send you a little book to read  that your Aunt Eliza gave you.  I read it this morning to Fanny, & it contains just such advice as I would like to give you now, but I am obliged to stop, for since beginning this letter I have received by Mr. Beattie two letters from your Papa.  I had written to him & told him I had not heard, & now I must write again, which makes me shorten your letter.  I write so badly.  You must tell Aunt Eliza & your Cousins what I say, & can read aloud parts but do not show them the letters, for I am ashamed of them.  Beg Aunt Eliza to write to me.  
	Willie Frank & Fanny & Hext will all be glad to see you again, also your Grandmama Aunts Papa & myself.  Your attached Mother, E.F.P.

[Dear Anna]

	I do not know that I can get a cloak this winter.  I hope Aunt Mary�s can be changed.  If not I expect I will have to do without, as I cannot afford another, unless one could be got reasonable, so tell Eliza merely to let me know the prices.  I will then let her know.

	If she has not got the second dress for Fanny, I expect one will be enough, for Aunt Mary�s bill is high.  Until I have paid for that, I find I must be economical.  Your dress I can have
 made here. & materials for a S� for Fanny & a pattern will be sufficient.

	You will be so well supplied with clothes you will need nothing next winter.  

	If I had known Aunt Mary�s bonnet I could wear at all I would not have sent for another, but it is very small.  Next summer I will have a peice added between the crown & front, & cover it over with ribbon & wear it as a summer bonnet, & make up for my extravagance in get[t]ing two, but the one Eliza has got will be very useful.

	Thank Aunt Eliza for her letter.  I write now in great haste, & when I have leisure I will write to her.  I am glad you pleased Mrs. O�Driscoll by your playing, & that your friends are satisfied & pleased with you.  I am sorry you have missed seeing so many.  The Spring is the pleasantest time for a visit.

	Tell Eliza I will not trouble her with shopping for a long time again, & when the Rail Road is finished I hope once in a while we can go down & shop for ourselves & not trouble our friends so often.

	The most economical way is not to send at all, but go without what we cannot get here, for when I once begin a list, I do not know where to end it.

	The weather is again bad.  You have had nearly 3 days together clear.  I am thankful that you have a happy contented disposition, & it is well , as you know in Greenville our happiness has to be found at home.  There is nothing beyond home to amuse & divert.  Everyone complains of the want of society, & the little sociability there is now, that there is less than there used to be.

	Give my love to all my friends, particularly those in the house with you

	Mr. Elford ought to have been to see you.  I suppose he was busy.

My dear husband

	Today has been so unfavorable, that we did not go to church.  I have just done reading to the children, so will now write you a few lines.  One important matter I nearly forgot mentioning to you.  When you are away the servants have so much�to do, I thought this a good time to purchase their summer clothes, for them to make up, so the money you left, I first bought some necessaries, & the remainder spent in Homespun for servants, but it was not enough to pay for all.  Would you be so good as to send me by Mr. Elford 10 dollars, to finish paying for the Homespun & to carry me on in Housekeeping.  It will be more than is necessary but you had better send that sum.  I have to pay Mom Phillis 2 dollars for being with Lindy.  I hope Mr. Keith will settle with you & pay you for all the cases you have been engaged in with him.  In writing your Editorial from Pickens, do not mention Mr. Easley�s name in connexion with the case you have against him, as his family are respectable, you must have some regard for their feelings.  If Miss Wynn were modest, she would now keep herself secluded & not wish to bring herself into public notice, as she is by bringing suit.  She is sufficiently disgraced & if a trial comes on, I am afraid other acts of indecency will be brought forward against her. So instead of vindicating her fair fame, she will establish its infamy.  Her father perhaps does not know how bad she is.  Like Mrs. Rabe Dr. Rabe before her trial did not know half of what was brought against her.  

	Lindy & her baby are doing well.  Write me a long letter by Mr. Elford.

	The Patriot in which you mentioned Scurry�s case you ought to send to Belton Williams friends,, mother, Uncles, , & cousin.  I think it a shame Scurry should be acquitted.  It was almost deliberate murder.  Massey certainly then ought not to have been hung, & I hope Mr. Wiliams will still pay you the additional fee.  I am afraid the�spirit will pass over.

	Mrs. Earle across the river, told Mamma she heard Mr. Sharpe was losing his property fast.  When will you be paid for Mr. Barnes Rail Road Case.  You will have been longer from home now than sometimes when you go to Columbia, & a Call was bad to have during Court week at Anderson.  Many are at Court, who would wish to attend.  

	Good bye.  We all long to see you.  Ever yours, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	Tonight Reuben said that Kossuth ploughed well, & that that good quality ought to be mentioned in the advertisement.  I do not know what kind of advertisement Mr. Elford has written, but perhaps you had better write such a one as you would wish, & give it to Mr. Elford to put in next weeks paper, for someone then may buy him to use on their farm to plough.  He certainly is fit for nothing else, though perhaps some person who understands breaking a horse, may in time break him, but I very much doubt it, for he seems by nature to be a[n] obstinate bad horse, & I cannot understood how Mr. Redwood can be a truthful man, & at the same time say, Kossuth was a good Buggy horse.  I am truly thankful you are going to sell him.  I have not had a comfortable ride since you owned him.  Selim & Hocky  will do to draw together, until you sell Selim & get a fine pair.  Perhaps H��s�you can buy & use with him, but I would rather be without horses, than have such a one as Kossuth.  He is not worth his food.  Goodnight.  Write by Mr. Elford, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry


Tuesday, 1/2 past 9, [1852]

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter mentioning your sad accident.  Mr. Beattie a short time previous had come to show me a letter from Mr. McKay who merely mentioned you had broken your arm at 10 oclock Monday morning & were doing comfortably well.  Mr. Beattie was afraid I might hear exaggerated accounts.  I was very much shocked & grieved , but was thankful it was not fever you had.  But I am afraid this accident may bring on fever, that you ought to come home at once.  Mr. Elford has just been here, & offered to send his carri[a]ge for you, & I have accepted the offer, so hope to see you tomorrow.  I have almost a mind to go in the carri[a]ge but am afraid you may not like it.  I am thankful it is your left arm, but truly sorry, it has occurred at all.  Edward Dr. Crooks said this morning was better that he regarded him now out of danger.  The symptoms at present were all favorable.  I was just going to write you about the Election when Mr. Beattie came.   I am sorry as yet the news is not encouraging.  The voting has been so strange that almost any result may be looked for.  Pinckney McBee is ahead.  Mr. Carson has managed wonderfully.  Mr. Ware thinks you next, but the Disunionist thinks Smith & Irvine ahead of you.  John Russell has been run by them in opposition to Col. Brockman.  Until the boxes are heard from today, there is no telling what the result will be.  I would send Willie out but Mr. Elford thinks it a risk for him to go, as his tongue you know is�, & he had a little headache night before last.  I believe I would certainly go, but he says it would be unsafe also for me.

	Be sure & come home tomorrow.  I will ride & meet you if nothing prevents.  Laurens is sickly & with your accident, you will be sure to get fever if you stay there, so I will expect you certainly tomorrow.  Reuben will go any time in the stage & bring the horse & Buggy

      I am sorry the horse was foundered; how careless in the Ostler.
      
      I long to see you & help nurse your arm.  I think I will have to go on your next tour with you.  I can write for you.  I will leave Hext, be a good time to wean him.  Susan will take care of the house & children.  I hope you are doing well, & will be at home tomorrow evening.  Your sympathizing Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. The carri[a]ge will soon be here to take this letter, so I must seal it.  How kind in Mr. Elford.  Mr. Hoke says his being beat this time will do him good, make him popular hereafter.  Tomorrow I hope to see you.  Last night I dreamt of you, but was awake almost the whole night.  I must have had a presentiment of some evil.  I was crying & begging you not to go where you would get fever.
