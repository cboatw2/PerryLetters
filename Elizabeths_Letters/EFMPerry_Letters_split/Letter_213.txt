Letter 213

Monday morning, 29 November [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have nothing to write about except to say we are all well.  Tomorrow I hope to hear certainly from you.  I have not heard yet.  When I do hear I will have more to write about than now.

	I am going to ride to Mr. McClanahan�s this afternoon to pay him.  Today Willie carried Mr. Leary his money.

	Yesterday I read Robert Halls life.  He thought Grey�s Elegy the finest thing ever written.  He recommends Jeremy Benthams writings to all Legislators.  

	Mr. Hoke bought some hogs today.  I don�t know whether he bought the one for us you told him to.

	I hope you are well, & Anna also.  I am in hopes Anna is by this time in Charleston.  I know of nothing new, have seen no one, & except the Patriot, seen no newspaper.  I must now close.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
