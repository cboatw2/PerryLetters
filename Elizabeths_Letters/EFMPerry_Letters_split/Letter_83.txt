Letter 83

Wednesday afternoon. 12 May 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have taken up my pen to write you only a few lines, to contradict some advice I gave you in my last letter.  You know I begged you to speak to Mr. McBee to get him to do something for Susan.  I have now come to the conclusion, that it is better for you not to speak, & I by no means wish you to do it.  In the first place it will be of no avail. & in the second place, even if it were, it would be of no consequence,  for Mr. Luther McBee is such a creature, I don�t think Susan can live much longer with him.  But I know your speaking to old Mr. McBee cannot change his character & make him liberal.  It cannot implant feelings in his heart which have never existed there, so I do not wish you to interfere.  Mr. Luther has always thought though you know without any foundation, that your influence was against him, so if you speak to his father to do something for Susan, with his suspicion, he will think you put it into Susan�s head, to think nothing was done for her, so I advise you to say nothing, but I would be very glad if Genl Thompson would speak, & he I believe has influence with the old man. 

        I am sorry to write you so unpleasant a letter & on such paper, but it is all I have, & I am too poor to buy any more.  We are all quite well.  My  Medicine has done me good.  I hope to hear from you tonight, & that you are well.  We have had Showers today, but Mary & Jim went to the Farm.  I have no news to tell.  Nothing came by the Mail  last night.  Willie yesterday got nearly head, only three boys were above him.  Today I dare say he will get down more.  He looks remarkably well at present.  I long to see you.  I would write more, but dinner is nearly ready & I am particularly busy.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
