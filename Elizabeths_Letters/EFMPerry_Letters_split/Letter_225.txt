Letter 225

Saturday night, 11 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received a letter about an hour ago from you.  A Servant brought it to the door & said, �Mr. Jones sends his respects, & sends you this letter.�  I took it & said nothing.  I knew he had not brought it from you that someone else had brought it, & begged him perhaps to send it to me.  In your letter you say Dr. Pasley will bring it.  I did not hear from you yesterday, nor today.  I mean this morning, no Mail it was said came from beyond Newberry, so I was glad to get the letter this evening.  I wish you had enclosed Anna�s to me.  She writes such short letters.  I would like to see all she writes to you.  Not being accustomed to writing, she finds it difficult to express herself & tell all I wish to hear, but what she does write, she writes well.  Aunt Eliza�s letter was very satisfactory, & she is fastidious & particular. & expects a good deal even from children.  So approbation from her is worth something.  This has been a fine day.  It is getting cold, & by Monday I hope will be good weather to kill hogs.  Mr. Hoke yesterday bought 10 for you weighing 2306 pounds, some of them about 200 weight, & some a good deal more, but on an average 230 pounds.  All say it is the cheapest way of getting meat, & everybody seems to have bought.  Mr. Lasly came today to offer to help kill.  He & his sons, & offered his daughter to help clean & attend to stuffing Sausages, so we will get assistance from him.  He says he will be here Monday at daylight.  We are out of lard so I am very glad to have some soon.  Lard is selling 15 cts a pd.  

	Charles has been suffering with Asthma, but is getting better & expects to be well Monday.  I told Becky to attend to him.  She said, �it was her duty to attend to Charles, for he was a good old man.�  So this shows her to be better disposed than some of our other servants.  The servants all seem happy now, & they respect Becky. & do not quarrel & abuse each other as they did.  Even Lindy�s child is beginning to thrive.  There is no complaint of not having enough to eat.  I dare say in consequence, that the eating will cost a great deal more than heretofore, but I know you will not object.     

	Susan this week spent several days & nights with me.  It was quite unexpected.  She came in to pass the day, & I felt so sorry for her, & knew it would be a relief to Ann to have her away, that I told her to stay for the night.  She, Annie, & Susy, so she staid three or four nights, & went back to Mamma�s this morning to see Vardry & Alex.  Mamma & Ann have dined with me three days so I have not been lonely this week.  I feel so sorry for Susan.  She has had a hard fate.  She is sensitive & ill fitted to endure the trials she had.  If she had been differently constituted perhaps she might, but as it is, I know of no one more to be pitied.  She said she enjoyed being with me, that I had everything to make me happy, that if it were not sinful, one might almost be envious of me.  When I think that it was just something in my person & manners that struck an old Bachelors fancy, I realize how accidental our fates in life are.

	Susan has helped me a great deal in my work.  I have been trying to make the house look more comfortable, particularly the two rooms where we sit for the winter.  I have had them whitewashed & new curtains put up.  The Sofa Mr. Wardell has finished looks very comfortable.  It will suit you exactly to lounge on these winter evenings.  The new Carpet on the Staircase & Entry looks very pretty.  These improvements were so unexpected.  My money has not held out, but as Minerva�s wages this year I have spent for you.  I know you will not begrudge returning as much of that money as I need.  Another year Minerva�s wages will appropriate expressly for my clothes & to buy things for the house I wish, & you do not care for.  This year I have spent it for every purpose but myself.  In Jan[uar]y you will receive Bank Interest which will help you to pay your debts.

	Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.  He inquired after you.  He says he went down on the R[ail] Road with Col. Dawkins last summer I think, & he was drunk the whole time.  His bold, vain aspiring Northern Wife I dare say has made him miserable.  She does not love him for himself, & therefore she wishes to gratify his vanity, that he should have honors & distinctions.  She has met with more than her deserts in marrying him & therefore she ought to be satisfied.  She ought to think that she was once a Music Teacher working for her bread, & now she has an independent fortune.  The bench must have been little in demand, so few Candidates, & such inferior ones.  I believe truly you would have been elected.  The State is beginning to appreciate you; if it does not, I hope the President will.

	Genl Thompson today sent for your office key to look at a�this afternoon.  I went to the office to shut it, & I saw Rices Digest open at a page relating to property given to children.  Mrs. Thompson is not confined yet.  I hope she will not be disappointed.  Perhaps the Legislature will not adjourn the 15th.  I almost wish you were coming in the Stage.  I am afraid the roads are so bad you will find the travelling in the carri[a]ge tedious, & the horses will get injured.  Mr. Elford would have gone down in his carri[a]ge but for the roads.  I do not wish you to follow my advice, contrary to your judgement, but I wish you to inquire on the subject, & find out whether the Stage with the night traveling, or the carri[a]ge & horses with the risk of injuring horses is best, or whether the road from Cokesbury or from Laurens is best.  Mr. Arthur says the road from Cokesbury generally travelled is very bad, that there is a more private one that is better.  The Mails are so irregular.  I hope the letter in which you tell me, how you have determined to come, will come directly to hand without any delay.  If it does not, it will be bad.  Only twice however the Mails have failed, though several times I have received no letter, but I suppose you did not write.

	Except to hear you speak, I would not care to be in Columbia during the Session.  The weather is so unpleasant, & the house so filled with ladies all seeking pleasure, but I think I will go next winter to hear you speak.  This Spring I would like to go to Charleston, when you go to Columbia, & if we are out of debt & have plenty of money, this summer we can go to the North.  You must send me a copy of your speech, �the Speech of the Session.�  I will read it with more interest now in your absence than when you are with me.  I hope you will soon have it published in the Patriot.

	I thought Anna would have to send for more money.  She will not have to buy anything again for a long time.  Going away from home, the softer sex require so many things to make them neat & comfortable, that they can at home do without, that it makes it quite expensive, but she is well fitted up & will need nothing more for some time.  I thought she would send for more than 10 dollars.

	Fanny says she longs for you to come back, but after you come back she will be sorry.  I asked her why.  She said because she would have to go out of my room, & sleep in the big room.  She already says Anna when she comes back must go up to bed with her after supper.  

	Hext is well, & when I ask where Papa is, holds up his hand as if to say gone.  Willie & frank are well.  I have rode out three times, & been to church each Sunday, the rest of the time busy at home.

	I hope to hear tomorrow, if so I will write more.  You ought to have told me what you thought of the Grocery bill.  At this moment I hear the singing in Becky�s room.  Mr. Arthur says he does not approve of it.  I am sure I do, & hope it will bring religion near to the servants, make them feel its importance, & lead them in the way they should go.
