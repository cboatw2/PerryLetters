Letter 62

Tuesday night, 25 November 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I wrote to you yesterday, & as you are so anxious to hear every Mail, I must write again tonight, for tomorrow I will be very busy working for Susan.  I was at Mamma�s today.  Some boxes arrived from town for her, among them one containing presents for Susan.  Aunt Brewton has sent her a handsome shawl; Aunt Elizabeth (Uncle Arthurs wife) a beautiful bracelet; Aunt Martha a Prayer book  Aunt Turnbull a pr of glass bottles; Aunt Harriet a China cup & saucer; Aunt Sarah Matthews a China candlestick; Aunt Eliza a China Lamp; Aunt Mary Hayne a Shawl & Gloves; Aunt a book; Elizabeth Jones a lace collar; Mrs. Lowndes a beautiful Broach an Amethyst, which you know is a Red or rather Claret coloured stone, not in gold.  They are the kind worn & Mrs. Lowndes has sent Ann a handsome Silver cup.  I mention the presents, because as I have so little to write about, it helps to fill up the letter.  The wedding is to be very private.  Susan has invited only Dr. Crook, Mrs. Duboc & Maria Pinckney.  Mr. McBee has invited Mr. Croft & Mrs. Pearson who said they intended giving a party on the occasion.  Mrs. Thompson & Eliza, Mr. & Mrs. Bradshaw & his own family.  Mamma was having some cake made today, to send to her friends in town, & to some persons here.  She will send you a peice.  There will be a good many opportunities to Columbia.  Wm Rowland is going down Thursday, perhaps I will send this letter by him, if he goes in the Columbia stage.  Mr. Elford is going to Charleston, & I suppose goes by the way of Columbia.  Mamma got him to attend to the witnessing & signing the papers Alston sent.  He said he would send them up & send them back to Alston, & at the same time, write a peice & put it in . saying he had attended to the business for her.

	The hogs are killed.  I hope now the weather will continue cold.  I am glad the corn will not diminish as rapidly as it has done.  You must not be uneasy about home.  I expect everything will go on as well as if you were here.

	Anna & Frank are in bed.  Willie has been staying downstairs with me.  They all speak of you, & Frank when offended with us, says �I�ll tell Pa� & ask him where Pa is, he says, Pa gone to Lumbia.  Last night was very cold, & I am squeezed in bed.  I can scarcely move.  All of the children wish to sleep with me, & I do not know which to refuse, so have to let them all.  The contest now is, which shall be next to me.

	I hope Mr. Elias Earle will be elected.  You must do all you can for him.  Mr. Wigfall I think I would like also elected, & would like you to vote for him, if there is no other person who has a greater claim on you.  Mr. McBee says he met Col. Townes today, & he said to him, �you don�t go down to Columbia�, he said, �no, but I hope you will help to send me down next winter!�

	Mr. Gibbs left today.  I am sorry he has been obliged to leave, for I like Mrs. Gibbs, their boy Ben, I believe has been purchased by the gentleman who bought the place.

	After hearing from you, I will have more to write about.  At present I can scarcely make out a letter.

	Genl Thompson leaves tomorrow.  Mrs. Thompson & Eliza are not going as they intended to Edgefield.  I suppose you do not know yet, whether the Governor will pardon Mr. Wells.

	A Mr. Humphreys came yesterday to get some advice from you.  No letters have come, only the Charleston papers.

	Good night, my dear husband; act for the best interest of Greenville; gain all you can in the Appeals Court is the advice of Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
