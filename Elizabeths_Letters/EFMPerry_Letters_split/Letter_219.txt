Letter 219

Sunday, 2 oclock, 5 December 1852
Greenville    

My dear husband

	I have come from church, eaten dinner & will now write to you.  I received a letter from you this morning dated Dec. 3rd.  Yesterday I did not hear, which disappointed me greatly.  But your todays letter pleases me, with the exception that you ought to express a wish to be Governor, for if you wished for success, you would be apt to be successful, though personally you should do nothing, you should get some friends to do for you.  I am certain if you let your friends interest themselves for you you will be elected.  Either this, or if you fail here, an office from the President you must have.  Judge I suppose you are not going to try for, though I would like that too.

	The letter you mention Mr. Keith would bring, Mr. Hopkins brought to the door.  I did not see him, but suppose Mr. Keith & himself had come in the Stage together, & Mr. Keith was hurried & begged Mr. Hopkins to deliver the letter.  Perhaps he did the same with your letter to the Patriot.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage.  I will write by them again to Anna.  They remain from one to three weeks in Charleston.  It will be a good opportunity for Anna to come back, but if she enjoys herself I am willing she should stay longer.  Mamma got a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday.  In the beginning she expresses a wish that Anna may arrive that day with Judge Butler who was expected, says Sarah Taylor intended sending for Anna as soon as she heard of her arrival in Columbia, though very feeble, that Mr. Taylor was not in Columbia, & that Eloisa also intended to take charge of her.  Aunt Eliza said they were thankful Isaac Hayne was reelected , but were still anxious about the office that they were more immediately interested in.  At the close of the letter, Aunt Eliza says Anna has just arrived looking well & pretty, & she makes Anna sign her name that I may see it.  

	I am not worrying about servants.  When I wrote Eliza had been very impertinent, seated in the kitchen all the time cursing & swearing & abusing me to Becky, refusing to work for Reuben & Charles, & if she did making the clothes so that they ripped immediately, not letting Edward work for them & preventing Johnny doing anything for us.  I called in Becky & told her, Eliza she must not let sit in the kitchen & behave so, for it would make her even disrespectful to me.  I told Eliza to go up & stay in her room, called Johnny in to wait, & my noticing her conduct has done good.  Johnny now comes in every day without being called, & I do not hear of Eliza�s speaking so impertinently.  I do think it is�to have a character like her in the yd.  She ruined Lindy, & will her children, but I hope so pious a person as Baylis & as I hope Becky is will soon counteract Eliza�s example.  Becky says she thinks Lindy & Edward are trying to be good.  Charles is delighted with her, says he does not hear himself cursed & abused as formerly, & gets plenty to eat, even say for to go to his supper.  I hope our yard will be happier & better now.  I dare say Becky has faults, & that I will find them out, but I think to be at the head of the servants, she will do much better than Minerva or Lindy.  I am not worrying, except about honors for you, & your not warmly interesting yourself to get them, or getting your friends to.

	I am glad you have become acquainted with Mr. Ravenel.  He is a good man, an old friend of Mamma�s.  He is a widower who has not forgotten his Wife.  They were attached to each other as children, & she said if she died, she knew he would have to marry again, because he was so domestic but he has not married.  He has no daughter, only sons.  His daughter in law keeps house for him.  One of his sons was engaged to Uncle Arthur�s daughter but died.

	I am pleased at Mr. Thompsons making you a present of boots.  Keep your money to pay your debts.  Dr. Irvine has not gone to Florida yet.  

	You must get the Black Dye for your Whiskers.  I think Mr. Cox�s at church this morning looked dyed.

	I am glad you made a good speech.  When published you must send it to me to read, & you must publish it in the Patriot.  I would like to have heard you deliver it.  How does Pinckney McBee come on.  How sad for Mr. Mauldin to be as he is.  How afflicted his family must be if true. As you were the originator of the Electoral bill, you ought to make a speech on it.  You ought to have introduced the bill this Session.  You must make Mr. Gladden pay you, & you ought to get Mr. Watts to tell Mr. Williams that he ought to pay you the 500 & am surprised he has not paid it. The weather is so warm Mr. Hoke had better not buy any Hogs until it becomes colder.  We are eating the Beef still.  I will have one Cow & Calf brought home tomorrow & begin to use the Milk.

	Mrs. Genl Thompson I believe is not confined yet.  Mamma thinks she never will be, that it is a mistake, which sometimes happens.  

	I know of nothing new at all to tell you, except an Eclectic & the letter from Mr. Hamilton containing the second Check, nothing has come from the Mail for you.

	Mr. Elford will be in Columbia Tuesday night.  He told me he heard from you yesterday.  He came to let me know he was going & would take anything.  The bells for church are now ringing, & I must stop & get ready to go.  

	Willie & Frank are going to ride on horseback.  Willie must in future go with you.  It improved & benefits him.

	Do my dear husband if it is only for my sake, accept any honor that is offered you.  Do not decline beforehand as you always do.  Think what gratification it would give me to see you who so well deserve it when no one deserves it so well as you.  Your Wife, E.F.P.

Dear Anna

	Mamma received a letter from Aunt Eliza yesterday, in which at the close  she mentions your having just arrived, & to prove it she made you sign your name.  I was much gratified to see it, & to hear you had reached Charleston safely, for the late R. Road accidents made me uneasy.  I appreciate the kindness of your friends in Columbia, & also those in Charleston.  This visit will be long remembered by you, & afford an interesting subject of conversation for a long time.  We were all pleased with Aunt Eliza�s letter & grateful for the kindness of herself & others near to us.

	I was in hopes to have received a letter from you by the mornings Mail, but suppose you have not had time to write.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford leave tomorrow evening in the Stage for Charleston.  I will write by them, & send you a pr of pantalets & a veil you left & which you may find useful.  I will also send a bundle of my hair.  If your Medallion will be wo� to a hair chain, you can have a chain made for yourself suitable for the purpose of getting your cousin Eliza to have it done.  With the hair that is left I wish a pretty chain made for Willie to wear with my watch.  I intend lending it to Willie.  If any is left have a chain made for Frank; if not enough for that, a bracelet to give to Fanny hereafter have as many things made out of the hair as it will admit, but I wish them all pretty, so if the hair will not allow of it, make only one or two of what I have mentioned.  These are presents for you to keep always in remembrance of me, & I leave it to your cousin Eliza�s taste & judgment to have the hair made in chains & bracelets as far as it will go.  Read this to her.  You can write to your Papa for what money is necessary.  Before you return I will write for several things.  

	Mrs. Elford will be in town one, two or three weeks.  It will be a very good opportunity for you to return with her.  Mr. Elford will call & see you, & you may go & see Mrs. Elford.  Anything Aunt Eliza wishes sent up Mrs. Elford will bring.  In packing up again, you can put your clothes except your dresses & thick Sashes in the carpet bag & fill your trunk with what you buy.  I leave to your judgement to get what you need.  I hope you practice on the Piano, so as not to forget what you have learnt.

	Give my love to Aunt Mary & tell her she can now perform her promise & give you the Canary birds.  I would like very much you should have a pair.  I will help take care of them, & it would delight Fanny & Hext.  Give my love also to Aunt Anna.

	Give my love to my Aunts in Logan st.  Tell my Aunt Har� she must answer my letter & beg my other Aunts also to write.  I am sorry you missed seeing Aunt Sarah Matthews.

	Each Aunt remember me kindly to & my friends generally.  Mrs. O�Driscoll you must not forget.

	When I told Fanny what Aunt Eliza wished she had gone down with you, she said, �I would be so glad, I would scream not to come back.�  She thinks her dollars you have will buy everything, a doll, & 7 Sugar dogs, a baby house furniture &c.

	Susan has been almost [every] day, & spent with me.  We work together, & Annie sometimes stays for the night, but she cries when bedtime comes.  Vardry & Alex come to the gate, but on account of the prohibitions they come no further.

	Luther has written to your Aunt Susy to return & says he will be willing to lose if she will return, & sends repeated messages.  Miss McBee wrote a note saying he was overwhelmed, & she did all she could to comfort him.  I got a letter from your Papa this morning.  He says he misses you a great deal, that you were a great comfort to him that he likes always when from home, to have someone near to him he loves.  I am always better satisfied too to have one of the children with him, to contribute to his happiness, & to their improvement.  Another time Willie must go, as he used to.  I think he�a great deal, & is one reason why he has such general information; that it has been remarked, there was no subject mentioned, that he was not informed on.  I am sorry he did not go this time.

	Frank still goes to school.  All have holiday but him.  I am very busy making servants clothes & sewing up�for comfortables, which I find are more  reasonable than blankets.  I have been out very little since you left.

	Becky & her husband have prayer meeting every night in their room, which the servants with the exception of Eliza attend.  I hope there will be a reform in the yard.  It seems purer already.  Becky I hope by her example benefit them, more than precept alone can do. 

	Mr. McKay has been prevented by a lame foot from going to town, & does not know when he can go.  Susan Hoke desired her love to you.  Said Augustus would go & see you.  

	Frank says you must write to him & he will write to you.  Fanny says you must bring her a head for her large doll.  The present head is broken.  She says you must bring her a set of furniture & a Cloak & hat.  I would like you to get a Worsted Cloak for both Fannie & Annie if they can be got of their sizes, & a hat & bonnet for Fanny.  If the Drab Beavers are not very dear & are worn, & you like them, perhaps one would be pretty, but I leave it to your taste & Eliza�s.  I wish a worsted Cloak & a hat for Hext.  Perhaps a Beaver would be pretty for him.  

	I hope you are behaving well, & performing all of your duties, & never forget that hereafter an account is to be given of all our thoughts, words, & deeds, & that we must pray for help & strength to act�, & to�even as we ought to, for our hearts by nature are sinful & need a thorough change.  Give my kindest love to Aunt Eliza, El� & Sue & W. Ed.  Write to me & believe me your attached Mother, E.F.P.
