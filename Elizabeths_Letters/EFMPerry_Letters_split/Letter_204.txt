Letter 204

Thursday morning 10 min[utes] of 9, 29 April 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter, & am very glad to hear from you.  I will write at once, because Susan is coming in to try on a dress Eliza is making, & she may stay the remainder of the day.  At any rate something will occur to interrupt me.  I believe as I read the other day in a newspaper, that one hour in the morning is worth two in the afternoon & whatever I wish done well, I do in the morning, when I feel most capable of exertion.  

	I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly, & Willie is behaving well.  I hope your dinner at Col. Williams will end with the fee being paid you. but as he is not obliged to pay, I know he will not, you say he will, if he does, I will give you credit, for a better judgment than I have.
	As for my relations, no neglect from them surprises me.  Mr. Taylor has never asked you to his house, since you have been going to Columbia, & if he were ever to ask you, I hope you would not accept the invitation.  I know when I go to Columbia, I will not enter his house, & I would like you to go to Columbia, if it were only for the purpose of refusing any attention from Mrs. Taylor to show her my feelings.  It was giving vent to my true feelings that made me write so literally to Aunt Eliza, & she either deceitfully, or certainly knowing very little of the matter said everyone connected with her, had always without any exception entertained the kindest feelings to you.  She could with truth have said exactly the reverse,  I have learnt to expect nothing but unkindness from my relations, & unkindness from those who you ought to receive kindness from, can neither be forgiven or forgotten, & make your feelings more bitter, than towards strangers who you have no claim on.  In a political view my relations have always, before you entered the family I suppose & will always dislike you, for they being contracted & selfish in their views, of course will be on an opposite side from you & they look upon you as the chief cause of preventing Harmony in the State, the one who has opened the eyes of the people, & prevented them from carrying out their selfish views, prevented their aggrandizing themselves on the peoples ruin.  Of course you will be the object of dislike to such persons.  Mrs. Taylor never paid Willie any attention in Columbia, & then deceitfully turned the tables on me, & told Mrs. Thomas she was very much hurt that I had not sent Willie immediately to her house to stay, that it was what she would have done if her son had come to Greenville; but enough of them we are not dependent on them.  Your friends are certainly a distinct set from�.  Mr. Pettigru, Judge Huger &c.  They have not heretofore assimilated with.  I am delighted to hear of the�as regards your being United States Senator.  I will live on that hope, & will be satisfied, when that is realized.

	Frank when I told him of your pleasure at Hext�s improvement asked what you said about him.
He has the Mumps.  Dr. Dean looked at his face this morning, but said nothing need be done for it.  He must not run in the yard when it was cold.  Fanny is well.  Mary looks ailing, but goes about.  Dr. Dean said she must take Blue pills again tonight.  She still has the pain in her chest, which shows disordered stomach.  The rest of the household are well, & I do assure you I keep house delightfully with my former illtempered cook away.  Lindy makes good bread, rolls, tea, cake, & above all she does whatever I tell her.  Whoever will give 1000 dollars for Minerva may have her.  Bad temper does not lessen her value to those who have the power (which I never had) of governing her & she is as capable a servant as ever was.  

	I am glad you are honoured in the Convention.  You I hoped would be one of the Committee.  I am afraid you will not remain in Columbia long enough to receive my box.  You must have my thimble mended  & after the Convention attend to your tooth.  Yesterday a letter from Mr. Verner came, one from Mr. Cochran about his Law case against Charles, one from Mr. Sawyer of Asheville about a suit he wished you to bring for some land near Union left to a family named F�, but who have never had it in possession.  He wishes the suit brought if you think they can gain it.  The land is worth 10,000 & you would get he says a good fee if recovered.  You would have to use the very opposite arguments you used for the Paris�s.

	Susan is now here, & I am writing while talking to her.  The children all have holiday until Tuesday.  Now to prepare for May day, & Monday to clean up.  I will be glad to hear from Willie.  I will write an account of May day, & how Hochy performs his part.  I have not a particle of news to tell you.  Charles & Reuben go every day to the Farm, & I hope are doing well.  In the morning Charles hoes in the garden.

	Though I expect no attention from our family, I am still glad that Isaac Hayne & yourself are friendly, & in the first instance he wrote you an apologetic letter, & what vexed him was that he had done it, & we did not accept it, so I think he at first was disposed to conciliate.  Mr. Perroneau I hardly know.  Politics now makes him treat you coldly, for he used to call on you in town & seemed to like you.

	Always write the hour in which you are writing.  Then I can understand better at what time all you write about occurs.  The Duncans being with Willie must make him enjoy himself more than if he was alone.  Let him do as he pleases about returning with them.  I read your Editorials in the Patriot.  Dr. M� I thought [word faded] Senator from Newberry, you said he had never before represented the people.  I am sorry your feet hurt you.  You must have your likeness taken, & send me the doggerel poem. [E.F.P.]
