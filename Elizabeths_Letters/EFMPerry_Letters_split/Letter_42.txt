Letter 42

Monday morning, 27 January 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I was so disappointed at not hearing from you last night.  I could hardly believe James, when he told me he had no letter.  However the disappointment was made up, by reading one from Aunt Eliza, Mamma received last night.  I was perfectly delighted at her account of Will.  She seems enraptured with him.  She says �had not thought to know such pure & lively joy again on Earth as she felt at the sight of him�, that he is indeed a lovely boy, that Sue has carried him to see some of his friends, & all received him most affectionately, that Aunt Brewton was touched even at the sight of him.  I suppose it recalled to her mind his Baptism, the last Sunday she was ever at church with Uncle Robert.  Sue says Aunt Anna & Martha were overjoyed.  She did not know they would be so glad.  Mrs. Irvine Keith  met him, & was delighted to see him, & wanted to claim him too.  Mrs. Deas a friend of Mamma�s called to see Aunt Eliza; and when she told him Willie had been to deliver letters of introduction, she said. �nature had furnished him with the best in his countenance.[�]  Aunt Eliza says Sue  is perfectly happy playing with Willie.  She really seems to love him, & I cannot tell you how much gratified I am at his reception.  Aunt Eliza begs, that I will let him stay with her, until I make my visit in the Spring, that he will then have time to know & be known to his friends, & it would be quite a charity to her.  My dear husband, I would have no objection to let Willie remain.  Though I miss him sadly, I am willing to part with him for the sake of the benefit he would derive, from intercourse with his friends.  It may improve his character, his disposition, his manners; the good impression made on him would be lasting & of benefit to him for Life.  In Greenville, he is always at home, associating with servants, & no social intercourse at all.  Aunt Eliza brings up children so well, I would commit Willie to her care with perfect confidence.  However this is just as you think.  In the Spring if I do not go down, you can carry him again to see his friends, when you go to Columbia, but I hope I will be able to go in the Spring.

	Aunt Eliza says you were kind & friendly.  You must go & see her the night before you leave, thank her for her kindness to Willie, & tell her if she goes to Edgefield she must come & see us, & offer your services if ever you can be of use to her.  She says she would like Wm Ed[ward] her son to make your acquaintance & secure an interest in your feelings.  She says she would gladly have invited you to stay with her, but they were in daily expectation of Dr. & Mrs. Thomas.  Mr. Martin was with them, & I believe Judge Butler also.  I hope you have been to see all the family & been kind & sociable in your manners, & made a good impression on them.  I am anxious they should think well of my husband.  If I can I will write to Aunt Eliza by the same Mail that carries your letter, but I may not have time.  This is the last letter I will write you if you leave Friday the 31st as you intended.  I have nothing to write about.  The children & myself are quite well.  Mamma has been unwell.  Ann is the same as when you left.


	Aunt Eliza said she wishes I could have seen Willie as he was feeding the pigeons, & gazing in astonishment at the Chimney sweeper who was performing his office, that the Canary bird & everything delighted him so that his sense of bashfulness gave way to wonder & pleasure, & that he sallied forth as trustingly with Sue, to deliver his letters of introduction, as if he had always lived with her.  She says she was not prepared to see so lively a child, but she is rejoiced at it, that his motions are lively & free, �best befits the mountain boy.�  Aunt Eliza says Willie knew them all, & he asked to see the room where I was born.  You recollect I told you to see the house where I was born.  He said he would stay with them every day, but must go to sleep with you.  The whole letter is about Willie, & the most interesting I ever read.

	Aunt McCall�s thought at first Willie looked like his Grandfather McCall, but after a time, said he resembled both parents & several�on each side.  I knew my friends would be glad to see him, but they have expressed even more pleasure than I expected.  From Aunt Eliza�s account they seem to have the sincerest love for him already.  She says each kind Aunt he went to see wished to keep him.  She could hardly get leave to bring him back, & Anna Turnbull thought she had quite an advantage over them, in the opportunity of being acquainted with him.  Willie made his mark in the letter for me.  Tell him it was made beautifully & delighted me.  Delia & Edward say I must tell him Howdys, & Anna�s toy he must not forget.  Anna tells everyone, he has gone to town to buy her a toy.  I do indeed long to see my darling boy, & hear tell all the wonders he has seen.  Today is clearing.  You have had much better weather than I anticipated you would have.  I suppose you will be back Sunday night, but I certainly expect to hear from you before you return.    You must not forget to buy the carpet.  The present one is not decent.  Susan begged me yesterday to tell you to inquire about the carri[a]ges.  Mr. Cox you know said he would not build them one for less than 350 dollars.  Mrs. Stone says Tom Butlers brother bought a handsome one for 275 & Col. Lynah�s Mrs. Coleman says was only 245 & Mrs. Tom Lowndes was 245.  Mr. Cox I dare say was exaggerated when he said Mr. Lowndes was 375.  Your affectionate wife, Lizzy

You must execute all my commissions.
