Letter 84

Wednesday afternoon, 28 October 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just done dinner, & I will write you a few lines merely to gratify you in case you are still at Anderson, as in all probability you will not be there, it is not worthwhile writing a long letter which you may not receive.  I scarcely have the time to write.  All of the morning I have been visiting my neighbors,  I paid 8 visits.  I owe now almost everyone a visit.  Yesterday I returned some visits at a distance, so rode, but this morning I walked.  March has been hauling lumber to the Mill.  I intend to let him haul for sometime.  This afternoon I am going over to the Mansion house to bid Mrs. Middleton good bye.  She goes tonight, & after that I going over to see Mamma, who is quite sick with Sore throat & fever.  Susan is not going to  Mrs. Thompsons or Mr. McBee either.  Neither of them wish to go.  I would like to go, & if I do go will go with Mr. & Mrs. Town[e]s.  Mrs. Town[e]s asked me to this morning.  You might very well have come back, & then gone to Josiahs afterwards.  Saturday night would have done just as well for you to attend to the business.  If you were going with me I would be certain of enjoying myself.  With regard to selling the servants, we will talk about it when you return, as to which shall be sold.  March is so pleasant a servant I would rather keep him.  His temper is so good, & as you must have a servant about the yard, he is a good one to have.  Your Farm ought to be attended to.  Therefore Charles & Jim will do for that.  James I would sell by all means, & Maria wish sold.  She is not good enough to regard her feelings, therefore sell her to Col. Irby or Mr. Cureton.  Mrs. Cauble I went to see this morning.  She said Maria�s mother has spoiled her, that she is only fit for a corn field, & at that will do well, that she can never be made a good house servant, that she is filthy, & that she has been more impertinent to her, than she imagined a servant would be, that the impertinence she gave me was just like her.  So unless you keep her at the farm, you will have to sell her, & at the farm she is of no use.  If it is necessary I can send Mary there to stay, let Eliza � & Delia stay in the house.  All of this we can talk over together when you return.  I wish you to take the money James is sold for & pay what you owe.  Willie, Anna & myself are quite well.  Frank I hope will soon be so.  He wishes to eat all the time.  I am obliged to restrain him.  Mamma has a dreadful sore throat.  It is very much swol[l]en.  She told me she had sent for you to stop there, & that you were quite kind. A letter came to you last night from John Cunningham about Mr. Simms.  It is a good letter.  He says he has always thought that his ancestors & Bill Cunningham ought to be disconnected, that he disapproved of his sisters publications, but he thinks Mr. Simms language most insulting to her, & that he would notice it, but he hopes you or Judge O�Neal[l]  will this winter  write a peice about his ancestors, disconnected with William Cunningham, & if so he will not do anything, says he regards you as a personal & family friend, & wishes you & Judge O�Neal[l]  to give him your opinions, & talk together on the subject.  He begs you to interest yourself in the selection of Aldrich for Barnwell, & Cochran for Abbeville.  I wrote to Pamela last night.  I had nothing else to do, & thought she would like to hear from me.  I did not mention Johns letter, as perhaps he would think I ought not to have opened it, but there were no secrets in it.  I have now written you a long letter.  I will write or send a message by someone going to Pickens, & you must write me when you think you will be back.  Stay as long as it is necessary.  If you can you must go & see Frances.  I would like to hear of her & her children, & she would regard it as an attention.  A North American Review has come containing a Review of Mr. Simms works, in which he is spoken of most disparagingly.  I long to see you.  I met Mr. Perry Duncan yesterday going to Georgia after his Wife.  Susan asked Mrs. Spears if Mr. Spears had any thoughts of accepting the Academy.  She said, no indeed, that after taking so much pains to acquire the arduous profession of the Law he was not going to give it up  to keep school, & besides he had refused much better offers than this one &�said seemed almost offended  at the question., but don�t mention this.  I have written in a great hurry, so good bye my husband & believe me as ever, Yours, Liz
