Letter 159

Tuesday afternoon, 18 June 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will this afternoon write you a few lines as you told me to though I am very busy.  After the Mail comes in tonight, if any letter comes for you, I will add a few lines & tell you.  I intended writing tonight instead of this afternoon, but Anna tells me Susan Hoke is coming over to sleep.  Her father is away.  If so I will be engaged with her & would only write a line or so.

		Willie & Anna commenced Dancing yesterday afternoon.  They have gone again this afternoon.  I expect Mrs. Blake will give lessons every afternoon, so she will make a good deal in a short time.  She had yesterday 19 scholars, but many who intend learning, either did not know of it, or were not prepared, so her school will encrease.  I have not seen her since Sunday.  Then she said she would be willing to stay at Mr. Crofts & teach for nothing as many children as paid her board.  All over Mr. Croft ought to pay for.  I sent a message to her today, & she was there at Mr. Crofts.  He has sent down his carriage for her, so I would not be surprised if an agreement is made between them.  Mrs. Pearson is so anxious her children should learn.  I carried Mrs. Blake to church Sunday morning & afternoon.  Mr. Arthur gave us long sermons, in the afternoon an old one.  Susans Alexander was baptized, & Mrs. Arthurs baby.  Alexander behaved well, but Mrs. Arthur�s baby screamed from beginning to end & seemed to agitate her.  Miss Lewis came this morning before we had done breakfast to practice.  She says they have heard from Mrs. Thomas lately & she still is obliged to use a crutch.  Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett paid me a visit this morning, said they would come again, when you were at home.  They say they have not half read the House of Orleans, & asked if we were in a hurry for it.  I told them no, they could keep it as long as they pleased.  Mrs. Poinsett had been to Mr. Arthurs, & she says his negroes have again run away, that 3 of them are in the Charleston Jail.  I suppose they are from the Contract in Newberry, but I do not know.  He has trouble enough with his negroes.  He today has gone to his contract in Anderson.  I wonder he has time to write such long sermons.  I carried Fanny to church Sunday afternoon, but she behaved very badly.  I hope Frank is behaving well.  Tomorrow the 19th is his Birth Day.  He will be 7 years old.  Willie says that he misses him, & the house is so much quieter. As I have so much less trouble that I miss him in a very agreeable way.  �I hope travelling will so much improve him, that he will behave well when he comes back.

		Two letters came for you Sunday night, one from Mr. Jamison saying he had received the half of the bills you had sent & begging you to send on the other half.  The other letter from Eutaw from Mr. Coleman saying the Court had allowed Washington Foster until October to settle his accounts with the Estate, the reason given, that the money was loaned out & had to be sued for & would not be collected until that time.

		We have had no rain.  Charles came in last night, & said they were getting the Farm in good order.  On Sunday while cutting wood, Reuben hurt his knee with the axe, & told Willie he could hardly walk.  I saw he walked lame, but he said nothing to me about it.  This afternoon he has returned early from the farm, & Charlotte told me he said he had come because his knee hurt him.  He left Lindy to hoe I suppose.  I have not seen him to ask about it, but will this evening when he brings me the keys.

		I have no news to tell you.  I have not been out except to church, & have seen only those who I told you came today & Susan Hoke & Mrs. Blake.  The walking in this dirty weather is so disagreeable I do not like to go out.  I have been busy working hardly had time to practice.  Anna says Mrs. Davis is sick in bed with Rheumatism   The pianos Mrs. Davids said were on there way, some of them actually in Hamburg, have taken so long to come, that I rather think he deceived us, & that he never wrote on for any more, until we took the one that came, for if the others had been on the way as he said  they would have been here before this.  I think ours a fine Piano.  I played for Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett, & they both thought it a very fine one, & not expensive.  I like it too, but still as some others might come I would prefer, I do not intend to decide yet until I see them, & whether you pay or not will make no difference.  I will still be at liberty to exchange this if I see proper.  I wish to feel perfectly satisfied with my bargain.  If I prefer this to any that come I will keep it, & if I do not I will exchange it for the one I like better.

		The household are well, including horses hogs &c except Reuben�s knee being hurt, which I suppose will not prevent his working tomorrow.  We are well.  Charles last night said when he went to bed at night  he was in pain all over.  I suppose old age & infirmities.  I am afraid he will not be able to work much longer.  I will stop & add something tonight.
