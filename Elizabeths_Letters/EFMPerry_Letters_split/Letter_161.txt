Letter 161

Saturday night, 24 November [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		You only left this morning, & yet you see I am already writing to you.  I intended writing tomorrow evening but as it will be Sunday, I will wish to send to Mary & Lindy.  I thought it best to write some this evening.  I will as usual tell all that has occurred since you left.  Fanny did not cry very long. & was quieted by sitting in my lap & eating an apple, & tonight is made happy by being put in my bed to sleep.

		Mr. Moore came this morning to sell Eggs, & I told him of your paper & that he must take it.  I did not give him a Prospectus, because I was afraid he would not understand it, & I would rather give them when I have the peice you wrote afterwards, to give along with it, for the Prospectus needs an explanation.  It has been so unrepresented.  I sent all of the letters you left to the Post office.  The boy sent word that the postage would amount to $1.35, & you can charge it to the Printing office.  The Columbia mail brought your newspapers, & a letter from Mr. Pettigru in answer to the one you wrote him, when Mr. Elford was in the desponding humour.  He said he hopes you will go on with the paper; that one established now on Constitutional principles he knows will succeed, & will deserve the gratitude of the rising generation; that he thinks the Disunion spirit is already lessening , but it would be better if the State did commit some folly & get into a scrape such as separate State action, for it would bring her to sense of her ill conduct, though it would be mortifying to be laughed at by everybody; that it is vanity more than any other feeling that influences South Carolina, so he think it will soon pass away. He says he will see you in Columbia, so as this is the case it will not be worthwhile to send you his letter, & I can make good use of it here.  Mr. Pickerell came this afternoon to fix the Clock, & we had a political talk.  He agrees with you, & I told him of Mr. O�Hanlon�s & Mr. Petttigru�s opinions, & he said he knew them both by reputation, so I offered to loan him the letters to read, at which he seemed pleased, so I lent them.  He said he went to the Mansion House the other evening to see the Phrenologist, who is a very intelligent person, & Dr. Simons came in & turned the conversation on politics, & said he went for Disunion, & they ought to ask Congress for something  she could not grant, & then we would have Disunion.  Mr. Pickerell said someone went to his shop the other day, & asked him if as a Chemist he could explain how it was that you & Genl Thompson had got together; that he told him you were where you had always been, & could not help it if Genl Thompson came over to you.  All who wish to know ought to ask Genl Thompson to explain it.

		I see by the Courier the Nashville Convention has adjourned & propose a Southern Congress, & see the death of Mr. Daniel Webster who died suddenly in church.

		This afternoon I went to see the Miss Anderson�s & I explained the State of the country to them.  They say if you go for the Union they will certainly take your paper.  They agree entirely with you in Politics.  They say they had heard nothing of the Meeting & Mr. Memminger until Mr. Cox paid them a visit, & they asked him what he thought of matters, & he said it was generally thought now the time had come to Secede & judging from the Demonstrations in honor of Mr. Memminger that was the popular feeling here & begged him to let him request Mr.  Cam[p]bell to send his paper to them, so you were either mistaken in thinking Mr. Cox agreed with you; or he has changed; or he is on both sides; but the people are so deceived; it is no wonder they think as they do.  I look for your paper to enlighten them.  Until that comes out they will remain in ignorance.  Miss Anderson says you will�with justice, if not now, in years to come; when the children of those now who are opposed to you, will be disgraced on account of the conduct of their fathers.  So my dear husband, act as your Duty dictates; bring forward a resolution for a Southern Convention; make a noble speech on the subject; that will be handed down to posterity; be sure that you say everything that is true & right & consistent with a Patriot & have it published in the Carolinian.   You have been�now as much as you can be.  I think the Editors are tired now they have vented their spleen & cannot find any words stronger to express it.  Do not vote for Mr. Memminger, Mr. Burt. Mr. Rion, & you know who. I hope you had a pleasant journey down, that the horses did not give out, & Willie & Frank are behaving well.  As you went off Charles said Scott would give out; that he had a strain in his back; that he was injured before you bought him; that you were cheated by the Drover.  I hope he is not correct in his opinion.  Tomorrow night I will finish my letter & tell you of everything else that occurs.  If it were not for want of space, I would write all�longer, but I must leave room for what may occur tomorrow.  Do not forget Susan Hokes Music, �Roll on Silver Moon.�  Miss Anderson tells me she heard Dr. Simons & Mrs. Temple had quarreled.  I do not know if true or not�.
