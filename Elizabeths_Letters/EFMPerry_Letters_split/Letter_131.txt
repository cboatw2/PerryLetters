Letter 131

Tuesday night

My dear husband

		I have just written a long letter to Aunt Eliza, & you will see by the date, that it is now very late, but I cannot go to bed, without writing to you, because tomorrow I may not be able to.  I expect to spend the morning in writing.  This morning I went to see Mrs. Kingsland, & then Susan, Mamma & myself, to see Mrs. Bryan, Mrs. Cox, Mrs. Robert Smith, & Mrs. Coleman.  Mr. Bryan is trying to sell his place.  He asks 2500 dollars for it, & he is selling his furniture at private Sale now, & afterwards what is left, will sell at Auction.  They will go to town whether the house is sold or not.  Mrs. Bryan was very anxious to go & says she does not wish to return.  Says Mr. Bryan says, perhaps he may return & buy a farm.  Dr. Simmons must have a very bad judgement before he has tried Greenville, & known whether he will like it, & known whether he will succeed.  He has bought a poor farm of Dr. Atwoods near Piney Mountain, given 800 dollars for it, & engaged board for himself Wife & children & 2 servants at Dr. Atwoods for 650 dollars a year.  �at the Mansion House he would have boarded the same family for 450 dollars.  Mrs. Bryan says, he said the Trustees had thrown out�inducements to him (which he would not mention) that he would not decline settling here, that she knows next year, he will get the Female Academy, & that she is sorry for Mr. Bradshaws family, they are such a fine family.  I myself am sorry for them, & as Mr. Bradshaw seems a good Teacher, I think for their sakes even, he ought to be continued.  Anna learns well, & of the two I prefer Mr. Bradshaw to Dr. Simmons,�looks too young, & too weak, & simple, & I dislike hurting Mr. Bradshaws feelings, & sending him & his family adrift into the world.  Mr. Mc� Mrs. Bryan says is going to remain, & has the promise of 30 scholars.  I must tell you the final settlement about Reuben.  Mr. Beattie is to take him, & you buy him, or not, just as you please, on your return.  So we can have a long talk about it, when you come back.  I have no letter to answer of yours, so have no more to scold you about at present.  Mrs. Coleman today, showed us over her house, & told the price of the furniture, for Susan�s benefit, who will have to get furniture for her new house.  She had in her Dining room a beautiful Carpet, Red & Black, colours suited for this Soil.  It was only 80 cts a yd.  I intend to write to town for just such a one.  She bought it at Lambert & Brothers.  She had a set of the handsomest Waiters I ever saw. Which she gave only 5 dollars for, & a beautiful Sideboard with a Marble top, which she gave only 50 dollars for.  I wish you to buy as few things as possible in Columbia.  Everything is too dear their.  I expect you could have got Knives much cheaper in Charleston.  Mrs. Colemans chamber looked so comfortable opening into her Dining room.  As soon as you come back I want you to have one made for me back of my Dining room, so much of it being made already, it will not cost much, & I wish the house painted.  The paint is so dirty now, I cannot make it look cleaner, so save all your money for this.  You need not buy any Books, except engage the Lady�s book.  The Croft family left today, all except Mr. Croft & Mrs. Pearson�s family.  Jim this morning drove me out.  This afternoon he shelled Corn for Meal & Hominy.  We are all well.  Mrs. Town[e]s is better.  I hope Cousin Isaac�s prospects are brightening.  I take no interest in the Legislative proceedings, as you are not a member.  I hope you will be, this time 2 years, if nothing better offers.  I cannot let you remain as useless as you now are.  You are too well fitted for the duties of a Legislator, not to be one.  All the bills you introduced about giving the voting for President to the people, the Penitentiary &c. will be passed, & you gain no credit for it.  I will stop now & add some more tomorrow.
