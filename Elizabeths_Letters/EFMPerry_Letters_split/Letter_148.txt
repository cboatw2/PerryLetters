Letter 148

Monday morning.  I have a good pen & will now my dear finish my letter.  Anna the first thing this morning when she woke looked under her pillow to feel for your letter.  I told her when she went to bed, if one came, I would put it there, but I had forgot to.  She dressed & came downstairs & I read it to her & it pleased her very much.  She sat down & answered it, but only had a short time before School, so hurried & did not write it as well as the last.  She is quite pleased at the idea of the Birds.  Frank is surprised you do not say what you will bring him, & while we were talking about your letter, Fanny said you must write to her.  She had a book a little while ago, & said she was going to play school.  She was to be little Sis, �(Sarah) big Sis, & C� was to be Mother.  Frank is now sitting down reading his book.  He wont let me tell him the words, says he knows, so it is amusing to hear him, but he manages to find out a great many.  Tell Willie I will soon write to him, & Anna says she will write after he has written to her.  I think his letters do quite well, when you think he has never written  but one or two before in his life.  I hope this visit will be of lasting benefit to him.  The other parents had better leave their children at home.  They are not equal to Willie.  It is a damp drizzly day, so the hogs are not to be killed, but as soon as it becomes cold again, they will be.  Anna has gone to school.  She will have holiday the middle of this week.  Wha Office is Dr.St� a Candidate for?  I hope Mr. Burt will not be elected Secretary of State.  He is a malignant creature.  Mr. Keith says you have often nonsuited him in court which is one reason of his dislike to you.

		You seem to make no complaint of want of money, & say you would have given even 15 dollars for my Shawl.  As the Shawl is so pretty & yet reasonable, you must spend the remainder of the 10 dollars which is what you were to give for the Shawl, in a bonnet for me 6 dollars or less could buy a pretty winter bonnet,�Silks or any kind that is fashionable.  I will need one now to wear with my Shawl.  I had intended wearing a Straw bonnet trimmed with Blue, that I wore in the summer, for a bonnet cannot even be trimmed well here.  But as the Shawl has cost so little, you must spend the remainder of the money allowed for it, in a bonnet whatever kind is fashionable.  I think you can get one for less than 6 dollars, & buy me the books I have mentioned �The lady Alice, or the new Una.�  Mr. Brown said it was a superior work, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers by Bulwer.  It is the first part of Alice which you bought at Mr. Earles sale.  If you have still money enough, buy Miss Pardoe�s [�] Francis the First.�  Of course if you have not the money you must not think of getting these things.  You must get your money due you as an Elector.  I wish you would send me the Telegraph, that contains all the news I believe.  I should think you might give up the Banner edited by Mr. Morgan, the Carolinian is sufficient.  I suppose you are beginning to have gloomy weather in Columbia as we have here.  Stay until the very end of the Session.  I will be delighted if you are elected President of the Bank, or Governor or any honourable Office.  Genl Adams seems a good sincere friend.  I have just asked Fanny what I shall tell you.  She says you must bring her Cocoa nut cakes & she wants you to come home.  She laughed aloud at Willie�s message that he longed to see her.
