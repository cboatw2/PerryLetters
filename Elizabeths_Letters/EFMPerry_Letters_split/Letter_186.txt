Letter 186

Sunday morning, 30 November [1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

		Today is just such a day as last Sunday, except it is raining more, so none of us have gone to church.  We are all seated in the little dining room, & Willie & Anna are also writing to you, but I do not know that their letters will be worth reading.  They seem at a loss what to write about, & appeal to me every moment.  We have had some good weather, but as usual it has not continued long.  Hext is in Charlottes arms, & Fanny & Frank are plaguing us all.

		I received two letters from you last night.  I suppose as usual the Postmaster was careless about Mailing one of them the day before.  So in future I will not be uneasy when I do not hear from you.  I am glad everyone is so kind to you.  I hope you are spending today pleasantly at Mr. Latta�s.  You must accept all your invitations.

		I wonder what Col. Brockman wishes with 200 dollars, for he does not bring 15 dollar bibles to his Wife.  I thank you for your remembrance, but I must say I would rather you show your love by saving your money for our future support, for though it is very pleasant to spend it, you ought to recollect that you are our sole support, & now when you make, you ought to try & lay up something for the time when you will not be able to make, so you ought to deny your generous inclinations, so do not be extravagant, buy only what is necessary, & only buy such books as are really interesting.  The Bible is the best book, but the pictorial bible I have seen, the pictures are small, & not very interesting.  If you see any pretty present that Ann would like I would be pleased at your getting it, but only  something reasonable, & in buying for the children get a little present for Vardry.  You are his Godfather, & never give him 
anything.  Susan is grateful at your merely remembering him, not the value of the present does she care for.

		I have had to buy Reuben Shoes, & an Umbrella, & sent some money to town I owed, so if you would send me 10 dollars I would be obliged to you.  My money has not given out, but it may, so I would be obliged to you to replenish my purse.  I read your letter in the Southern Patriot today.  You provoked me by mentioning Mr. Jones name.  You ought to treat him as you do the Mountaineer, & not deign to let his name appear in your paper.  The little he does in the Legislature is not worth recording.  Only in one instance ought you to have named him. & that is you ought to have mentioned Mr. Jones said there were not 300 Union men in Greenville District.  His conceit & vanity provoke me beyond endurance.  He cannot forget that he stood at the head of the ticket & is still saying I suppose that he represents the District not you.  I suppose he says, he governs it, that you have no influence at all, & then at the next election he will wan� & get the votes of your friends again.  Col. Brockman & Mr. Duncan & yourself ought to keep aloof from him, & not condescend to notice him & except to mention his folly & conceit which should be known to the people of Greenville, I wish you to mention him in no other way.  You ought to mention how he tried to put down the 4th of July meeting.  Mr. Jones self conceit, & a toothache I now have, have put me in a bad humour for the present & Hext is crying, so I will stop & nurse him & begin again in a better mood.

		Margaret H� left the Jail this morning.  Mr. Elford will take this letter.  I think you had much better not go to Charleston until the Spring when you go down to the Court of Appeals.  Now if you go, you will be neglecting your duties, & you would not stay long enough to warrant the expense of going down & coming up on the Rail Road.  In the Spring you can buy Groceries & other things we need, & take one or two of the children.

		I hope you will be appointed a Delegate to the Baltimore Convention.  It will be a pleasant trip for you.  So that you enjoy yourself, I am wil[l]ing to remain at home quietly, & think only of you, & wish you advanced, because you have always acted so disinterestedly & nobly you deserve it & unless one is rewarded by office & honor, they are not appreciated for their conduct by the world, they are the same men, but they are not esteemed  as they are, when they meet with reward.

		I see Mr. Hopkins is going to keep a school, so there will be 3 schools, besides the Academies & Mr. Arthurs.  Mr. Elford says Mr. Arthur takes the Patriot.  I felt vexed when I thought he did not; for as you go to his church, & pay him so much, I thought he was in duty bound to take your paper, but it does not seem to have enlightened him.

		Dr. Koch was here yesterday a little while.  He begged me to ask you to attend to the business he asked you about, says he could pay some of the money required to board Mrs. � at the Asylum, that he wishes to know how much they would charge for boarding her 3 months, so attend to it for him, do not think it too little a matter.  It is important to him.  I am glad you have introduced a bill for giving the Election of President to the people.  All the Anderson petitions were good.  You must introduce their petitions as bills, give election of Governor to the people, have basis of representation altered, the free school fund more equally distributed, & taxes more justly levied, & in short�South Carolina a free State, & the Upper country equal to the Lower.

		I like to read your letters in the Patriot, & always wish they were longer & contained more.  I have written to you every day now since you left but one, when Anna wrote.  

		I have told Mr. Elford to buy Hext a Straw carri[a]ge & chair & 2 yds of Carpeting that is needed.  He is to buy a Carpet for Mamma.  He is obliging & a good judgement, & I would rather him shop for me than anyone, so let him make the purchases I have mentioned.  They are necessary & will be very useful, & I would rather buy these things for Hext than you should buy anything for me.  Hext needs both carri[a]ge & chair now.  I intended writing to Aunt Mary to buy them, but I much prefer Mr. Elford should.  He knows exactly the kind & will send them up quickly.  I will pay for them out of the next money you make for me, rather than he should not have them.  I hope to hear tonight from you.   I hope you will mention all Mr. Jones falsehoods in your letters.  They ought to be known.  Yours truly. E.F.P.

I thought you were going to vote for Mr. Ashmore as Commissioner.
