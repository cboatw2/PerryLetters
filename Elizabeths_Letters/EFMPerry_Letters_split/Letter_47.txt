Letter 47

Friday morning.  I read your letter this morning in the Mountaineer.  My objection to it is that it is not long enough.  The invitation to Miss Earles wedding came this morning for us both.  It is to be a very large one.  You must be sure & write me by return Mail whether I leave home or not.  I will continue writing to you, so that you may hear my Mail.  When you return I will be a good wife.  If you had been brought up more among ladies, you would not think me as strange as you sometimes do.  I do not think you understand, or know how to treat the fair sex, but I will not scold you, for I love you dearly, never mind what you think of me.  

	You must write interesting letters for the Mountaineer, & tell the people all you [word obscured] would interest them. but I will not give you advice about what you know better than I do.  I expect with pleasure to hear from you tonight, though you letter may contain  [word obscured].  I am sorry when I think of the one you will receive from me.  You will be provoked at my dwelling so long on one subject.  I never will again.
