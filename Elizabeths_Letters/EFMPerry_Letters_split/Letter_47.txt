Letter 47

Tuesday night, 28 October 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	As I promised to write to you I must, & I write tonight, because tomorrow I am going to Mamma�s to help Susan work.  I was there part of yesterday & today.  You are perhaps uneasy about Willie.  All Sunday he complained of pain in his stomach, said he felt weak, & as if he would throw up.  At night I went for Dr. Earle.  Just before he came, Willie threw up some acid stuff.  It seemed to relieve him.  The Doctor said I must give him a dose of Castor Oil, & 10 drops of Laudanum.  It operated, & Willie was well enough Monday to go to school.  I dare say he will be better for that dose of Medicine.

	Sunday morning I went to the Methodist church.  In the afternoon I rode with the children to Mrs. Gibbs to inquire how Mr. Gibbs was.  He is very poorly, eats principally Custard.  At the Methodist church door, I saw the servant Ben who wishes you to purchase him.  He is a fine, pleasant looking servant.  I told him I wished to exchange James for him.  He said he would be very glad of it.  I mentioned to Mrs. Gibbs that I would like to change one boy for Ben.  She said James was good looking, but did not say whether she would like the exchange.  I asked Mr. Gibbs price for Ben.  She said 700, & I do not think that is high for so good a servant as he looks to be.  I should think he was under 20.  As for James I have no patience with him.  I will not rest until you have parted with him.  I have no comfort in his driving.  I intend to give up riding altogether.  He has not sense enough to be a good driver.  This afternoon he almost upset us.  He turned the carri[a]ge short, & carried us up a high bank. You must thank Providence your Wife & children are spared you, for you might have returned & sought for them in vain.  When we are on a good road we go at a snails pace, with every now & then a jerk forward which nearly throws us off of our seats, then when we come to a hill either up or down, we go at a gallop, & we are always at the side of the road half way down in a gully, or up on the bank, with the tree brushing or scratching the carri[a]ge.  Our carri[a]ge which has always been thought so easy, is now the most jolting concern I know of, so do you think I will lose anything in giving up riding.  The Springs I think must be injured from driving fast over bridges, gullys & stumps.  Last Sunday the carri[a]ge would not have been ready in time, if Jim had not been here to fix the horses, while James was dressing, & I had to go to the stable myself to call him to come & dress, & when dressed he was not fit to be seen, his coat collar turned inside, his shirt collar standing up & a dirty Jacket.  This Afternoon he drove us to the show.  I let him unharness the horses & go in.  When the show was over he was nowhere to be found.  Fortunately March was near, & he drove us home.  When we passed near Dr. R��s shop, there was James quietly standing up.  He is a perfect fool, & if you will keep him, he must be in your service & not mine.  I would rather have March as my wa[t]chman than him.  The carri[a]ge & horses are both beginning to look shockingly & I expect will last one twentieth the time, that they would have done with a good servant.

	We went to the Menagerie.  It is the poorest collection of animals I have ever seen, but still worth seeing, as all animals are.  So I advise you to go if they are in Anderson.  The Hippopotamus is stuffed, the snakes are quite small, a Monkey rides round on a pony, a little boy & man perform feats of agility & strength & some men dressed as negroes sing.  They perform again [page torn]  night [page torn]  if you had been here I would like to have gone.  I like all shows.  I now hear the music & wish I was there.  Everybody I may say was there this afternoon.

	Mr. Pringle went last night, & Mrs. Pringle goes Saturday.  She was here this afternoon after the show.  I drove up while she was in the house.  I was going to shop with Susan.  She said I must not get out, that she had come for a book, & would come again to see me.  I told her to go up in the Library & choose one.  I can tell you nothing of your farm, but hope all is going on well.  Neither Jim or Maria came in to go to the show.  Charles I met on Mamma�s road.  I gave him the money but do not think he went.  I expect he preferred keeping the money.  3 letters have come for you, one acknowledging the receipt of T. Butlers money, another from � Foster enclosing a note on a Richards, another from N. Carolina relating to Hodges.  I am ashamed of my shabby letter.  You must excuse it.  Your dear wife, Liz.
