Letter 70

Wednesday morning, 10 December [1845]
Greenville

My dear husband  

	I was not able to write you last night, & this morning I am so busy, I will be able to write you but a few lines.  Miss McBee�s party is this evening.  I am glad mine is put off, for it will take all this week to prepare for the cooking next week, & I think it would have been very strange to have had it just before your return.  I hope this evening to hear from you that Mr. Wells is pardoned, & to carry the good news with me to the party.  In the consultation with the Delegates last Saturday, I suppose the Governor decided what to do, & I can hardly think he has refused to pardon him.  If he has we must get up some stronger petitions, & all of us write to him, & even send a Committee to intercede with him.  Mr. Earle I should think would be here tonight.  I hope he has not had the fate of Mr. Wigfall, who I regret exceedingly to here [hear] has been beaten by Mr. Black.  I suppose it is dreadful to be opposed by a Black.  They get everything they wish.

	The fruit & nuts arrived last Monday, & in good order.  It will be quite an accession to my supper.  Mr. Luther McBee had promised me two pigs.  He finds he has none young enough, so instead has sent me�pounds of Flour.  I am going to fatten two of yours, & also two Turkeys.  Vardry McBee & Mrs. Alexander sister in law of Mrs. McBee�s arrived yesterday from N. Carolina.  Mrs. Alexander is a sister of Mr. Clark in Columbia, who is the step father of Miss Scott.  Vardry McBee & her son were at Mamma�s last night.  Alexander McBee has been there twice, which is something wonderful for him.   I think they seem a fine family, & I begin to like Mr. Luther very much.  Last Sunday afternoon Susan & myself rode by to Mrs. McBee�s & we did not get out.  We only went to ask a question.  Old Mr. McBee came to the carri[a]ge.  He looked smiling & pleased.  He said he must have an introduction, for he did not know us apart.  I told him I was his daughter in law, so he shook hands with me & said �howdy do Susan�, I am glad to see you, & Miss Malinda said he would have kissed me, if I had been nearer.  Afterwards Susan told him, that she was the one.

	We are quite well.  Maria is a great deal better, getting well.  We will all be glad to see you, next Wednesday.  I believe I have told you all you are to get.  Two presents for Susan, for you & me to give her, a present for Ann, Knife for Willie, Drum & Whip for Frank.  He speaks often of his Drum & Ip, & anything you choose for Anna.  I will write but once more to you & hear three times more from you.  

	I must now close my letter.  There is no news to write about.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
