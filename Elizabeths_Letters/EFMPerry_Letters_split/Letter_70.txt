Letter 70

Sunday afternoon, 22 November 1846
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have but a few moments to write to you.  I have not heard from you yet, & would have been�hearing an accident had happened to the Rail Road Cars, Sunday, but this morning saw your name mentioned in the paper as having presented some petition in the Legislature, so I know you must have arrived safely.  I have no conveniences for writing, & have but this one blotted sheet, perhaps not for a week to come to write on, so you may expect to hear from me very seldom.  Monday I dined at Aunt Haynes, & spent a very pleasant day.  Last night I took tea at Mrs. Henry Pinckney�s.  There were about 30 persons there.  It was quite pleasant.  Mr. Pinckney said he saw you at the City Hall, & tried to speak to you but it was so crowded, he could not get near enough to shake hands.  I was also invited to Mrs. Ancrums, but I was engaged to Mrs. Pinckney�s.  Tonight I was invited to take tea at the Elliotts , but it is so cold & the wind blowing so high, that I have excused myself.  Tomorrow I am to dine at Aunt Brewtons.  My present plan is to stay here about 2 weeks, then go to Columbia & stay 2 days, & then return to Greenville unless E� goes to her brother Isaac, & Aunt Eliza asks me to stay with her, & then I will stay longer in Charleston.  I sent a message to Miss Rodgers, & wished I could have gone to have seen her but it was out of my power, she stayed so far up.  She was to leave today.  I have been at a great deal more expense as regards clothing than I expected to.  Charleston is now so fashionable a place, that coming from the country, one has to brush up a good deal.  I will never come again except with a plenty of money, & as that perhaps will never be the case, I hardly think I will see Charleston again.  I am sure my dear husband you have been very liberal to me, when you were so straightened & I am much indebted to you.  The children are quite well.  Willie behaves the worst of all.  He is a boy that does not care what is thought of him, so he behaves just as badly among strangers as he does at home, but I hope he will improve.  The weather is now very disagreeable, cold & windy.  I have written to Mamma but once.  It is only when I am perfectly at leisure, that I can write with care, & I have been obliged to shop every day, which is very fatiguing.  Aunt Anna has made me comfortable, but I would have enjoyed myself much more at Aunt Eliza�s, for she possesses a spirit congenial with my own, & if ever I come again, I will stay with her.  Still Aunt Anna has been quite kind, & I do not feel as if I was imposing on her.  I am now writing in the same room with my Aunts, & the children running about shaking the table, so I hardly know what I am writing.  You must be careful how you express yourself in peices to be published.  Today I read your Rail Road speech, & you said in it, that the best part of the population emigrated & left behind the paupers & drones.  You ought to be very careful [page torn]�dieu now my dear husband.  It is getting [word obscured; page torn].  I have written in a great hurry [word obscured] not know when I can write again.  Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P.

I told Willie what I had written about him.  He says I must rub it out.  I told him I would let it stay in, but tell you he was going to be a good boy.
