Letter 45

Tuesday night, 17 June 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I met Genl Thompson on the road yesterday as I was walking to Mamma�s, & he asked me what message he should give you at Pickens, if he should say we were all well.  I told him perhaps I would write a few lines, & he said he would call for them tomorrow.  The children are gone up to bed, & instead of passing the evening, reading or working, I will converse with you, & you must promise not to scold me once.  

	Sunday morning Susan & myself went to church.  Mr. Pinckney preached on the subject of building a new church.  He gave all the reasons why it was necessary, & answered all objections that could be made against it.  The sermon was so satisfactory, that many who objected before are reconciled now.  He regretted you were not there to hear it.  The reasons in favour are too many for me to mention in a letter.  I will let you know them all when you return.  I will only inform you of a few now. It is a fact that the sleepers under the floor are decaying, some have already given way, & that part of the church would have to be repaired at an expense of several hundred dollars,  The church would not be enlarged for cutting away the wall, would make it unsafe.  More pews are needed, for persons have applied for pews, & not been able to obtain them.  The Society in Charleston which has given one half of the salary to our Minister, been assisting for 20 years & in that time given 5000 dollars has informed the Vestry, that it must now withdraw its assistance, appropriate it to build up other churches.  This year they have decreased the sum one fourth, & will continue gradually to lessen it, until they stop entirely. The support of the Minister will then devolve on 30 pew holders, & they will consequently have to pay more than they do at present.  It is therefore important that there should be more pews, so that the support of the Minister, should fall upon many.  This last I think the strongest reason, but there are others too numerous to mention.  Yesterday Mr. Pinckney, Mr. Cox, Dr. Irvine went about obtaining subscriptions, & Mr. Sutter, Mr. Bee�himself among the young men.  Persons have been uncommonly liberal even those badly off have given.  1600 dollars have been subscribed.  The work goes on prosperously.  I have heard of but one person who objected to it, the bearer of this letter, but he does not know the motives for undertaking it, neither do you, so you must not say anything against it.  Mr. Pinckney came to me for your subscription, thinking you had told me how much you would give.  I told him you had not said what sum, but that you would give something, & if he thought it not proper in me, & not taking too great a liberty with you, I would put down for you what I thought you would be willing to give.  He said yes certainly I must put it down, so I did, & he said it was the sum all expected from you.  It was however on the condition that you were not bound to pay it, as it was done without your knowledge.  He said there was no danger of that, that you were a gentleman of taste, & would contribute towards raising a beautiful building, such an ornament to the village, even if you had no higher motive.  I am afraid you may be displeased at what I have done, & I have been rather uneasy at my boldness, but Mrs. Poinsett this afternoon said I was perfectly right, & she would have done the same.  The money is not to be paid for some time, & I intend to save out of the 5 dollars you allow me every week, so when the time comes to pay the money I will be able to assist you.  You have no curiosity so you will not care to know, how much I subscribed for you until you come home.  I have dwelt so long on the church, I will not be able to tell you all I had to say on other matters.  Sunday morning stupid James sat down by one of the horses in the stable.  I rather think under it, & had a finger mashed by the horses foot, so that the nail has or will come off.  I suppose he was asleep.  I almost thought he must have done it on purpose to keep from working.  I was afraid he would not be able to plough, but from Jims not asking for Mary today, who I told him he might have, I suppose he has been able to.  John drove the horses Sunday quite well.  Jim came home early Monday morning in a good humour.  Perhaps it will be better for his wife to live at the farm.  It will be a treat to him to go to see her, & he will be grateful to you for allowing him the privilege.  Yesterday I paid 6 visits.  Mrs. Irvine, Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Dubose, Mrs. Crawford, Mrs. Wm Roberts, & Miss Crittenden.  In the afternoon I walked to Mamma�s with the children, & Susan came back with me part of the way.  This morning I paid 6 more to Miss Lynah, Mrs. Mauldin, Mrs. Wells, Mrs. Theodore Thompson, Mrs. Bradshaw, & Mrs. Baker.  I was congratulating myself at the prospect of getting through & lo! 3 have been returned alteady.  One I paid yesterday was returned today, Miss Crawford.  Col. Lynah this morning inquired after you.  I told him you were away, & you would have gone over with me to see him.  I thought I might say so without fibbing, for of course after his coming to your house last summer, you would call to see him this.  They left Mr. Roper at the point of death with country fever, & Mrs. Andrew Turnbull with the inflammation of the Bowels.  You saw her at Aunt Turnbulls & was pleased with her.  Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett called this afternoon & were quite pleasant.  I like them so much.  Nobody knows there is Court at Anderson.  I don�t believe the Lawyers wives (with a few exceptions.)  Minerva I let go to Mamma�s today, to make another trial at cooking, & will continue to do so, until you return.  I suppose tonight you are at Pendleton.  I have scarcely room to inquire after my little Willie.  Tell him I hope he has been a good boy & given you no trouble; that Mrs. Mauldin thinks of naming her baby Willie or Frank, & little Mary says she must name it Willie Perry.  Anna & Frank went to see it this afternoon.  I kissed it this morning, & Mrs. Mauldin said I was the first person who had, that it was so ugly no one would.  It is a large child, weighed 11 pounds when it was born.  Tell Willie the kitten is very playful, that his chicken is well & takes care of Anna�s chicken.  They are always together & seem so fond of each other.  Frank begins to talk.  He is so smart & interesting.  Sunday he was at the window & John passed on horseback towards the stable.  Anna said there goes Uncle John.  I asked if he was on a horse, & Frank called out; Skylark, Skylark.  Today I was in the Library writing a note to Susan & Frank was playing with a half a dollar of hers.  When I had finished writing I left the Library & went to my room.  After a while I thought of the half a dollar.  I took Frank back into the Library & told him to find the money.  He instantly went to a book that was loose at the back where he had slipped the money down & showed it to me.  This morning his tea was hot, & he said to Lindy blow, blow.  As you rode off Sunday he said, �I want go.�  Anna & himself behave quite well, so I hope Willie will too when he comes back.  Mr. Hoke has returned.  Hooker this� he might eventually  live in N.C. but he believed not at present.  Mrs. Stone last Sunday said Tom Butler was going to write to Richard Stone to come up to be a candidate for Sheriff, as it was thought Mr. Hoke would resign.  He had better not be so quick, but wait till he actually does.  I would be sorry for Mr. Hoke to move away & hope he will not.  No more Balloons have been sent up.  Hooker said he heard it fell in our yard, & he believed the Council had talked about it, & determined to allow no more to ascend.  Good night.  I hope you will be pleased to hear from me.  Except salt, I have not bought anything since you left.  10 oclock, E.F.P.

The church last Sunday was crowded, more so than I have ever seen it & Mr. D�mion preached the best sermon I have heard from him
