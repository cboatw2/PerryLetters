Letter 45

Monday morning.  I will write a few lines today.  I this morning received an invitation from Mrs. Earle to her daughters wedding, which takes place next Tuesday evening.  Mrs. & Miss Jones have just been to see me, & Miss Pinckney has paid me a visit who I like so much.  I am so sorry they are to leave Greenville.  They will go early in January.  After having several rainy days, the sun is shining most delightfully.  I hope to be gladdened by a letter from you tonight.  You must write me all the news.  Ever yours, Liz
