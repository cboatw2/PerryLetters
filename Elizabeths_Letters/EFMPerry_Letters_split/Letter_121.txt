Letter 121

Friday morning, 30 June 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will write you a few lines to inform you of all that has happened since you left, to prevent your being uneasy & hurrying back sooner than you ought, & when you hear all, you will find you could not be from home at a better time than now.  Frances left yesterday, & she had scarcely gone, when Minerva was taken sick, & in a short time was delivered of a girl, & both doing well.  She will now be up when Frances returns in a month.  Mamma Susan & Mr. Arthur dined with us Wednesday & with�assistance I was able to prepare a nice dinner.  Delia was sick all day.  What with her sickness, the company, the ironing has been so retarded, that scarce any is done, & now Minerva confined.  I expect to live comfortably for a long time, as I have been living ever since Mary�s sickness.  So I advise you to take this opportunity & do all the Electioneering that is to be done between this & October.  You will fare better anywhere than at home, for with Delia sick & at the same time our cook we will necessarily live economically, & it will be a convenient necessity.  Money is universally scarce.  Mr. Sharpe said he heard a merchant say, he did not believe there was 50 dollars in Greenville.  You had better bring back some money from Laurens.  I dare say if you try you will get interest money, or from someone that owes you.  If you can pay the money you have to without borrowing I will be so glad.  I never wish to go into debt.  You saw Mrs. H� with me.  She  came to beg a great favor, that I would lend her four dollars, to pay a debt, but I had neither inclination or power to�her going into debt, for the purpose of getting out of debt.  Before she left, Mrs. Walker came, with a subscription for the organ headed with her name 5 dollars, & she wished mine placed next.  I told her I had put down 100 for the church which I ought not to have done in your absence, & I was not going to contract any more debts.  She said if anyone gave for the church, you ought to,  for you were the first Lawyer here, & had a most extreme�.  She forgot that she once said, no Lawyer made enough here to clothe his Wife.  She was quite vexed, & said she had done so much for the church, her work would amount to 100 dollars, but that everyone must do as they chose, & I told her I thought so too.  The next time I will ask her how much she has�for the church.  Little did I think we would have so much cause to regret her joining our church.  If it was not for her, the church would remain just as it is, which it ought to until they have enough money to build a new one.  After she left Mrs. Tom Lowndes stopped to leave a bundle for Mamma, & begged me to go to the Working Society where she was bound, & said I must go & see her.  I told her I would go to the Society when I could, but that time will be very far off.  Yesterday Susan & her children dined here.  In the afternoon we set off to go to Mrs. Stones, but it rained, & we had to turn back.  It poured, & today Jim says the ground is too wet to plough, so this afternoon if it does not rain we will go, & then I will not take the carri[a]ge until the�is finished.  Willie went to the Methodist Fair, but he said he wished himself at home.  He was obliged to stay until after 11 until Frank Hoke came away.  I was uneasy & sent for him, but he was then on his way home.  I expect very little was made, but I have not heard.  I write to you my dear husband, though you did not request it, but I think if you hear that all at home are well, you will stay away with more comfort.  Otherwise you might come home sooner than you ought, merely to see how things are going on.  I wish your mine to be at ease respecting home.  I hope to hear from you this evening.  You must do all you can for yourself.  The time is approaching, & I tremble at the result.  I hope & trust that you will be successful;  you deserve it, but merit does not always bring its reward.  Art, intrigue, vanity & deceit, often triumph. Therefore it behooves you to do all that is honorable to ensure success, & I think as yet you have done but little, & but little time remains.  New questions have been started.  You must try & see your way clear before you.  If you can you must see my friend Mr. Barksdale & the other brothers that you have not been to see yet.  I see all the communications you wrote for the Herald about Burnley & Johnson, in this mornings Mountaineer.  I hear Mr. Croft is to be married tonight.  I hardly think he would choose Friday, & Caroline Earle next month to Mr. Mills.  You ought to be thankful that your property is gradually increasing as you have now an additional negro.  Minerva[�s] children do not interfere with her work, as Mary�s baby did.  Frances came just at the right time,  She will stay one night when she returns.  I would like very much to go to Pendleton this summer, stay at Mrs. Heywards.  I always prefer boarding to a private house, (except Mrs. Cunninghams), but Frances pressed me to stay with her & said you may but the persons I like most Mrs. M� for instance, she seems to have little to do with, never seen Mrs. Burt even.  The village is very quiet.  Susan said she heard Mr. N� was going to stay six months in Stewarts store N. York.    You affectionate wife in haste, E.F.P.
