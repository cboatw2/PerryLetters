Letter 202

Monday morning, 26 April 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	Except to let you know we are well my letters can afford you very little interest, for I have nothing to write you about.  Today the Convention meets.  I hope you will have a pleasant time, that no unpleasant excitement or difficulty of any kind will occur.  Write me how long you will remain in Columbia, for I have a box in Charleston which I will wish sent to you, if it is ready in time.  I do not wish it sent after you leave, so as soon as you can ascertain let me know.


	Tell Willie I am glad he is with you, & hope he will return improved, & behave like a gentleman & set a good example to his brothers & sisters & not quarrel with them

	Yesterday was a fine day; today it is cloudy & looks like rain.

	I get along pleasantly in my household now cleaning is away, & it is a satisfaction as each week passes away to know that a few dollars have been added to your little income, & that the increase has been added without our denying ourselves, so it is a clean gain.  I do not think you will ever know what I suffered while under Minervas dominion.  If ever I wish[ed] you punished I will wish you in that situation.  Frank has just come from the Office & brought a pardon from the Governor for Mr. Nash for as much as relates to the imprisonment.  I have sent him to the Goal with Mr. Beaufort Watts letter, & will send the Pardon to Mr. McDaniel or Mr. Hoke.  Mr. Nash has just sent to know if he can come [word faded] of Goal just as soon as he wants to, & I have sent word just as soon as I have sent him the pardon.  I suppose he will go immediately to his family & surprise them.

	A letter came from Mr. Willis Brown asking your influence in electing him Treasurer of the Upper Division.  He says he is encouraged to ask your aid on account of your friendship for his deceased brother John G. Brown, together with himself, that it is only necessity  [that] induces him to apply for the Office.  The letter is dated Spring Grove, Laurens.  Says in his old age he is left with a helpless family to provide for, & except the assistance he receives from his son M.L. Brown of Columbia, they are dependant upon his individual exertions.  He writes early, before other applications are made to you.  A letter came desiring the Patriot to be sent to a different Post office.  I will send it to Mr. Elford.  The Metropolitan the newspaper sent to me came.  This is all.

	It is now raining.  I have no news to tell.  We are all well.  When I hear from you I will have more to write about.

	Mr. McDaniel has just come & taken the pardon so you see since I commenced writing a good deal has taken place.

	I hope to hear tomorrow this time from you.  Give my love to Willie.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I received a letter a few hours ago & for fear of being prevented answering if I postpone to later in the day, will answer it now.  I was very glad to hear from you, to know you had arrived safely, & met with no disagreeable incident.  The Patriot I am gratified to hear is noticed, & its Editorials made of importance.  If I were a member of the Convention, I would propose the State should leave the Union, & remain out of the Union forever, the Secessionists remain in her, & henceforth remain devoted to her, & her only.  The Union men remove to some other State where they can have peace & quiet, their principle be appreciated, & themselves have an equal share of honors & office with their fellow citizens.  South Carolina will be no loss to the Union, but a good riddance, & she & her selfish & vainglorious sons.  The Union can go on prosperously without her, & she has abused it so long, it is time now she should leave it.  I am glad Willie is satisfied & hope he is enjoying himself.  Tell him though he will not be here May day to participate in its pleasures.  He will be represented by his second self Hocky.  Frank Hoke has asked Frank to let Rudd have Hocky to ride on May day, as he is one of the Marshall[s], & I have given my consent, that if he is alive then, for being now under the sole care of Reuben the Horse killer, I am under daily apprehension of some morning hearing the news, �Hocky is in the stable lying down & cannot get up.�  Reuben has a mysterious way of getting rid of all our horses.  Charles says he killed 7 pair of Mrs. Harrisons.  So I am forgetting next Spring, new carri[a]ge, new horses, a new Coachman , all at the same time.

	Yesterday I wrote you word that we were all well.  A few hours later, I would have written, there are three of your family sick, for at night Mary came from the Spring complaining of pain in her chest, Charlotte pain in her stomach, & this morning Minerva came from the Mansion house with pain in her head.  Charlotte I gave a dose of oil to, & she is now well.  Mary is so useful, I dread her being sick, & for fear of Pneumonia which is so fatal, I sent her at once to Dr. Dean�s & he gave her some pills, & said he thought the pain proceeded from her liver.  This morning I gave her Castor oil, & when the medicine has effect she will I think be better.  She is at her work, says the  pain is not as bad as it was.  Her habits being so irregular, & she so careless about herself, I expect is what makes her so often unwell.  Minerva had taken medicine from Mrs. Irwin before she came over, & is now in her room.  I am sorry whenever I see her come in the yard.  I never intend to have her as my servant again, if I can help it.  I went in to see her & found her the same impudent creature still.  I left her room in thankfulness that she was sewing others & not myself.  Your wife & children are at any rate well, & I hope will continue so.  Frank commences school tomorrow.

	Mr. Ward came yesterday to see you.  Mr. Hoke came over Saturday morning, thought you were not to leave until Saturday night.  He had Mrs. Blassingame�s marriage settlement, which had been sent him from Columbia, & he did not know what to do with it.  This morning your letter, the Lady�s book, & the Southern Review were all that came from the Post office.  I wish at Newberry you had seen Mr. Williams, & he had performed his promise.  Be economical, recollect this time next Spring, I will be with you on my way to Charleston, to buy new Carri[a]ge, & many necessaries we need, & you must save now for that purpose, & some summer before I get old, I do wish to go to New Haven, & look once again at places I will never forget.  If I were rich, I would wish for us all to go & end our days there.  I have no love for Carolina, where you will never meet with your reward.  You labour you save the State, others know it in their hearts, & are ever glad of it, but they give you publicly no credit for, & as for honoring you with Office & Distinction, they never dream of it, but to the end of your days, will heap abuse on you, & stigmatize you as a Submissionist, a term that at once excludes you from honor, & this is their object in applying  it.  They are thankful to you for being a Submissionist, & yet try to disgrace you  by the Epithet.

	You must not forget to see old Mr. Hearn.  Dr. Irvine must indeed have been anxious to be elected as he had determined to go to Columbia.  He would like to have been honored as a Delegate, & had his expenses paid.  I suppose he will expect great attention from the Governor, in return for his hospitality, selfish hospitality truly.  

	Hext looks well, & I believe does not miss you at all, & yet will be delighted to see you.  If it were not for him I would have been in Columbia with you,  Old Mr. Miller was here this morning, inquired about the Convention that the Leaders who boasted of State Right were State Wrong, that Mr. Hunter had not gone to the Convention when now was the time for him to benefit the people.  He was electioneering for Clerk, & he hoped he would be beaten.  He mentioned your�about Genl Wallace.  He is a sensible old man.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
