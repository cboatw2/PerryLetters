Letter 150

Wednesday morning, December 12, 1849
Greenville

Dear Willie

		As I answered your Papa�s letter by the last Mail, I will now answer yours.  I was very much pleased with both of your letters & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself.  Anna thanks you for thinking of her when you saw the birds.  It showed you loved her, & though absent, had not forgotten her.  Fanny was very much pleased at your message.  Almost every day, she says she wants Billy to come home.  Anna this morning before breakfast wrote a letter to Aunt Mary Hayne, told her you were going to bring her some birds, & asked her to write & tell her, how to take care of them & when she must make nests for them to lay the Eggs in.  I hope the Cage is pretty.  I have seen very pretty wire ones painted green.  Fanny Townes wrote a note to Anna yesterday to ask her to get her Slate & pen from school, so Anna has gone to get them & to carry Mr. Bradshaw a book mark she worked with �Think of me� on it.  Fanny said  to go too, so I suggested she go warm & she has gone too.  Frank reads quite well now, & is very fond of it.  If he had gone to school to Mr. Burnham for the past year, he would have improved a great deal.  He even learned to write on the Slate, & wrote so well, Mr. Burnham told me he did not believe he made the letters himself.  Mr. Burnham has gone away now, & Mr. Bradshaw has broken up school, & is going away next week.  This is the coldest day we have had.  The Thermometer when I came down this morning was at 24, 6 degrees below freezing point.  It continues cold.  Reuben & Charles are killing the 4 remaining hogs.  Frank read his lesson & then ran out to see them.  If you were here, you would be with them too.  How much better it is to believe you are improving I hope in every respect.  I am glad the hogs are killed, so our Corn may be saved, but you will miss Sausage meat when you come back.  I suppose you have plenty of Sausages in Columbia.  When Papa comes back he must send for some Buckwheat Flour, & then you will have Buckwheat cakes which you like so much.  Frank soon after he had his ball worked to make a hole in it.  I told him not to.  One day he brought it from school with a hole he said the boys made while throwing it.  He would fill the ball with water & squeeze it out, & in so doing has made the hole so large that he has ruined the ball. So you had better bring him one, or he will be borrowing yours.  I hope to get letters tonight from Papa & yourself.  Anna says you must write to her, & then she will write to you.  She has worked a pretty pincushion, or little ottoman she may call it.  I made it up for her, & it will astonish her Papa as much as her letter.  She has been so busy at it, she has been quite happy, for she is always happy when she is employed.  I am wondering who will be her Teacher.  Mr. Stuart ought not to have acted as he has done, for the Teacher the Trustees would have got when they selected him, are now engaged to other places.  Dr. Simons taught you nothing at all.  Frank would have learnt so much more at the other school.  The money spent on you was thrown away.  You must write me the name of the books you have bought.  I think you have enough.  Frank has no cap to wear to church.  You must buy him whatever kind the boys wear.  You are well supplied with clothes.  I have only been to church once since you left.  The two last Sundays, the weather has been bad.  You must tell Papa he must not forget to interest himself in getting a place in the Military Academy for Mr. Markley�s son.  He is one of a large family, & entitled to a place there.  Perhaps one of these days you will be going to school in that place.  I have seen no little boys since you left & do not know how they are spending the holidays.  Last night the boys gave a party to the girls.  It was so cold I hardly think many went.  I had no thought of Anna�s going.  Last week the young men gave one to the Beachams.  Your Grandmama is very much pleased you behave so well in Columbia.  She gave me some small change to keep for you, & it was money left from what she gave me to buy butter for her.  Vardry fell on a kettle or over I do not know which in the kitchen, & burnt his hand very badly.  About the same time, at night when Fanny was undressing to go to bed & was standing before the fire, a spark popped out, & burnt her behind her ear.  It must have rested on the collar of her night dress.  It was only a little burn, & is now quite well.  Fanny is still very lively & affectionate.  She sleeps with me at night, & she hugs me, & if I turn away, she says �turn over Ma.�  Anna & Fanny have come back now.  They are making so much noise, I must finish my letter to you, & will write a few lines on the other side to Papa.  Mr. Bradshaw (Anna says,) is selling his furniture today.  The two oldest boys are to stay with Mr. Erwin to go to school to him.  Mr. Keith told me he offered to bring you home, but you preferred staying until you Papa came.  Fanny says I must tell you howdy.  Anna that you must write.  Frank is not here to send any message.  So Good bye,  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

My dear husband, As I had nothing particular to write to you today, I thought it best to answer Willie�s letter.  I will now however express a few thoughts to you.  I saw the Courier last night.  I approve of your recommendation about the Penitentiary.  The other motion you made partly I approve.  The election of Commissioner in Equity ought to be given to the people, but the Attorney General, Solicitor, Controller &c ought to be left as it is.  I suppose by this time you have spoken on the Bank.  I hope you did credit to yourself, acquitted yourself better than Mr. Reed.  Have you done anything for Mr. Markley�s son?  You must not forget him.  I hope your prospects as regards the Executive & the Bank are progressing, now that Law is�, you ought to think of something else.  You must do something in advancing your own interests, not�leave it to friends, & I hope you will tell me your prospects are good, for one or the other of these offices.  I think if your name was only suggested for the future Governor, it would take immediately, for you are respected throughout the State.  So if you are not elected to the Bank. You must think of the other.  You can have a partner here to attend to your business for [word obscured].  My directions about getting me a bonnet are not a joke.  10 dollars was what I allowed you for the Shawl, & as you only gave 4 dollars, the remaining 6 spend for me in a suitable winter bonnet.  You have much good taste.  Whatever you get will be pretty, & it gives me pleasure to wear anything you buy.  These are the only things I care to buy this winter.  I do not expect to buy a dress.  What I have I will make do.  When I tell you to buy me anything, it is always of course meaning if you have the money.  If you had the money I would like a dress too but I know you have not.  From your being able to do all you have done, you mst have been supplied from some source I know not of.

		We are all well.  The weather is very cold.  We have fine weather for our meat.  I wrote Willie all I could think of, having received no letter since I last wrote.  I have less than usual to write about.  Your letters give me great pleasure.  If it were not for the cold I would like to be with you.  I am really glad Willie does so well.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
