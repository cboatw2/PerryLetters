Letter 143

Sunday night, 2 December 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just finished reading Willie�s letter; yours to me, & yours to Mr. Wells, the letter Mr. Wells I am sure will think entirely too long.  It is now 8 oclock, too late to commence writing, but I am more at leisure now, than I will be tomorrow.  Tell Willie his letter is a very pretty one, & I value it, because it was written entirely by himself.  You must make him write me a little every day, telling all that he has seen & done, & in this way, have a long letter to send me by each Mail, & your must also write, for never mind how much business you have in the day, at night before retiring to bed, you can write me a letter, you write so quickly.  I look forward anxiously to the arrival of this Mail, & you cannot imagine my disappointment, if I do not have.  I was very much provoked Friday night when Mrs. Irvine�me my letter.  Dr. Irvine had written to tell her where it was.  The reason of my writing by him was this.  As I had written by Mr. Elford, I did not intend writing by the next Mail, which would arrive on the evening after him, but I heard some news about Mr. Jones which worried me, & to relieve my mind, I wished instantly to impart it to you.  The Mail had closed so I sent to the Stage Office to inquire who was going.  They sent word Dr. Irvine & Mrs. Anna Williams, so I sent my letter to Dr. Irvine.  I will send it along with this one.  I have not read it over, but I wish you to know why I wrote about Mr. Jones, which will explain what I alluded to  in my next letter.  I was sorry & provoked at what you told me of Isaac Hayne as it showed such a mean spirit.  He no doubt has not got over the prejudice he contracted against you  during political times, though self interest made him forget it last winter, & though you have married into the Hayne family, his branch is not nearly connected with ours, & it was only our being brought up with his Sisters that made us intimate.  He is a Stranger to me, & therefore he feels no interest, (though perhaps he ought to) in you on my account; & I must say that all of Uncle Haynes first children as they have grown up & settled in life, have proved themselves utterly  selfish & ungrateful & indifferent to all but themselves & families.  They were indebted to Mamma for a home, when they needed one, & no one else offered.  Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor & ourselves were like Sisters, but now the only times I have seen them for years, they have been so cold & selfish & indifferent, that I have lost all respect for them, & would expect more from a Stranger than from them.  Isaac Hayne I suppose is just like them, & he can hardly have lived with his Wife without having contracted her bad qualities.  She is proud, sarcastic, selfish in the extreme, the spoiled favorite of her Mother, & never regarded anyone of importance but herself, & now only those nearly connected with her.  But in spite of all of this, I was going to say, that perhaps your manner towards Isaac Hayne was not cordial, & he may have perceived it, & made his less so, for you have though unconscious to yourself, often a cold forbidding manner, not sociable enough, & you know in your Elections your manner has always been objected to , & has made you enemies.  I am glad in your last letter, that you say Mr. Haynes manner is more cordial, for if possible, I wish you to be friends, & persons often dislike one another from not knowing each other personally, & if they would be�to be familiar & pleasant towards each other, would respect & like each other, so do you in your manner be cordial when you meet.  You can soon see whether he reciprocates.  What you mentioned about your being thought of as Governor, I know you meant only as a joke.  I am certain the legislature would give you any Office you applied for, & though you are not lowered in my opinion by your late defeat, in the eyes of others you are.  A defeated man seems like a fallen man, until he is elected to some equally honorable station as the one he strived for.  So I say my dear husband, let your friends or do you get some friend to bring your name forward for Governor.  The Upper Country ought to have the next one, & if you come forward in time, you will be sure to be elected, & then I will be reconciled to my late great disappointment, but until you succeed  in gaining some distinction of this kind, I never will get over it.  I am surprised at so many Upper Country members going for the Bank.  I thought you had the popular view, & felt easy.  I am afraid now you are on the unpopular; not that I wish you to change, but I had felt so�on the subject, thinking the Majority were with you.  I am sorry you have so little money.  You ought not to have changed your pencil, & given with an exorbitant boot, for your pencil was a superior one.  You ought to have given it to me, & changed mine.  After getting me something warm, only get some Cocoa nut cakes for the children, that will please them as much as anything.  Toys they instantly break.  I will send by this Mail a letter Anna wrote you this morning, her first letter & she is just 8.  From the way she holds her pen & forms her letters, I can tell that she has been carelessly instructed in writing.  Indeed the Academys have had poor Teachers.  I am so vexed with Dr. Simons.  I wish he would be�, does not you quick sense tell you that Mr. Stuart has seen his extravagant puff, & it is this that has made his resign.  He is a gentleman & does not wish to be involved in squabbles with opposition schools.  You know he said that he would not apply for the Academy, if Mr. Bradshaw intended remaining & setting up a school in opposition.  His wifes health is only an excuse.  It was expressly on account of health he was coming here.  I would not be surprised if Dr. Simons in his mean]n]ess had written to tell him, he himself expected to have a flourishing school.  I am sure he has injured Greenville enough already, deprived the Academy of a fine Teacher, & the Church of a delightful Organist.  I anticipated much pleasure hearing Mrs. Stuart play.  I wish you to write to him, & persuade him to accept. If his Wife is in bad health, Greenville is the very place to come to.  You may be sure that is not the reason at all.  Dr.  Simons is.  You know what Machivelli says.  It has been raining all day & I was afraid it was getting too warm for our meat, but it is now getting very cold.  The Shelter for the Cows fell down yesterday, & for fear the Stable might follow suit, Reuben at present has our horses in Mr. Goodletts Stable.  They are locked up carefully.  In this wet weather, he says there is more danger of the Stable falling than in dry.  Jim was here last night, &�he did not know where his Wife was staying, said he knew what had occurred between them, & it was best for him to keep away.  He says Mr. Rosemond will have some large jobs next year, & he thinks finds him so useful, will give good wages for him  I think he will for Jim is a good carpenter & must be great help.  I have been reading today Lectures on Bunyan & the Pilgrims Progress, lent me by Mrs. Pearson, a very good work, though severe against Churchmen.  It is written I think by a Presbyterian.  Bunyan was an open Communion Baptist, & was imprisoned 12 years during Charles 2d reign on account of his non conformity to the established Church, & in prison wrote the Pilgrims Progress.  I have read also to Anna & Frank, & Fanny took up a book & thought she was reading too.  She is the smartest & most interesting child I ever saw.  Tell Willie I am very much pleased at his letter, & would write to him by this Mail, if it was not that 3 letters are ready to go.  Do send me your letters to read first, that are written for the Mountaineer.  I enjoy them more, than when I see them in the paper.  The last paper I have not even sent for, but will tomorrow, when I send your letter.  You must write good letters, & not get into trouble by them.  The one tonight I liked, but I think you might have condensed it more.  You must think of some honor to gain from the Legislature.  In Mr. Calhouns Congressional District I am afraid you can never gain anything.  I [am] thankful at any rate you are in the Legislature, some field for your talents. I see Mr. Whitt� compliments you.  You must subscribe for his Wifes poetry.  You must continue in the Legislature if you cannot do anything more, but you must think of being Governor.
