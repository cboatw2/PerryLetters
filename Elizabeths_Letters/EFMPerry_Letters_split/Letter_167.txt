Letter 167

Tuesday night, 3 December 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received your letter today, written last Saturday.  I was very glad to hear from you.  The next winter when you go to Columbia you must leave the children at home, & carry me instead.  I hope you spent a pleasant day at Col. O�Hanlons, but would rather if possible, you should have gone to church, & spent fast day with�.  I think it very hypocritical to appoint a fast day, to pray to the Almighty to help out of difficulties, that the State has brought on herself & wishes to bring.  I for one cannot help it.  I see in your resolutions you speak of the aggressions of the North.  I have always argued that the North has not aggressed, but on the contrary as Judge Nesbit said, done more for the South lately than she has done for the last fourteen years, that California had a right to exclude Slavery, & Congress a right to admit her a State, that the Wilmot Proviso had been abandoned.  The Fugitive Slave law passed, & Slavery trade being abolished in the District of Columbia was what many Southerners approved of, & I thought you argued in the same way, so where are the aggressions of the North?  Mr. Clemens says many Southerners voted for the admission of California.  The Southern States that are satisfied ought not to be made to take a part even in a Southern Convention.  If they are satisfied, let them remain so.  South Carolina only thinks herself ill treated, so let her fight it out herself, so I hope she will get well beat, & be taught a lesson she will never forget, only you, have not helped to bring on the difficulty, shall not help them out of it.  Dr. Crook & Col. Town[e]s & others may be the first to fight.  Mr. Memminger has done more than anyone to bring on the difficulty, & wishes it & then appoints a fast Day to pray for help & direction &c.  You have not mentioned Mr. B�ly.  He seemed so friendly to you.  I suppose you will see him, unless Politics may have made a change in his feelings.  I am glad Dr. Lieber & Mr. Williams are Union men.  I can sympathize with Dr. Liebers finding it a treat to have one like you to talk to, for I find it a treat to go to see the Miss Andersons, who are warm for the Union.  You must interest yourself in getting subscribers for the Southern Patriot.  I hope Mr. Frederick Ford has been elected & that you voted for him, for he is needy.  I see in the paper, the first ballot he was 2 votes behind.

		In the legislature they seem to be getting warm, from their resolutions I suppose it is all for effect.  It is strange after Mr. Memminger changed his Politics to be made Chancellor, that he should decline running.  I suppose of course he would  have been elected.  If you find there is a prospect of your being elected, you must try your chance.  You ought to let your friends electioneer for you, & inform you, what they think.

		You must be on your guard against Pickpockets, even if you have but little in your pocket.  I yesterday paid Mr. Payne�s beef bill, & today Mr. Randolph sent his, but I declined paying it.  I have bought Tea & Turkeys & do not wish to be quite out of funds so I leave it for you to pay; so recollect you will need money when you come home.  Willie mentioned you have bought me a pencil & pen, but I am sorry you have, for I have a pencil now & a quill pen I prefer to any other, because it has a finer nib, & I told you expressly to bring me no present, if you�I would always rather fix upon something I really want.  I sent your letter to Col. Town[e]s to read, because I wanted him to see what kind of person Mr. Jones was, who I dare say he had begun to think highly of, merely because on the Southern question he pretended to agree with him, & there was nothing in your letter to prevent my showing it to him, except that Genl Thompson had written you in connection with the paper, & as I knew there was such a prejudice against him, I saved a�paper on that fact so he could not read it.  There was nothing else in the letter but what could with propriety be published to the world.  There was no domestic matter discussed, nothing that would have been indelicate to show.

		It is raining now & has been all day.  It puts a stop to the servants doing any work.  The clothes are not even dry enough to iron.  The roads are too muddy to haul wood.  Our groundnuts cannot be dried.  Eliza is doing pretty well.  Minerva is out of her room but I gave her very little to do.

		Dr. Simons exhibition took place yesterday at the Methodist church.  Susan Hoke attended & gave me an account of it.  He himself made a long speech & praised himself greatly for having performed his part so conscientiously to his scholars.  He read the Essays of the young ladies.  One of them was on the impropriety educating children at the North & using the�of their imbibing Northern principles, that at the North they received but a superficial education; encouraging Northern Teachers at the South ought also to have been treated of, but of course that was understood.  Dr. Simons gave the Degrees to four young ladies, to each of whom he made a speech in Latin. & strange to say those very young ladies are coming back to his school next year, & yet are called the graduating class, rather different from colleges in general.

		Tonight two letters have come from the Post Office, one from Mr. G.W.P. Pool, Dekalb Kemper County Mississippi.  He says he is a native of this District.  He understands  you have established a paper for the purpose of advocating the principles of the Union party, not only in your State, but in the South generally.  He knows you by reputation, & is satisfied the principles of any party, will not suffer in such hands.  He knows nothing of the terms, or even the name of your paper, but you will please send it to him, & he will remit the amount of subscription as soon as he knows the amount due.

		The other letter is dated Harrisburg, S.C.  The name I cannot decipher, but I will write it as he has, & perhaps you will find it out.  It is signed D.W.C. L�son.  The letter says Mr. Isaac Kennedy wishes you to send him the prospectus of the Southern Patriot & he will try & get subscribers for you.  The person who writes the letter is the Post Master at Harrisburg, S.C. 

		So as Miss Anderson said, subscribers are springing up, one place & another.  I think you have received encouragement already.  I am thinking, suppose a Southern Convention does assemble & determines to go for a Dissolution of the Union, you will be�the very thing you wish to avoid, whereas letting the other States alone, South Caroline will find it impossible to dissolve the Union herself & therefore will have to give it up so do you not think it best to let her take her own course, & see what she is going to do.  Of course you not assisting her but maintaining your position, disapproving of separate State action 7c.  But you know not.  I merely tell my thoughts.  But I wish you would be quietly enrolled among Chancellors & Judges, one of whom I hope to see you, if not now, at another time.  Do you really think now, if you tried for it, that you would be elected; you ought to let Col. Dudley find out for you.  I am�Willie & Frank are doing well.  E.F.P.
