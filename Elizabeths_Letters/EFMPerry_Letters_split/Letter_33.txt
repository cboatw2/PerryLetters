Letter 33

Friday morning.  I have just been reading the Mountaineer.  How I wish I could have read a letter from you giving an account of Legislative proceedings.  You ought to be a member, if it is only to inform the people what is going on.  I am sure they must miss your letters.  How blind they are to their own interest when they do not insist on your going.  There is no one now to attend to the interests of the upper country.  If you had been a member last year, you would have prevented your circuit from being arranged as it is at present, & which has injured you so much.  I feel very uneasy, lest you should be more occupied.  If you run for solicitor, of course you will remain in Columbia until after the election.  It seems to be an advantage to let the people know, you are a candidate for an office long before[word obscured] it seems to entitle you to the office.  So as you will not be a Candidate for Judge this time [you] must inform the Legislature that you will be a Candidate at the next resignation.  Today for a �der, the sun is shining.  I expect with pleasure a letter tonight.  I am sorry you will not hear from me.  I have written every other Mail.  Willy says I must tell you, he is learning a Hymn & Catechism to say to you, & says his lesson every day.  I have not answered Pamela�s letter yet but must soon, that she can hear before she leaves home.  I long to see you again.  I think it is much better to leave home sometimes for it is such a pleasure to meet again, &  it makes us value home, to leave it occasionally.

Benjamin Perry
