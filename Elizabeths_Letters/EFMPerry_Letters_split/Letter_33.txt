Letter 33

Friday morning, 29 November [1844]
Greenville

My dear husband

	Again have I taken my pen in hand to write to you.  Mrs. Thompson has sent me word, Butler is going tonight to Columbia, & will take a letter for me, so I will send this by him.  Your letter I received Wednesday night, & it would have given me great pleasure, had it not been for the sad intelligence you communicated.  We had not heard even of the sickness of Uncle Hayne, so that his death was quite a shock.  When Mr. Yancey said he met cousin Isaac coming on to see his father, I supposed he had attended to a sickness he had some time ago of which he had completely recovered.  What an affliction it is to his immediate family, & a loss to all of the family, for I believe he managed the whole of the business of those who were without gentleman.  What will Mamma do; I should think as soon as convenient, you would have to go to town to see to the transferring of his business.  Aunt Eliza some time ago wrote word that Wm. � understood the management of it, so that he would attend to it if anything happened to his father, & I hope now he will be able to, but no one will supply Uncle Haynes place.  He improved her money for her; whenever he could & never asked, though poor, for any compensation, from Mamma & no one else.  He was a good man, had a sad fate, & now I am sure is meeting his reward.  His family were entirely dependent on his exertions, so I do not know what they will do.  So little did we know of his sickness, that by Mrs. Mauldin, Mamma sent a present of two beautiful coloured dresses to Eliza & Susan, & I sent two aprons.  They must have received them immediately after their fathers death.  Mamma thought as Uncle Hayne asked nothing from her, in return for his trouble, she would make a present to his children that would be useful & a help to them; but as it turned out, it was quite mal apropos.  Mamma I suppose will receive a letter tonight from some of the family.  They no doubt waited to write until all was over & were in no hurry to communicate such bad news.  There are few whose death will be such a loss to Mamma.  If you have heard any particulars, write me of them.  I dare say it was anxiety of mind, which he must have suffered for a long long time  brought on Paralysis.  I am glad cousin Isaac arrived in time.  His other children I suppose were with him.  

	I read your letter this morning in the Mountaineer.  You will see a glowing description of the Torch light procession in the Mountaineer.  I scarcely recognize it.  It appears so much better on paper.

	So certain am I that you will wish me to go to Mrs. Cunninghams that I have commenced putting my Wardrobe in order for my visit.  I anticipate great pleasure& so do the children, & I know it will do us all good.  A change sometimes is very pleasant.  The only objection you could have, would be that Jim would be taken from his work, but that is none; for after carrying us, he can return home.  I wish you would see Pamelas letter.  She is so urgent & pressing in her invitation.  If you would prefer seeing your Constituents immediately after the adjournment of the Legislature, you might return home from Columbia, & then come to Mrs. Cunninghams.  You might come at any time after the adjournment, that suited you best.  I know you cannot object  top myself & the children paying them a visit, & it would be very pleasant if you would come & bring us home.  Whichever time suits you best, I will arrange everything to go on with or without me.  I would like to go the 10th of December & stay until after Christmas.  Pamela says I must pay a long sociable visit & that would be allowing myself only a fortnight.  I mention the 10th because I do not think I could get ready before then.  Jim I suppose had better return home with the carri[a]ge & horses.  You must write me about that, & which time will be most convenient for you to come, on your way from Columbia, or after you get home.  I will take Delia with me, & Minerva will superintend the yard & be careful of everything.  Jim will kill the hogs more probably before we go & will have plenty of wood.  I will arrange everything as well as I did for your party.  The change will be particularly beneficial to the children, who associate at home too much with the servants.  Anna asks now, Why we don�t go to Miss Pamela�s that it has stopped raining.  
I will get materials for working your shoes & carry with me, that Pamela may show me.  Mamma & Susan say they think it will be very pleasant for me to go.

	I must mention two important peices of domestic news.  The Cow you bought from Mr. Goodwin, yesterday had a calf, & the Sou Mr. Hoke lent you last night had ten pigs, real Berkshire.  Jim says all are doing well.  You need not now have taken Flora. For one Cow is quite sufficient for our family, & the Goodwin Cow I dare say will give a great deal of Milk.  This morning Minerva milked her & she gave a gallon.  We will now make a good deal of Butter, which however is more expensive than buying.  With Flora I churned twice a week.  Mr. Thomas came here this morning, (the person from Buncombe we buy Butter from) & asked if I would like any Herdsgrass seed, that several gentlemen had asked him to bring them some, that he would sell good seed sifted at 1 dollar a bushel.  I told him I would write & ask you, so you must let me know.

	In all probability Mr. Roper will give you a bundle for Susan.  If he does, send it to Greenville by the first opportunity, for it contains articles she wishes to wear now.  You must not forget to open the letter Mamma gave directed to Mr. Roper, take out the money, & pay Mr. Roper whatever the articles Mr. Roper got amounted to.  

	You are fortunate in getting a nice room to yourself.  It gives me pleasure to think of your being in Columbia, & that your talents will now be brought into use for the good of your country. I hope you will exercise a good judgement in your course this winter, so that no fault may be found with you at home.   

	You must write me all the news.  I have none to tell, except that Mrs. Dr. Earles eldest daughter is to be married to a Mr. Williams of Laurens.  But you must not tell anyone, for Mrs. Earle informed Mamma in confidence, through a servant, who she sent to borrow a dress from Susan.  

	Perhaps I may hear from you tonight, at any rate I will anticipate it, but as you are so busy will not expect certainly.  I look anxiously to your letter Wednesday night, as from that I will have certainly, if I can go to Mrs. Cunninghams.  The children are well.  Ever Yours, Liz
