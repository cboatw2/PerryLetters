Letter 129

Sunday night

My dear husband

		I have just received your letter by Mr. Keith.  Mr. Long�s son brought it.  I told him to ask Mr. Keith to come & see me, but I dare say he will not.  I write to you tonight, because tomorrow I expect to be engaged visiting.  Jim arrived safely, as you have heard.  The two next days it rained, so he only cleaned the carri[a]ge & put up Elisa�s Stove.  Yesterday he hauled one load of wood, & some leaves.  All next week I am going to use the carri[a]ge, so I expect he will do very little work, but Charles will work & Jim as much as I can spare him.

		Since writing the above, Mr. Keith has paid me a visit.  He has just left, so I will continue.  You will be surprised to hear, that I have not purchased Reuben.  You merely said, if I desired it, you would purchase him.  This permission, I do not consider authority enough.  I will tell you all that has passed.  After receiving your letter, I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, what you said, & that I would not decide unless I knew your wish, to purchase Reuben.  She said I must decide at once, for Mr. Beattie & Mr. McBee both wanted him, so I sent for Mr. Hoke, to get advice from him. He said he had never thought much of Reuben, but admitted he knew nothing against him, except that he drove Mrs. Harrisons horses hard, that he knew he would suit me better than Jim, for he was obedient, sober, & industrious, that Jim was a worthless creature, drank, traded with poor people, was idler, careless, &c. that he saw him constantly at Pecks stable & numerous other things that he mentioned, & yet said he would rather have Jim than Reuben, for he would whip him & make him know his place, but with you he would never be of any account, because you were too indulgent.  After this account of Jim, I was determined to buy Reuben, so I sent to Mrs. Harrison that he should come for me to look at.  He came, & I liked his looks, & what he said, but still not give a decided answer.  At night when Jim came in with the keys, I felt sorry for him, so I thought I would say something to him, so I said �Jim you know if we buy Reuben,  & are pleased with him, we will sell you, but I do not suppose you will care, for you never have seemed happy here,[�], he said, � if my owners are not satisfied with me, I am perfectly willing to be sold, I do my work, & if I cant please them  I am willing to leave them�.  I said, �you have told me you would rather belong to a strict owner, than your master�.  He said, �I would rather belong to an owner who treats his servants alike some of them here are treated well, the other have to poke about,� insinuating that he, the most indulged of all, was treated the worst.  I now lost all pity for him, & determined to buy Reuben.  I was in this frame of mind, when Mr. Hoke came in, & brought with him Dr. Crook, who he said knew more about Reuben, than he did.  Dr. Crook said he had always seemed to him slow motioned, & if you sent him on an errand, he would stop if he met anyone & laugh & talk with them, that he thought compared with Jim. It was 6 of one & a half a dozen of the other.  Mr. Hoke said he had worked for him & worked faithfully, & what Dr. Crook knew against him was literally nothing, yet they both advised me not to buy him, & said if he ever acted badly, I would blame myself.  Of course advised in this way. I would not make the purchase, so I went to tell Mrs. Harrison, that in your absence I could do nothing.  This morning Reuben came again & said his mistress said, that she would let him remain so, until you returned, that she would send me the bill of Sale, & then if you did not wish him, you could give it to Mr. Beattie, & Mr. Beattie would buy him.  She said you would fix all right.  She had perfect confidence in you.  Matters rested so until this evening after church.  I saw Mr. Beattie, & asked him if Mr. Harrison left Reuben & you did not buy him, if he would, & he said he had sent word to Mrs. Harrison he would take Reuben, but had not received an answer so he thought if Mrs. Harrison would agree to it, he would take Reuben at once, & when you return if you wish him, he will sell him to you at the 500 dollars.  If you do not wish him, he can easily sell him to someone else.  So here the matter rests, & I think I am a perfect Metternich to arrange things so well.  Dr. Croft after church this morning, said he wished to see you, to consult you on some business.  I told him, I could advise him, I knew a great deal about Law.  He said I was indeed, the smartest lady he ever knew.  He invited us to visit him at Newberry this winter.      
 And now for your letter.  I must my dear husband say that I am vexed at the foolish purchases you make.  You show no judgement at all, knives, forks, spoons, when we have not a decent cup or plate to use with either, the spoons, but particularly the forks we could have done without & as the forks are not real silver, it was foolish to get them, for our�ones answer perfectly well, & one set of imitation is quite enough.  What we need is a dinner set of Crockery, a nice set of cups & saucers, some Table Mats, a carpet for the Dining room, which we will be obliged to get, for our present one is in rags, a chamber downstairs, our house painted, an oil cloth for the Stair case.  These things are necessaries.  The 36 dollars thrown away in the spoons & forks, would have bought the carpet, & then our chamber would have been made comfortable with the old carpet, & the dining room with the new.  Every thing of this kind is yet so much cheaper in Charleston, & comes up so much more conveniently, that I prefer getting them there.  Things are so dear in Columbia, that when you go down, I do not even mention what we want, for fear you may buy it, but as you will throw away your money so foolishly I will not be so scrupulous another time.  If you knew how self denying I was, how I deny myself of every comfort in clothing, because you cannot afford it, you would reflect more before you spend your money.  If you were to see my petticoats, my drawers, my stockings you would be shocked.  Of the money that passes through my hands. Precious little is spent on myself.  It is all expended on the house, children & servants; a few handsome dresses I have & those you bought me.  I have taste, & make my things look well but nothing more than I possibly can help, do I buy.  Aunt Eliza who thinks herself so straitened, would be astonished if she examined my Wardrobe.  You preach economy, & in your dress you are economical, but at one blow you spoil it all; 36 dollars or at least 18 thrown away, for forks we had no earthly use for.  What we have are good enough for our circumstances, & they are not even silver.  What you have bought therefore I must say it was very foolish to buy a second set of imitation silver.  I would like you if you would  to get back your money & keep it for some of the necessaries mentioned above.  The first 20 dollars you can spare me, I am going to send to Charleston or the North for a Musical box.  If you had�the money you�to, I would long ago have got one.  I do not wish it now, but next year some time I hope to git one.  Now I wish the house painted, and a Chamber downstairs, & a Carpet, & an Oil Cloth, & a Dinner Set, & a Tea Set, & Table Mats, & more Table Cloths, Towels, Pillow cases &c., but these things I intend getting in Charleston, everything now is cheap there.  Columbia particularly during the Session is extravagant,  Therefore I do not care for them to be got there.  I  have spoken long on this subject for I really feel it.  I know that we have no money to spend uselessly.  I never have a fourpence to give away.  As you have I want you to bring a present for Vardry.  You are his Godfather, & have never given him a present yet so get something for him, & the three pictures for 50 cts for Ann, & the glass slate for Willie, & engage the Lady�s book for me, & if Graham & that together can be got for 5.00 engage Graham for Mamma.  Willie has 15 cts I owed him for Chickens.  He says you must buy something pretty for him at that price besides the slate & he will pay you the money when you come home.  You must buy what books you can afford, but I expect that will not be many.  I expect the Women of the Bible, is too costly, so you can get that another time.  Per[s]ons here seem to think Mr. Edward Earle is sick, but as you do not mention it, I suppose he is not.  Mr. & Mrs. Perry Duncan were here this evening a few minutes to see how Fanny was.  They had heard she was sick, & did not know she was better.  I went to church today, both morning & afternoon.  Mr. Hoke says Genl Thompsons family say he has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.  I wonder he does not accept it.  He boasts enough.  He loves nothing from his humility.  I cant bear him or his family.  They are too conceited, but conceit & vanity helps a person in this world.  It has made Genl Thompson.  I am pleased at the compliments paid you, but nothing can make up for my mortification at your late defeat, until you have triumphed over your base enemies.  Until then I can not feel as happy as I once did.  I took�pride in you, & it has been humbled, & so many are pleased at your defeat in this Congressional District.  The Lower County appreciates you much more than the Upper.  I wish Judge Butler could be beaten.  He never ought to have been elected.  I do not wish Col. Manning elected Governor.  He has no claims to it.  I hope Cousin Isaac will be elected.  You must do what you can, without injuring yourself.  I am sure you can influence many.  I feel great interest in his election, not only for Cousin Eliza�s sake, but for the sake of the name he bears.  He is the only one at present, to preserve it with distinction., & I am sorry for him.  Gloria has not much manner.  She is like her father, & she is very cold.  She always was.  I hope Col. Orr heard the speech made by Genl Brisbane, & I hope Col. Edwards with be elected Solicitor.  I wish you would be elected Solicitor when Genl Whitner is elected Judge, which Mr. Keith says he will be when Judge Richardson resigns.  Do you not think your chance is better than Mr. Youngs.  You must watch your chance, & be elected to something to cover the disgrace of your late defeat.  You must certainly price Buggy�s & Carri[a]ge�s, but a�Buggy you most need, & if you can make a good bargain, buy one.  See how much they would give for your old one.  Describe it to them, & then let Jim carry it down to you, or if you can get a reasonable one, perhaps you might�your old buggy here.  At any rate see what kind of bargain you can make.  If you cannot make a good one, then get one from Mr. Cox here.  You might price Carri[a]ges & at one time or other change ones.  I dare say you would sell ours here, to someone in the country at a good price, when you wish to get another.  I have had a long chat with you, & if you were not tired would go on much longer.  I am not as silent as Gloria.  It is going on 10 oclock.  I am sending Willie upstairs.  I am glad you thought his letter did pretty well.  You might have told Col. Dawkins, if he meant it as a disparagement  [of] the four children only that you had had 6, & asked him how many he had.   They having married twice, you supposed  he had a house full, & tell him we were going on quite as rapidly as we desired, but if�would leave some of his property to one, we would try & have another & name after him.  Mr. Henry Thompson will be disappointed in not being Bursar.  I am going to write to Aunt Eliza now , & will tell her you think Cousin Isaac will be elected, & that the Greenville delegation will go for him.  The village is dull.  I have only been out to church, since you left.  I have been working for the servants all the time.  Eliza has worked two days for Margaret Croft, which will come to 75 cts.  Adieu I may add something tomorrow.  I am going to see Mrs. Town[e]s tomorrow.  Several messages have passed between us.  I am going to see Mrs. Tom Jones,  & Mrs. �.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

I have a shocking pen to write with & no way of getting another.  I am ashamed of my letter but cant help it.
