Letter 226

Sunday morning, 11 oclock

My dear husband.  The Mail this morning came very late, owing I suppose to the bad roads, to my great disappointment no letter has come from you.  One from Anna, & one from Aunt Mary McCall I received.  I think you must have written, but the Post master in Columbia has neglected sending it.  Tomorrow no Stage comes, so I cannot hear until Tuesday, & if you then write for the carri[a]ge, it may be too late for it to meet you.  Mr. Hoke says he thinks	the roads are too bad for a carri[a]ge to get along at all.  I wish you to come the way you prefer, but I hope you will come in the Stage.  It seems to me that will be the best way on account of the roads both for you & the horses, but if you write for the carri[a]ge I will send it, if the letter comes in time.  I am going after church to dine at Mamma�s so have to write to you now.  I am so sorry I did not hear from you.  I am afraid you were spending your evening so pleasantly with some of those bold ladies, it made you forget your Wife; perhaps Becky Sharpe you got introduced to.

	I have written to Mr. Elford to buy us a set of common knives for every day use.  Our old knives are lost & worn out, & the new set is too handsome for every day, & would soon get ruined, a common Butter knife I also begged him to get.  You  must bring us nothing at all.  Anna will bring us something.  Charleston is a cheaper place than Columbia.  The little things you get for the childrenare expensive & useless, so bring back nothing but yourself.  

	I must write to Anna now.  She says she enjoys herself more than she expected, & that she will come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & that I must write & tell you so that I can make you understand better than she can, that she is not to go to Columbia & meet you, & come up with you, but she will come all the way up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.

	I hope you will be careful on the R Road & take a safe scarf & wrap yourself up warm.
I will now conclude.  I remain Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry

I am glad you now like my letters.  I like you cannot bear to be scolded, especially by a husband.  The next time you begin, I will call in one of the servants & let you finish on one who deserves it.  But you think you are so certain of my heart, you can impose on it, but you must not venture too far.

If I had heard from you this morning I could have written you another sheet.  Now I have nothing more to write about, except to add I love you.  E.F.P.

Anna�s letter today was a long one, a whole sheet.

My dear husband

	I had written a long letter & sent it to the Post office & wrote I had not heard from you, when Mr. Beattie sent me two letters.  I can now only acknowledge them, for I expect Susan every moment to come from church & carry me to Mamma�s�I now hear the carri[a]ge.

	I know the sugar was more than we use, but it is economy to get a large quantity at one time.  The barrels & commissions cost as much if they are small, as if they are large.  I thought & knew the Sugar would not last more than a year.  We have 14 servants.  We use more than a pound of Brown Sugar every day for them, more than a pound of white for ourTea & Coffee each day.  The loaf Sugar was for company, the Clarified for cake, the powdered for icing.  This was the reason there was such a variety.

	Susan has come & gone, & I must now get ready, for when the carri[a]ge comes back.  I will write again tomorrow.  

	Mr. Brown was not the Soul of Honour as I had thought.  I am glad you are coming up with Mr. Duncan, but think you would find it pleasanter on account of the bad roads to come in the Stage.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
