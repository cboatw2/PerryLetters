Letter 132

Wednesday morning.  I have just done breakfast.  Mrs. Town[e]s sent me a few Oysters, & some bread, & says she is quite smart, & that Maj. Earle returned last night & says Col. Townes is better.  The Oysters as usual were shocking.  I sent them into the kitchen.  The pickled Oysters brought to Greenville, are not fit to eat.  You know the Cornfield at one side of Joe P�s house, between his house & Mr. Luther McBee�s .  He has sold half of it, a narrow strip to Mr. Rowand for 500 dollars, which I think was enormous.  Today it is very cloudy & warm.  I expect it will rain.  If you get a Buggy, & can have yours taken in exchange, you must write for Jim to carry it down.  If you do not get one, & wish to come back in the carri[a]ge, write for that, & I will let Willie go down in it.  The horses seemed not at all injured
by the journey, or the Carri[a]ge either.  If you get a Buggy, it must be a fashionable kind, but if they are too expensive, you can wait until next Spring.  Columbia is so dear, perhaps Buggy�s & Carri[a]ges may be dear too.  So I do not tell you to get either.

2 oclock.  I have just returned from paying visits.  In the course of them I heard the Governor was dead, that Maj. Earle brought the news.  I heard also that young Elias Earle, intended next winter to be a Candidate for Comptroller General, & Mr. Jones also, that Mr. Jones had declined running for Treasurer.  I went to Mrs. Arthur�s where I saw Mr. Rosemond who is building a nice piazza in front of Mr. Arthur�s house, for only 27 dollars.  Mr. Arthur furnishes Lumber & Nails.  I asked him how much he would ask for putting a room in our Piazza & described it to him.  He said he would not exactly say, but he supposed 10 or 12 dollars.  I told him to come down tonight & look at the Piazza & tell us exactly.  He is going to build the house for Mrs. Pearson, & is said to be the cheapest workman here.  He has been working for Mr. Pinckney at Flat Rock, & was recommended by him.  So I wish you as soon as you return, to get the Lumber, & have the room commenced by Mr. Rosemond.  I hope to hear tonight from you.  Susan is going to Housekeeping, & I will wish you to make her a valuable present.  So a dozen large & small forks, such as you have got, I will wish you to get for her.  If you could afford it now, I would like it, if not in the Spring when you go to Columbia, perhaps what you have got for me I may give to her.  I will see about it.  This week I expect to get through with my visiting.  Every afternoon Jim has leisure.  Yesterday he shelled Corn; this afternoon he is going to haul wood.  Tomorrow I am going to see Mr. Henry Thompson.  This afternoon I am going to pay visits in the neighbourhood, so when you return, I will be able to stay at home, & entertain you, & ride with you.  Fanny is at this moment seated on the table sucking a bone.  Charles stays entirely at the farm, so I hope he is doing well.  It has cleared off now, & the sun is shining, but it is so warm I expect it will rain soon.  I must now close to send the letter to the office.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
