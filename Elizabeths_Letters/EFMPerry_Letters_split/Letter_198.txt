Letter 198

	Sunday, 2 oclock.  My dear husband, I have just done dinner, & will finish my letter to you.  I went to church this morning, all of us.  I took possession of Mr. Poinsetts pew, & like it very much.  It is more private than ours.  We will keep it until Mr. Poinsett comes up, but I rather expect he will never come.  If he does, we will take some other vacant pew in church.  There are several unoccupied.  Mr. Arthur preached.  He did not go to Spartanburg as he expected.  A horse fell with him & lamed him which prevented him.  Mr. Cox read the prayers.  Mr. Arthur�s was extempore, & as poor a one, as I ever heard, tedious & laboured, & really teaches us one virtue patience.  Mrs. Westfield says Mr. Ioor has addressed several young ladies on the Grove, & they all refused him, but Miss Lewis with her little property, thinks him good enough for her.  Mamma says he looks quite sad.  He must know that his object in choosing such a lady is wid�.  She is very unloveable, with her one eye.  Mrs. Ioor has taken the house Mr. Walker the merchant has been living in, so we will have her for a neighbor.  

	It was a house of Butler Thompson�s I believe that is�not Genl Thompsons.  Edward told Mamma a tale of Butler Thompson�s being thrown out of a Buggy, his horse killed & himself hurt, but I do not know how true it is.  Reports are so false I am afraid to mention them.  

	The weather today is very cold.  Do be careful of yourself as you come home, wrap up warm, & do not increase your cold.  I hope & pray you may be well when I hear from you tonight.   I am miserable when I hear you are feverish.  If you are sick you must be at home, where every moment, I can know how you are.

	I do not know whether you will be here Wednesday or Thursday.  Mr. Goodlet says the Legislature adjourns Tuesday 12 oclock & that you will set off in the Cars the same day.  Be careful to get a safe seat in the Cars, & take care of your pocket book.  What a strange law to pass for a man when in debt to have so much of his own property secured to him.  Business will have to be stopped for no one will give him credit.

	This afternoon Willie is to drive us out in the carri[a]ge.  There is no service at church.  It is so cold I can hardly write.  My hands are cold.  I have not time to read over my letter,  Your must excusae mistakes.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
