Letter 245

Wednesday morning, 11 oclock, 5 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have been disappointed today in not hearing from you, but suppose you were prevented writing by some engagement, & as I have said before, I never wish you to write to me when anything occurs to make it inconvenient.  I received two letters from you yesterday.  I wrote to Eliza & Aunt Mary McCall, which left me no time to write to you.  I sent Aunt Mary 49 dollars to pay my bill, which I am very glad she will soon receive.  I disliked being in debt to her so long.  If your Papa comes in before I close this letter, I will get some money from him & send it to you.  I would send to his office, but persons are generally there & he dislikes being interrupted by messages.  If I do not send the money today, I will tomorrow.

	I am glad you are still enjoying yourself.  Miss Drayton has been very kind to you.  I suppose you know the Fords are cousins of yours.  You have so many relations, you might stay in town a long time, before you found them all over.  The patterns of your Cloak & dress are beautiful.  The dress much prettier than the blue one Aunt Mary sent me. & well worth 64 cts more a yard.  A Cloak as dark as yours would have just suited me.  I am very anxious to receive Fanny�s.  She has not been to church yet, for she has nothing to wear [&] if the box does not come soon, I will have to buy her a dress here.  The Cloak I hope will come by some private opportunity.  My Cloak Aunt Mary will change for a black Cape, about one yard deep, which she says will be very comfortable.  I can wear it this winter for dress, & next winter I hope get a handsome cloak.  As soon as the box arrives I will let you know.  The bad roads will delay it for a long time.  Our Groceries I dare say will not be here for weeks or months.

	Fanny went to school today.  Willie & Frank will go Monday.  Mr. Rosemond has commenced building the new kitchen.  It is to be joined to the old one, & have four rooms, two below for a kitchen & ironing room, & two above for chambers.  The kitchen we have been working in so long, will be a general sitting room for the servants, so our kitchen can be kept clean, & the Cellar will be kept as a Lumber room.

	 Lindy is still over at Mamma�s & Sarah Green is not a good servant, so your Grandmama hears, & I expect she will be obliged to keep Lindy.  Susy has the Measles.  I would be very sorry for Lindy�s baby to take it, but it must now take its chance; for I am obliged to let Lindy stay there, Mama having ho servant to cook.  R� is hired to Mrs. Charles Roberts.  	

	There was a Circus here yesterday, & an animal show.  The two shows connected together.  The children went & were delighted.  More ladies must have been at it, than I have ever known before from what the children say, & I hear Ministers even were there, Mr. Buist & Mr. Mims.  The say it was an uncommonly good performance.  I saw nothing of it.  The band did not [page torn] down the street as they generally do.

	Your Aunt Annie is as poorly as ever, & as much opposed to your Aunt Susy & the children being there.  I do not know anyone more dreadfully situated than your Grandmama.  The walking being so bad, & the horses all the time hauling wood.  I have been there very little, & your Grandmama scarcely ever can have her horses, as they are all the time hauling wood, & Aunt Annie does not like her to leave her for one moment.  

	I have not paid any visits since you left.  Writing has been my principal occupation, & Eliza being still confined to her room, I am obliged to sew.  Clara made my blue dress, not as well as Eliza, & the other one I am keeping for Eliza to make.  The baby is well, & so is Eliza, but she will not be out of her room for two weeks yet.  Clara is now working for Mamma & Ann & Susan.

	Susan Hoke says she has repeatedly written to Augustus Hoke to go & see you, & she thinks he cannot have received the letters, & so does not know you are in town, but it is no consequence  whether he goes or not, except it is rather ungrateful in him not to go & see Aunt Eliza who was kind enough to invite him to tea; but I dare say he feels awkward, not being accustomed to visit among ladies.  

      I am glad you are learning independence & visiting alone.  A little girl may be modest, & yet at the same time be easy & independent, & able to act for herself.  I am glad also you play for your friends on the Piano.  It is right to begin at once, & be obliging, & not refuse, which generally proceeds from affectation & a too great desire to please.  They refuse, because they are afraid they will not excite admiration enough, though sometimes it is from awkwardness.  I am glad to hear that you are obliged & able to entertain your friends.  I hope you will play well when you return.  It is no consequence whether you work much on your quilt now.  You will have plenty of time to finish it when you return.  
      
      Mrs. Beattie & Mrs. Henry Earle have been here since I commenced writing.  Mr. Mauldin I hear is much better.  He is still in Columbia.  Mrs. Joab Mauldin stays with Mrs. Mauldin.
      
      Sally & L� Cleveand are going to school at the Limestone Springs, & Mrs. Cleveland is going in the county.  Your Papa has not come home since I commenced writing, & I sent Fanny to his office this moment, & two gentlemen are there, so I cannot send the money today, but will soon.
      
      I hope you are behaving so well, as still to merit the good opinion of your friends.  I sent the box with the Cloak & a letter containing the chain & pencil case by Mr. John Jones last night.  I had sent the bonnet & petticoat before I got your letter saying you did not need them.  Fanny says she likes school.  There are a great many scholars, Vardry & Annie go.  Give my love to Aunt Eliza & my cousins.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.
