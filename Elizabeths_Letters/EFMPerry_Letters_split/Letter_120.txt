Letter 120

Tuesday night, 20 June 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I have just received your letter.  I was so anxious & yet afraid to open it, that as usual, it gave me the pain that I have often told you anxiety & fear produces.  This shows you how much interest I feel in your success, & an unfavorable result may produce serious consequences, to me, so this must make you exert yourself  more than ever for the love you bear your Wife do not let her be disappointed.  Mr. Orr is doing all he can, & he will not be particular what means he uses.  You have not so good a chance as you only avail yourself of honorable means, & your friends are also honorable, so you must try the harder in the ways you allow yourself for I would not have you beaten on any consideration.  I am glad you have been encouraged.  I am a croaker like Mr. Norton, & I hope you are not flattering & deceiving yourself.  I am afraid Mr. Norton is only half a Perry man.  In one of his letters he said he had promised Mr. Orr not to do anything against him.  The evening you left Mr. Lester paid me a visit.  He said he heard Washington Shepherd say, (who has been ped[d]ling in Laurens, that you were doing well there, that in G� Wrights neighborhood I think 3 or 4 steady men  who were going to vote for Mr. Orr, changed after hearing both of you speak, & were going now to vote for you,, & that Sullivan was now for Orr, but before the Election he might find it to his interest to vote for you.  Th� Mr. Lester said was warm in your favor.  Mr. Robert Maxwell he said he heard say he would like to be your friend, but you must take care & not make any more Railroad speech, as they might cut you out.  I send you a letter of Mr. Bridwell�s & one from Mr. Simpson, which I opened as I considered it addressed to me, as we twain are one flesh, as Mr. Arthur said last Sunday.  He is decidedly against Mr. Cass, & has objections to Genl Taylor, so your position is like the South Carolina Delegation neutral.  I hope Mr. Orr will be served right, & lose instead of gaining by the position he has assumed.  I dare say he will take some of your friends from you, Mr. Reed for instance, but I hope you will take from him in returning Sunday morning.  Susan & myself went to the Baptist church to hear Mrs. Thompsons funeral sermon.  Mr. Arthur had no service in the morning in consequence of it.  Mr. Bre� spoke of Mrs. Thompson as a most perfect person. Compared her to the beloved Di[s]ciple John, & from his description she was as perfect as our Saviour himself & possessing every accomplishment of mind & person.  Genl Thompson & his family sat in the front pew.  As far as I could tell they seemed composed.  In the afternoon we went to our own church.  I carried Mrs. Walker home in the morning.  On the way back, I was caught in the rain, with my new dress on, the rain came in, & wet it.  I was so provoked I determined not to carry Mrs. Walker home ever again. For after all my kindness to her, she is your enemy.  Mr. Lester said he hardly supposed Col. Walker would vote for you, & what objection has Col. Walker to you.  I suppose you are too far his superior, for him to wish well to.  Yesterday Frank chewed a Lucifer Match & I sent for Dr. Crook to know whether it would hurt him,  He said, no, one match containing too little on it to injure, but I gave him a dose of Castor oil, which I knew would do him good.  Frank found the match underneath the Sofa cushion in my chamber, the having to take Oil, will be a lesson to him never to touch a match again, & I will keep them where there will not be scattered about.  Speaking of the election Dr. Crook said he heard persons say, even those who thought you would be elected that Mr. Orr electioneered so much better than you did.  He said if he had been a Candidate, he would have such opponents as Mr. Mc�, Jones & Elias Earle, & they by electioneering might beat him.  Mr. Orr�s reputation for electioneering is wonderful, but you will prove his reputation is undeserved.  Saturday night Mr. Long�s servant brought the shoes.  Some lady had brought the bundle from Columbia.  They are made up better than I expected.  The material with which they are lined, is much better than that used by the Charleston Shoemaker, but the shape, & the work is not fixed as pretty.  Instead of putting all of my work, he cuts off some of it.  The red pr I last worked, he was obliged to make according  to the shape I worked them, & they look beautiful.  Today I sent Mary to the farm, to hoe, & kept Jim to whitewash the living room.  When the carpet was taken up, there was an immense quantity of dirt underneath.  Tomorrow Jim will go to the farm, & Mary will wash the paint.  Thursday  I will again keep Jim to whitewash the Entry & send Mary to the farm to hoe, then the housecleaning will be finished, & then Mary will at her leisure whitewash the fences, & Jim when you can spare him, the kitchen & chairs.  Yesterday the Rye was cut.  We have had showers every day since you left.  Yesterday it rained almost all day.  I thought of you, but hoped you were beyond the rain.  Minerva is not taken sick yet, but one of Willie�s Sows has been, & brought forth her first pigs 6 in number, 2 of which died, & 4 are living, & Willie says he has another one about to have pigs.  Mr. Beattie this afternoon sent an account for the Gingham dress I bought months ago.  I had a receipt for it & kept it in my Wardrobe until last week.  I thought I would never have any use for it, & tore it up.  I am so provoked that I did.  I wrote him a note, which satisfied him, but I would have been delighted to have had the receipt to have shown him.  Tonight two notes came from Dr. & Mrs. Thomas inviting us to their house the evening of 4th of July.  Perhaps Dr. Thomas� daughter is to be married.  I was in hopes you would have stopped to have seen Col. Keen Saturday as you passed.  I forgot to tell you to.  Do stay in Pickens as long as you can & electioneer, go over every part of it, that you possibly have time to, & bring me back good news.  I wish you to beat Mr. Orr severely, & in future making [page torn] afraid to contend with you.  Mary McLeod said today, that Mr. Sam Earle did not even write to his Wife, & here are we  when absent only a few days, writing to each other.  I send you all the papers & letters that have come for you.  No one has been to inquire for you.  Do try & bring some money with you, so that you may not have to borrow to return Mr. Folders money.  I am certain you can get someone to pay you.  If you could see Josiah, I am sure he would be able to pay you some.  Eveline says Col. Dunham  is better, & his mind is restored, but I do not know whether this is true.  I have no news to tell you.  We are all well.  Willie is head.  Fanny looks a great deal better, & is more interesting than ever.  She kicked Frank this morning when he was asleep.  Frank without knowing it, pushed her, & she was quite indignant & tried to push him out of bed.  It is past 10 oclock.  I am writing with a bad pen & bad light.  I know you are very particular, but you must excuse my shabby letter.  I am also sleepy, not having taken my usual nap.  If you come back too soon, you will find us in the midst of housecleaning, so you need not hurry home, not that I do not wish to see you, but I wish you to be better employed, in shaking hands with the men, kissing the women &�the children on your knees.  Good night my dear husband.  Write me by Col. Town[e]s.  Ever your dear Wife, E.F.P.

Frank was 5 years old yesterday,  Fanny will be 1 year old Saturday.
