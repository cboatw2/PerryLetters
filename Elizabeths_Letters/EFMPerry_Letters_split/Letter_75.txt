Letter 75

	Saturday I had the horses & paid with Miss McBee & Reinhardt�visits.  Mrs. Smith we went to see & Mrs. Bradshaw, we went into the garden, which has the greatest variety of vegetables in it.  Some I have never heard of.  He gets his seed from Thorburn N. York, & they are the finest vegetables I have ever seen.  Susan went back to the Factory last Friday & returns today, to remain a few days & go on with her work.  She has not staid with me yet.  I stopped at Mamma�s yesterday & carried herself & Ann to ride a little way.  It was the first time I had seen them since you were away.  I am so busy I will not be able to write to you again.  In my last letter I told you what to get.  India rubber for me.  Hat, ball, picture books for Willie.  Anna says you must bring her a doll, & Frank says an ip (whip) but I don�t say so.  I would like you to bring some little trifle for him, if it were only a 25 cts present.  Do not forget to draw the pattern of a fence.  The Mountaineer mentions Col. Town[e]s is to be the editor for a year & perhaps longer.  I have no news to tell.  I long to see you, & long to hear from you.  The children are quite well, & often say, �I want my Pa� & I reply I want him too.  Yours, E.F.P.
