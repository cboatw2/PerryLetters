Letter 254

Charleston

My dear husband

	We arrived here a short time ago & have a comfortable room at Mrs. Davis� up in the 4th story.  Mr. Arthur, Mr. Cox & Mr. Lec� took good care of us, & Mr. Pinckney who got in the Cars from Aiken at Branchville was also very kind.  Mr. Arthur hired a carri[a]ge & brought us to this house.  He is at the Charleston Hotel.  Our dinner was sent us upstairs.  I am undressed, & am very tired.  My hand is unsteady, from the motion of the Cars, & I only write to prevent your being uneasy.  I have borrowed pen ink & this half sheet of paper from Mrs. Davis.  An irish woman waits on us.  I will be glad to see you any time [page torn] come, but I do not think it worth [while] [page torn] to come down twice, unless you can remain several days each time.  I would rather you come for me & stay some time here.  Mr. Arthur says he & Mr. Cox can vote for the delegates who are absent (from Greenville) that is he�is entitled to vote for the other, so if you come here you will vote as a delegate, but if you are away. the others will vote for you, so it makes no difference of course.  I have seen none of my friends yet.  Tomorrow morning I will go & see them�.to me every day, & I will write Wednesday, if I have time, but if you do not hear, you must not be uneasy.  I missed you today.  No one can make up to me for you, but the gentlemen�very hard.  Mr. Pinckney said he would come & see me.  I paid 1 dollar for the hire of the carri[a]ge, & 50 cts to Mr. Arthur for ice creams.  He did not wish to take it, so I told him to give it to the children.  A boy has come for the�&c.  I must stop.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
