Letter 67

Monday afternoon, 12 October 1846
Greenville

My dear dear husband

	According to promise I write you how Frank is.  The Doctor this morning said he was better, & thinks if the medicine would only operate freely he would soon be well.  The medicine operating so slowly is the reason he is so long sick.  His throat is better, & his tongue cleaner.  This morning as he awoke, he asked if I was going to make cake today.  He then asked if Pa had come back.  I told him no.  He said he was afraid somebody would steal Pa.  I told him Pa would not let them.  He said they would steal Skylock.  He then asked to see his cap, then he wished to put it on.  Your uneasiness about him  must not bring you back sooner than you ought to come.  If there is any prospect of business, remain for it.  In these hard times the least prospect of business you can get is of importance.  Frank is doing just as well as if you were here, & as he is getting better, you must feel easy.  I have just written a letter to Aunt Eliza for my Aunts to carry.  It is now raining, so I think it probable they will not be able to go tomorrow.  It will be a disappointment to them, that I would rather the rain should have put off a few days longer.  They are to pass the night here, so as to set off early tomorrow.  They were here yesterday after church.  They asked me when they would see me in town.  I told them I did not expect to go, that travelling was expensive & that your journey had taken all the money you could afford.  They both said that the only expence would be the journey down & up, for of course I must stay with them, that they would always be glad to see me; they really are in earnest.

	I hope you will made a bargain with Col. Irby for Maria & James.  They are perfectly useless servants, at any rate sell James to him, & try to get 550.  March is so good tempered I am loth to part with him.  He is a pleasant servant for a lady, more so than Jim.  I would be willing to hire out Mary this winter.  She is such a pleasant servant I never wish to sell her.  Eliza could very easily�us wages by taking in work.  All these means we must resort to if your business fails, & what a Providence it will be if you can make Chancellor.  If not you will have to go to Congress, as the last resort.  It was only your Law practice that prevented your thinking of that & now if you have no law business, that objection is removed.  What bad news we have from Mexico, so much for War.  The spirits of the Volunteers will be�.  Poor Capt. Williams, you know who used to be with us in the Mansion house, he has been killed.  It is well his wife is dead, for what an affliction she is saved, but the orphan children are to be pitied & I dare say he had a second wife.  You know I have a painting over the Dining room Mantle peice which he gave me.  I shall always value it for his sake.  I liked him so much, that I am grieved at his death.  I am writing with such a bad pen, that you must excuse this ill looking letter, & I have been writing all the morning so that I am quite tired, & have also been obliged to stop frequently to attend to Frank.  Willie has staid at home this afternoon on account of the rain.  I today bought him a pr of shoes with his money & have given the others to Edward, as they fit him exactly.  I have tried to get some news of the election, & send you Mr. McHays statement.  I sent to Mr. N� & Mr. Watson who lives next the Court house, but would hear nothing satisfactory from them.  I then sent to Mr. Mc� & send you what he wrote me.  I see Dr. Crook�s name is not even mentioned.  He must have come out too la[te].  He is in Greenville village today.  I have not heard of any of th[e] other candidates being here.  Mr. Hoke I expect went to some other box to electioneer for I sent to know [fro]m him about the elections, but Mrs. Hoke said [he] would not be back until this evening.  I must now send my letter to the office.  Yours truly & sincerely & devotedly, E.F.P.
