Letter 67

Friday.  I wrote to you last night, but I have opened my letter this morning to write a few lines.  I have just read your letter in the Mountaineer.  I am surprised & disappointed at its being so short.  How could you write so little when you had a week to write in.  We depend on you for giving us information, so  you ought to give us more.  Let you next letters be longer & contain more.  I think Massachusetts has acted shamefully.  I more than ever disapprove of her conduct, & hope you will never take the part of her & her agents again.  The weather is today mild, & they are sowing the Oats at the farm.  March seems much better.  I should hardly think you will adjourn the 12th.  Mamma has now received her money, so she can pay Mr. Hoke & her other debts.  We are getting along quite well, so do not be worried about us.  You must get along well too.  Write us all the news.
