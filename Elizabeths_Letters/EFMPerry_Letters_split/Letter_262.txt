Letter 262

Sunday afternoon.  Aunt Elizabeth carried me to St. Phillips to hear the new Bishop.  He was a Lawyer from North Carolina, 52 years old, seems in feeble health, not animated, but a very good plain preacher.  Mr. Arthur reaches Greenville tonight 8 oclock, left here yesterday afternoon, & had a letter from Dr. Croft for you, which he was to have put in the Post Office at Columbia.  You must write me, whether you prefer my remaining here, or wish me to go to Columbia & meet you there & stay until your business is over, with you or go on to Greenville before you.  Either way I am willing to do, if it were not so expensive, I would be willing to stay here a longer time.  It is thought perfectly safe this month & the next.  I pass my time pleasantly, but I will be glad to see the children particularly Hext; & shopping takes so much money, that it is very unpleasant to go to shop, unless I had a good deal to spend, & I buy the things perhaps I could do without, & have to go without what I need.  It is dreadfully confusing, & dreadfully fatiguing, & I believe I would rather before I come again, write for what I wish, & when I do come not enter King st., where there is so much to tempt.  

	Straw Mating, China, towels &c I have not even looked at.  I would like very much to buy a new carri[a]ge, to put our new horses to.  If you come, you must price some.  

	I will now conclude & write to Susan, & before long I must dress & go to Uncle Arthurs.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I dined at Uncle Arthurs yesterday in company with Mr. Pinckney Alston & his daughter who we saw at Greenville.  He is so pleasant; he prevents a dinner party being stiff.  In the afternoon Aunt Elizabeth took us to ride round the Battery, which is a delightful place, very much extended & improved.  That & the Magnolia Cemetery are beautiful rides.  I have to dine at Aunt Mary McCall�s today, at 3 oclock.  She has just sent to repeat the invitation.  Tonight we are to take tea at Aunt Emily�s.  

	As I was out yesterday, I expect no one asked for letters at the Post Office for me, so I will send this morning.  After breakfast I am going to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, & tomorrow I hope she will carry me to return some visits.  Augustus Hoke came to see us last night, just as I got home from Uncle Arthurs.  He looks & seems quite well & offered to escort us to the island, but I do not think we will have time to go.  Several persons called yesterday while I was out.  The weather today is very pleasant.  I have not found it hot yet.  There is generally a breeze.  Today is quite warm.  I am afraid Greenville even after the road is finished will not be patronized by the lower country.  They say it is too hot,�that when they leave Charleston, they wish for a greater change so go to Buncombe or the mountains of Georgia.  

	I have written you I believe every Mail, which is more than you have done me.  I must now prepare to go down to breakfast.

12 oclock.  I have just received a letter from you, & the boy says, there are two more, but he has to pay postage, so I sent him back with 10 cts.  I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly.  I dare say more pleasantly than you would in Charleston, for the gentlemen in Columbia are congregated together; here if you stay at this house, you would be with no gentlemen you know, & may leave before your friends know you are here.  At the Charleston Hotel, you would find it pleasanter, but at this house I find it pleasant.  This morning I went to see Aunt Anna Turnbull, Aunt Haynes, & Aunt Eliza.  Aunt Anna is expecting Mrs. Bull Friday, & that day we are to dine with her, & after Mrs. Bull leaves, she is to stay only a day or two, but I know she thinks so of trouble & expense, that I do not think I will go, particularly as I do not wish to be obligated to anyone, & for a few days stay, expect to ask them to stay with me a summer.

	If you prefer not coming down, you must write me, for I wish you to consult your pleasure, & not come against your inclination.  I will today speak to Mrs. Davis & ask her terms.  Aunt Mary said 18 a week, 12 for me & 6 for Anna.  I hope if it is not more than that, I would rather be at a boarding house on account of the independent feeling that I have.  I have just received a letter from Susan & Willie.  They are all well.  Anna is quite well now & is to dine with me today at Aunt Mary McCall�s.  Tomorrow night we take tea at Aunt Haynes.  Perhaps tomorrow morning we go to the island. 

	I would like very much to buy some Matting for our drawing room, & the large chamber.  You can get it 25 cts a yd. 10 dollars for each room.  I wish you would be so good as to send me 20 dollars, if you are wil[l]ing for me to get it.  I also would like to get some Shades for our Drawing room, 3 of them.  I suppose 6 dollars would buy them & I wish some towels & a few large Table cloths.  If you are willing for me to get these things, send me the money, but if you would rather not, you need not.  The 40 dollars you sent me will pay two weeks board, so if you are not coming down, I am afraid to spend it, therefore have nothing now to make purchases with.  The Matting looks so cool & sweet & saves scouring.

	Mama wished me to get some money from Alston which will be due in a few days, to make some purchases for her.  I spoke to Aunt Brewton about it, but Alston has not sent me any.  If I could I would lend it to her, but I have it not.  

	My relations have been quite kind to me, & it is a pleasant change to come to the City for a while.  All I regret is, I have not more money to spend.  Uncle Arthur told me he was surprised to find you were willing to accept a Judgeship, as he supposed you made a great deal more.  I told him you had never been a Candidate.  He says if you had removed to Charleston before this, Mr. King who has a great regard for you would have helped you greatly.  I wish you would move & bring the paper here.  I have not seen a paper since I left home.  I wish you would send the Patriot.  I hear nothing of it.  I suppose Mr. Elford has not been to Columbia, as you do [not] mention him.  I think there is no risk in sending money.  If you think there is, you can direct your letters to the care of Wm Ed, but when I send my name written on paper, the letters are always brought me.  Write to me every day, that I may know your movements, & buy a nice setting Sack Coat, either in Columbia or in Charleston if you come.  I will return whenever you write me.  

	I am very glad you took a pleasant ride with Gov. Manning.  Persons here are more�of their horses than anything else, & keep them for show, not for comfort.  I have walked more than I do a year in Greenville.  Dinner company seems not as common as it was.  Eloisa Martin asked me to stay with her, but has not asked me to dinner, but I suppose she will.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
