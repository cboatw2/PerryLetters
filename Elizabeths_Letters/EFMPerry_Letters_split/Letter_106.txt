Letter 106

Saturday night, 29 March [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	Mr. Elford does not go until Monday but for fear tomorrow I may not have time to write, I will tonight write as much as I can.

	I will begin by telling you the news that Lindy this morning after breakfast was taken sick, & after dinner gave birth to an infant a girl.  She suffered I expect a great deal, but I am glad the event is safely over, & hope she & her child will do well.  It is a good�baby.  Fanny wishes upon having it as her maid instead of Sarah.  I think we will name it Caroline or Emily after one of Lindy�s sisters.  I sent first for Mom Phillis, & Mom Phillis afterwards begged me to send for Dr. Crooks so he was with her.

	I received your letter this afternoon by Mr. B�.  I sent your Editorial to the Printing office.   I am very sorry you fixed upon this time to have the sale at Tugaloo, instead of coming home.  I told you it was unwise.  A Mr. Cunningham came today to see you.  He thought a case had been brought against him which he wished you to defend, but looking at the records, thinks the case has not been brought.

	You have heard I suppose of the death of Mrs. Washington Earle.  She was sick only 2 or 3 days I believe with Cholic & I heard was speechless.  These are all [the] particulars I know.

	Mamma Ann Susan & the children [page torn]were with me.  Lucinda is sick�& the servant Mamma hires from Dr. Williams is sick.  My family are all well.  Fanny still goes to school.  She knows all her letters, says she is the smartest girl in school.  Anna & Willie took tea at Mrs. Hopkins last night & enjoyed themselves so much, they staid until after 11.  Frank went to the Court House to hear a blind girl play on the piano & sing.  He had no invitation to the party.

	Mamma Susan & myself called to see Mrs. Hoyt the other day, on account of her coming from Charleston, & knowing Aunt Hayne�s well.  She calls Mr. Hoyt & herself & the young couple.  They stay at Mr. Randolph�s.

	I hear Mr. Tom Lowndes & family are not coming up next summer.  They are going to France.  Dr. Dickson it is said wishes to purchase again in Greenville near the village or in the village.

	Mr. Carson has postponed his trip to California for some months.  He cannot get a passage I believe.  Old Mrs. McBee says she does not know where he will get the money from to carry them.  I hear Chandler has returned.  Got as far as the isthmus where he found too many waiting to get across.

	I am glad to hear of your professional good luck in these hard times.  A large fee is very acceptable.  I heard Mr. Wynn was going to bring suit for his daughter, so when you mentioned you  were employed I felt glad, but that feeling has passed away, & I wish it were on the other side you were employed.  I have no patience with a bold impudent girl encouraging a young man, or at any rate yielding to his wishes, & then [page torn] round & seeing him for what she is as much to blame [page torn] girl would never be in the situation of Miss Wynn.  Her father may be good, but I expect she inherits badness from her mother.  The whole family I believe are a worthless set.  Kelly while at Mamma�s spoke of this same Miss Wynn & said her husband a Mulatto man had connexion with her, & her master had a daughter who lived with a man without marrying, had a child & the man afterwards left her & she herself she said had children by her master & her masters son.  Someone told Mamma at the time that the servants & overseers are all alike.  I expect Miss Wynns character will be proved to be so bad (for so many were named as the father of her child) that you will lose the case.  So if you bring such a case, so demoralizing  to the community, & one that makes you so many enemies, you need to make up  for all you will suffer, secure to yourself a large fee, whether you [word botted] or not, 1000 dollars if you lose, 2000 if you gain.  I think you laid the damages too high.  She is not worth paying one cent to get rid of.  Make Mr. Wynn beforehand give his note.  I hope you will gain Mrs. � case & get well paid by Mr. Brown.   Now you are an old Lawyer & of some reputation  you ought to charge high fees where you have rich clients.  Write me about Miss Wynns case whether it is for breach of marriage promise you are suing? Or what? & whether it is to be tried this Court?  Mr. Barnwell Rhett has sent you Espy�s report on Meteorology, the Smithsonian report & Patent office reports on Agriculture.  No letters have come.  You have two of Espy just alike.    You can give one away.

	Have you heard Mr. Jones is a candidate for Con[gress].  I hardly like to make him of so [page torn] to mention it, but wish to know your opinion as to whether he will be elected.  I am sure I hope not, do not you think perhaps he may, those opposed to Mr. Orr & not knowing what a contemptible character Mr. Jones is, may take him up.  This does not look as if he was humbled by your exposure of him, or his bankruptcy; but as if he would show to the world at least, that he thought more of himself than ever.  Write me your opinion on the subject, what you think his motives are in offering, if he really thinks he will be elected or thinks it will give him importance even if defeated.  Mr. Luther says at Mrs. Earles funeral he was figuring about, giving himself great a[page torn] not looking like a broken man.  

	Tomorrow we will go to church for the last time in the building we have been going to for so many years.  It is to be pulled down & Mr. Arthur will preach in the Academy or McBee�s Hall.  I am sure he is not worth building a new church for.  I am sorry you have to give one cent for a person who I do not even regard as your friend.

	Susan says Mr. Campbell & Ioor are going to Florida to speculate in lands, not to live.  I wish they were going there to live. 
  
	If I have anything new to write you tomorrow I will write again.  The children are all asleep, & I will now follow their example.  [page torn] I expect is coming on well.  Reuben & Charles [page torn] [E.F.P.]

My dear husband

	Except to let you know we are well my letters can afford you very little interest, for I have nothing to write you about.  Today the Convention meets.  I hope you will have a pleasant time, that no unpleasant excitement or difficulty of any kind will occur.  Write me how long you will remain in Columbia, for I have a box in Charleston which I will wish sent to you, if it is ready in time.  I do not wish it sent after you leave, so as soon as you can ascertain let me know.


	Tell Willie I am glad he is with you, & hope he will return improved, & behave like a gentleman & set a good example to his brothers & sisters & not quarrel with them

	Yesterday was a fine day; today it is cloudy & looks like rain.

	I get along pleasantly in my household now cleaning is away, & it is a satisfaction as each week passes away to know that a few dollars have been added to your little income, & that the increase has been added without our denying ourselves, so it is a clean gain.  I do not think you will ever know what I suffered while under Minervas dominion.  If ever I wish[ed] you punished I will wish you in that situation.  Frank has just come from the Office & brought a pardon from the Governor for Mr. Nash for as much as relates to the imprisonment.  I have sent him to the Goal with Mr. Beaufort Watts letter, & will send the Pardon to Mr. McDaniel or Mr. Hoke.  Mr. Nash has just sent to know if he can come [word faded] of Goal just as soon as he wants to, & I have sent word just as soon as I have sent him the pardon.  I suppose he will go immediately to his family & surprise them.

	A letter came from Mr. Willis Brown asking your influence in electing him Treasurer of the Upper Division.  He says he is encouraged to ask your aid on account of your friendship for his deceased brother John G. Brown, together with himself, that it is only necessity  [that] induces him to apply for the Office.  The letter is dated Spring Grove, Laurens.  Says in his old age he is left with a helpless family to provide for, & except the assistance he receives from his son M.L. Brown of Columbia, they are dependant upon his individual exertions.  He writes early, before other applications are made to you.  A letter came desiring the Patriot to be sent to a different Post office.  I will send it to Mr. Elford.  The Metropolitan the newspaper sent to me came.  This is all.

	It is now raining.  I have no news to tell.  We are all well.  When I hear from you I will have more to write about.

	Mr. McDaniel has just come & taken the pardon so you see since I commenced writing a good deal has taken place.

	I hope to hear tomorrow this time from you.  Give my love to Willie.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I received a letter a few hours ago & for fear of being prevented answering if I postpone to later in the day, will answer it now.  I was very glad to hear from you, to know you had arrived safely, & met with no disagreeable incident.  The Patriot I am gratified to hear is noticed, & its Editorials made of importance.  If I were a member of the Convention, I would propose the State should leave the Union, & remain out of the Union forever, the Secessionists remain in her, & henceforth remain devoted to her, & her only.  The Union men remove to some other State where they can have peace & quiet, their principle be appreciated, & themselves have an equal share of honors & office with their fellow citizens.  South Carolina will be no loss to the Union, but a good riddance, & she & her selfish & vainglorious sons.  The Union can go on prosperously without her, & she has abused it so long, it is time now she should leave it.  I am glad Willie is satisfied & hope he is enjoying himself.  Tell him though he will not be here May day to participate in its pleasures.  He will be represented by his second self Hocky.  Frank Hoke has asked Frank to let Rudd have Hocky to ride on May day, as he is one of the Marshall[s], & I have given my consent, that if he is alive then, for being now under the sole care of Reuben the Horse killer, I am under daily apprehension of some morning hearing the news, �Hocky is in the stable lying down & cannot get up.�  Reuben has a mysterious way of getting rid of all our horses.  Charles says he killed 7 pair of Mrs. Harrisons.  So I am forgetting next Spring, new carri[a]ge, new horses, a new Coachman , all at the same time.

	Yesterday I wrote you word that we were all well.  A few hours later, I would have written, there are three of your family sick, for at night Mary came from the Spring complaining of pain in her chest, Charlotte pain in her stomach, & this morning Minerva came from the Mansion house with pain in her head.  Charlotte I gave a dose of oil to, & she is now well.  Mary is so useful, I dread her being sick, & for fear of Pneumonia which is so fatal, I sent her at once to Dr. Dean�s & he gave her some pills, & said he thought the pain proceeded from her liver.  This morning I gave her Castor oil, & when the medicine has effect she will I think be better.  She is at her work, says the  pain is not as bad as it was.  Her habits being so irregular, & she so careless about herself, I expect is what makes her so often unwell.  Minerva had taken medicine from Mrs. Irwin before she came over, & is now in her room.  I am sorry whenever I see her come in the yard.  I never intend to have her as my servant again, if I can help it.  I went in to see her & found her the same impudent creature still.  I left her room in thankfulness that she was sewing others & not myself.  Your wife & children are at any rate well, & I hope will continue so.  Frank commences school tomorrow.

	Mr. Ward came yesterday to see you.  Mr. Hoke came over Saturday morning, thought you were not to leave until Saturday night.  He had Mrs. Blassingame�s marriage settlement, which had been sent him from Columbia, & he did not know what to do with it.  This morning your letter, the Lady�s book, & the Southern Review were all that came from the Post office.  I wish at Newberry you had seen Mr. Williams, & he had performed his promise.  Be economical, recollect this time next Spring, I will be with you on my way to Charleston, to buy new Carri[a]ge, & many necessaries we need, & you must save now for that purpose, & some summer before I get old, I do wish to go to New Haven, & look once again at places I will never forget.  If I were rich, I would wish for us all to go & end our days there.  I have no love for Carolina, where you will never meet with your reward.  You labour you save the State, others know it in their hearts, & are ever glad of it, but they give you publicly no credit for, & as for honoring you with Office & Distinction, they never dream of it, but to the end of your days, will heap abuse on you, & stigmatize you as a Submissionist, a term that at once excludes you from honor, & this is their object in applying  it.  They are thankful to you for being a Submissionist, & yet try to disgrace you  by the Epithet.

	You must not forget to see old Mr. Hearn.  Dr. Irvine must indeed have been anxious to be elected as he had determined to go to Columbia.  He would like to have been honored as a Delegate, & had his expenses paid.  I suppose he will expect great attention from the Governor, in return for his hospitality, selfish hospitality truly.  

	Hext looks well, & I believe does not miss you at all, & yet will be delighted to see you.  If it were not for him I would have been in Columbia with you,  Old Mr. Miller was here this morning, inquired about the Convention that the Leaders who boasted of State Right were State Wrong, that Mr. Hunter had not gone to the Convention when now was the time for him to benefit the people.  He was electioneering for Clerk, & he hoped he would be beaten.  He mentioned your�about Genl Wallace.  He is a sensible old man.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Wednesday morning, 20 minutes of 10 oclock, 28 April 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just read your letter to Anna.  She is at school, & will be pleased when she comes home to hear from you.  I write only because later in the day, I am generally interrupted.

	I am glad to tell you that the blacks portion of your household are almost well.  Minerva yesterday after dinner, returned to the Mansion House where I hope she will remain.  Charlotte recovered entirely of her pain.  Mary while I was writing I believe stopped ironing. & lay down, & looked so stupid�& complained of the pain in her chest. & the medicine not acting much, I sent for Dr. Crooks.  He was at Laurens so I sent for Dr. Dean, & he said the pain proceeded from improper eating, that it was not Pneumonia, & he gave her Blue pills, prescribed Mustard plaster & Sage tea, & this morning she is up, & says she feels well.  I always like Dr. Deans prescriptions.  He says he would rather treat any disease than Pneumonia, that the lungs are effected (or affected) a vital part, & before you are aware the Patient is in danger, he dies.

	This morning Frank while dressing came into the room crying, with his face swollen, & said his cheeks being�, I expect he has the Measles which are all about.  So I have not sent him to school, but he is playing now, & seems in no pain.  He was afraid at first, they would kill him.  If the children will only wait & take them after May day I will not be sorry, as it is as well to have them now, as any other time, but I have fitted them in clothes for May day, so do not wish to lose my trouble.  Frank I expect will be well by then, so I am not troubled on that account.  He is grieving over the loss of his last pigeon which Charlotte with delight told him Minervas cat had eaten.

	Fanny complained of costiveness last Saturday, & I gave her a dose of Oil & last night again, & I gave her Rhubarb.  I am afraid at school she does not go out as often as she wishes, which will be very bad for her, so I dare say I will keep her at home, if she complains often in this way; otherwise she is well.  I have kept her at home today.

	Hext is quite well & steps about holding to something.  He crawled upstairs yesterday.  I followed after him.  He had a flower he wished to put in his mouth, & was going upstairs where I would not see him, & when he got to the top of the stairs, he dropped the flower, a fit emblem of what comes often in life.  I believe I have no news at all to tell you.  Except to church I have not been out.  Mrs. Col. Irvine & Susan Hoke are the only persons who have been to see me.  I owe almost everyone visits, so I expect few visitors until I visit myself.   

	I am glad everything in the Convention goes on well, that the Members are cordial to you, & you are passing your time agreeably.  If you are enjoying yourself & treated with the respect you deserve, it is all I wish, I am happy.  I would be willing to be shut up in the Penitentiary you wish to build, if at the same time, you were receiving some deserts from your fellow men; but what makes me unhappy, is, that you should be unrewarded, & others so far your inferiors, in merit & ability should receive the prize you have won.  My. Orr so much your inferior in every respect, beat you for Congress & so it will be to the end of your life.  I must see you rewarded with some high Office or Honour before I leave this world.  I am thankful however for my many blessings, & first of all for my dear kind husband.  You have not mentioned Judge O�Neal[l] & your Daguerreotype.  How is your life & likeness progressing.  I hope you will have a good Daguerreotype taken  to transmit your intellectual features to posterity & that Judge O�Neal[l] will do your character justice & write with more warmth & spirit than you did of yourself & as regards one incident of your life, explains it in such a way as to exonerate you from blame, more than you did yourself.

	From what you say yourself & the Greenville Delegates except old Mr. McBee must be rooming together.  Is it so.  Mr. C� ought not to be unwell.  I suppose the life he now leads is so new to him, it does not agree with him.

	The poem you mention ought not to class you with Mr. Memminger Butler Orr & such who are influenced only by personal feelings, to keep themselves in power & gain Office & honor.  You stand apart, one the only one of prominence, who have acted from disinterested motives.  You lose everything, gain nothing, & have the independence to be stigmatized as a Submissionist, which deprives you of all hope of advancement & which str� prevents the others coming out as Union men.  I do hope though such nobleness will be rewarded.  

	I saw Genl Thompson�s carri[a]ge pass out of the village this morning, I suppose going to bring up himself & family.  I am sorry, wish he would always remain away, particularly now he courts you, & you are so foolish as to unite your prospects with his.  No one likes him, & it is his going over to your side that caused all the excitement at the Memminger meeting, & your predicted downfall.  He will never be of any good to you.  In his�he would not advance you if he could.

	I am glad Willie is enjoying himself.  It is a great pleasure to hear from you, but if you are too busy to write, let Willie write one line, to say you are well.  Truly, E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter, & am very glad to hear from you.  I will write at once, because Susan is coming in to try on a dress Eliza is making, & she may stay the remainder of the day.  At any rate something will occur to interrupt me.  I believe as I read the other day in a newspaper, that one hour in the morning is worth two in the afternoon & whatever I wish done well, I do in the morning, when I feel most capable of exertion.  

	I am glad you are passing your time pleasantly, & Willie is behaving well.  I hope your dinner at Col. Williams will end with the fee being paid you. but as he is not obliged to pay, I know he will not, you say he will, if he does, I will give you credit, for a better judgment than I have.
	As for my relations, no neglect from them surprises me.  Mr. Taylor has never asked you to his house, since you have been going to Columbia, & if he were ever to ask you, I hope you would not accept the invitation.  I know when I go to Columbia, I will not enter his house, & I would like you to go to Columbia, if it were only for the purpose of refusing any attention from Mrs. Taylor to show her my feelings.  It was giving vent to my true feelings that made me write so literally to Aunt Eliza, & she either deceitfully, or certainly knowing very little of the matter said everyone connected with her, had always without any exception entertained the kindest feelings to you.  She could with truth have said exactly the reverse,  I have learnt to expect nothing but unkindness from my relations, & unkindness from those who you ought to receive kindness from, can neither be forgiven or forgotten, & make your feelings more bitter, than towards strangers who you have no claim on.  In a political view my relations have always, before you entered the family I suppose & will always dislike you, for they being contracted & selfish in their views, of course will be on an opposite side from you & they look upon you as the chief cause of preventing Harmony in the State, the one who has opened the eyes of the people, & prevented them from carrying out their selfish views, prevented their aggrandizing themselves on the peoples ruin.  Of course you will be the object of dislike to such persons.  Mrs. Taylor never paid Willie any attention in Columbia, & then deceitfully turned the tables on me, & told Mrs. Thomas she was very much hurt that I had not sent Willie immediately to her house to stay, that it was what she would have done if her son had come to Greenville; but enough of them we are not dependent on them.  Your friends are certainly a distinct set from�.  Mr. Pettigru, Judge Huger &c.  They have not heretofore assimilated with.  I am delighted to hear of the�as regards your being United States Senator.  I will live on that hope, & will be satisfied, when that is realized.

	Frank when I told him of your pleasure at Hext�s improvement asked what you said about him.
He has the Mumps.  Dr. Dean looked at his face this morning, but said nothing need be done for it.  He must not run in the yard when it was cold.  Fanny is well.  Mary looks ailing, but goes about.  Dr. Dean said she must take Blue pills again tonight.  She still has the pain in her chest, which shows disordered stomach.  The rest of the household are well, & I do assure you I keep house delightfully with my former illtempered cook away.  Lindy makes good bread, rolls, tea, cake, & above all she does whatever I tell her.  Whoever will give 1000 dollars for Minerva may have her.  Bad temper does not lessen her value to those who have the power (which I never had) of governing her & she is as capable a servant as ever was.  

	I am glad you are honoured in the Convention.  You I hoped would be one of the Committee.  I am afraid you will not remain in Columbia long enough to receive my box.  You must have my thimble mended  & after the Convention attend to your tooth.  Yesterday a letter from Mr. Verner came, one from Mr. Cochran about his Law case against Charles, one from Mr. Sawyer of Asheville about a suit he wished you to bring for some land near Union left to a family named F�, but who have never had it in possession.  He wishes the suit brought if you think they can gain it.  The land is worth 10,000 & you would get he says a good fee if recovered.  You would have to use the very opposite arguments you used for the Paris�s.

	Susan is now here, & I am writing while talking to her.  The children all have holiday until Tuesday.  Now to prepare for May day, & Monday to clean up.  I will be glad to hear from Willie.  I will write an account of May day, & how Hochy performs his part.  I have not a particle of news to tell you.  Charles & Reuben go every day to the Farm, & I hope are doing well.  In the morning Charles hoes in the garden.

	Though I expect no attention from our family, I am still glad that Isaac Hayne & yourself are friendly, & in the first instance he wrote you an apologetic letter, & what vexed him was that he had done it, & we did not accept it, so I think he at first was disposed to conciliate.  Mr. Perroneau I hardly know.  Politics now makes him treat you coldly, for he used to call on you in town & seemed to like you.

	Always write the hour in which you are writing.  Then I can understand better at what time all you write about occurs.  The Duncans being with Willie must make him enjoy himself more than if he was alone.  Let him do as he pleases about returning with them.  I read your Editorials in the Patriot.  Dr. M� I thought [word faded] Senator from Newberry, you said he had never before represented the people.  I am sorry your feet hurt you.  You must have your likeness taken, & send me the doggerel poem. [E.F.P.]

Friday morning, ? past 8 oclock, 30 April 1852

Dear Willie


	I have just received your letter & your Papa�s last night, & this time will write to you.  I am sorry you did not write a longer letter, but thank you for the short one.  Your Papa is so busy I make allowance for his short letters.

	Mary is still sick.  As she did not get better I sent for Dr. Crooks , who I always feel has a right to be our Physician & who was out, when I first sent, which made me send for Dr. Dean.  He is now prescribing for Mary, & she says she feels better today.  Mary being sick, & Minerva hired out, & Lindy taken up with her baby, has made us all depend on ourselves for fixing the house almost entirely.  I am glad to tell you Anna has excited herself, & with Charlottes help, has fixed the whole house already, & now gone up to the Academy to help dress it with flowers.  Lindy has to finish ironing, & Charlotte has gone to the Spring to wash, & Sarah is minding Hext.  John has gone to Mama�s to carry some chickens to Susan, to bring in two Chairs to send to the Academy to dress with flowers for Fanny & Anna to sit in at Flora�s.  A Ham that was boiled yesterday will serve us for dinner, so you see even when in a straight like the present, if the children perform their duty we can get along.  The House cleaning has not commenced yet.  John Smith was engaged this week & cannot come to Whitewash until Monday, so we will have very little time to clean up before you return.  It will have to go on slowly, even after you come back.

	Frank still has the Mumps, & is very much afraid he will not be able to march tomorrow.  He plays about as usual, & this morning when I told him he must not go out, he cried & said he promised to meet Alex Hunter at some corner of the street, & he must go.  He has escaped & gone.  This morning Dr. Crooks was examining his cheeks, & Frank resisted, & Dr. Crooks said, �you must not do so, don�t you know when your Papa is gone, I am a kind of papa to you all.�  Frank says if he does not participate in the May day pleasures, he may get back his 15 cts.  If you were here, after all you might have had the Mumps, & been obliged to stay at home, for you would have been for concealing your swollen cheeks, not displaying them like Frank.

	I have not had a glimpse of Hochy since you left, but I make frequent inquiries after him, & give cautions concerning his good treatment.  I hope tomorrow he will behave himself well.  My interest will be divided between Hochy & the Flora�s.  Next year you can ride on him as a Marshall.

	Hext looks well.  He does not walk yet alone, but walks about with very little assistance.  He gets more interesting every day.  This morning I taught him how to kiss.  

	There came from the Mail this morning a long communication from Asheville, contradicting the assertion Mr. Wh� made in his Temperance lecture about the Scripture use of wine, that in some parts of the Bible it was unfermented Wine, in others fermented.  It proved from the original Hebrew, that Wine is always fermented, that there is no such thing as unfermented Wine, & where it is denounced, it is the immoderate use of it.  He says temperance is a Christian virtue, which can never be too sedulously inculcated, but the lame attempt to wrest the scriptures will injure not benefit the cause.  He says he admires St. Paul who voluntarily would abstain from anything on his brothers account, but when it was sought to ensnare his conscience, & to tamper with his Christian liberty & discretion on false grounds, he would submit, no, not for an hour.  This is my opinion, I will not take wine, on account of my childrens sake, I will voluntarily abstain from it, that they may follow my example.  I will follow the dictates of my conscience, which is more noble, than promising a few individuals, who in all probability you care not for, & whose opinion you do not respect, promise them not to do wrong.  I do not desire you should ever drink a drop of wine, & particularly until you are of your Papas age, & there is no danger of your indulging too freely.  I wish you to follow your Papas example & be actuated by a good conscience, & a sense of morality, virtue & religion.  These must govern you.  These are noble motives, & I have confidence in you, that your character is one to be influenced by such motives, & not by the far less noble of one. Of a promise to a few boys trifling ones for the most part, but I have said more than I intended & will tell you of something amusing.  Last Sunday at the Hall, I forgot to carry my prayer book so when I went in church, I took Annas from her.  While the Prayers were being read, Willie Earle who was in front of Anna, took the opportunity very slyly as he thought, to hand Anna his Prayer book, which she had the ill manners to refuse.  A short time after, she removed her seat to another desk.  I noticed Anna moved her [word faded] & wondered why, & noticed that Willie Earle looked rather vexed.  I had not seen the offer of the prayer book.  Susan saw it & told me afterwards.  Is it not amusing to see a little girl, vexed at attentions, that in a few years later, she will covet, & displaying rudeness, which before long, she will be surprised at.  I mention this little incident to amuse you.  Do not mention it, as Anna will be vexed if you do.

	Tell your Papa I am glad his resolutions were approved of.  I have seen no paper mentioning the Convention, except the Patriot.  I am sorry the Duncans have left you.  Your Papa forgot to carry down the Tea nuts for Dr. Blanding & the other gentlemen.

	I have come to the end of my sheet, so must stop.  E.F.P.

Sunday morning, ? past 10, 2 May 1852

My dear husband

	I have just sent off Anna, Fanny, & Frank to Church, & before I read to myself, will perform my duty to you.  Yesterday was May day, & getting ready so many children, Mary being still sick, & having to do it principally myself, fatigued me & gave me a headache, which though I partly slept off last night, I still have a little left & preferred staying at home this morning & resting, & go to church this afternoon.

	Dr. Crooks went to his farm Friday morning & said he might not return soon as he might find more of his servants sick.  I think he must have done so, as last night he had not come back.  Mary is getting better, & comes down into the kitchen. But she has not come into the house yet.  This put me to great inconvenience, so I live in great discomfort & make me reconciled & even pleased you are not here & I would rather live as I do than [to] have Minerva back again.  Since she is away, the other servants do better.  This morning while Lindy was fixing the house, Edward made some biscuits, & Eliza washed the dishes.  A general happiness has been diffused throughout the household since Minerva�s departure.

	Yesterday I received no letter from you, which disappointed me greatly.  This morning before I was up, Mr. Duncan sent you packages, & after breakfast when I sent to the Office a letter of yours came, which I expect I ought to have received yesterday, as it was written before the one Mr. Duncan brought.  I suppose there was some carelessness in the Columbia Post office.

	I will have scarcely room to tell of May day.  Frank was at the School House all day, until 10 oclock at night, looking at the Tableaux & eating.  Very different from last May was this, for everybody I hear had plenty to eat.  Frank asked this morning how long it would be before May day would come again, so he must have enjoyed it.  Anna also did.  She returned home in the afternoon. Dressed anew, went back again, & staid until 10 oclock at night.  The little H� I think had very little pleasure, their poor little feet had to paddle along so fast, they were quite worn out.  Fanny dwells on the �ness of the Queen, who said she wished she had a stick to make them go faster.  The Queen if she noticed us, must have been mortified at observing our attention was entirely on the H�, not on her.  Her iron rule it is well bestowed only for a day, & her subjects were rebellious, for they would have the Tableaux, which she objected to.  I looked at them from the carri[a]ge, did not go into the schoolyard.  All of the Marshalls walked, so Hocky was not used,  Rudd strutted about in a cocked hat.  The sun was so hot, it was enough to give them all fevers.  Hext was out, & looked sweetly.  I am glad the Convention adjourned in harmony.  I wish your resolutions had been adopted by the whole, but they paid you more respect that Mr. Memminger.  I long to read the account of the Convention in the next Patriot.  I read your Editorial this morning, & sent it to Mr. Elford with your printed Resolution & Mr. Greggs.

	You must be sure & have your likeness taken, for without these the life is far less interesting.  You must stay in Columbia for the purpose if necessary.

	I recollect in Columbia the servant at Maybins saying Mrs. Hemming a widow kept a boarding house opposite.  I suppose it is her son Miss Walker married.  I thought when she kept school she would meet with someone, as schoolteachers always manage to make a match.  As she is so unpleasantly situated at home with a stepmother. It is a providential thing for her to get a husband.

	Mr. Burketts business being of less interest to me, than your  own,  I did not mention it. as I had not room for all, but I have opened the letter now, & will tell you what is in it.  Mr. Verner says he obtained a note on Mr. Hunnicut for 4 dollars, at a Muster, which he agreed to have paid in the fall; that Mr. Burkett says all are well & progressing at the Farm.   The Corn short 40 bushels, Lard 50 lbs.  Shucks one load which he paid for himself, which amount can lie, until he has some settlement about the notes in his hand for collection.  The country generally healthy.  One of the Mares at Burkett has a fine mule, & something about R� Susan Perry was here.  Friday, her Grandmother had toothache�  A letter came this morning about some change in Post office & one from John C. Sullivan about some Law business.  You must try your best for the Paris� not to get a new trial.  Mr. Luther I am afraid & Susan never can be happy.  An un� wife wife perhaps might be able to resign herself, but no other.  What do you think of his sitting down almost naked to breakfast only in his shirt, & going over the house before children & servants, & strange servants in that condition.  Vardry even asked if it was right for Pa to come down naked.  He is still harping on the Joyce estate.  Mr. Hoke told him the estate was 160000 dollars, & he had given security only for 20 .  Mr. Luther told him he could give security for 500000 dollars.  Soon after Mr. Joyce died, old Mr. McBee sent for Mr. Luther to go to see him, & when he refused to go, sent again, & Mr. Luther went, & on his return home Susan asked him for what he was sent, & he said to talk about Mr. Joyne�s will, so Susan thinks his father put it into his head to try & get it.  You know he persuaded him to run for Ordinary, an Office he was entirely unfitted for.  So if this is so. You make old Mr. McBee give security to you, that you may not lose.  Pinckney is not as bad as Mr. Luther & is better off.  He has carri[a]ge, buggy & 3 horses.  

	Tell Willie when he returns I am going to have a May day in the orchard, so he must bring me a pound of cocoa nut & one dozen nice oranges.  This will do instead of any presents for the children.  Anna will be Queen & he must deliver an address.  It will be pleasanter than the Academy May day.  I have come to a close.  Hext is now playing on the floor. E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter & Wilie�s & am obliged to you for them.  I was holding Hext while reading them, & gave him the envelopes to play with.  Mary was taken sick two days after you left, & though almost well now, does nothing in the house, & very little of anything in the kitchen.  Lindy works, Milks, minds her child[,] helps wash & iron, so of course can do nothing in the house.  Eliza works for Mamma, Susan, Ann as well as my family, so I can take her as seldom as possible from her sewing.  Sarah or Charlotte have to mind Hext, so it leaves you perceive almost nobody to clean the house.  So I have lived in greater discomfort than I have known at housekeeping, & the house is dirtier than I have ever seen it, but I am far happier than if Minerva were here with her insolent tongue & things were cleaner.  John Smith disappointed me & did not come yesterday to whitewash. & says he cannot come until Thursday.  If so the house will be confusion the night you return, but I have sent to ask him to come tomorrow, & allow me one day to clean up before you come back.  If he cannot come tomorrow, I will have to put off the whitewashing until next week.  I like it done every year, because we are obliged to clean every corner, & cleanliness promotes wealth.  But when I tell you it was fever Dr. Crooks thought Mary had, you will be thankful that she is soon getting well, & that all the rest of us have continued well.  All of Dr. Crooks negroes are getting well, & Mary is almost well.  She only takes Bitters to strengthen her.  She is so careless I expect her to be sick as long as we have her.  Frank is well, & none of the others have as yet taken the Mumps.  You tantalize me when you tell me of Mr. Rhett�s resignation.  He is right, for as a Secessionist, he misrepresents the State, but no other Secessionist ought to be elected his Sucessor.  You of course ought to be, but as you do not try for yourself, & have no friends so disinterested as to try for you, your claim will always be passed over.  If you had only got some friends to bring you to the Governors notice, I am certain you would have received the appointment, & what a triumph after being defeated for the other house, but of course you will be overlooked, so I am provoked as I am always with you, for doing nothing to promote your interest, but as usual letting others get ahead of you.  Some honor of this kind would be the making of your family in this  world, so you ought to make every honorable exertion for your advancement.  Persons like Mr. Martin of Abbeville always express what you ought to have & what is due you, but no one tries to get you your due.

       I am glad your Daguerreotype is taken & so fine a one.  Copys are always cheaper after taking one, so I wish as my present, you would have a Daguerreotype taken like the one you are to send to Mr. Livingston, only finished, & bring me.  A second one should be taken for far less than the first.  I hope Judge O�Neal[l]  will write your life better than you did.  Altogether I was not satisfied with it, & look to him to do you justice.  I am glad Mr. Finley spoke cordially to you.  I know our family in their hearts respect you, but in politics having been always on opposite sides, gives them a reserved feeling to you, & you yourself are reserved to them, for your manners, as I very often tell you are repulsive & you think others cold to you, when it is only a reflection of your unintentional coldness to them, you need me by to soften things.  Politics creates bitter feelings as I know by experience.  Think of the Cunningham family who formerly were your best friends, have now changed into enemies.  You say you did not recognize Mr. Finley, so he might have thought you rude, when you did not mean to be rude at all.

	You must not forget to have my thimble mended.  I hope Willie will come back very much improved.  Yesterday afternoon we had a fine rain, which was greatly needed, & today Charles & Reuben are ploughing the bottom land & planting it, as it is in good condition to be done.  Charles attends to the garden every now & then.

	Mrs. Poinsett is now at her place.  I believe her son is with her.  Last Sunday afternoon Mr. Arthur had no service, & we went to the Baptist church to hear Mr. Furman, but he is away. & there was a Prayer meeting held instead of preaching.  Mr. Elford made a prayer a very good one.  After service he called to me as I came out of church, & said he had an Editorial sent him that morning of yours, which he would send to me to read.  I told him I had read it, & sent it to him.  He said he thought it had been sent by mistake to him.  You know Mr. Duncan brought it & sent to me, & I sent to Mr. Elford, & he was not up, & seeing the Envelope directed to me, & not knowing who sent it to him, thought there was some mistake	.  I have not sent him the Temperance communication yet.  It is directed to you, & he I expect will not publish it, & I want you to read it.

	I like you, wish Anna to be modesty itself, but at the same time polite, & I think it was rude to refuse the prayer book.  If a fan is offered me & I do not wish it, for fear if I refuse I will hurt the persons feelings.  Little attentions ought to be accepted with politeness & at the same time modestly.  A little girl who is afraid it shows her to be bold.  If she looks at a boy, perhaps is bolder than one who looks at him with perfect indifference.  I wish our children to be modest, easy & polite, but not forward & bold & rude.  I think with our training they will pursue the right course, as we ourselves have.  

	If I have time I will write to Willie.  We will all be very glad to see you.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Dear Willie


	I have written to your Papa, & as you are now at leisure, & not much to occupy you, it may give you pleasure to read a letter from me. So I will write to you.  I will first tell you of Hochy, who you are most interested in.  He was not used May day, as I have informed you.  I saw Rudd strutting about with a cocked hat on, & though he would not have graced Hochy much.  Aunt Anne inquired what plain looking person he was.  I dare say he is good, which is far better than good looks, but he is not as handsome as Hochy.  Sunday afternoon Reuben put Hochy & Selim in the carri[a]ge & drove us a little way.  It seemed to me both horses looked thin.  It may be I only imagined it, for I expect no horse under Reuben�s care  to do well, & I am aways expecting to see them looking thinner & thinner.  Reuben said Hochy was quite well, & had been used very little to haul wood.  He is so young, it gives no pleasure to use him, for fear it hurts him, so I determined not to use him often in the carri[a]ge.  Anna wrote you a letter Sunday.  She would not let me read it, so you must make allowances for mistakes, as she composed & wrote it entirely herself.  Yesterday she wrote to her Papa, & I read that.  I was amused at her arrangements for the May day she is to have; at everyone having a part assigned them, & when it came to Alex�s carrying the May pole, I laughed aloud.  Hext will be an odd little H�, unless he walks alone before that time.  There will have to be a third H� to lead him & the Procession will have to make a very short circuit, in consideration of his little feet.  I hope you will acquit yourself well on the occasion, & that your first effort as a public speaker, will foreshadow who you are to be in after life.

	The boys gave a party last night to the girls.  Anna wished to go, but as you were not here to go with her, I was very glad it rained so hard, that she could  not go.  I hardly think any girl could have gone, & it was not in the favor of any who did go.  Until girls grow up, they should show themselves very little in public, & even then only occasionally.  They should be retired & modest, though at the same time polite.

	Franks mumps have troubled him very little.  He has gone about as usual except the first day he stayed from school.  He has gone to school this week.

	Mr. Wallace Thompson�s judgment I think very bad, to tell you, you ran about too much & neglected your school.  Judge Butler would have told you differently.  The foundation you lay out at school is very important, but the knowledge you gain in the occasional trips you make from home, are of great benefit to you, & will be through life, & give you information, that probably you never would have. If you staid all the time at home, went to school, & devoted yourself to Grammar, Geography Arithmetic &c.  Perfection in these studies, would make you a good schoolmaster, enabling you to impart  the same knowledge to others, but as you are to be a Lawyer or Statesman or something of this kind, you must have a knowledge of mankind, in general information matters & things which you can never gain at school only.  Your occasional association with the good & great has already done I hope much for you; for you know Hugh Thompson told his mother you knew something on every subject mentioned.  Your character it seems to me is different from the other little Willie[s], who stay at home, & whose Papas are not like yours, who have not the advantages you have.  You are more enlightened, & ought to be better than they are, when you think of the trouble & expense your Papa puts himself to, to improve you, so you must come back a man in behaviour, & such a thing as quarreling with Frank, & being rude & unkind to Anna & Fanny you must be above, & be respectful to your Mama & not scold the servants.  I would have sent your letter to your Grandmama to read, but as you forgot to send your love to her, I thought she would be hurt at the neglect, so did not send it.  She takes great pride in you, as you are her oldest grandchild.

	The Temperance Cadets turned out May day, & were very intemperate in eating.  I believe if it were not for the marching occasionally, & the scarfs & banners the company would not be near as large as it is.  I hope nobler motives than these will influence you to be good, virtuous & temperate.  Read your bible & be governed by the principles there inculcated.  We are all born sinful creatures, but some certainly even by nature more virtuous than others.  Your Papa is innately virtuous, & I hope his children may be like him.

	If you come home Thursday night, tomorrow I will write my last letter to Columbia.  When you return you must devote yourself with increased application to your studies.

	I hope Paul Hayne�s talents will be of some use, & not like some of his cousins, but what was his end.  He had no energy & was wanting in many things, but he was sensitive & many allowances must be made for him.  I am glad your Papa dresses so well, as to be observed.  He loves you�, [E.F.P.]

My dear husband

	I will write you a few lines, though with a shocking pen, to prevent your being more anxious than is necessary.  Dr. Crooks this morning said Edward was doing reasonably well, that with the fever he has, the patient one day is better, the next day perhaps worse, & sometimes so for 12 or 15 days, sometimes longer before they begin actually to get better.  He also says that there is not so much danger of the fever spreading in the yard, as if one of the servants about us had it, for then it would have originated on our premises, & the same cause would give it to others, but that Edward was not living here, his sickness originated elsewhere.  You know Mr. Dyer said he had 3 servants sick like him.  All the rest of the family are well, & I hear of no new sickness anywhere.  I expect certainly to see you Saturday night & wish you would come back sooner, as you are to leave Sunday.  You ought to give me one day at least.   Take care of yourself.  I hope Frank is behaving well.  You must not be uneasy about us.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

My dear daughter

	You only left yesterday, but I am certain your Paper will be gratified to hear from home as soon as he reaches Columbia, so I will write now, that you may hear the very moment you get there.  This letter will be travelling along the Rail Road the same time with yourself.  Little will you know of it, that there is a letter travelling along with you telling how we all are.  I am sorry you had such a bad day yesterday but am glad that today the weather is so fine.  I hope you are well & behaving well, & that your Papa feels better than when he left.  We are all the same, as we were yesterday morning.  I have been busy today helping Mary fix upstairs, which has been in great disorder for several weeks past.  I am now tired so thought I would rest & write to you.  You must tell me everything in your letters, who you see, what they say to you, how you enjoy yourself &c. &c.  I was gratified to see you display some feeling on leaving home, for though I wish you to enjoy yourself when you leave home, I wish you to be attached to home & prefer it to every place.  I hope & believe you will spend your time pleasantly.  Everything will be new to you.  If you can get a very pretty Silver comb in Columbia at a reasonable price, get it, but if not, wait until you get to Charleston.  After you have made all the purchases you need, write me word how much money you have left.  Your Papa had better give you 30 dollars.  Buy some Castile Soap to clean your teeth with the morning after you get to Columbia. I forgot to give you any; 6 cts worth is enough, & you will find it very useful.  It whitens the teeth, & cleans them easier in this cold weather, than the water alone.  I forgot to put up your Barege Sack,, & one nice pr of  fine tucked pantalets, I saw in your drawer today, which I ought to have packed up.  Do not forget the Castile Soap.  I am going to buy 3 peices this evening for each of the childrens room.

	Nothing more from the Post office this morning.  Fanny missed you yesterday & wished you were here.  Willie little while ago came from school with your bucket in his hand, grumbling that he had to bring it�Mrs. Hopkins called him in as he passed & begged him to bring it home.  I am glad it has been found.  Fannys shoes were broken, & as it was so wet I let her stay at home today.  Frank has gone to school.  Willie is now learning his lessons.  Fanny is seated on the floor putting on her stockings which  she had taken off.  Hext is in the little dining room playing with the�to the stove.  Charlotte has gone to Mrs. Mauldins to carry Mary Mauldins book mark & pocket handkerchief you left for her; the other book marks for Mr. & Mrs. Hopkins Fanny will carry tomorrow.  I have no news to tell.  Charles has gone to the Farm to get wood.  I have been busy cutting out clothes for the servants & helping make them, but I go to bed regularly at 9 oclock.

	I hope you will not have to stay long in Columbia.  As you have gone down so late, you will have but a short time to stay in Charleston.  

	I will write perhaps again tomorrow, but if I do not you may know I have nothing to write about.  Write to me & behave like a lady, & tell your Papa to write.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. This is the first letter I believe I have ever written to you.
