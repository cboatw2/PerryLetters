Letter 106

Monday morning, 29 November 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	If Fanny will permit me I wish to write to you this morning.  I have the charge of her, Delia & Mary having gone to the Spring to wash.  She is now lying on the floor, but does not seem satisfied with her position.  I received a letter from you last night, & Willie also received one.  He answered his immediately, so you will get two letters again the next Mail, but I know it will not be too much of a good thing for you.  I must give you a scold, for breaking your word & being extravagant when you promised you would not.  It is well for you to say, you got the books to send to me this winter.  Your conscience told you, you must give me some excuse, for doing exactly what you told me you were not going to do.  There are more books in the Library now, than I can expect to read, & until we have read those, there is no necessity to buy any more.  There is no room in the Library even to place them.  Those that Pamela sent back, I cannot find a place for.  If you buy books to please me, I would like Mrs. Opie�s, Mrs. Sherwood�s, Miss R��s works , & others of the like kind.  Novels, I do not care for, but such works as I have mentioned, are improving & interesting & light, serve to wile away an hour agreeably.  Your books, almost all of them are too deep & solid, for the general reader.  Yesterday Mamma & Susan stopped on their way from church to see me, & they went in the Library to choose a book for Ann, & except two or three little books I had bought there was scarcely one suitable for her, who was sick & wished something amusing & interesting.  There are so many things we need for the house, necessities that we will be obliged soon to supply, that we ought both to deny ourselves of whatever we can do without, that we may have money to supply those wants.  We now need many things, Staircase Carpet, Waiters, Face Towels, Cups & Saucers, Dinner set &c&c, but even these things we must try & do without as long as we can.  It must be a�tation to you, when in Columbia, & particularly in a Book store, to forget all of your economical resolutions.  I cannot blame you, in Charleston last winter I saw so many things I wished to get, & it was such a good opportunity to supply all my wants that I could not but regret that my means did not allow me to, & I did spend to the very last cent almost, all that you gave me.  I would never go to town again, unless I had plenty of money, as I know that will never be the case.  I for my part need not regret the Rail Road failure.  It would have been no immediate benefit to me.  It would have brought crowds of friends to see us, but not carried us to see them in return.  It would not have cheapened the price of board in Charleston, & would have made things dearer here.  I am not so selfish as to begrudge to others the benefit they would have received, so if the failure of the Road is an injury to my State,  I do regret it, but I do not regret it for myself.  Genl Whitner is really anxious to be elected Judge, & I am sure he has no claims to it, for he is not I believe, even a good Lawyer.  He would make a poor Judge.  Honour has certainly something more fascinating in it, than money, for Col. Memminger I suppose makes a great deal more as a Lawyer, than he will as Judge, but he wishes the honour of being a Judge.  I have always felt so.  I would not wish the honour with no money, but I am satisfied  with less money & some honour.  You tantalize when you say, Col. Martin says if you continued in the Senate, you would be elected President of it.  If I were certain of that I would wish you to continue, for you would then still practice Law, & the position would be just as honorable & even more so than if you were in Congress.  I suppose though it is entirely uncertain if you would be elected President, & at any rate it is too late to change for Col. Brockman considers perhaps himself as in the field.  I believe if you are confident you can be elected to Congress, & at the same time practice Law, & support your family, though you have to give up half you make to a partner, I am satisfied I would have liked you to have been a Judge above all things, but there are so many aspirants for that office, & would be also for the President of the Senate that I need worry myself, that you will lose all chance of ever being elected to those offices.  In a few years as our young servants grow up, we must�or sell some of the older ones & make something in that way.  When Edward can drive, we can sell Jim, & when Lindy is older we can sell Mary & Minerva & Lindy herself or hire them out.  I would like now to hire out some of them.  I am glad you have heard good news from Stephens, & that Genl Thompson is interested in your election.  As you are a Candidate, I wish you elected.  Mrs. Duloc wrote me word you had a great many warm friends in Pickens.  Willie was very much pleased with your letter.  As I read it to him, the tears came into his eyes.  Every evening I hear him his lessons, & after that he reads to me or asks questions.  We sit up till 9 oclock, & I am so busy working I am sorry then to go to bed.  I have�now for all of my learning.  Woman�s Mission, which Mrs. Cunningham sent me, I find I have read.  Aunt Eliza sent it to Susan; in it, I recollect reading to you, that Mothers must recollect they were to be the Mothers of grown up men, as well as children, & must improve their minds, to keep pace with them respect them.  Saturday Jim & Charles killed the Steer.  It is not very nice meat, tastes poor, however it is some help; the hog also that was killed, was�by the other hogs so I do not eat the meat with much pleasure, but it makes no difference with the servants.  As regards the presents you are to bring us, I wish you to be economical & bring trifles.  I assure you we do not care for valuable presents.  Bring Susan & myself a string of Black beads, such as you got us before.  I think the price was 621/2 cts.  Bring Ann a basket if you see a pretty one to put her knitting in, if not some little trifle.  Bring Anna a Match to her China Doll, bring Willie a Knife, bring Frank some Marbles he says & a knife.  He needs a cap for the Winter, but I expect I could get a cheaper & prettier one in Charleston.  I could send for one, but do as you think about the Cap.  Bring Fanny a Straw Rattle; in Charleston they cost�so I can send for one, if there are none cheap in Columbia, & bring her an Ivory ring if you see them cheap.  I mention these things, but you can bring whatever you think best, provided they cost little.  We are counting the days until you return.  You must write every Mail, if it is only a line.  Willie says I must tell you to be sure, and ask Mr. Summer for his dog.  Since I began writing, I have held Fanny repeatedly, & have now put her to sleep.  She is more & more interesting.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F. Perry

P.S. I do not�to scold you for buying books.  You must get whatever you wish, but I like lighter works�.
