Letter 192

Sunday night, 7 oclock, 7 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

		This afternoon I wrote you a few hurried lines to go by tomorrows mail, & prevent your being uneasy.  Until this now, I have not had a moment to spare today to write to you.  

		The children & myself went to church this morning.  It was Communion Sunday, so when I got home it was so late dinner was ready.  Mamma & Ann Susan & the children dined here, & just after dinner we went to the Episcopal church to attend the funeral of Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Ioor�s daughter, whose death I am sure would greatly surprise you.  If Mr. McBee had not mentioned that she was in the last stage of Consumption.  Your telling me that alone prevented me from being greatly shocked when the invitation to her funeral was brought here this morning.  Mr. Arthur mentioned in his discourse that he believed she had safely gone to heaven, that last Wednesday she partook of Communion & seemed to derive great comfort from it.  Mrs. Ioor was not at the funeral.  Her brother & a person who I suppose was Mr. Evans, were the only mourners.  So lately we saw Mrs. Evans go up to the Altar to be confirmed, & in so short a time after she has been carried to the same altar in her coffin.

		Mrs. John Jones is very low.  It is said she cannot hold on long.  When Mr. Henning�s funeral took place, she requested the bell might not be tolled, & this afternoon it as not tolled on her account.  Mr. Tom Butlers son the second, is very ill, not expected to live.  Mrs. Carson has has one sick but he is getting better.

		I saw Mrs. Perry Duncan at church this afternoon.  She told me she only returned from Georgia yesterday.  She has altered in her appearance so much.  She used to look fair & delicate, now she looks coarse & ugly, & her eyes seem affected, but do not mention this opinion to Mr. Duncan.  I told her I heard of Mr. Duncan constantly, & he was quite well.  I saw Mrs. Elford also at church, & told her she must not be jealous, but I had been writing to Mr. Elford.  Mamma begged me to write to him to buy her some Clover & O� grass seed, & I did, & told him if he could get some pretty reasonable Dining Table covers, to get me some.  The Carpet & Piano in the Dining room has made the old ones look to shabby.  I told Mr. Elford that I wrote to him instead of you, because I had written to you, not to go to town, as you had heretofore been a very obedient husband.  I knew you would not go, & these things we wished purchased in Charleston, but the letter will have arrived so long before he does, that I am afraid it may be returned here, & he may not get it.  I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am sorry you remain so inactive in the Legislature.  You ought to speak & do your best to have influence & to be listened to with respect.  You ought to express your views & not be silent.  You ought to speak so the whole State can hear you, & not express your views merely in private conversation, but I see you need me to direct you in future.  I will always go down with you  Never was  husband blessed with so wise a wife.  Do you not in your heart think I have more wisdom in affairs generally than most of the female sex.  I must be more than ordinary, for you to be satisfied with me.

		I was very much provoked this morning to see Mr. Campbell not only in front of us, but exactly in front almost touching where you sit.  Mr. & Mrs. Arthur were in Dr. Simons pew, which I suppose they are to occupy now.  I think it a great peice of impertinence in him to put himself in that place, & that Mr. Arthur knowing how he has treated you, ought to have told him it was improper in him to put himself in contact with you, & ought not to have let Mrs. Arthur taken that pew.  Mamma & myself both think it derogatory to your dignity to be seated just behind Mr. Campbell, so we both think that you must change our pew for Mr. Poinsetts, the pew we first sat in.  We can occupy it until he comes up, but I rather think he will never come up again, so we can keep the pew altogether.  Mamma says she likes to be far back.  It suits her, but that Mr. Poinsetts pew is the one suited for you, & that you ought to sit in, so you must not object to my proposition:  I can take no company in going to church, if Mr. Campbell is to be stuck in front of us every Sunday.

		Mr. Arthur�s sermon this morning was a Missionary one.  A collection is to be taken up next Sunday for the cause, & Mr. Arthur is to preach at Spartanburg, & there will be Lay reading, so he gave us the sermon today, that he would have preached next Sunday if here.  He proved that the Episcopal was the first denomination of religion preached in this country, that years after the Pilgrim fathers came over, & afterwards the Catholics under Lord Baltimore & they had no right to come over & cause Schism.  His whole sermon as usual was to prove that the Episcopal was the best, & the only true church.  These sermons I do not like, for I have always felt, that one church was as good as another, but the form of Worship in the Episcopal church I like.  The Baptists I disapprove of, because they will permit no other Christians to commune with them.  They are illiberal.  During the Communion service Mr. Arthur said he earnestly requested the Communicants to take off their gloves when they received the Communion, that it was much more respectful than to keep them on.  Mamma says it is a custom in the Episcopal church to commune without gloves, but she had never regarded it as of any importance, but Mr. Arthur now regards form altogether & perhaps he believes in Transubstantiation.

 8 oclock.  Willie has returned from the office, & brought me a letter from you.   I am glad you mention perhaps you would take part in the Convention Debate, for you ought to.  I am sorry you have bought so many things for the children.  I wish I would impress it on you, that it would [be] much better for them to show your love by saving money for them, to educate them, & send them to college & fit them up in whatever business they are to follow.  I hope you will see the Indian & buy the pocket books & Shoes.  Some of the presents you bring the children, I will give to Susan�s.  It gratifies Susan that you should remember her children, & you ought not to forget that she complimented you Vardry�s godfather.  Mamma sends her love to you.  Willie has bought himself a knife with his own money so does not wish you to bring him any.  Frank you ought to bring a cheap one to, or get one here for him, for 35 cts.  You can get good ones here.  Willie has a turn for Drawing.  He ought to have the Drawing pencils instead of Anna.   Reuben will kill the hogs Tuesday if the weather is cold.  The Lunatics letter I will not publish.  The children perhaps will write to you tomorrow.  I hear Mrs. Walker goes tomorrow & Mr. McLeods family, but I do not know if they do or not.  The servants say no.  I must stop.  If I have anything to tell you tomorrow, I will get Willie or Anna to write for me.  They all have holiday now.  Adieu, E.F.P.
