Letter 138

Wednesday morning, 14 November [1849]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I suppose you will expect to hear from me tomorrow when the mail reaches Laurens, so I must write to you now.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  No letter came Sunday night.  If any arrive tonight, it will be too late to send them by the Mail that carries this letter.  I will begin as usual & tell all that has occurred  since the moment you left.  Sunday morning we went to church.  Mr. Pinckney preached & gave us a very fine sermon.  He & his son only came down this way, & were to meet the rest of the family at Mr. Andersons.  Mr. Stuart played very finely on the Organ.  In the afternoon Mr. Arthur preached not one of his best.  In comparing the Union of Church & his people, to the Union between Husband & Wife, he always knows my delicacy, for it was an old sermon.  Mr. Croft spoke to me after church.  He says Mr. Moore has married a poor lady.  On Monday morning Mr. Pinckney made me a pleasant visit.  He says he did not speak against Greenville to Mr. Shoolbred, but if he had been asked on the subject, he would have said, that he was perfectly disgusted at the open manner in which the gentlemen drank when he was here last, showing no shame whatever.  In the afternoon he went to see Mamma, & told her, I seemed so well.  The next morning he left.  Charlie also came to see Willie.  He is very much grown.  Monday afternoon the Mother & Wife of Mr. Hopkins returned my visit.  They are both, particularly the Wife very pleasant ladies.  Yesterday morning Dr. Simons called to see you.  Sarah asked him in, so I went down & saw  him.  He commenced by reading me a note he had addressed to the Trustees requesting them to meet him somewhere, that he might explain to them his reasons for having sent in his letter of resignation, on hearing of his not being elected to the Female Academy.  He says he has no mortified feelings whatever, but considers himself as very badly treated by some members of the Board; that he was persuaded by some of them to accept of his situation as assisting in the Male Academy, on the express  condition, that he should be elected to the Female; that he asked the few who spoke to him, if they spoke authoritatively in the name of the Board & they told him yes, & when he became dissatisfied & wished to give up, one of them told him to consider well,  for he would certainly be elected Principal of the Female Academy; so he considered himself as elected, & afterwards those very ones had shifted their grounds, & quite forgotten what they had formerly said.  He said you & several others had never said a word to him on the subject, so he exculpated you, & did not even ask how you voted, & I must tell you he wished the private relations formerly subsisting between you to continue just the same.  He says though he sent in his resignation, as the time for his engagement had expired, which was until the Election took place, he would continue to assist Mr. Leary until the vacation, but it would be a Jubilee to him when he gave up; for the boys were so bad. I would be shocked if I took a peep in at them; & he himself would never send a son to the Academy, where there was such a mixture that one boy came into his presence smoking a Cigar, one of them wrote a most insulting composition, & if he whipped the parent complained & if he did not they complained.  He will commence a school on his own account.  He did not know how he would succeed.  I listened very patiently.  I thought I might easily have explained his disappointment, by telling him, those very Trustees who had promised him the Female Academy had since found he was incompetent to the chrnge & therefore would not vote for him.   

		Last evening Susan Hoke came over & spent with me.  This morning Mrs. Pearson paid me a visit.  She says she wishes to see you as soon as you return, that she has received a letter from Florida, & wishes you to attend to, or look over some papers.  She says Dr. Simons met her Father & spoke to him about his treatment & abused Mr. Beattie a great deal.  She says Mr. Moore was boarding at the house where Miss Trott was, with her Grandmother. & the Grandmother was always telling him, he had talents that would not be appreciated in the Country.  He ought to live in the City, & so he thought he would marry the Granddaughter & live in the City & let the Grandmother support him.  Mr. Bradshaw she says is certainly going.  Since you left I had heard Mr. Waddil would not let him.  Mr. Smith who applied for this school, had also applied for the one Mr. Bradshaw is now going to take charge of, & he says it is one of the most desirable in the Southern Country; that the Music Teacher is paid one thousand dollars a year.  Mr. Bradshaw will have a good opportunity of pocketing there.  He says he will pay the money he owes the church in 6 months after he leaves here.

		Reuben & Charles are sowing the Wheat.  Mr. Moore was here a little while ago, & says he has brought the Wheat to the Mill.  Mr. Slatton engaged you, & kindly is now cleaning two barrels to carry down for it.  Mrs. Pearson says it is scarce & dear.  Except to church, I have not been out I was going to say, but I forgot, Monday morning only I went to the Genl to see Mrs. McConnell & Miss Goodlett & went to see Mrs. Westfield & Mrs. Watson.  The latter lady told me she heard Mrs. Dr. Butler had lost her young daughter, but I think this must be a mistake.  Lucinda got a letter from Bob Sunday night.  He said he could not endure the treatment of his owners, so he left them & 4 days after he was taken by a gentleman, to whom he now belonged & liked very much, & he expected now to get a letter from Dr. Butler, so I suppose the gentleman has offered to purchase him, but I expect Mrs. Butler  will wish to get possession of him to vent her anger on him, but I hope not.  We have been reading a little book of Mamma�s called �Home� by Mrs. Sedgewick.  It is most excellent.  I wish I would be such a Mother & Wife as is there described.  I would like you to read it.  Mrs. Daniel Ravenel gave it to Mamma.  I have written in a great hurry, have no time or room at�to tell you how much I love you, & miss you.  I hope you will come back with some notes.  I do not care for money which is soon spent.  I wish you to accumulate notes for our future benefit.  The children are well.  The weather pleasant.  A Miss Wynn came over yesterday to see me with Caroline Horton. She lives 12 miles from here is Anderson District, & says her Father is a great friend of yours. She had heard so much of my house, she wished to see it.  Mrs. Pearson says all who come to see me speak in praise of the house.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
