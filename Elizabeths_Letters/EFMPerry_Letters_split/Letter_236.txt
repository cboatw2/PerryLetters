Letter 236

Saturday afternoon. 25 December [1852]
Greenville

Dear Anna

	This is Christmas day, & a very dull day it has been.  The weather continues very bad.  I never knew so long a spell of rainy warm weather in winter.  The streets & yards are very muddy, & the house looks as if it never could recover.  The Carpets I am afraid are ruined.  The roads must be dreadful.  Your Grandmama & family were not able on account of the weather to come in & spend the day with me.  I sent them some of our desert, as they could not come.  I let Becky have holiday, & Lindy cooked.  Tomorrow Lindy will have holiday.  The pleasure seems to be all among the servants.  Last night some of them went to a party; today they have dined out, & their having holiday seems to make them happy.  The children hung up their Stockings, so I was obliged to put something in.  I bought 5 cts worth of Candy apiece, a mug, a 5 cts doll, a cake, an apple, a switch & 10 cts apiece.  So St Nicholas they think has not forgotten them.  Fanny regrets very much that you are not here.  I hope when you return we will have pleasant cheerful weather or you will think Greenville very dull.  Your Papa will go down for you.  He may not have time to go & return before New Years day.  If he does not, he will go immediately after New Years Day & that will be as soon as Mr. Springer thinks of coming.  So by New Years day have everything ready.  I dare say he will spend a few days in town though, so you will have time to get ready after he gets down.  I expect he will take Willie with him.

	     Mary Elford was buried this morning.  I hope she has spent her Christmas in a happy world with Laura McKay, who was so afflicted, that I think it was a blessing she was taken, as her life would certainly have been one of suffering.

	Fanny Hoke is getting better.  Fanny sent her a doll & she sent Fanny a box.  Susan Hoke told me she wrote to Augustus to go & see you.  I suppose he feels awkward about visiting.  Butler Tompson told your Papa his Fathers wifes son, weighed 13 ? pounds, & his father was very proud of it.  

	I am always writing you something to get, & I expect as long as you remain in town it will be the case.  I wish you to get me a little key basket, & 1 dozen black lacets for Gaiter boots.  The tines come off so soon, & then ties cannot be laced.  Mr. Westfield puts such large tines on they will not go through the holes, & then they cannot be laced, so buy one dozen black lacets for Gaiter boots. Some neat dark Calico about 12 ?  cts a yd such as will wash I also wish, & will write for before you leave.  A good many yds I would like, but I will wait until I get Eliza�s next list.  Beg her to send me a list of the other things she has bought.  I know I will like the bonnet she has got, & will wear it constantly.  I see in my list Calico is mentioned for A� the 1.37 ? for the Calico if Eliza chooses & the 1.12 ? for Reedy House might be added to your money, & pay for some of the things you have got.

	I am obliged to your Aunts for making you such acceptable presents as the Bible & Prayer book, the very things you were going to buy.  Also to Aunt Eliza for the boxes & Aunt Emily.  Your friends are very kind & I am thankful for the good opinion they have of you.  I am greatly indebted to your cousin Eliza for all the trouble she has taken to shop for me.  I will never forget their kindness to you.  Aunt Mary McCall has been kind.  I hoped to have heard today from her about the Cloak but have not.  If the man will take it back, your Papa can carry it down, but I suppose he will not change it.  

	Give my love to your Aunt & cousins, Aunt Mary, Aunt Anna, Aunt Emily & my other Aunts.  I wish you would see about Sarah Matthews & Aunt Harriett but suppose you will not.  Give my love to cousin Sarah Gibbes, Mrs. Irvine Keith, Mrs. O�Driscoll, & my other family.  Have you seen Elizabeth Jones?

	It is 10 oclock.  I can hardly see to write.  Hext is well & fat & lively & good, better than he used to be.  Minerva is sick, over at the Mansion House, with cold & headache.  The rest are well.  Lindy is still lame from Rheumatism, & is not going at present to your Grandmama�s.  She has engaged Nancy Greens daughter.  While Lindy�s baby is young, I know she would not do well hired out.  She can hardly work but next summer, after her child can run about she will do better.  She is now only able to help the other servants.  I will stop now & finish my letter after the candles are lit.

Dear Anna, You had better buy the dolls not dressed & dress them yourself.  I hope Aunt Harriett will come down from Mrs. Wilkes to see you if you are in town when she is there.  I am sorry you have not dined with your Aunts in Meeting St. but hope you will now.  We used to spend pleasant days with them when we were children.  I hope Alston will name his son after his father.  He lost one named Robert, but I think he ought to name another after his father, & that it would please his Mother.  I am sorry Aunt Anna Turnbull & Aunt Martha have gone in the country.  I hope you will see them again, & that they will be in town when your Papa & Willie go down.  Tuesday week I expect your Papa will go down for you.  Wednesday the day after he will stop at Newberry to attend a R[ail] Road meeting, Thursday he will go to Columbia, & Friday reach Charleston.  He will remain there a few days.  It is very unexpected he is going down, but now he has determined to go, he is pleased with the trip, he is obliged to be back before the 15th Jany.  He would have gone down immediately, but all business men ought to be at home Sale Day, & he could not return in time.  So you will soon see him, & I expect Willie.  Write every day.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.   

Anna Perry
