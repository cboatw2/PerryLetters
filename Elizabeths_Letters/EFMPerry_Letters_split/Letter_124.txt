Letter 124

Tuesday morning, 10 October 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I feel as if I must write you a few lines by Genl Thompson, who leaves for laurens about 10 oclock today.  He will carry later news than mine, but I will tell of little incidents, that he will not mention.  He voted for you, but that is all he did.  He has not gained you one vote besides, but on the contrary like some other of your professed friends, has tried to injure you by telling how many more votes Mr. Orr  would get at certain places than yourself.  For instance he said, at Pickensville, Mr. Orr would beat you 200 votes, & he only beat you 71.  Mr. Jones told a man from Pickens, that Mr. Orr would beat you at this box.  I think in future Mr. Orr, Genl Thompson, & Mr. Jones must put very little confidence in their calculations.  So far the news from Greenville is better than you expected, for all the boxes I have heard from, you have got more than you expected & Mr. Orr only as much, or less than you calculated, except Dickeys where not as many votes were given in as you thought, but of those you got all but 2.  Of the other candidates, Mr. Edward Earle is ahead, Smith next, Col. Town[e]s perhaps next, though Mr. Hoke says he has fallen off wonderfully, for which I am very sorry, for next to you I wish him elected.  The fourth man will most probably be Elias Earle.  I will not tell you who voted against you.  Mr. Hoke says generally the most trifling worthless people from the country, some from Pickens & Anderson voted here against you, & I heard of one from the Sullivan neighborhood, two of the Paris�  voted against you, , the Fergusons, a Richard, a Kemp, from the country , of the villagers, Old Maj. Turpin, who is an intimate friend of Genl Thompson, Tom Turpin, Charles Stone, Gaines, Isaac Hennings, & he did all he could against you, boasts of having turned 4 men from you, to Orr yesterday.  Mr. Wm Choice is against you & doing all he can against you, & Tandy Walker is against you.  He saw a man passing & asked who he was going to votes for, the man replied Perry.  Mr. Walker said, �Oh no! that wont do.�  The man in reply said, �I will vote as I please Sir.�  Choice & Walker are both electioneering against Col. Town[e]s, because Col. Town[e]s is for you.  They take men into a corner & electioneer in a sneaking underhanded way.  Mr. Nicol made Lark vote for youwho was going to vote against you, because he said, because you tried to make his wife a free dealer.  The old man Lark & Palman were going to vote against you, but Mr. Hoke changed them.  Mr. Taft at the Mill, was going to vote against you, but Mr. Hoke made him vote for you.  He saw him put in your ticket, & afterwards heard him saying, he had voted for Orr.  Lewis Thurston voted for you, Dr. Turpin voted for you, S�thiel Martin voted for you, Smith who works at Mr. Cox�s voted for you, & Mr. Luther McBee says he is certain Mr. Peter Cauble will.  Maj. Earle voted for you Mr. Hoke thinks.  Mr. Orr said, if Hoke could be kept away from the Dark Corner, he would get 100 votes there.  Hoke did stay away, & he got 30.  So mention this circumstance to him and ask him to account for it.  I received a message last night from Mr. Durbec, saying he had heard from you at Laurens, & you begged him to tell me not to be uneasy foryou were getting a great many more votes in Laurens than Col. Orr.  It seems to me that there is some mistake in this, that time did not allow for a message to arrive so quickly.  I feel very anxious, for though the news from Greenville, so far is good. There are still other boxes to hear from, & three other Districts, in two of which Mr. Orr is certainly to beat.  Yesterday, it was so quiet, that I would hardly have known that an election was going on, except from my feelings, it was a clear but windy day rather.  Today it is cloudy, & unfortunately has commenced drizzling, but it only makes me more thankful that yesterday was a good day.  The vote in Greenville is larger than you expected.  You have been unlucky in having your friends absent & sick.  Mr. Croft intended if able to come out today & vote for you, but the rain will of course prevent him.  Mr. Spears is sick & cannot leave his room.  Mamma stopped yesterday to inquire after him, & Mr. Spears said, it made him more sick the disappointment, at not being able to come out to vote for you.  He has diarrhea, passes blood.  Dr. Earle, Mr. Poinsett, Mr. Arthur & others are absent.  Dr. Crittenden & his sons voted for you.  John Crittenden wrote the tickets for Mr. Hoke.  I feel grateful to your friends here, Mr. Hoke, Taylor, Dill & Others I will be always obligated to, but those who voted against such as Maj. Turpin &c. I will never forgive; for Orr�s being a Taylor man is no excuse.  It ought to have made him contemptible in their opinion, knowing he only went for Taylor, to gain their votes; & the men who voted for you, but were not in their hearts for you, & tried to injure you by saying you would not be elected  & would hardly get any votes at such & such places, are the worst of all, & they have sunk in my esteem.  If they had been your friends, & such was their real opinion, they would have kept it to themselves, but they expressed this opinion with a view to injure you.  It is raining now quite hard.  A great many people have come in already, but I am afraid many of your friends, will be prevented by the rain, from going in to vote for you, , & today the strong pull, the long pull, & the pull altogether is to be given, that is to make you successful, today the great event  is to be decided.  I am so sorry it is raining.  How I wish  there was a Telegraphic line to Laurens, & I could ask you, how you are coming on?  I do hope in Laurens you will get the majority you expected.  The paper I send you was furnished by Mr. Taylor.  At the Dark Corner Mr. Nicol gave you 5 more votes than he does, 175 instead of 170.  Mr. Orr�s minority are so small, that you will be able to tall to a man who voted for him.  Some of the boxes are not mentioned on the list you gave me, or they have different names.  Groces I cannot find, or Brushy Creek.  At Pickensville Mr. Orr got about what you expected, & you less.  Perhaps some of your friends went to other places to vote.  Mr. Hoke does not think Mr. Jones will be elected, but somehow it seems to me he will; his friends will try so hard today.  Do write me by Wednesdays Mail.  Last night I hardly slept at all.  Just before bedtime I heard the news, & it excited me.  Either good or bad news keeps me awake, but the former makes my thoughts much pleasanter when I am awake.  I do not see McDaniels mentioned on your list either.  While I have been writing I suppose more news has arrived.  I am seated at the window in my chamber with the blind hooked.  Little while ago I saw two buggy�s pass with gentleman in them.  It seemed to me they were friends of Mr. Orr�s come over from Anderson to electioneer for him.  They looked at the house so much, as if they had never seen it before, was what made me think so.  Mrs. Lowndes came to see me yesterday.  I told her she must make Mr. Lowndes & Mr. Wm Lowndes come in & vote for you.  She said she wished she had a vote she would give it to you; that Mr. Lowndes was then in the village & she expected would vote for you.  Mr. Shermans little son brought some apples, & I took 2 ? bushels, & told him his father must vote for you, & he said he was going to, but I do not know if it was true.  I bought some Irish Potatoes from a person Molineaux. Who said he had just voted for you.  The rain has now stopped so I hope your friends will not be kept away.  You ought to be proud of the vote at Dickeys, all but two.  You certainly must inquire who those two are.  If you are elected, & Edward Earle, Col. Town, Smith & McKay all will be as I wish.  Mr. Jones has acted too treacherously for me to wish well to.  Perhaps he may lose by it, as Genl Garvin did.  At Burtons you did so well, all but 7.  Smith at Cox�s shop, voted for you of his own accord, because you were best qualified.  Charles Stone voted against you, because you voted he says against Richard Stone.  Mrs. Earles son in law�s have not acted I [word obscured] suppose as she wished.  If you are only elected my dear husband I will be so gratified, I must have my likeness taken again.  It will look so much happier than the last, & the reason I wish you elected is that you deserve it, & I will feel for once, that merit has met with its reward, that envy & malice have been defeated.   We are all well.  I hope to see you safe & well next Tuesday as the representative of your State, but if it is ordered otherwise, I must be resigned, but I wish Col. Orr to be made to feel his presumption, & the Pendleton junto to know, as things do not happen as they dictate. & [word obscured] believe in prosperity or adversity.  Ever your attached, E.F.P.
