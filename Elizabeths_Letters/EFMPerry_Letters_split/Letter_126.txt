Letter 126

Sunday evening, 22 October 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		Mrs. Du�   has just paid me a visit, & I am so sorry you did not see her.  She came about half an hour after you left, & she told me a great deal about the Election, & gave me great comfort, for she explained how much chicanery & cheating went on in the election, & which when you are aware of, you might another time counteract.  She says your friends are indignant at the way things were managed & say Col. Orr shall never get as many votes again, & indeed they think that he did not in reality get all the votes counted him.  At Bachelors Retreat Ebenezer Verner voted for you, but did nothing more for you.  Sam Verner certainly voted against you.  Old Mr. Verner said he did not care for either you or Col. Orr.  Old Whitfield she says acted a double party at Bachelors Retreat pretended to be for you, so that your family even voted for him, & elsewhere abused you, & tickets that were written for you & given to voters, he withdrew & gave others with Orr�s name on it.  She says he acted most deceitfully.   Mr. Taylor Mrs. Du� says turned against you two weeks before the election & electioneered against you all he could.  Says�were attributed to you, as being in favor of, which you never�that something I think Genl Cass said about poor people being sold, it was said was a measure of yours.  In short such cheating, stealing & corruption as went on at this Election, was never known before.  Mr. Lee says Orr is a disgrace to the country, & you ought to hold your head higher than ever, but he thinks he could never be elected again.  Mr. Humphries the minister electioneered against you.  He is Wm Lee�s brother, told Mr.M� Judge [page torn] was a great friend of yours.  Mr. Orr�s friends thought you would be elected, & that is the reason they made such exertions.  Mr. Orr, your friend, I suppose, thought you would be, & did not exert themselves as they ought to have done.  Mr. Ben Hillhouse the gentleman who dined here, was a good friend of yours.  I hope you will hear a great deal from your friends about the election, & write me about it, & if they think so you ought to, & run again & beat the drunken demagogue.  It is a disgrace to send such a creature to represent the State, & I hardly think the people would do so another time.  You have pursued such an honorable  & manly course, that I must believe you will be rewarded.  Your intellectual countenance. & fine commanding person  were not given you for nothing.  It is meant that you shall take a stand among the highest of Creation, & then you  will be appreciated.  Mrs. D� says  all that was said against you was your pride, but the idle lies, about Brandy &c. were circulated.  They may have injured you this time, but another time, I think they will lose their effect.  If you are ever a Candidate again, I will put in the newspaper an especial advertisement for myself, saying all the idle reports of my sayings are false, that I love the poor people, & have always been particularly kind to them.  Mrs. D� threw a new light upon Mrs. Choice�s dislike to you.  She says Mrs. Choice  once thought you were going to marry her, & I believe it firmly, even if you do not.  You never have suspicions of that kind, but I dare say she would like very much to have married you, for when she was young, among her acquaintances in Greenville, there would have been none superior to you, or who a young lady would have been more likely to wish to make a conquest of than yourself.  So my dear husband, I feel very gratified & quite complimented that you should have chosen me, when I know there were others, who would have been glad to have bestowed themselves [page torn] & who also at the same time would have bestowed a fortune likewise.  I must try & make you a good wife, & I assure you I would not change you now, for anyone else in the universe & as for Col. Orr, he is not fit to black your boots.  I am too worrying a person, should have triumphed over you.  It would have been quite natural for you to beat him, but I think it must have been a most unexpected surprise to himself & his friends, when they found he was the successful one, but you must hold your head above him & hold it higher than ever, & he ought to put his in the dust when he knows how many tricks he had to resort to, to accomplish his ends.  Yes he triumphed, but he ought often to pass in rev� all he means he used.  I wish you would mention to him or his friends, that they must have really determined to use all means, when he even tried to injure you through your wife.  Tell them you heard what he said of me.  It was a mean thing, & I wish him to know it.  He ought to know that we heard it.  Mr, Pickens Mrs. D� does not like, says he thinks only of himself.  I expect among all the Candidates in Pendleton District you had (except Mr. Lee) not one friend.  Tell Mr. Burt from me, that I always knew he was a false friend.  Mrs. D� says Josiah is confined to the house.  Wilbern is staying with him.  Perhaps you had better return home from Anderson, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court, for I�say he is in immediate danger.  Mrs. D� did not know anything more of him than this.  She told me a great deal about the Election which I would like you to have heard, before you went to Anderson.  Col. Orr�s brother, though he was treating so for him, did not expect him to be elected.  I do not suppose anybody did.  Mrs. D� will come & see me tomorrow again, & I expect pass the night.  I expect she will stay with me off & on while she is here.  You must certainly write to me by Tuesday�s Mail & I think you had better return home, & go to see Josiah from Pickens Court,  I wish you would go to Pendleton Village before you re[turn] next week on your way to Josiah, & see what the people there say. I think there will be a reaction in your favor, at least I hope so.  Mrs. D� thinks Mr. Taylor acted shamefully, but W�field the worst of all.  I hope you will hear all she told me, & I suppose you will, when you see Foster, & Mr. Keith & others.  I have nothing to write about, which is the reason I dwell so long on one thing.  Willie is downstairs.  I have spent the morning in writing to you, & this afternoon I must read.  Mrs. D� says Col. Orr can never again get the same number of votes, as he got this time, that the eyes of the people are opened, & they are disgusted at his electioneering, & this is the last thing I will say.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
   
Write to me Tuesday, whether you will come back, or go on to Pickens & see Mr. Lee if you go to Pickens, & he will tell how things were managed at Bachelors Retreat.

Benjamin Perry
