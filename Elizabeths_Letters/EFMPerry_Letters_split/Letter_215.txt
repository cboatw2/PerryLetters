Letter 215

Wednesday morning, 1 December [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received two letters from you this morning, & one from Anna.  I was very glad to hear from you.  Your letters are the only comfort I have while you are away.  I was really provoked to hear that Jones was elected by the Legislature, Treasurer.  If anyone deserved defeat it was him.  It has given me a bad opinion of mankind, for I see now that duplicity, want of principle, meanness, vanity, presumption, & being a fool, is all that is needed now to succeed in this world; that merit & good conduct & sense stand no chance.  I would have given a large sum to have defeated Jones.  I believe how he will appropriate the money he receives in his Office to his own use, pay his debts, live in style, & never breaks, & even if he does this, I suppose he will be elected again.  He is now made for life, & will hold his head higher than ever.  I am sorry too, your enemy should have succeeded.  It seems as if your exposure of him failed of its effect.  I thought he was put down forever, instead of which he has risen higher than ever, & your judgement too is out, for you thought he stood no chance of success.  What a pity Mr. Ashmore or some prominent man had not been a Candidate.  

	What a dreadful Rail Road accident.  I am afraid for you to come back on it.  You must hire a hack or have the carri[a]ge sent down for you.  The Rail Road will never be safe.  It will be constantly under �ing.  All the rains will injure it.  At the South they cannot manage as at the North.

	Isaac Hayne�s election was really close.  You were obliged on account of my relation to Aunt Eliza to vote for him, but I would not have been sorry if he had been defeated.  You are the only magnanimous  person I know of, & the only one that meets with no reward.  It makes me heartsick to think of Jones election.  He deserved defeat so.  Dr. Crooks says he borrowed one thousand dollars to pay for his Piano & Carriage, that he cannot hold up much longer, & that John Jones will break along with him, for he is security for all his debts, but I do not believe either will break.  

	Mr. Hopkins has just brought me a letter from you.  I will stop & read it.

	I have read your letter & am very glad to hear again from you.  I hope Anna has gone to Charleston by this time, as she will have so short a time to stay, if she remains longer in Columbia.

	The white faced Cow has a calf also.  Reuben says they had better all remain in the field, that there is plenty there for them to eat.  They were brought home yesterday & Charles has carried them back today.  In two weeks the oldest Calf & Cow will be brought home & milked.  John is quite well now, Edward goes to his work, Mary is well, & Lindy seems pretty well, hobbles a little.  I would be thankful if I could get rid of Eliza.  She calls Joe Powel her husband, says she has been living with him five years, sends her children on messages to him, abuses me, wont let her children work for us, & she is an abominable creature, a pollution to any yard, & Mary could & would have married, if it had not been for Eliza�s abusing her, to those who wished to marry her, but these things we will speak of on your return.

	I am glad Anna is behaving well & enjoying herself.  I will write to her when she gets to Charleston, & she must write to me often, & do you write whenever you can.  I have written by every Mail.  I know of nothing new at all.  The village seems very quiet.  When you are away, I hear nothing.  I have nothing at all to write about.  Becky is ding well.  If I can get rid of Eliza, & take home Clara as the seamstress, I think then our yard will be purified.

	I am sorry the Mails are so irregular.  I will be very uneasy when you are coming home  I would rather send the carriage for you all the way to Columbia.  The road curves so.  I think the Cars will constantly run off.  How sad for Col. Singleton & his Grandson to be killed.  The road must be badly managed, & I suppose the freshet undermined it so, that many parts will yet give way.  Next winter I will go with you. Hext will be weaned, & I would like to stay in Mrs. Janney�s room as Anna does, not go to the public table.  I am glad she does not.  She is too young to go much into public.  Mrs. Janneys family have been kind.  I rode yesterday to Mrs. Dr. Williams to carry home her Can she had sent for.  She has had 30 cases of sickness.  She expects to be confined.  What a pity.  She is having her house plastered, & going to add an addition in front.  We rode also to the College Hill, & saw the building more than 3 stories high.  I do not hear of any sickness now in Greenville.  I hope it will be healthier.

	I am glad you are treated with respect.  That is all the reward you will meet with.  I wish you would be Judge.  If you think you can be elected you must try for it.  The Legislature would be inclined perhaps to bestow the honor on you, for your disinterested conduct, through life, but you have no ambition.  I wish you honored for your childrens sake.  It will be an advantage to them.

	Write me long letters, & tell me everything.  All the letters I received today were dated 27th.  You must have written one on Sunday.  I now see your last was Sunday, but you dated 27th instead of 28th.  This is the first winter day, & quite warm.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
