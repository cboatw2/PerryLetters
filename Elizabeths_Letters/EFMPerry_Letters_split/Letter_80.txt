Letter 80

Monday morning, 27 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I was very much disappointed last night at not hearing from you, but I suppose you had not time to write, & the Mails are also irregular, for Col. Townes received last night the letter you wrote from Philadelphia, & which he ought, I should think, to have received the Mail before.  I sent to know if he had heard, & he sent me the letter to read.  I cannot help being uneasy, for fear General Houston, who you called a Humbug, or some of the Members who you said were no gentlemen, may call you to account.  My dear husband I would not for the world, that anything should happen to you while you are away, as I beseech you if any difficulty does occur, for the sake of your wife & children, settle it in a peaceable way.  The Mountaineer I suppose is sent on to Washington in exchange for the papers there, & so of course will be seen.  I like you to write letters, but be careful not to say anything to hurt the feelings of others, & do not insult anyone.  I see in your letter last night, you again mention Genl Thompson.  You make him of so much importance.  I wish you had mentioned Mr. Poinsett, who was so good in giving you letters, & you might have brought him in so naturally, so in one of your future letters, you must do it.  It is a compliment due to him, & he is so good a man, flattery will not injure him, he is worthy of praise.  He & Mrs. Poinsett came to see me yesterday.  They seemed very much interested in all I told them of your travels, & their friends.  Mr. Poinsett asked if you had mentioned Maj. Cooper, that he was one of their�friends.  He spoke of your letter in the Mountaineer. They excite great interest & that is the reason I wish you to continue to write, but to be careful how you write, & write well.  How could you leave Washington in the midst of the Tariff debate, when you would have heard Mr. McDuffie & so many great men speak.  I am provoked you should have lost the opportunity.  I suppose it was owing to Col. Fair, who is making such a hurried tour, that he has no time to stay anywhere, & you who ought to take things leisurely are just hurrying along with him.  I knew this would be the case if you took a companion, & therefore regretted it, as soon as you told me Col. Fair was going on.  Instead in Philadelphia of delivering the letters Mamma took so much trouble to write, that she even hurt her eyes, you just put them in the Post office.  Mrs. Jones is a hospitable lady.  She has sons, who would have been of service to you in showing the city, & to know a place it is requisite to know the people.  In Washington you should have staid a week longer.  Mrs. Poinsett asked if you have not mentioned the Post office.  On your way back you can stay long enough to see everything.  All say you ought not to return too soon.  Though so anxious to see you, I am willing you should remain a long time, as I know not, when you will be able to go back again.  You know not how I miss you & the thought of anything happening to you, makes me miserable, & fills my eyes with tears as they now are, & two have dropped on the paper.  From your description of Adam & Eve it must be a most indelicate picture, scarcely fit for a drawing room, & to think you described it rather indelicately, still if you had the money which I know you have not, I would be willing you should buy it.  Perhaps you could afford to buy one much smaller & costing a great deal less as a specimen, but what I would prefer above all things, is that you should let Sully or some other distinguished artist take your portrait.  Oh how I would value it, & you need bring me no other present.  We can give the one Mr. Barclay took to Mamma.  I am so sorry you even had that taken.  It is so unlike you.  I never look at it, for it makes me forget how you really look, so if you wish to please me, instead of�pictures or anything else, bring me yourself on Canvass.  Adam & Eve must be a picture not proper for a private room.  I am sorry you expressed a wish to have it.  Furniture & everything else I expect is the cheapest in New York.  I would like to have a neat sofa for our dining room.  I dare say in New York would get one for 20 dollars.  If you have not enough money, you need not get the dress I mentioned you must get for me, or the Shawl.  Indeed anything you see, you may wish to buy, you must buy in preference, to what I have requested you to get.  I went to church yesterday for the first time for months.  Mr. Arthur preached two very good sermons�such as you would have liked, & better than any I ever heard from Mr. Dennison.  He preaches practice as well as faith, so he will not be liked as much as Mr. Dennison & some ministers who preach faith alone.  He has a very pretty wife, & seems he is good.  It is strange, he is thought to look so much like you.  Jim yesterday said�looked like his master, & Mary McLeod today said Willie looked like Mr. Arthur.  I told Jim I was going to write to you.  He said, I must give you his compliments, & [page torn] you to make yourself contented.  They were doing as well [as if] you were here.  They are now hoeing the Cotton�, which they expect to make something of & are pleased, for they say you thought it was ruined.  The Corn looks quite well.  It rained yesterday, & rain was very much needed.  We have not yet had as much as is necessary.  Willie is enjoying his holiday.  He even�& then says a lesson to me of his own accord.  He is afraid Willie Choice is continuing his studies, & will get ahead of him.  He left school head of his class.  He now looks quite well.  Mrs. Duloc yesterday gave him a Prayer book.  He went to church in the afternoon with me, & carried it.  He read all of the services, & found it so interesting, that he now says, he will go to church, both morning & afternoon, that he found it tiresome before, because he stood up doing nothing.  Frank one evening heard the Augusta stage pass, & went to the window, he said to see if Pa had come.  Anna is as affectionate as ever, & when anyone troubles her, says she will tell Pa when he comes.  Mamma sends her best love & says I may truly tell you I have never been alone.  She says she finds it a relief to be here.  Mr. McBee stays at the Factory, but comes up constantly.  He was here yesterday & desired his respects to you, hoped you would have a pleasant trip, & that you would stay long enough to see everything.  I do hope you will see some of Mrs. Butlers friends.  In visiting Mr. Van Buren you may mention Mr. Poinsett, if it is only that he gave you the letter of introduction.  You must be sure to deliver all of the letters you have now & not put them in the post office.  I think you are greatly indebted to Mr. Poinsett & I wish you to make some return to him & it is due to him that he should be mentioned in one of your letters.  

	This is my seventh letter.  I have written two to Washington, two to N. York, & two to Boston, & this is my seventh which I will also direct to N. York.  I hope you will receive them all.  I wish you would write to me on Foolscap paper.  I am always sorry when I get to the end.  You ought to pay postage on Col. Townes letters, & continue to write.  All who see me speak of your letters, & seem to find them interesting.  You would write an interesting account of Mr. Van Buren, Mr. W� & others.  Niagara, Saratoga &c.  I wish I were with you.  You must not hurry too much.  I am provoked you left Washington so soon.  I have no news to tell you.  The village seems quite dull.  You need not regret your absence.   Yours, E.F.P.  Take care of yourself.

If you have money enough, buy a Sofa a neat cheap one, though even in this do as you think best.  Dr. Randall Croft has lost his youngest child a boy seven months old.
