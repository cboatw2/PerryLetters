Letter 80

Wednesday, 8 March 1847

My dear husband

	I feel very anxious to write at once to you, to tell all that has passed outwardly & in my mind to you, since we parted.  We rode on after you left us, until today when we stopped near a well & eat our dinner.  Then we continued our journey & arrived at Mr. Conner�s at 4 oclock.  We stopped & a servant came to the gate, & on asking her if we could stay there that night, she replied, her master & mistress were both from home & she expected them back that evening, that the house was locked up, & that we would have to sit in the kitchen until they came, so we got out & went into the kitchen, but I had not been there a moment, before I thought how uncomfortable & ridiculous for us to sit several hours in a kitchen, full of servants, & perhaps after all, the Master & Mistress might not return, & then what were we to do.  So before the Trunk was taken off, I asked the girl what was the next house we would stop at.  She said, either Mr. Boyd�s, which was 10 or 12 miles beyond, or Mr. Barksdale�s which was two miles from Laurens C.H.  So as the horses were tired, I determined to go to the latter place, & right glad was I at my determination, for when we drove up to Mr. Barksdale�s, the house looked so comfortable, I was certain we would be well accommodated..  We asked a boy we saw, if we could stay there, & he called his Master.  As soon as I saw him, I thought of Mr. Richardson & your cases, but the old gentleman, a very respectable looking person, handed us out, & carried us into the house, into a comfortable room where there were 3 ladies seated by the fire.  He said to the oldest one, a motherly looking person, that he did not know by what name to introduce the lady to her.  I told her my name, though I was almost afraid to.  After awhile, he said, there was a Perrin that lived in Abbeville.  I told him I was from Greenville.  In a little while he went out of the room, & when he came back, he noticed the children, & looking at Frank, said he was the image of his �. & said Willie�s forehead was exactly like his �.  I expect he had found out from Jim who we were.  I sat with them, until a fire was made in another room; when they asked me to go into that room, where I staid until Supper was ready.  After supper I [word obscured] back into that room, thinking they preferred I should, but Mrs. Barksdale asked me to remain in the room with them, which I did & made myself as agreeable as I could.  We passed the most comfortable night, I have ever passed on the road.  Everything was clean & the cooking better than usual.  The next morning Mr. Barksdale sat with us before & after breakfast.  I thought all the time it was your particular enemy.  I felt awkward to ask him if he was that gentleman, but on speaking of our return, & Laurens Court & soon, I took the opportunity to ask, if he was the gentleman that had the difficulty with Mr. Richardson.  He said no, it was his brother, who lived six miles above.  I said I was very sorry it had occurred.  He said he was very sorry Mr. Richardson applied to you to defend him.  I did not say anything more, not knowing that I ought to.  After a most pleasant time spent with the family, we prepared to resume our journey.  I asked him what he charged; he said 2 dollars.  I told him that was too little; he said no, he only charged for the provisions we had used.  So after being treated kindly & behaving kindly myself we left.  We passed through Laurens village, & arrived at Mr. Cunningham�s Monday before dinner.  We were affectionately received, & this is the first opportunity I have had of writing to tell you so since I arrived.  Mr. McLees, the Presbyterian minister of the church in the neighborhood, was here.  He left yesterday morning.  Mrs. Beman & little Cara Yancey & Mrs. John Cunningham & children are here now.  Pamela seems as usual.  She came downstairs last evening & spent it in the dining room & today she is riding out.  I sit with her a great deal & the children run about & have not given me much trouble.  Fanny�s voice is hardly ever heard.  Willy sometimes seems at a loss what to do.  I have not heard them any lessons yet & intend to.  And now my dear I would be happy & contented, & pass my time pleasantly, if it were not for one thing, &  that one thing absorbs my thoughts in the day, & keeps me awake at night.  I will tell you what it is.  Soon after I got here, Mr. Cunningham asked me where I had passed the last night.  I told him at Mr. Barksdale�s.  He laughed & asked how I had happened to get in at the Barksdales, & then the difficulty with Mr. Richardson was mentioned.  He said he had forgotten the subject until a few days before, he was speaking with Mr.  Coleman of this District, & he asked Mr. Coleman what he thought your prospects were in this District, & Mr. Coleman said you would have had no trouble at all, not met with any obstacle in the District, if it had not been for that unfortunate Richardson affair, but that your appearing against Mr. Barksdale, , had completely turned him against you & Mr. Barksdale & his family commanded 500 votes.  Mr. Cunningham said he was at first surprised when he heard their influence extend[ed] to 500 votes, but when he began to think of the respectability of the family, the number of the influential families with whom they were connected, many of them having been members of the Legislature, the Allens & others, & the popularity of Mr. Barksdale, Mr. Richardson insulted, he was not surprised at it.  He & all here think that Mr. Barksdale has justice on his side, that Mr. Richardson acted with the greatest impudence, that striking his negro; he ought to have whipped his negro himself, & apologized to Mr. Barksdale.  I cannot but be surprised that you should bring a case of this kind, you might have been in honor bound to defend Mr. Richardson in the case brought against him, but it seems to me you ought not to have indicted Mr. Barksdsale, you ought to have declined this, & could have done it with perfect propriety.  I had not heard you say anything of the cases lately & had quite forgotten them.  I only hope they will be dropped, that you will drop the one you brought, & Mr. Barksdale will drop his.  But if they are tried, I pray & beseech you to conduct the cases so as not to hurt Mr. Barksdale�s feelings.  You can be just to your Client without being unjust & harsh to your opponent.  You have the unjust side, & I am afraid your only recourse will be abuse lavished on the opposite party, for you deal in abuse I believe more than any other Lawyer.  You make more enemies than any Lawyer I ever heard of.  There seems to be no reason why a Lawyer should not conduct a case with zeal & ability for his Client, & yet so honorably & justly as to satisfy even the other party.  Do my dear be on your guard in these cases, so important to your interests, the fate of the election perhaps depends on it.  I beg you not, just to show your independence  & disregard of votes to abuse Mr. Barksdale & be violent against him.  I regard it as most unfortunate that Mr. Richardson should have applied to you.  If it had not been for this affair, Mr. John Cunningham says would have got but very few votes.  Now you have been the cause of giving him 500.  He is certainly most fortunate, electioneering himself & you electioneering for him.  I am so provoked with Mr. Richardson.  I wish he could be well  punished for the trouble he has given me.  The Lower Country persons regard the Upper Country persons with contempt, & this is an instance of it.  He treated Mr. Barksdale with contempt, made his horses run away, & then ran after him with a pistol & long knife, & then indicted him .  You know Mrs. Span said their servants had been ruined at the Virginia Springs, & they behaved impudently at Mr. Simmons, & to think that all this impudent conduct, in which you had no success, & you yourself would have acted so differently, persons who had no interest in you, should have injured you in so vital a manner; you ought to have told Mr. Richardson that he had acted impudently, that he had not justice on his side, & advised him to apologize to Mr. Barksdale. & make up the latter as well as he could.  If he had given you a fee of 500 dollars to have the unjust side, you may have been obliged to defend Mr. Richardson, though you might as you were advised by others have declined it, but I cannot see that you were obliged to bring an unjust case for him, as the indicting Mr. Barksdale for striking an impudent negro, certainly was.  Oh my dear I can only beg you for the love you bear your Wife, to be prudent, in the management of these cases, in which you are so unfortunately concerned, if they are tried, but I hope they will never be tried.  My mind is relieved after expressing all these thoughts to you, but I cannot tell you how provoked I feel with Mr. Richardson.  Little did I think, a person who I never saw, was to become such an injurious influence on your fate in life, perhaps make your career in this world so entirely different, from what it otherwise would have been.  At any rate if he does not occasion your defeat, your election if it had not been for him would have been attended with so little difficulty, the Barksdales with their 500 votes, would have gone for you.  They are connected with the Parks, Allens & I do not know who all.  The gentleman I passed the night with has 9 children gwown, one a doctor at Laurens village, another living near him, a son in law named Parks, another named Bird.  I sincerely believe this Mr. Richardson will be the cause of your defeat, for otherwise the majority in Laurens would have elected you, for it is that District which will turn the Election.  Do write me immediately.  I long to see you, though I am vexed with you for all the trouble you cause me, for you ought to have followed the advice of your friends, & not taken the cases.  I envy Mr. Orr�s good fortune in having his opponent electioneering for him.  Do read this letter over, & think deeply on it.  Write me when you will come here.  When you get to Laurens you will be able to tell how long you will be detained there.  If you can [word obscured] sooner than you thought, write to Mr. Hoke to tell Jim to come sooner than we told him, so I can go back with you.  If I go home alone, & you have no objections, perhaps I will stop at the Mr. Barksdale you have the case against & pass the night.  Perhaps I will make him your friend.  If not, I will stop at the same one I stopped at in coming here.  When � find me warm on a subject, you always take the opposite side, from obstinacy, but in all the � do not disregard it [portions of final line illegible], E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I wrote you a long letter yesterday, & gave you a great deal of advice, all for you own good, which I hope you will follow the reason of my writing to you again is that Mr. Cunningham this evening, said he wanted me to give you a message.  That in the management of these cases against Mr.  Barksdale you must be very�that you can act justly towards your Client, but at the same time not be harsh & severe to your opponent, that if you have any severity in your manner towards Mr. Barksdale. It will excite his feelings against you, to your injury, while it will be of no advantage to your Clint.  You must be fair & just, but not severe & harsh, & if you set them, the cases in the end may not operate against you.  So perform your duty, but do not have any harshness or severity in your�.  Mr. Cunningham if he can, , will go to Laurens C.H. but does not feel well, & is not certain he can go.  I like Mr. Cunningham, & particularly because he is such a friend of yours, he is a man of honor, which is saying a great deal.  I wish I had some good news to tell you, but as I have none, I will tell you some bad.  Mr. Quin came here this afternoon, & told Mr. Cunningham that he met a son of the Genl Jones who has volunteered to raise a regiment, & he told him Mr. Orr would get half of the votes in the village of Laurens.  I know he is an enemy of yours, but I am sorry to hear that this Genl Jones is a man of great influence, a dangerous man Mr. Cunningham says.  You will think I am Jobs comforter, but really this news, & the 500 votes you are to lose on account of taking Mr. Richardsons part has so depressed me, that I feel as if I must unburden myself to you.  Mr. Cunningham thinks Mr. Orr a most insinuating person in his manners & knowing as I do, that he will exert himself to the utmost, & that all you do, is to give votes to him 500 at a time, I cannot but be very uneasy.  Do write to me.  I have written all my thoughts now, so I will not have much more to say to you when I see you.  I am passing my time very pleasantly, & if it were not for these unfortunate cases against Mr. Barksdale, who Mr. Cunningham says has immense influence, connected with the most respectable families, I would be very happy.  Fanny gives me no trouble, the other children amuse themselves running about & playing.  It is late at night.  I will conclude with one more peice of bad news.  Mr. Cunningham asked me who Genl Thompson was for, I told him he professed to be for you.  He said the reason he asked me was, that he had lately seen a Mr. Ward from Greenville a Whig who was going to support Mr. Orr.  So he wanted to know if it was owing to Genl Thompsons influence or not,  He said when he argued with Mr. Ward & told him he was astounded he should support a man from Anderson in preference to one from his own district whose character, talents, firmness & so on were so well known as yourself that Mr. Ward seemed warped.  So my dear all this bad news is to make up for the good news we heard before we left Greenville.  I thought I was duty bound to tell you, so as to put you on the alert, & not let you deceive yourself.  I will close by begging you once more, to be prudent in the management of these cases, but I cannot tell you how grieved & provoked I am that you are engaged in them.  Drop Mr. Richardsons the one you bought, for there is no justice in it, & I am surprised any Lawyer but Joe Powel should bring it.  Wishing that you may have better news to tell me than I have told you.  I remain Your devoted Wife, E.F.P.

I hope Mr. Cunningham will go to Court.  He is your real friend.  You will think me warm & will be inclined to go just contrary to all I have said, but, assure you this letter is written so as to give you the message Mr. Cunningham sends you on the first page.  He begged me to delete it, for he may not be able to go to Court.  I believe you are often unnecessarily severe in your speeches in Court, but in these cases do not be so.  You must be�than it is the custom for any other Lawyer to be, for I know of any other Lawyer who makes enemies of the opposite party, in every case he has, as you do.
