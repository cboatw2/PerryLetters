Letter 5

Sunday night

My dear husband,

	I have this moment received your letter.  How delighted I am that you have not purchased the Rattle.  I have almost a mind to tear up this letter and write another, omitting the scold, but I think I will let it remain so, as it may serve you as a lesson for the future.  You must if you are able to get the Waggon and send it home some way or other.

	Wills hat fits to perfection.  It is a little beauty, and so becoming to him, you would scarcely believe I made it.  It is made of striped silk, & the rim turned up.  I have made one for the society of the same shape. They gave me the materials.  We have not met since you left as it rained yesterday.  He has only been to Mrs. Sloanes once.  I intend sending him to Mrs. Hoke�s soon.  Mrs. Gower sent for him this evening, but he was asleep.  When he has a carriage of his own, he shall go out a great deal.

	James does quite well.  Victoria�s misconduct was not his fault.  It seems to me Rose gives as much Milk as usual.  I have now a bowl full of Cream.  Carlos has acted badly.  She almost killed the Duck.  I thought it had better be put to death, but contrary to my expectations it has recovered.  The other night after I was in bed, & the candle put out, I heard him howling in the Drawing room.  Delia was obliged to come down & let him out, and this evening he was at the front door & knocking & looking for admittance in a furious manner.  He was turned away with the broom stick.  Uncle Arthur had better give up all thoughts of Presiding & quietly go home & preside over his own household.  Good night, E.F.P.
