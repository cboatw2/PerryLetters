Letter 5

Thursday morning, 5 December 1839
Greenville

My dear husband

	I was disappointed last night in not hearing from you.  I believe no Columbia package arrived, or if it did nothing for me.  I received a letter from Susan, which in some measure made up for not hearing from you.

	Your Waggons from Pickens arrived yesterday.  The Man (I do not know his name) says the agreement was to bring one Waggon for 95 dollars, and the wooden part of another Waggon of the same size for 25 dollars, which made up the debt of a hundred dollars.  He says the Waggon was not to have been painted, but someone offered to paint it, if he could have the use of it for a few days, and he drove it to some place (E�I believe) and was offered 90 dollars right off for the Waggon, so that though you have got it for 75 dollars only.  You can sell it for 90 dollars.  It is a Red Waggon, and is now standing in the Stable yard.  The pieces of the other Waggon, I have had put in the Lumber room, that they may not be exposed to the rain.  A Blacksmith will have to put them together.  You must expect in parting with the Waggon to ask 90 dollars.

	The weather is now good, and has given me an opportunity of returning some of my visits, and of others coming to see me.  Tuesday Miss Harrison & Charlotte Smith came, and afterwards Mr. Pinckney, who said, he was afraid I might be sick as I was not at church on Sunday, so had come to see me.  He was very kind, and said his Sister was coming to see me, to ask me to spend the day with them this week.  So accordingly Miss Pinckney came yesterday, paid me a long visit, and said, I must take my work, and my baby, and go early tomorrow morning and spend the day with them, so I am to dine with them tomorrow.  Miss McBee afterwards came and then Mrs. Dr. Butler.  I showed Mrs. Butler the hat I had made for my baby, and she admired it so much, and said her baby was greatly in want of one, and that she did not know where she could get one, that I offered to make her one, furnish the Silk and all.  You know she has been kind in sending us things, and she admires Willy so much, that she has quite won my heart.  So I intend to deny myself of something or other I may need, and spend the money in getting the materials to make the hat for her baby.  I assure you I am so beautiful a Milliner, that if reduced I could even gain a livelihood, by bringing into use my accomplishments in that line.  Miss McBee said she had no idea I was so ingenious, that one not accustomed or obliged to work, should work so beautifully.  I told her, since I could recollect I always had been fond of my needle, that we all could work.  I commenced showing her how to knit Socks.

	Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Coleman came to see me, but I was out.  I had gone to see Mrs. Hoke and Mrs. Townes.  Mrs. Townes� baby is really the ugliest little thing I have ever seen, though rather too large to get into a quart cup.  It was born a month too soon, so Mrs. Gordon says it will sleep for one month instead of being able to�like Willy.  It looks as if it hardly breathed.  It is a weak, puny little thing, but do not mention what I say to anyone, as it may seem ill natured, but I only tell the truth.  I carried Will with me, and Mrs. Townes says he is the prettiest baby she has ever seen.  She thanked me kindly for some Syllabubs I had sent her the day before, & which she said were the nicest she had ever tasted.  Mrs. Wm Roberts was there and as she held Willy, she said, �this baby is just ten days older than mine would have been.�  I felt sorry when I thought what comfort she had been deprived of.  Mrs. Roberts, Mrs. Sloane�s daughter seems an amiable lady.

	The Servants have all gone to the Show.  It has been the subject of conversation for days past, so I told them if they behaved well, I would give them 25 cts apiece & let them go.  Minerva & Delia, so I gave them quarter of a dollar, but James staid so long last night at the Post office playing, I was obliged to send Delia after him so I would not give him the money but have made him pay his own expenses.  They have all three just gone off, so Willy and me are alone.  He is on the carpet amusing himself.

	Mrs. Butler says it is paying Willy no compliment, but he is the image of you, particularly his nose (which you know is the exact opposite to yours).  Willy�s eyes are particularly admired & are pronounced by all, �very fine eyes.�  Everything said of my husband & child goes straight to my heart.  I have quite forgotten myself.

	All seem very kind to me, now that I am alone.  Dr. Crook has been to see me twice and even Mr. Wells, when he came to get your Office key, said �recollect if you wish anything call upon some of us.�  I had the baby in my arms, and he said , �it was a remarkably fine baby.�  I get along astonishingly.  Dr. Crook said, �who would think for a Charleston g[page torn] come up here, keep house so well alone�a little Soldier.  Delia and little William are my protectors at night.  Minerva takes care of the Kitchen & James.

	Mrs. Henry Earle has a Son.  Sarah writes word that Eloisa�s baby is a weak puny little thing.  It is a seven months child, and Eloisa is suffering excruciatingly with a Milk fever, which confines her entirely to her bed.  It must be something like Rheumatism.  Aunt Eliza�s is a remarkably fine child, fat and plump.  Susan says they saw Mrs. Thompson as she passed through Charleston.  They went to see her.

	Dr. Crook offered to take me to see the Giraffe, but I did not care to go.  Augustus Hoke has this moment come to ask me to go.  He is the image of his Father, even his manner.  Mamma prefers a small door between her Drawing & Dining Rooms &[word obscured] Railing, what I call Banisters to her back steps.  

	I have come to the�of the sheet my dear husband, & Willy is crying.  I am quite well, & hope to hear by the next mail that you are; so adieu for the present.  Your ever affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
