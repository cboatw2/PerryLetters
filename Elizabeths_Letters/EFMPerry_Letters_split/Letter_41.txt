Letter 41

Friday morning, 24 January 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received your letter Wednesday night & was delighted to hear from you.  Your account of Willie was very interesting, & pleased me extremely.  I laughed at his sayings.  I was so anxious to hear how he was doing, & am gratified he has behaved so well.  Susan & Mamma say they have always thought him an uncommon child in every respect.  I hope tonight to hear again.  I wish to know how Willie behaves in the city, & what his friends think of him.  I am afraid you have bad weather.  It rained here yesterday afternoon, & all last night.  It is not raining now, but is very cloudy, & I suppose will rain again.  I have just been reading the Mountaineer.  Gov.Briggs message about the Hoar case is published, & Mr. Wells speaks very indignantly of the Abolitionists as interfering with us first in [one] way, then in another.  As you did not disapprove of Mr. Hoars mission, it does seem as if you side with the abolitionists, & indeed my dear husband I do think your judgement there was wrong, & I will always regret the part you took.  I think the Legislature was right in the course it took.  It was an uncommon case, & called for uncommon action.  If Mr. Hoar had been allowed quietly to remain, the Northerners would have been encouraged to go further.  On this account, it was right to send him away.  I am not satisfied with the peice you have written.  I do not think it vindicates your course.  To have avoided the appearance of evil, you should have acted differently.  I am afraid you will see trouble on account of it yet.  Your enemies can take hold of it against you.  However as you got yourself into trouble, I hope you will be able to get out without my help.

	I yesterday wrote to Pamela, & mentioned you would execute the commission for her.  I suppose she wrote directions, how the dress was to be dyed.  If you return by Augusta, in passing through Abbeville, you could send the dress to John Cunningham, who would send it to her, or if you return by Columbia, you can leave it at Laurens for her, but perhaps she has told you how to get it to her.

       A letter received by the last Mail from Mr. Bailey, making inquiries when you would be in town, & very anxious you should go down, or get someone to attend to the case for you.  A letter also came from Mr. Elijah Webb thanking you for your able speech on the Presidential Election, says it breathes a true republican spirit, that he believes the people will do right if left to themselves, that the election which has just come off is a fair illustration of it, that if his election had been control[l]ed by the dominant party of the state, & a few aristocrats about Anderson & Pendleton, he would have been turned out of office after all the pains he had taken to make the people a faithful public officer.  He hopes your speech will find its way to every house in S. Carolina.  The letter you received from Mr. Gantt the night you left, I hope you have answered, as he seemed so anxious to have his difficulty solved immediately.  A Museum has arrived.  Another year I would like to take the Lady�s book.  It has such beautiful pictures in it.  Mrs. Coleman has stopped taking it, so now I have no chance of seeing the pictures.
       
       I have not been out since you left.  The walking is very bad.  Susan has been in to see me.  Miss Goodlett & Miss Long have paid me a visit, & Miss Williford & Miss Service.  Mrs. Pemble lives only a few steps from the Charleston Hotel, in Hasell st, so you must carry Willie to see her, if only for a few minutes.  They would be pleased if you did.  Miss Margaret said you must.  Uncle Joseph lives so out of society, that I am certain he will not call to see you, but through Aunt Anna Turnbull, Willie could see him.  Aunt Anna would carry Willie, or invite uncle Joseph to her house.  Though he has thrown himself away, he has strong feelings, & would be gratified to see his little nephew.
       
       There are some things I am afraid you will forget, so will remind you again.  One is to inquire the prices of carri[a]ges for Mamma, & put the prices on paper, so you will not forget.  I am under the impression that carri[a]ges are much cheaper in town, & handsomer than in Greenville, & there of course they have the latest fashions.  Mr. Cox I think is exorbitant, & after all our carri[a]ge was not made so well, for it is now at the shop repairing.  Jim says the springs at first were too slender.  I am satisfied with our carri[a]ge, but I am willing Mamma should get a better bargain.  You must price different ones.  Another important thing you must not forget is to look for a place for Minerva.  Mrs. Thompson & Coleman, had women with Mrs. Lee or Johnson, the latter I believe keeps Jones.  Lee it is said keeps the best table in town, so that would be a good place for Minerva to learn cooking.  I never could spare Minerva better than now.  Her children are old enough to do without her.  Delia can sleep in the room & take care of them.  She can wash & iron, & Eliza cook.  The terms are, that for the servants services, she is taught to cook.  Minerva is capable of being a good cook, if she was only taught.  A mistress can read the receipts for making things, but cannot direct the baking, boiling, mixing &c which is the most important part.  Minerva could go down as soon as you return, & come back in the Spring.  The expense incurred would be well repaid by having a good cook.
       
       I have been planting orange seed.  I have planted a row on each side of the walk from the steps to the gate, & am not planting all round the fence.  James & Delia are doing it, directed by me.  Whenever I commence such improvements I am discouraged, from the difficulty I find in getting what I wish done.  Jim will commence, & suddenly when my back is turned, go off, & I can[not] get him again.  Then I call James, & while I am attending to something else he will disappear, & lastly I give up in despair.  You will have to improve your lot, & I attend to the house.  I am anxious to have some orange trees, that I hope you will persevere, if I am obliged to give up.  Jim has been working at the farm.  It is only before he gets his breakfast, I ask him to help me.  I have been told the lower country orange seed, take better than the upper.  If you were to be in the way of getting any, now you are in town, you must bring me some.  You must buy some Mango seeds, which makes such nice Pickles.
       
       I have no news to tell you.  We are all well, at Mamma�s the same as when you left.  Corn has been brought several times.  I hope to hear tonight from you.  Tell Willie he must behave so well, that his friends will love him, & then he can go & see them again.  I may write to you once more, if you remain as long as you expected, but if you do not hear you may not be uneasy.  Kiss Willie for me, & tell him I long to see him.  Remember me to my friends, Lizzy
