Letter 93

Tuesday night, 14 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband
	
		I must write you a few lines tonight, because tomorrow Mrs. Arthur & Mamma�s family are to dine with me, & I will not have a moment to spare for writing.  The barrel of Cider was bought�ago., by the Mr. Millers father & son.  Willie received from Mr. Gantt two very pretty letters, one was written 2 weeks ago when he thought Mr. Miller was going to bring the Cider then, the other was written yesterday.  In one of the letters he tells Willie, Mr. Miller is connected with a large, respectable & influential family in Pickens, the Alexanders, & that if you were at home, he would have advised  you to pay him some attention, with a view to the result at the Congressional Election, so I took the hint, & was very polite, asked them to take Supper which they did, & I pressed them to pass the night, but they said they had to sleep at the Mill, with their Grain.  I asked them to come back to breakfast tomorrow.  They said they would as they had to come for T�. Mr. Gantt sent the letter by the son, who came to his fathers last night, about 15 miles from here near Pickensville.  The old man lives & they came on together.  I am to pay 1 dollar for bringing the Cider.  Mr. Gantt in his letter says the Cider ought to be drawn off immediately, & put in smaller vessels, or it will turn acid, but I have nothing to put it in.   He gives Willie a great deal of good advice.  Wilie is now writing to him.  Poor T� we are all sorry to part with him.  Mr. Gantt says he will be kind to him, & if ever he parts with him return him to Willie.  Yesterday I wrote to you, & it was warm, last night, it rained hard, then the wind blew, & this morning it cleared up cold, tonight it is very cold.  It is well for our meat, that this change has taken place, for if the warm weather had continued only a little longer, it would have spoiled.  As it is, the Sausage meat, Liver, & Hogs head cheese, have all been useless.  Jim examined the Meat yesterday & says it is safe.  I am happy to tall you that for two days Mr. Hooker has been working on the Fence, & it has now almost reached the office.  Yesterday I looked at it repeatedly, today the wind has been so high, I have hardly been to the door.  Mr. Arthur is going away tomorrow, so only Mrs. Arthur is coming, & those at Mamma�s.  Mrs. Town[e]s yesterday, sent to ask me to fix upon a day to go to Mr. Duncans, so I fixed upon Friday, as by that time Mr. Hooker will not need Jim to help him, so Friday if it is a good day, you can imagine us there.  Mr. Croft goes to town Thursday.  I had intended writing to some of my friends by him, but he goes so much sooner than I expected, that I am afraid now, I will not be able to.  The Mr. Miller�s asked me the news from Columbia, so I told them all I knew.  I told them Judge Harper�s family had been given by the Senate a years Salary.  They disapproved of that.  I told them you voted against it.  They said there were a great many poor families besides Judge Harpers.  There was no reason they should have money given them.  They asked if anything had been done for Col. Butlers family?  I said I had heard of nothing.  I expected Congress would attend to that.  They said yes, it was by Congress.  The provision ought to be a years salary.  Mr. Hooker said Judge Harpers family ought not to have a years salary, that it was time now to stop that practice.  Do you not think it would be a good plan to buy your garden seeds of Mr. Russel[l] in Columbia.  When we went to Housekeeping you used to do so, & we had much better vegetables than we now have.  I expect they keep the seeds here from year to year.  At Russel[l]s you would be more apt to get them fresh.  I write in a hurry, & am dictating at the same time, Willies letter.   We are all well.  We long to see you.  I expect you will have dreadful roads to travel home, but you must not mind it when you recollect  that every step however slow & rough, brings you nearer home, & when you get home, it will be pleasant to talk of all  of all that has passed during your absence.  The talk will all be on your side, for nothing has occurred since you left.  This is a dull season.  You ought to be glad to be away from Greenville a short time, that you may not stagnate.  I do not hear of any weddings to take place.  All the engagements I believe were mere rumours.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow.  I wrote you yesterday, so have nothing to write about now.  Anna got through her reading book today.  She is a smart little girl.  Mr. Gantt wrote beautiful letters to Willie, giving him good advice, & speaking of his friendship for you.  I think he will be pleased to receive an answer from him.  If the Legislature adjourns Friday, this will be my last letter.  If it does not, I will write again.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

P.S. Wednesday morning

		I will add a few lines.  I have everything ready now for my company. Table laid & all.  I have just taken my last look at T� & I assure you I cried.  Poor Willie is at school, & I was glad he was.  The�eat breakfast here, on going away.  I told him I hoped he was your friend.  He said he always had been.  He has 8 brothers, all in Pickens except one, who moved lately to Greenville.  The Cider Mr. Gantt wrote word was Nectar.  We will try it at dinner.  Willie wrote him a pretty letter.  Today is very cold.  The Fence is still going on, & looks very pretty.  I wish you were here to eat some of my Plum pudding, Jelly & B� & Turkey, but I will give you a good Christmas dinner.  Adieu, E.F.P.
