Letter 216

Thursday morning, 10 oclock, 2 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you.  I am pleased at your being thought of as Governor, & provoked that you should decline the honor.  If you ran & were not elected this time, you might be another, & it would then seem as if you had at last been so rewarded & appreciated by your State.  Your position in the State for yourself & family would be established forever.  You would then be ranked among the highest.  Why do you act so strangely, & not avail yourself of the offers made to honor you.  You are always holding back, & let others take, what you could easily have.  Why do you not think of your own & your wife & childrens interest.  It has provoked me ever since I have been married, this disposition of yours, to do for others, what you wont do for yourself.  As your honors all end in nothing, it is tantalizing to me, only to have suggestions made & not carried out, that it gives me no satisfaction.  I would be much happier if you had some ambition.  I have, & your not having any, is a constant source of annoyance to me.  You had better for my sake be elected to some Office.  Until you are I will give you no peace.  I will then get over my disappointment at your Congressional defeat.  You ought to have said yes you would run for Governor.  You know you deserve it, & would discharge the duties better than anybody & in Greenville where so many look down on you & dislike you, I would be so pleased to make them henceforward feel differently.  I hope you will be elected; for my sake do, it will make me so happy.  I will never worry at anything again, & I will feel so pleased at your being appreciated, & after the term is over you can practice law again.  It will cause you to have higher honors & make your children stand so high in the world; for their sakes, consent to run.

	I am glad Anna is enjoying herself, & that Mrs. Martin asked her to stay with her.  I suppose she is today in Charleston.  I am sorry you bought her so useless & extravagant  a present as a medallion.  A Silver comb which is ornamental & useful I wished her to get.  She has no chain to wear the Medallion with.  Do not spend your money so uselessly.  All of mine here goes for servants clothes.  In winter it costs a great deal to clothe them & I only give them what is absolutely necessary but try to provide for one a great many.  I try to save but it is no use, what I save, you throw away.  We are all well.  Mrs. Stuart was here yesterday, came to borrow books.  She said she wished Mr. Thompson would get an Office; that he wished to be Superintendent of roads, that the present incumbent did not wish the Office.  I told her you were going to try & get it for Mr. Thompson.  You must not forget it.  When you are Governor you can give him an Office.  How delightful to have it in the power to help others.  Susan Hoke says Mrs. Trimmier was a run away match; says the family are so small in size, dwarfs I should think.  I am sorry Anna witnessed such boldness.  I hope to hear every day from you.  It is my only comfort.  I have nothing new to write about.  

	I would be very sorry if the Commons in College is dispensed with.  I think the young men should eat & sleep in the College.  If the Fare is bad, make them pay more, & have better.

	Isaac Hayne�s was really a close vote.  If the Greenville Delegation had not voted for him, he would have been defeated.  I am really sorry Jones was elected, but if you are elected Governor, I will be able to get over Jones undeserved reward.  It worries me so, the fear that you will not run, that I am almost sorry you mentioned the subject to me.  From Mr. DeTrevilles vote there must be a great many Secessionists in the Legislature.  You will get also the Union & some of the Cooperationists, so if you will only run, you will certainly be elected, so I will live on hope & do you run I never will again repine at you not hav[ing] been rewarded as you deserve if you Are Elected Governor.  It seems to me if you are only a Candidate, the Legislature will be glad to show their esteem by electing you.  So I new certainly look forward to my dear husband being a Governor, not that it will make him higher in my esteem, but in the World it will, & will be a mark of esteem he deserves & merits, & through the whole United States he will be honored, but alas I fear my wishes will not be realized.  If not, a Seat on the bench is what next I wish.

	I will write soon to Anna.  I hope she will pass her time pleasantly in Charleston.  I am glad she behaves well.  Willie reads, & hauls wood.  He misses the driving the carri[a]ge, & wont drive one horse unless he can drive both.  Frank goes to school.  Fanny & Hext�amuse themselves at home.  Fanny also goes to Mamma�s. & Annie comes here.  I am too busy to visit, have rode out twice only.  I am glad you are employed, but wish you had a little more time to write.  Write every day.  I miss your letters if you do not.  Ever yours, E.F.P.
