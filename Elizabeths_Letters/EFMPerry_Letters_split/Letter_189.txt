Letter 189

Wednesday, 1/2 past 10, 3 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband  

		As I heard from you last night, & consequently have more than usual to say to you, I will write before I commence my work.  Willie, Anna, Frank & myself all received your letters last night, & were very much pleased to get them.  In all your letters you ask what you must bring me, so now I will tell you.  I love to make presents, as much as you do, so do bring me, a pair of Indian Shoes, such as you have bought for Hext.  I wish to give them to little Susan.  I have never made her a present yet, & would like to give her a pr of Shoes just like Hexts, & buy me also another Indian pocket book, that I may give it to Ann.  She is at present very poorly, & would be pleased to be noticed kindly by me in some way.  I would like one or something else for Susan also.  If they are not very expensive, buy one of the pocket books for Susan, or I will instead give it to Vardry as a present.  So remember these are the things I wish you to bring me, two Indian pocket books, & a pr of Indian Shoes, anything made by Indians is a curiosity, & even if not useful, is interesting to keep.  My bag is of no use.  It is too large, & the beads come out constantly.  I hope Anna�s is prettier than mine, & a smaller size.  Now do not forget to bring me three things if the Indian has not gone.  These are all the presents I wish, & you must not bring many things to the children, save your money to clothe & feed us this winter, & to pay your Doctors bill, Blacksmith�s, Saddler�s &c &c to buy a new carri[a]ge & horses next Spring, & to take me to Columbia with you.  The children if you gave them a Carte blanche, would very easily fill it up, but you cannot think of gratifying all their desires.  They will each write to you, & you can select out of them what you choose to bring them.   	

		I am sorry you could not dine at Mr. Latta�s, & particularly the cause that prevented you.  If you see him, Mamma says you may tell him, she has not forgotten his kindness, to her on board the vessel as she was going to Philadelphia, & if he has a pretty place, & any suitable seeds to plant on a Lawn & improve her place, she would be much obliged to him.  I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am afraid you are too kind to the Secessionists,  When you mention a Secessionist, you praise them up too much.  A Secessionist who has the heart to ruin his State & principally for his own selfish views, or the bad judgment to think he is right in wishing the State to Secede does not deserve praise.  The Cooperationists are the safest of the two parties, as they can do no injury, have to wait for the other States to join them, but the Secessionists would ruin the State now at once.  I like Mr. Owens bill, that the people have resolved against Secession.  I hope you will make an able speech on his side.  If the Convention does meet, arrange it, that it will not meet when the Baltimore Convention meets to nominate President, as you�to go to that, & will have to go to the Columbia Convention.  I do not understand how it is that Mississippi has no Governor, as the Patriot says, & I suppose she has not, as I see Mr. Footes name mentioned in Washington. 

		If Mr. Burt wishes you Governor, I am sorry he does not edit a newspaper now, for if he did, he would make known his wishes to the people.  He commenced editing at the wrong time, when he injured you, & stops when he would benefit you.  If you tried for Office, I expect you would get it, but I hope you may still get it one day.

		I am sorry a Baptist will be elected President of the College.  My idea of that Sect is always associated with ignorance & cont�[word faded], & a Minister, the young men will feel a prejudice against.  They are generally so sanctimonious, & put on the appearance of religion, where very often it is wanting.  

		Willie is again hauling wood.  He drives the wagon.  The children all talk constantly of you.  Your letters pleased them very much.  Fanny & Hext the next time you must write to.  Mamma has a bad cold & Ann poorly.  I rode in the Buggy yesterday for the first time to see them.  Mamma has made an arrangement with Mr. Saterfield who has been overseeing for Mr. McBee to cultivate her place next year, & make everything for her, & attend to the whole place.  He has a wife but no children.  I wish you would get such a person.  I do not wish ever to rent your place to a large family.  They will burn too much wood.  Mr. Saterfield says your place well attended to, would yield so well you would have to buy very little provision, or none at all.  He is a friend of yours, says it is not easy to find another like you & he takes the Patriot, so of course he will have me for a friend.  He will cut wood, raise hogs, work in the garden.  His wife [word faded] Chickens & Eggs, attend[s] to the Cow, & do[es] just Mr. P� white overseers & family do.  So I hope Mamma will be more comfortably fixed than heretofore.  Negroes hire is so dear now 105 dollars a year for a man.  She is obliged to take Mr. John Townes woman, who has just been confined, so will have a young infant along with her.  She can get no other.  She will go in a few weeks.

		We have bright cheerful weather now, & even Commencement day turned out better than you supposed.  At least it was a charming day here.

		I have read the Patriot through.  It is the only paper I see.  I hope you will get some subscribers to it, while in Columbia.

		You made your speech yesterday I suppose, on the Election of President.  You can improve it, & write it out, & publish it in the Patriot, or publish the one you made before.  You occupy an independent position.  You are between the two parties Cooperation & Secession, can see the faults & virtues of each, & write of them accordingly.

		I am glad you are to dine  with old Mr. �.  Tell him I am the Originator of the Southern Patriot, & even the Editors themselves were about to give up, I encouraged & made them go on.  He ought to hand down my name to posterity in poetry. 

		Do not be extravagant, my dear husband, bring me a present in money when you come home if you wish it.  So instead of buying so many things now, come home with a pocket full of money, but buy the Shoes & pocket books I have told you.  E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
