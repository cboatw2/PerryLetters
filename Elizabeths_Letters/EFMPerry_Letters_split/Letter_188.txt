Letter 188

Monday morning, 11 oclock, 1 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

		I am sorry I have not better pens to write with, but as they are very bad, you must make many excuses.  Mr. Elford I suppose left this morning.  He will take you a letter from Anna & myself.  Willie thought his not worth sending.  He will write to you soon.

		I received a letter from you last night.  I was very glad to hear, & wish you would write every Mail.  I am pleased you are treated so well by the Secessionists.  I suppose, as Mr. Elford says, they thank you in their heart, & look upon you as one who has saved them from disgrace, though for their own credit, they feel compelled to abuse you.  I hope they will reward you, for the good you have done them.  Mr. Memminger is a mean man, & you have not been half hard enough upon him.  You ought in your paper to bring all inconsistent, selfish people to the view of the people.  I hope all such speeches as the Representative from Greenville lately made about their being so few Union men in Greenville, you will make known to the people, who are so misrepresented, through your paper.  I cannot bear for deceitfulness & falsehoods to pass unnoticed, & not injure the person who acts so�but�get him along prosperously & favorably.  Such people ought to be disgraced at once.  It is a wonder how such should have been honored by the people.  I hope the days of such are numbered.

		The servants tell me Mr. Walker & family have left for Georgia this morning.  I hope you will not be grieved to hear the sad news.  I wish others of the same description would follow.  Yesterday was a damp, rainy, disagreeable Day.  I had toothache almost all day, & the cold penetrated me, & I have to wear a large shawl & flannel over my face; but today I feel quite well, & this first day of winter has made its appearance bright & cheerful, & most charming for the washing of clothes, that most necessary business every Monday.  Anna is at school, & will have holiday in a week.  Willie has driven the horse & wagon to the Farm to help Reuben bring home a load of wood.  Charles is spading the garden.  Frank cut some wood, & then went in the streets to see some playmates.  Fanny makes herself very useful helping lay the table & put away the dishes.  I told her I would write you word she was the best & you must bring her a doll, or some pretty present.

		I believe Green Hughes is just passing now to receive his sentence.  I suppose the Governor has not pardoned him.  I am glad you are getting along very well.  I wish you to be happy & contented, as it is possible for you to be, without your wife by your side.

		Hext is well, & as sweet as ever, & waiting patiently for his Carri[a]ge & chair to arrive.

		Our colds are quite well.  That is the childrens & mine.  Lindy is a little hoarse; the rest of the servants are pretty well.

		I have not been out once since you left, & am so busy, I do not know when I will go out.  The winter clothes for the children, are not hardly commenced making yet.  The rooms at present look very neat.  The Piano [is] in the dining room, where the Sideboard stood. The Sideboard looked so shabby, & got broke a little in moving.  I sent it to Mr. Waddil to do up, & when it returns will put it in the little dining room, as that is the place for it, when we eat, & it will save a great deal of dirt, from the servants not coming in & out constantly to it.

		Willie looks quite well & hearty.  Next Spring you can carry Frank & himself down with you.  You recollect in a few years Willie ought to be at college, so your expenses will then increase, so you must save your money now, for those times.  Col. Brockman must give you his note bearing interest, & then he may keep the 200 dollars as long as he wishes.  

		Your review of Mr. Calhoun�s works has not been published yet in the Patriot,  I hope they will soon print Mr. F��s peice of poetry addressed to you.  You must write & tell them to.  The paper will do badly with neither of its Editors here.  Old Mr. Reese�s letter has not been published either.

		I hope you are feeling well & looking well.  Tomorrow you must make a good speech on giving the Election of President to the people, & after that introduce some more important bills.  The basis of representation ought also to be given to the people, & you know all that ought to be done, to put South Carolina on a footing with the other States.

		I do not think the College will flourish under Mr. Manly as it has done under Col. Preston.  I am sorry Col. Preston has to resign.  I thought Mr. Thornwell or Mr. Henry would be elected President.

		 I know of nothing new to tell you.  I hope you will put off your visit to Charleston till the Spring, & then Willie & Anna can go down with you.  You are sent to the Legislature by the people to attend to their business, & ought not to leave it, even for a day.  If you will go to town, go after the Session.  You can then stay longer, & will not be neglecting your duty.  The expense of going on the Railroad up & down is not worth incurring for the short time you will stay now.

		I write so often, I have nothing to write about & am sure you think so too, & will not be sorry I have come to the end of my sheet. Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.
