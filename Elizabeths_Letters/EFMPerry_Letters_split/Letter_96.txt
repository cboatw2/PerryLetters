Letter 96

Thursday night, [1846]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I will write you, if it is only a few lines tonight to send by Mr. Town[e]s tomorrow�.  I know you will be disappointed if you do not hear again.  I expected certainly to hear from you last night, & would scarcely believe the mail had come, when March returned without a letter.  My disappointment is always mingled with uneasiness, for when from home, I am always anxious to know certainly that you are well.  Your life is so important to your family, that you must be as careful as possible of it.  I am still busy housecleaning, even now.  March is in the room, putting a peice of Furniture in its place.  We have not half got through, the white washing is finished, & the room somewhat fixed, but next week the Entries, the Staircase, the Piazza�all to be cleaned, the Curtains washed & put up, & other things done too numerous to mention.  There are enough dirty things to occupy a week.  Monday, Delia & Mary will have to stop to wash some of the clothes, the house, all over, was shockingly dirty, the dirt seemed to me several inches thick under the Carpets.  To show you in what confusion we have been, last night when Frank fell asleep in my lap, there was not a single bed ready for him, & we had to put him in the basket of dirty clothes, where he took a comfortable nap.  I am thankful, & you ought to be, that you have not been here.  You would not have stood it.  I feel tonight, tired.  I have to work, so will be able to write you but a short letter.  You must write to me by someone returning home, any directions about your farm you can give.  I expect they are all doing as you would wish them, for I believe Jim & Charles are good fa�.  I sent work to Jim, that you wished him to go on planting rapidly.  Susans letters now are quite satisfactory.  She mentioned in one of her notes to Mamma, that Pinckney McBee had paid them a pleasant visit, that he kissed her, which she certainly thought a proof of regard, & on going away, he said, if he was only certain of having such a wife as she was, he would be perfectly happy.  Mr. Luther said, he had never known propriety, until he married her, & they determined her to do all in her power  to make him happy.  So I hope everything will go on smoothly.  As soon after your return as is convenient, I wish all of us to go & spend a day at the Factory.  I have seen no one, been no where, & have no news to tell you.  The only new thing I have heard is, what Mr. Hooker told me when he came to fix up the bedstead (which March could not do).  He said there were to be several more stores set up here, one by Mr. R. Duncan & Charles Elford, another by Col. Irvine & Joe Elford, & another by Mr. McBee & Frank Cox, so I think they must be anticipating the Rail Road.  The children are quite well.  Today Frank said, I rode on horse.  I said when? He said, this morning.  I said, who let you ride?  He said Pa.  I said where is Pa?  He said, up street.  He is as sweet as ever.  Mr. Luther says they are the prettiest & finest children he has ever seen.  Unfortunately a looking glass has got broken, the one that was on my table & that you had before we were married.  It was put in the Portico yesterday along with the other chamber furniture.  The wind was very high & blew it down.  I am more superstitious about that than anything else.  It makes me uneasy about you while you are away, & after you return I will be uneasy about myself.  So do be careful of yourself my dear.  It is now past 9, so good night   Yours ever, Liz

P.S. Mr. Luther sent me yesterday a present of some candle wick.  As I do not make Candles, I will put it into stockings for yourself & the children.  It seems very strong.
