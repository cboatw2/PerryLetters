Letter 56

Sunday night, 11 May 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you.  I am so glad you wrote, for it is such a disappointment when I do not hear, more so to me than to you, for without you I am lonely, & a letter from you, even a few lines is a treat.  If you were not so very busy I would write oftener, when you know how much work I have on hand, you will see I have not the time.  I write tonight, because I am more at leisure than I will be tomorrow.  I will tell you the work I have to do at once a dress for Minerva, Delia, Mary, Lindy & Clara each; Pantaloons for Jim & James; Shirts also & aprons for them; Night  dresses, Chemise, Petticoats, Nightcaps, Aprons & Collars for myself.  Shoes for you & clothes for the children, & more besides; now have I a moment to spare.

	Mamma is very glad to hear Uncle Arthur will pay her a visit.  From Aunt Elizabeths letter, she was in hopes he would.  I dare say he will come during your absence.  I am sorry, as I would like you to have seen him, & he you.  It is a pity the arrangement of the Court was changed so as to bring the lower country Lawyers to Columbia.  You were not formerly delayed in your business as you now are, & it is so expensive to remain so long a time in Columbia, particularly when you are doing nothing.  You must in the Legislature next winter propose altering it, & having it as it formerly was.

	Mr. Butler went Friday night to Columbia.  He sent me word that he would take a letter but Margaret was with me, so I could not write.  I wonder why he goes down.  Mrs. Stone says on business connected with the Commissioners office.  You say you have engaged a suit of clothes.  I suppose they are a dress suit.  If they are, you ought to get another suit for every day, as you so much need them.  Nice clothes are needed for the week, as much as on Sunday.  I hope you have bought us pretty beads.  I suppose they are different from mine, as you got a set for me.  Willy says you must bring him something pretty, that he will not tell you what, because perhaps you will get something prettier than he would tell you.  If there are any horses such as you saw in Charleston, & are suitable for a boy of his size, & do not cost much, you might think of one of those for him, but I expect there are none of the kind there, you mentioned seeing in Charleston, & if they are, now when we wish to save, it would be extravagant to get it.  The Valocipedes I do not like at all.  I wish Columbia was as good & economical a place for shopping as Charleston.  There are several things I would like you to get for me.  I am very glad when you do buy pretty things, that they should be such as will do to put in the Drawing room, & add to the beauty of the room.

	You must tell Mr. Barclay if he is coming to Greenville only for the purpose of taking my likeness, he may stay away, if he did not succeed to my satisfaction in yours, he will certainly not in mine.  I wish mine taken, but it shall be by one, who I am confident will not fail.  Yours to the generality of people would be a striking likeness, but I see it is far from being correct, though your features are large, they are delicately formed, your nose is thin, your lips are thin,, & you have no double chin, & full cheeks which Mr. Barclay has given you along with a Roman nose, & puffed up lips.  It always looks to me like Mr. Henry & Col. Brockman than you.  If the Daguerreotype painter that Mr. Summer mentioned in his paper, is still in Columbia, do you have your likeness taken, in the prettiest way that he takes them.  If you wish to bring me a valuable present, & one that will please me above everything else, bring me your miniature.  I wish to own an exact likeness of yourself, & taken as Mr. Summer described, it was far superior to all Daguerreotypes we have ever seen & must certainly give an exact likeness, so if the Dr I think he was a Doctor is still in Columbia, gratify me & bring me what I so much wish, a faithful likeness of yourself to comfort me during your many absences.  This is if the likenesses taken are really good.  The paper mentioned the price was reasonable.

	Mrs. Chick is dead.  She & Dr. Chick have been at the Springs since last summer..  She was quite well & went into the garden after the rain & was walking about, & she fell down.  She cried for help. & when someone went to her, one side of her body was paralyzed.  When she was carried into the house, the other side became affected.  After that I think it was the last consciousness, & after remaining so for a time & suffering greatly, died.

	You say I must tell you how everything goes on.  I am sorry to tell you that faithful Bob is not well.  Yesterday morning Jim came in & said Mr. Longs Dudley said Bob & Buck were taking the Distemper.  I told him to go ask Mr. Hoke to come & see them.  Mr. Hoke came & said they had not the Distemper, that they were injured by James riding them so hard to water, their filling their stomachs with water, & then being rode hard back again, that if that was continued, you would never have horses, or they would be of no account if you had, that he had often spoken [page torn] about [page torn] he said also their food was too dry, that their fodder must be [page torn] in salt & water, & they would then improve.  Today Buck who was the least sick seems quite well, & Bob is better, & will soon I suppose [be] watered & fed properly [&] be quite well.  I suppose when James kills a pr pf horses for you, you will think it time to part with him.  Mr. Westfield, Mr. Cauble, & I expect many others have spoken to him about his manner of riding.  If you cannot make him obey you, it is high time to sell him.  The other evening, a horse galloped by so fast I thought & Will too that it was running away.  I looked & it was James on Skylark.  You need not be uneasy about them now, for this warning for the present at least, will make him more careful.

	Troubles I expect to have as long as the Goddess of Wisdom presides over my kitchen.  For several days she was sick, so I have not been troubled as much as usual.  This morning however she did something to provoke me, so when she came in to take out dinner, I told her not to do so again, & told her I hoped she would do better, that if she did not behave differently from what she had done, we would not keep her.  Instead of saying, she would try & do better, she said she had done nothing wrong, {&] if I was not pleased with her, she would rather be sold, [&] if I would only let her have her two children, that she had never been so unhappy as since she had been in this yard, that she had scars on her now, given her by you &c. &c.  The other morning Charlotte was walking round the garden, & would stop & pull something.  I sent Edward to bring her out.  I was in the piazza , & Minerva came to the kitchen door, & before me called to Edward to leave Charlotte alone, that she had feet of her own to walk out of the garden with.  I do not tell you these things to worry you, for I have not been worried.  I am contented, as you say you will part with her, & get another if she does not do better.  I am going to try & get along as easy as possible, & not worry myself & scold the servants as little as possible.  Still I do not think everything should be put up with.  Margaret the other day observed the behaviour of some of them & said to me, if you let your servants go on so, they will soon walk over you.  I did not mean to say so much about them.  I went to church twice today.  The children & myself are well.  Ann says if Lemons are not dear, she would like you to bring her a few.  No letters came for you tonight.  If money is scarce bring only a trifling present for Will.  I am glad you bought perfumery.  Write me as often as you can.  I will write every other mail, if am not busy.  It is now past 9.  The children are asleep.  Mamma�s horse is dreadfully hurt, the hip either out of place, or fractured, can hardly walk.  Bob I think will soon be well.  Goodnight, E.F.P.

I received a letter from Pamela last Mail, do not think I am worried about servants & hope Minerva will do better.  I am worried about War.
