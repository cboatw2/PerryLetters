Letter 56

Thursday night, 11 December 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have taken up my pen to write you my last letter.  I will hear twice more from you, & then I hope to see you, as the Legislature adjourns Monday.  I received a letter from you last night, just before I went to Miss McBee�s party.  Everybody who spoke to me, asked if I had heard from you lately.  I told them I had just heard, & then informed them of the news.  Dr. Crook said I was the only one you let hear from you, for you had not written to him or anyone else, & that Mr. Wells was complaining of you.  How my dear husband have you been so neglectful.  I believe I told you before you went to write to persons, particularly when so interesting a subject as the Rail road, they wished to be informed on, for all the gentlemen last night seemed to take a deep interest in the Rail Road.  I you had written long letters for the Mountaineer, there would have been some excuse for your not writing to others, but you have not done that.  You have not informed the people of all that was going on, for I have never known you to write such short & inferior letters as you have this time.  It is well you took my advice, & have written a longer one for tomorrows paper, & now take my advice again, & as soon as you have read this letter, sit down & employ yourself Sunday night, & as much of Monday as you can spare, in writing another long letter for the Mountaineer.  Try & make up by the two last letters, for the inferiority of the two first.  Tell all that has been done in the Legislature that you think the people would like to know.  I am sure you can find enough to write about.  I bet you Mr. Henry has.  I have been extremely mortified on this subject.  You generally have written such good letters, so now take my advice, & write one more good letter, but do not say anything in favor of Mr. Hoar.  The Miss Harrisons were here this afternoon.  They said from what Mr. Reinhardt said, they did not think much Rail Road stock would be taken in Charleston, on account of some of the Greenville members not have taken an active part in it, that Mr. Walker & Mrs. Duncan had not, that they heard Mr. Duncan was afraid of his popularity.  I now think Mr. Duncan one of the meanest men I know of.  What a pity he ever quitted the shades of private life, where his meanness he might have concealed.  He is on a footing with my next door neighbor.  If he only knew it he has injured himself more by refusing to sign Mr. Wells petition than he has gained.  Mr. McBee says he will never vote for him again, & I expect many others will not.  Dr. Crook spoke of him last night; said he told you he knew he would not sign it.  I am so sorry you have not written letters to Dr. Crook & others as I told you.  I wish I were near you constantly to give you advice.  You would do much better.  You need me, instead of being like Mr. Duncan, politic.  You are the most impolitic person I ever knew.  Do in future do better.  The Governor has really taken long to consider Mr. Wells case.  Of course he cannot refuse pardoning him.  You must bring the pardon home with you.  Ask him for it.  You said in your letter last night, you wish you could return with Mr. Earle, in time to be at my party.  I am doubly pleased at having put it off.  I do not think Mr. Earle has returned.  I have not heard from him or my bundle, which if he had come, I think he would have sent.  I am sorry for his disappointment.  Everybody is astonished, that a man so well off as Mr. Maxwell should have run.  Mrs. Thompson says she is glad Mr. [Louis Trezevant] Wigfall is not elected, because he had no business to live so extravagantly.  I expect she is not glad on that account, but because he killed Mr. [Thomas]  Bird.  I enjoyed my self very much at the party.  It was one of the pleasantest I have been at.  In the first place I was dressed very nicely, which made me feel comfortable.  I had on a beautiful silk which I told you I had sent to town for, also a beautiful sash, which Susan had sent to town for.  It was not becoming to her, & as it was to me, I took it from her.  It was the admiration of the room.  It is such an uncommon looking one, that it strikes attention.  When I first went in, I sat by Mrs. Pearson.  She is a great flatterer.  She told me if you were to hear the compliments that were constantly paid me, you would be very jealous.  She told Susan last summer, that I was the belle of Greenville.  Certainly I am the most unconscious belle.  I am the belle at any rate of the only one I care to be, my husband.  You will be astonished at the nice party I am going to give.  When it was first proposed, Mamma was to pay the expenses, & that will consist  in the purchase of Butter & Eggs, which I have paid for, & paying the servants who assist.  Almost everything I have in the house, the expenses we now incur will not be much.  20 or 30 dollars at least will cover them.  Willie wishes to add a postscript.  He was very much pleased with his letter.  We are all well, & I will be delighted to see you.  Do not forget the snuffers for the candle sticks, the presents for Susan & Ann.  I would like you to bring me one dozen Lemons to make Lemonade for my party.  It is so much better than Lemon Syrup, which I would have to buy.  I am obliged to you for the fruit you have sent me.  Pinckney McBee, Butler & Harriet did not arrive in time for the party, & I do not know whether they have yet.  Mr. Luther is very much provoked at Pinckneys not having come.  Pinckney thought they would have waited for him,  but as the preparations were made they did not.  I got a long letter from Pamela last night.  She does not invite me to see her.  Says she hopes I will go when she is better.  I expect she is in reality too sick for company.  She says children & talking disturb her.  I have no pencil to write Willies letter for him, so will write for him what he tells me.  E.F.P.  Dear Papa, you must be sure to bring the knife.  What sort of handle has the knife got?  Is it green? or what colour?  I went to the party last night.  Tell Mr. Summer to write to me.  I cant read writing, but Mama can read it to me.  I hope I can soon read writing.  I long to see you.  I want to go to Columbia next time.  Good bye Papa.  Your affectionate son.  I had so little ink, I had to put water in it, so I can hardly write Willie with it.  This is my excuse for so shabby a letter.
