Letter 235

Friday morning, 24 December [1852]
Greenville

Dear Anna

	I have just written to your cousin Eliza & will now write to you.  I expected you home this morning.  I heard Mr. Elford would be here.  Last night I heard a Stage as I thought stop at the gate.  The driver called out very loud, & then blew his horn.  I thought you had come, & woke your Papa & he woke Charlotte.  By that time the horn sounded at a distance, & I discovered it was the Augusta Stage that had passed.  This morning Mr. Hoke told your Papa, Mr. & Mrs. Elford had arrived at 6 oclock.  Little Mary Elford died only a short time before.  She was at Mr. Perry Duncans.  Mr. Duncan sent in a servant to prepare Mr. & Mrs. Elford for the sad event.  The servant passed them on the road, but they were afraid to inquire of him about the child, so rode on, & knew not whether the child was alive or not until they got to Mr. Duncan�s & found it dead.  It was something like Scarlet fever, for yesterday an irruption broke out.  Fanny Hoke has also been sick in the same way, but is getting better.  How many little children have died lately in Greenville.  It must be a warning to those who are left.  Mrs. Harvey has moved into the County.  Her two oldest children will stay in the village & go to school.  Susan Hoke I see very often.  She sends her love.  She says she wrote to Augustus to go & see you, but as you have not mentioned his visit, I suppose he has not been.

	I am sorry Mr. Elford was hurried home so much sooner than he expected, & that you did not come back with him.  Do inquire of Mary C�ton & anyone else from Greenville who may be in town of some opportunity, & let you know that you may return.  If you hear of none, in a little more than a week your Papa will go down for you.  He would set off at once, if it were not for some business that detains him at home.  I proposed that Willie should immediately go down for you, but your Papa said somebody would have to go to take care of Willie.  The  children are very much disappointed at not having their Christmas presents.  I have nothing to give them.  They will have to hang their Stockings after you come back.  I am sorry you are not here.  I put off making the Hogs feet into Jelly until you returned but now it is so warm I can wait no longer & am making the Jelly today.  I am sorry also you have been obliged to stay so much longer than we intended you should, & as your aunts house will soon be full, I feel uneasy at your putting her to inconvenience.  You must write to me every day until you return.  Do not forget the Candy & Cocoa nut cake for the children.  I am getting nothing of the kind for their Christmas here.  I have sent Eliza 20 dollars, & I have troubled her so much in shopping for me that except a�for Fanny, & something for a S� or Cloak for her, & a pair of Gaiter boots for me, & a Prayer book for yourself, there is nothing more I wish at this time.  You know we pay our bills.  We have to contract during the year, at the Blacksmiths, Sadlers. Doctors &c, buy meat Corn &c, so I am more straightened than at any other time, or I would send for a great many things I need, & I have also a large bill to pay Aunt Mary McCall 21 dollars for the Cloak, which is almost white, & I never expect to wear, but I know she did the best for me, as she thought, & therefore I do not wish to hurt her feelings, & she has been kind to you, but it would have been better not to have got me my cloak.  The bonnet is too fashionable for Greenville, but I cannot dispose of it, so wear it.  If I had known there was so much difficulty in getting work done I would not have written to you to get a dress.  I am sorry I troubled your cousin so about work.

	Your friends have been kind to you, & I am sure you will never forget it.

	I hope to see you soon, & to hear from you every day.  Frank says bring him some crackers, & Willie & himself a knife.  In haste.  Your affectionate mother

	Mr. Hopkins & his family have just passed on their way to Florida.  Fanny is regretting she did not see them, & says she wishes Rosa had staid.  I think Fanny is almost crying.  She is now saying, �I want Anna.  I wish Anna would come.�

	The Silver Comb I want for Annie like yours.

Anna Perry
[Charleston]
