Letter 85

Monday afternoon, 22 November 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I wrote you a letter which I suppose your received last night, on your arrival in Columbia.  I received yours written at Newberry, last evening.  Willie answered it for me, & put his letter in the Post Office on his way to school today.  It is his first letter so you must be pleased with it, & answer it & praise it.  He was not satisfied with it himself, wished to write it over again, but I told him it would do very well.  I wish you had carried him with you.  Excursions from home always do him good, & associating with grown persons.  He always appears well, having no excuse to quarrel, or be irritated as he is with children.  You can carry him with you next Spring, when you go to Columbia.  Though Willie has written, I cannot resist writing, to express some of the thoughts  that are passing through my brain now that I have been to Columbia, I can imagine your situation there, much better than I did formerly.  I know where your chamber is, & where your seat in the Senate is.  I used to imagine the Senate Chamber, at the other end of the State House.  I am sorry indeed the Convention acted with so little harmony.  If I may express my humble opinion I would say, that the only plan now to be adopted is, that each District should build the road for itself.  Newberry must build the Road from Columbia to Newberry C.H.  Then Laurens must continue it & build from Newberry to Laurens C.H. & Greenville must go on & build it from Laurens to Greenville.  In the same way Abbeville & Anderson will have to do, for no people will build a road for others, that is not to benefit them.  Selfishness is too deeply planted in�nature for that.  I hope Anderson does not feel to you, as Laurens you say does to Mr. Orr.  It was unfortunate the interest of the two places should clash together & that you should be situated as to have to offend one or the other.  I hope that your good judgement carried you skilfully through & that in the end it may be all the better for you, & that you have gained & not injured yourself with either party.  I have perfect confidence in you, though I often venture to suggest, some new ideas to you.  Your honor, prudence, & good judgement, I believe equal to anyone.  Now for a little advice, if you would obtain a Seat on the Bench easily, you hear so from our friends, you must by no means decline it, it being in my opinion a situation preferable to any other, combining both profit & honour, with permanency, but I rather think the office will be sought so earnestly  by so many, that your claims would have to be pressed to be successful.  A Judge you are cut out for, your good judgement, would make you an invaluable one, but in my opinion there is no responsible situation you are not fitted for, even the Presidential Chair.  I am glad Mr. Choice & yourself are friendly, an honorable enemy, could easily be changed into a friend.  I was uneasy about you, when I heard of his accident.  Mrs. Thurston I believe was hurt also.  Mrs. Butler told me she jumped out, & knocked out some of her Teeth.  Mrs. Butler stopped at the gate Saturday.  Miss Rogers says she will stay with me, so I expect her at any time.  No one can supply your place to me, therefore when you are away, I prefer no one staying with me, I am not lonely, but I miss you.  But if Miss Rogers comes, I will try & make her pass her time pleasantly.  Jim has carried me to ride twice since you left, one afternoon & one morning.  All the rest of the time, he has been digging Potatoes for Mr. Hoke.  He will finish I hope today.  He says Mr. Hoke has about 100 bushels of Potatoes.  Mr. Hoke Saturday sent me a peice of Pork & a peice of Beef.  Saturday & Sunday were so cold.  If such weather had continued, hogs would have been killed, but the weather today has moderated.  It is cloudy & drizzly, so unfavorable.  Mary & Delia have not washed as usual.  I went to see Mrs. Harrison one evening.  I think she seems more comfortable in her present home than in her old one.  I have received pleasant letters from Aunt Harriett & Mrs. Dubose.  Uncle Edward & his daughter has not yet arrived.  Mrs. Alston Hayne Aunt Harriett says has sent some of her Bridal Cake to us. Sarah Cunningham, Pamela�s cousin is engaged to Mr. Daniel of Georgia.  I suppose she saw him last summer.  You know she went to Clarksville.  Have you heard anything of Pamela?  I am surprised she has not answered my letter.  I directed it to Hamburgh to the care of Mr. Yancey.  Ask him if she received it.  Willie wrote you the compliment Genl Whitner paid your speech.  Mrs. Dubose says Mrs. Gordon & Mrs. B� who have children named after you & to whom I sent a frock & book were delighted with the presents, particularly as coming from me.  Your brother Fosters children thanked me for what I sent them.  Her brother Mr. Lee had been elected Magistrate, but the friends of his opponent, are going to try to present a petition to the legislature about it.  The children are well.  I went to see Mamma yesterday morning after church.  The 3 oldest children dined with her.  I returned to my sweet little Fanny, who is as good as ever.  The cold days I could not keep her warm, so wrapped her up in a�blanket.  Mary Long is said to be engaged to Tom Crayton & to be married next month.  One of the Miss Bollins is to be married Thursday night, & the other the Thursday after.  Mrs. Town[e]s I believe is well.  Mrs. Roberts & Mrs. Burn came to see me Saturday.  As I have written twice already, I do not think I will write by the next mail, but will wait to hear from you.  I dare say the opponents of the R[ail] Road would constantly have said, the road would stop at Newberry, that the money would all be used to bring it as far as that & no further, so perhaps it is as well the company should be dissolved & each District made to build it for herself.  Newberry must commence, & the other Districts follow.  Each one now will be obliged to build for itself, & Abbeville & Anderson do the same.  Adieu my dear husband.  Tell Edward I am glad to hear he is behaving well.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.
