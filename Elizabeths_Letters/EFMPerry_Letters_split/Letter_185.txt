My dear husband

		Anna wrote to you yesterday.  I was very busy making up the little room carpet, & I am happy to say, little Carpets are made, & put down, & the two rooms look very neat, but I am afraid, before you see them, the dirty feet of so many servants & children will have ruined them.  The old Carpet is put down in my room, & I have moved the set of Drawers & Basin stand from the large room into ours, & the Curtains, for we are entitled to the best in the house, you especially, who works hard & makes all the money, so I thought I would have a very nice room ready for you on your return, & I assure you it looks so nice & comfortable, you will be very much pleased with it, & the carpet makes it so much warmer.

		I was disappointed again last night in not hearing from you.  I hope you were busy, or the Postmaster as usual careless.  Mr. Elford did not hear either.  I thought you were to write to the Patriot every Mail.  You ought to write longer letters for the paper, & I am disappointed at their being so short.  Perhaps you have not had much to write about yet.

		I hope you interceded for Mrs. Hughes, after all the trouble she has taken to go so far.  She deserves to succeed in getting her son pardoned, so for her sake at least I hope the Governor will show mercy to him, & hope he will be merciful to all for whom you carried petitions.

		I am glad Mr. Isaac Hayne & yourself have met & spoken; nothing more is necessary.  He & his sisters are very disagreeable, I think, & though Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor lived with us, & we were brought up in intimacy, I now regard them as Strangers.  They seem cold hearted & selfish.  I am glad your cold is better.  You must give yourself no uneasiness about us.  I write to you daily, in order to make you easy & satisfied.  I wish you to enjoy yourself & attend to your duties as a Legislator & Patriot.  I will attend to home & everything is going on well.

		Mr. Elford paid me a visit this morning.  He goes Monday morning in the Stage.  I will write by him.  He says Mr. Duncan & yourself are going to Charleston with him.  You must do as you please, but I think you had better go some other time, & not leave your Legislative duties now.  It will be an unnecessary expense, & when you go, there are many things I wish you to purchase which I cannot tell you now.  You had better go down in February during the Races.  You will then have been at home & wish for a change again.

		Aunt Mary McCall has sent 2 yds of Carpeting less than the room needs.  Mr. Elford looked at the Carpet & says he will buy it for me.  I will get him to buy a Straw carri[a]ge & chair for Hext, which I am very anxious for, & wrote to Aunt Mary to inquire the price., but I will get Mr. Elford who is so good a judge & has offered to buy anything.  To buy them for him the carri[a]ge will be 3 or 4 dollars, the chair 1 or 2.  I mention it to you, so that if Mr. Elford tells you, you need not be surprised.  I suppose you will have no objection to his getting them.  Hext needs both careri[a]ge & chair now.  Lindy hardly ever has time to hold him, & it is so much better for him to be drawn about, than held by � & Charlotte.

		You would stay so short a time in Charleston now only a day or two, that I think it is not worth the expense going down.  Some other time you can stay longer, & carry Willie & Frank with you.  If you were to stay any time now, you would be neglecting your duties.  Mr. Elford says someone asked him if you did not feel more at home in Columbia this winter than the last, & he said yes & that next winter you would still be more at home for the Legislature would be a new one, scarce one of the Members in it, that is now he says the Secessionists in their hearts thank you for getting them out of the scrape.  I think the Cooperationists are a cowardly set.  They have not the boldness to come out as Union men.  They cannot bear what you did.  I am sure you deserve to be rewarded., but not being ambitious. I am afraid you never will be.  You ought to try to advance yourself for the sake of your children.

		Young Powell brought Col. Picket�s history of Alabama, that he gave Uncle Arthur for Mamma, & Uncle Arthur gave Aunt Eliza to send, & a bundle of Shoes, Susan sent for, & a little worsted bonnet apeice for Hext & Susan.  I wrote to Aunt Martha to buy Hext one. & she sent it as a present, but it is not pretty, & does not fit him, is too small.

		I have been interrupted so that the dinner hour has arrived, & dinner is coming in, so I must soon close.

		I sat with Anna while she practiced today, the first time for a month or more.  I am too busy to go out.  

		I bought Reuben a pr of shoes yesterday.  He asked for them.  Mary & himself are quite well now, & Elisa as well as she ever is.

		The children are behaving pretty well.  Willie drove to the Farm today & Reuben brought home  a load of wood.  Willies cold is well; so is Franks.  We are all pretty well & hope you are too.  Yours as Ever, E.F.P.
