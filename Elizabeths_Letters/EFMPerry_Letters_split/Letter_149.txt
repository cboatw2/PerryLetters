Letter 149

Monday afternoon.  I will not conclude my journal.  Anna came home early this moprning, said Mr. Bradshaw had dismissed the School, that he cried, & the scholars cried. That he is to go away next week.  Mr. Erwin is to live where Mrs. S�don did.  Old Mrs. McBee has bought the house from Mr. Waddil.  If there are not prettier ladies in Columbia, than Miss Pickens & Miss Thompson, the attention of the members will not often be diverted from the members of the house.  If you get the birds, you must have the cage fastened on top of your trunk behind the Buggy, & if you get me a bonnet, you must have it put in a small box, & fastened alongside of the Cage on the trunk.  It is giving so little for the Shawl & its being so pretty has made me think of the bonnet, & I really need one.  Ann says you must get her the box in the shape of the Apple so do not forget it.  I wish you could get her some birds, but of course you have not the money.  You must buy Vardry a little present.  Willie is well supplied with books.  You ought to borrow from the Bookseller for him.  The weather continues gloomy.  Reuben is cleaning the Carri[a]ge today.  Eliza has gone to Mamma�s to work.  There is no news to tell.  I wish you to write Mr. � so the people may hear of your deeds, otherwise they will hear nothing of you, for I expect Col. Town[e]s does not mention you but enclose the letters to me.  I suppose your being�prevented your writing & you must write or not as you wish.  If you have money enough bring Ann some birds, & some gentleman coming up can bring them for you, but only [if] you have more than the 40 dollars you mentioned.  I am sure you will not be able to.  You must be tired of this letter.  You must send it attentively�&�all I say.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

If you are made President you can afterwards practice Law in Charleston.  If you are not you must be Gov.
I hope you will be appointed a Delegate to Nashville.  It will be a pleasant experience.  You must get yourself appointed.  If you are elected President of the Bank I will like it, or Gov.
