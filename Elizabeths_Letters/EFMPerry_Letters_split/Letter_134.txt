Letter 134

Monday morning

My dear husband

		I must write to you, so that if you remain in Columbia until Wednesday you may hear from me.  I have been very punctual in writing.  There is a great pleasure in feeling confident, when the Mail arrives, that it will bring a letter.  I judge of you by myself & know that you would rather hear, even if you receive a scold.  I indeed ought to scold you now.  The Crockery & waiters we needed.  Though Columbia being so dear & inconvenient  to get things up from there & also so expensive, I would have preferred getting those things in Charleston.  However we needed them so I wont scold about that.  But the Toys were perfectly useless, a few would have answered.  You put too much money in them.  A little more, would have bought me a Musical Box, which I have so long wished, so now to make friends, you must give me 20 dollars, on your return & I will send it to town & buy a box with most beautiful tunes, which I will listen to all day while at my work.  You have no air for music, cannot realize my fondness for it.  One thing you must do, you must tell the children, I am to choose, what I wish first.  If not, anything you say is theirs, & I wish they will not give up, for already they are quarreling about it.  I wish one of the knives, I have long wished a knife, so tell them as soon as you arrive, that I am to distribute.  I will take what I wish, & then give to�what suits them best.  You know if you had plenty of money I would not [obje]ct to your buying whatever you fancied, but we need too many [necess]aries, to indulge our fancy.  We will have to get a carpet for the Dining [roo]m, our present one is in rags.  The 30 dollars the Legislature gives you [page torn] Couch, except to put up separately in a paper, & give to me on your �turn, to send to town to buy one.  Mrs. Coleman has one [page torn] Room, which I think beautiful.  It is black & red. Does not show dirt, &�[page torn] the Dining roomas we sit in that room in Winter.  She bought it in Charleston at Lambert & Brothers, & gave only 80 cts a yard  for it.  Our room requires 37 yds so the carpet with the Binding would come to just 30 dollars, & we ought to get a Rug to suit, but we could do without the Rug.  If you could get such a Carpet in Columbia, at that price, I would like you to get it, but I do not believe you could get one there so reasonable.  It was a strong carpet, not Venetian, Ingrain I expect.  Carpets are not very reasonable.  Red & Black, or Red & Green are the colours I like.  They are dark & yet bright.  You might inquire the prices of Carpets [page torn] but if you find them like the Buggy�s dear, [do] not get any. 80 cts [page torn] Mrs. Coleman gave for hers.  The waiters that you have bought, must be�I described to you, that she had.  Sometime I would like to give out, that [page torn] are going away, have an auction, sell our furniture high, then change our minds, &�, & buy new.  What do you think of my having made a contract with Mr. Rosemond to put a room in the piazza, for 23 dollars, he furnishing the Lumber.  This is most reasonable, as you may know, from Mr. Croft�s employing him, to build Mrs. Pearsons house.  He will commence the room immediately as you return, unless you prefer instead of the room in the Piazza, an addition put at each side of the house, two rooms on each side.  Four rooms altogether with a little passage like Mr. Poinsetts, & doors to each room, 2 windows to each &c.  He has given me a bill.  He can do it, furnishing the Lumber for 325 dollars.  This is reasonable, & if you would not approve that, one room on each side, would be about half, but if you do not wish this, he will immediately put the room in the Piazza & this Winter we will occupy it.  The other he does not know if [page torn] can do until he has finished Mr. Crofts house.  I told him we had [page torn] boy who during the time we would hire to him, so that Jims [page torn] [w[ill be deducted from what we pay him.  He says for good [page torn] from 18 to 26 dollars a month, that he could not tell how much he would pay for Jim, until he tried him, but at any rate would pay from 12 dollars upward.  Now do you not think I am a manager.  Mr. Beattie yesterday sent me a paper, saying that he had purchased Reuben, & on your return would let you have the choice of purchasing him, on the same terms he had done, provided you purchased him in a month, from that date.  So do you not think  I did well there too.  Mr. Lester paid me a visit today, says he saw you in Columbia, looking as well as he ever saw you.  I received a letter last night from Aunt Harriet McCall.  She says she heard gentlemen regretting you were not in the Legislature.  You know Mrs. Faber has married a third time.  Aunt Harriet says she has married a young man 27 her sons Tutor, that it seemed strange that she could not support her Widow�.  Tom Roper who a little more than a year ago, you saw, has since lost his Wife & Married again, so Matrimony is complimented.  Neither of them had the excuse of a gentleman I read of in the papers, who lost his Wife, was sorry for his little daughter, so married again to give her another Mother.  I hope my husband will never have such sorrow for his children.  Mr. Hooker was here this morning.  He says he heard Mr. Curtis last night at the mansion house, expressing his astonishment at your defeat, & saying how much interest Spartanburgh felt in it.  All these compliments only provoke me the more, to think the Congressional District you live in, & one you asked the favor of, was the only one, that would have refused it.  From any other part of the State, you would have been elected.  You must try your chance again, or I will never be satisfied.  Play your cards better the next time.  Mrs. Theodore Thompson told me Col. Orr was taken up & brought away from a Corn Shucking, dead drunk, that she said at the time, you were not above Shucking Corn, but you were above degrading yourself in that way, that her brother was anxious you should be elected.  You had always been a friend of their family.  She & Mr. Thompson are going to Union to live on a plantation she owns.  She says there Mr. Thompson will have employment [page torn] of the �pation, & said when she saw the page torn] were moral, faithful to their Wives, acted in every respect as they ought, she felt ready to fall down & worship them, & that you were one.  I told her yes you were an exception.  Genl Thompson made quite a mistake in sending Willie a female Dog.  Both are females.  Do tell him of [word obscured] Franks has grown finely, & is the prettiest Dog I ever saw.  Lindy washed it, & it looks white as Snow.  Willie�s has been sick, & at one time [page torn] thought would have died, but it is getting better.  It has not grown like the other.  It has mortified Willie very much.  He has the feeling of a parent to it.  He cannot bear to hear comparisons made between the dogs.  Anna stepped on his this morning & lamed it.  He is afraid it will never get over it.  He does without Milk to give it to his Dog.  I have paid all my visits but one to Mrs. Loveland.  Jim has commenced ploughing the garden.  Charles stays entirely at the farm.  I have had the whole front lot raked & swept, & cut down three old Peach trees.  I am more ready for the house to be painted.  Delia is sick, is in her room.  She is almost entirely useless, & perhaps will not live long.  [word obscured] will be a great loss .  After this spell, I will let her do no [word obscured] work, only mind Fanny.  The least hard work, makes her worse.  Dr. Earle has been over to see her & sent medicine & direction.  The Convention of the Baptists is going on.  I have been too busy [to] go the church to hear the Ministers.  There is no news to write about.  The children long to see their presents, & I long to see you.  Buy me the �Carolina Receipt book�, if you have the funds.  Do not make a mistake.  It is by Miss Rutledge, & buy me �to the married & those contemplating Marriage�.  Each of these books is 1 dollar, & buy me some Cork Soles.  They keep the feet warm.  I have [word obscured] a long letter to Aunt Anna Turnbull, & am going to write to [word obscured] Cunningham.  I am glad Eloisa Martin has sent a bundle.  Give my love to her, & inquire particularly how Sarah Taylor is.  I expect Miss Calhoun would like to marry Col. Manning.  Mr. Calhoun has treated you badly.  He blasted your hopes this last summer, but I hope, you will yet triumph over him.  I woke the servants this morning at 4, & was done myself a little after 6. [page torn] I woke them it was so early.  It was moonlight.  I took [page torn] now.  Ever Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Mr. Lester says Genl Thompson is not your friend & never has been.  He has always considered you a rival & has been the means of injuring your prospects greatly that Mr. Kilgore has no opinion of him.
