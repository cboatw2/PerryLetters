Letter 144

Monday afternoon. 3 December [1849]
Greenville

Dear Willie

	I wrote to Papa last night, & have sent the letter to the Post office, along with the one Dr. Irvine ought to have carried & also one Anna wrote yesterday.  As so many letters were going by this Mail, I thought I would write to you by the next, but today I find I have so much to say, I feel I must write.  I am so much alone, I get thinking, & having no one to express my thoughts to. I am obliged to write.  I was very glad to receive your letter.  You must write often & tell me everything you see & what persons you see, & how you enjoy yourself.  I think you must be passing your time quite pleasantly.  You have set the fashion for little boys going with their Fathers to Columbia.  It will be followed.  Ann� says Mr. Jones perhaps will take his son & Col. Town[e]s Alex the next time.  I would not send a son younger than you are.  You are just old enough to take care of yourself, & notice things & improve from associating with gentlemen.  I am glad you have new clothes.  I have always preferred a round Jacket to a Frock coat.  I have never seen you in a Coat, so cannot imagine how you look.  You must be a good boy.  Papa has done so much for you to make you happy.  Anna says she wishes to read your books.  Papa must not  bring many presents to the Children, for he will need all his money to pay your board, & to give you to spend in other ways.  12 numbers of the Lady�s book for 1849 have come.  Mr. Godey wrote word those were all he had, that he would get two bound volumes of the years previous at a high price 5 dollars a peice, & if Papa wanted them, he would have to send 5 dollars more.  Frank & Anna carried their dinner today.  It is so wet, so I have only Fanny at home.  Frank dreams of you every night; says he dreamt last night you had grown so big.  I expect he saw you in your new suit.  Have you new pantaloons & waistcoat? as well as Coat.  I hope you read in your little Testament every day, & say your prayers, & that you clean your teeth. & have your face & hands washed very nicely.  I am glad you behave like a little man.  Today I suppose you are at the College Commencement.  When you are graduating, I will go to Columbia to hear you speak.  Perhaps Papa will carry Frank next Spring.  I sent word to Poinsett Wells that you had bought him a knife.  I send in this letter a 2 dollar bill, which Papa must keep, & out of it pay 1 dollar or 1.25 for my shoes.  I send it because as Papa has not much money I would rather pay for the Shoes out of what he left me.  Mr. Leary I believe  gives holiday next week.  I am so sorry Mr. Stuart is not coming.  I am certain Dr. Simons having set up an opposition school is the cause of his resigning.  Mr. Arthur has moved back to the Parsonage.  I have no news to tell you.  Grandma says she can never love any grandchild as well as you, for she helped to take care of you, when you were a baby.  I wish you would pay a visit to Charleston.  You would stay with Aunt Eliza, but I expect Papa would hardly have the money now to let you go.  You have travelled a good deal for a little fellow like you.  Fanny talks often of Billy, & thought your letter was written to her.  She has put it away in a corner, & will not let me have it.  Your affectionate Mama, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	You will think I am in a writing humour, but really having no one to talk to, it is a relief to write, having written so much by this Mail.  Unless I have any particular thing to relate, I may not write by the next Mail.  I sent your letter this morning to Mr. Wells.  If you continue to write, be careful in all you say, & not get into any trouble, & write good letters.  I am quite worried about the Bank question.  You say it is such an important question.  I hope you understand it well & are on the right side.  I am staggered when I hear of Col. Irby, Mr. Henry, & so many intelligent upcountry gentlemen going for it, & am surprised that 3 members from Greenville should.  I had thought the very name of B� was odious to the Upper Country, but it seems so many of them are in favour of it, as in the Lower.  So examine the subject & be sure you are right.  You cannot think how sorry I am at Mr. Stuarts resignation, & am particularly provoked  with Dr. Simons, who I feel certain is the cause, & to think such an Organist we have lost.  I wish you would write to him & tell him his Wifes health would improve in Greenville.  I am very sorry you did not carry my pencil case down, & exchange it instead of yours.  I suppose you could have exchanged it on the same terms, & yours was a superior English one, which I would like to have had.  You blame others for fickleness, & liking to change, but you are very fond of changing all you have yourself.  Some of the servants say, they hear Mr. & Mrs. Sam Earle are here.  I do not know but as tomorrow is the Sale, suppose he at least is.  Mr. Moore was here, not his Wife, the lady with him was Miss Thurston.

	Send your letters to me to read, if you write any to Mr. Wells, I have not looked at the last Mountaineer yet.  I would rather read your letters in manuscript.  They give me more pleasure there.    The B� Office Reports, & a book on Mexico & California with a map.  I have written Willie about the Lady�s books.  There are two or three pretty pictures in each number.  The rest are woodcuts.  I believe I have said all I had to say.  I only feel�that the majority of the people are for the Bank, & I am sorry if you are on the unpopular side, & as Mr. Elmore thinks it is so important that you should go for the Bank so�to us, you ought to examine the subject well.  I do not mean to interfere.  I only tell  my thoughts.  You must speak well & distinguish yourself as you have hitherto done.  I wish I could be seated in the Gallery by Willie listening to you.  Before next winter we will perhaps get a new carri[a]ge, & I can go down for part of the Session, & hear you, if you are still in the Legislature, but I believe it is so cold now, I will prefer going in the Spring, if ever I do go.  I will go to see you inaugurated.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Col. Ware is so politic.  What makes him go for the bank.  He keeps very quiet.  He does not distinguish himself, but he gets along easily with all parties, & so finds no difficulty in being elected.  If nothing better offers, in two years, you must have your place back again, that he now has.
