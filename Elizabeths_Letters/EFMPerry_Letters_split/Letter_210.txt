Letter 210

My dear husband

	I take up my pen to write to you, with very little to write about.  We are all well.  Nothing more from the Post office this morning for you, a letter from Aunt Mary McCall to me, & letters from Aunt Eliza & Alston to Mamma is all that came.  Aunt Eliza is expecting Anna down, & says Mr. Taylor & Sarah requested her, to ask you to carry her to stay with them.  If they ask her in Columbia, let her stay with them.  Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Isaac Hayne are to be in Columbia & if they are at Sarahs, Anna will find it pleasant having companions among their children, & less lonely than at the boarding house, where she will be alone, while you are away all day.

	Col. Town[e]s came this morning for your office key.  He has brought it back again.  He says he sets off for Columbia tomorrow with his brother Augustus in a private conveyance, so he will not get as quickly as the Mail, or I would write by him.

	The Spotted Cow has a Calf, a few days old.  Charles says he will let it remain at the Farm until we can use the Milk.  Charles is today hauling wood with Mamma�s horse.  I suppose Reuben will be back tomorrow.  I hope you have arrived safely in Columbia & feel better than when you left.  I am glad you now have fine weather.  Today I hope you are going on safely to the end of your journey.

	Write me how Anna behaves, & if she enjoys herself.  Willie�s school breaks up tomorrow.  I will ride to Mr. McClanahans & pay him as soon as the horses have rested on their return.  

	I have no news to tell you.  Write me everything you know I am interested in all that goes on.  I will have more to write about when I hear from you.    I will then give you advice, which I know you are longing for.

	We are getting on quite well.  I hope Anna & yourself are also.  I write only to keep you from being uneasy, for I have literally nothing to write about.  I hope tomorrow or the next day to hear from you or Anna.  My love to her.  Your affectionate wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	This is a bad day.  It commenced raining all day.  Reuben got home last night about Supper time.  The horses are quite well.  He says you set off before he left & you were quite well.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow morning.  Anna�s first day in Columbia has been a gloomy one.  But I hope she will pass her time pleasantly.  She can commence her quilt if she remains long in Columbia.  I hope she may stay with Sarah Taylor, but she may not like your not carrying her to her house at once, & therefore may not ask her again.  Your first appearance in the Legislature has been in bad weather.  I hope you are comfortably situated at your Hotel & able to get along with convenience though with a broken arm.

	Willie has come from school.  He has now done with Mr. Leary.  He brought his bill 10.25 which I will pay.  Frank is the only one who will be going to school.  Fanny�s breaks up tomorrow.  She staid at home today on account of the rain.  Nothing came from the Post office this morning.  I have no news to tell you.  Mamma & Susan came in yesterday.  They are well.  Reuben is cleaning carriage & harness, Charles shelling corn.  As soon as Reuben returned, Charles accused him of carrying off one night last week a load of Potatoes. But it turned out to be a load of�he was carrying over to Minerva to fix up a Stove in her room.  Mr. Lasly is cutting down the timber at the Farm to build the house.

	I will stop now & write a few lines to Anna.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
