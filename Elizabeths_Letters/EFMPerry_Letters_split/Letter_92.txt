Letter 92

Saturday morning, 5 December 1846
Charleston

My dear husband
 
 	I received your welcome letter containing the 25 dollars.  It was several days since I heard from you, so I was very glad to hear from you again.  I dined yesterday at Aunt Mary�s & spent a very pleasant day.  Aunt Anna & herself gave each of the children a present, & Aunt Sarah gave Mamma, Susan, Ann & myself a basket apeice. Aunt Brewton has also made us presents, & Mrs. O Driscoll, & Aunt Emily each of the children, & Aunt Sarah has given me a cup, & Aunt Susan Anna a dress.  Aunt Mary wishes to keep Mary all winter, & Aunt S� wishes her also.  It would be a great advantage for her to be with her Aunts, who would take so much pain with her & if she were willing I would leave her, but she says she will not stay.  My friends have all been very kind to me, & I have passed my time even more pleasantly than I expected.  I would like to stay here part of next week so will not be in Columbia to attend Commencement, the Inauguration of the Governor &c.  I will leave here some day next week, perhaps not until Saturday, then I will stay in Columbia Sunday & Monday, & leave for Greenville Tuesday.  I will reach there the 16th of December, & about that time I suppose the legislature will adjourn, & you will soon follow me.  You need not be uneasy about the children on the Rail Road.  It will be so cold, that the doors & windows will all be shut.  I do not care to go under the protection of anyone, for gentlemen always find it troublesome attending to ladies, unless they are particularly interested in them.  Arthur Hayne goes up tomorrow.  He attends Commencement day, taking his Degree of Master of Arts.  Col. Isaac Hayne does not know when he will go, his wife is sick,  Alston Hayne has gone to the West, to attend to some property his father owned there.  The fire bell is now ringing., & the Planters Hotel, corner of Church & Queen st is on fire.  Today I am to pay visit with Aunt Anna.  She has been very kind to us; indeed all of our friends have been, & Charleston has appeared even better than I expected.  It is pleasant to be among so many relations & friends.  Last night when I returned from Aunt Mary�s, I found the table covered with cards of persons who had been to see me, Miss Rutledge, Mrs. Fraser who is Mrs. Davie�s mother, Mrs. Dubose, Rev. Mr. Trapier, Julia Horry &c.  Anna thinks everybody is her cousin.  I met Mrs. Fraser in the streets yesterday, & after we had parted, Anna said is that a cousin?  I said yes, then I told her I was going to see Mrs. O Driscoll, she said, is she a friend, Aunt, or cousin?  I also met Mrs. Seabrook who staid at the Mansion house with us.  She has just returned from Europe.  She asked me to go & see her.  We have had warm pleasant weather, but today is rather cold.  I received a letter from Susan yesterday.  It was not directed to the care of Wm Ed, so had not been put in his box, & had been about a week in the Post Office.  I sent Delia to the Office, thinking there must have been a mistake, & that there was a letter for me, & she accordingly brought it.  It contained cheerless news.  Mamma was sick in bed with Rheumatism , & not able to put her feet to the ground, her feet & ankles being particularly affected.  Ninny had to lift her in & out of bed.  Mamma is really afflicted more so than any member of her family, & it seems as if her afflictions are to have no end.  Our household Susan said were well.  Mrs. Erwin Jones was really a mischief maker to tell Genl Thompson what Col. Herndon said, & from Genl Thompson�s noticing the remark, it seems as if he felt it, & knew it to be true.  It would have been just as well not to have noticed it.  I do not particularly like either Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Walker or Jane, & if you have no objections, it is not more expensive, I will stay at Clarks.  You know Mrs. Walker I do not fancy at all, & do not care to be with her.  You say nothing in your last letter about Judge.  I hope you have not given up your claims for that office.  If Judge Butler is elected Senator, there will be two vacancies on the bench, & you I should think would [page torn] get one, so I hope if your prospects are the least favorable & I would think they were as good as anyone else�s. you would [word obscured] for it, set about it in good earnest, & ascertain if you cannot be elected, get someone to write a peice in the Carolinian nominating you, & I am sure you would be elected, & how much pleasure it would give me.  My utmost wish for you would be answered, & I would remain perfectly satisfied for the future, so if you think my dear, you could be elected you must be.  I see the Courier every morning, & the Patriot every evening, & see you mentioned very often.  This morning I read an account of your R[ail] Road speech.  I think you are a very important member of the Senate & therefore it is I think you could be elected Judge as soon as anyone.  You might even aspire to be State Senator, but Judge which is an office for life, & with a good Salary, I even prefer.  Unless Judge Butler is well off, I wonder at his caring to leave the bench.  The children are well, & behave better than they. Anna is a particular favorite among her Aunts on the Hayne side.  I think Mamma�s sisters are remarkably fine ladies, & have uncommon manners & characters also.  Indeed her whole connexion on that side is distinguished for worth & excellence in every respect.  My other Aunts are also excellent, but their minds are not as good as the Hayne family, but I love them very much.  Aunt Susan Hayne (Uncle William�s wife[)], says I look exactly as Mamma did at my age.  She & Mamma used to be intimate when young.  Everybody says I look well, & have not altered in the least.  Aunt Mary was saying yesterday you had taken good care of me.  They say I must come down often to see them, but it [is] so expensive I do not expect to come often.  I hear the whole of the inside of the Planters Hotel is burnt.  It is just opposite the Hugonot church.  Tomorrow I go to the Circular church with Aunt Mary & Aunt Anna.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

I am very much obliged to you for the money.  I do not think it will be enough to buy [page torn] clothes, & you do not say whether I shall get them & have the [page torn] sent to you & you send the money when you have it, so I will [page torn] until I hear from you, unless I find the money will buy [page torn].  I wish to get a present...for Susan & Ann Warley &c. & my [page torn] whom I am staying.  You are as kind to me my dear h[usband] [page torn] you are too generous.
