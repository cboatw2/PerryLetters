Letter 92

Monday morning, 13 December 1847
Greenville

My dear husband
		I received a letter from you last night.  Willie was very much disappointed at not receiving one also.  We had calculated that last night was the time for his answer to come.  I hope he will hear the next Mail, as you were too busy to write by the last.  It is a great comfort to hear regularly, & be certain that each Mail will bring a letter.  When you go to Washington, if I do not go with you we will write to each other every day.  I do think it is a price of independence for Mr. Orr to oppose you, & that is one reason, I particularly wish you to beat him.  I am glad that you have favorable accounts from Pickens.  It depends entirely upon yourself, whether you are elected.  I believe if you exert yourself, & do all that ought to be done, you will be elected.  Last week the weather was so bad, Mr. Hooker was not able to do anything to the Fence, until Saturday afternoon, when he put up one panel.  Today he is actually at this moment going on with it.  It is now one week since we killed hogs.  The weather turned warm the very day we killed & has ever since continued warm, that we have sometimes, sat without fire.  The Sausage meat & the Livers have both spoilt, before we used them, & if the weather continues so, much longer, I will be uneasy about the Meat.  After you left, soon, I begged Jim to kill, but he said no, we must wait for Mr. Hoke.  You said he must kill with him, & also wait for the increase of the Moon, & all we have gained by waiting, is warm weather.  The Salt with the Meat I suppose will preserve it.  Mr. Hoke I believe is not uneasy about his, & his is much larger meat than ours.  It is cloudy today, & does not yet look like clearing , but it is not raining.  Willie & Anna have gone to school.  They will holiday next week, for six weeks.  Willie is the only boy of his age, that learns history.  He commenced a letter to you Saturday, but did not have time to finish it.  Anna says I must be sure & tell you how nicely she lays the table & puts on everything.  She then runs upstairs, & turns down the beds, & fills the pitchers.  She will get through her reading book in a day or two.  Frank says he dreamt last night you had come home, & brought him a knife & marbles.  Fanny has had a bad cold, which has prevented her improving as much as she would have done, but she is very sweet & pretty,  She will be delighted with her present, for she loves to hear a noise, & to put things in her mouth.  Yesterday morning I went to church.  Mr. Arthur preached a very good sermon, to a very small congregation.  I am sure if he was heard, he would be liked, better than the other Ministers here but persons do not even give themselves the opportunity of judging what kind of preacher he is.  In the afternoon I carried the children with me to Mamma�s.  They were all there as usual.  Mamma said I must remember her to you.  I told them about what you said about Mr. Choice�s carri[a]ge.  They said they would be very glad to exchange theirs for it, but I am certain Mr. Choice would not change. Mr. Luther McBee & his brothers have gone to N. Carolina to Vardry McBee�s wedding, which takes place Thursday night.  I think the lady�s name is Sumner,  She has no property.  I have hardly seen Mr. Luther to speak to, since the separation first took place.  Susan I am certain has told him, what little I said of him, & which I said, in consequence  of their thinking me lukewarm & partial to him, & they provoked me by telling me he cursed you a whole night & cursed me &c.  If he was  inclined to like us, & our not opposing of the separation, the good opinion was soon removed, by being told, we had originally dispproved of the marriage.  I do not think separation will be tried again.  It is well it has been, for they have now seen the inefficiency of it, which they would never have been satisfied of, if they had not tried.  Mrs. Butler came to see me Friday.  She said it was only the second time she had been in, since you left.  She asked me what you wrote about.  I told her of the Brooch you had bought me.  She said she had seen the kind.  They were very pretty.  Mrs. Lowndes had one, & asked the price.  I told her $1.50.  She said if she had known they were as cheap as that, she would have given you the money to buy Behethland one, so if you think proper, you may buy one for Behethland.  She said Behethland was making me a Chain, of course I will have to make her some return.  So I think you had better buy a Brooch for her.  I did not ask Miss Rodgers to stay with me, it being particularly inconvenient.  After you return, I will ask her perhaps, for a short time.  I have been very busy �king, & the weather has been bad,  Minerva also busy making her clothes.  I have so many more uses for my money than I expected, that I thought I had better send Mrs. D�Oyley a barrel of flour.  Flour is at all times acceptable, for if she has it now, when that gives out, it will save her buying more, so I sent the barrel.  I have $2.12 ? still for her, which I will spend for her, before you come back.   Judge Dunkin is very kind, but not more so than he ought to be.  How much good the rich might do, without even feeling the loss of the money they so spend.  Mr. Hoke has a bad bile or boil on his leg, which confines him to the house.  He cannot walk.  It must be a great trial to a restless, active person like himself, particularly when he must wish to be electioneering, the election being so near at hand.  Mr. Nat Heyward has returned to Charleston & Mr. Beauford Dean has come to take his place.  Beauford is our family name.  I think there must be some connexion between us.  Mr. Hoke has put his house lower down than where it stood before.  I expect he intends to put a store next to McNicols.  The brick foundation is up several feet.  He intends to have a Basement story, with a kitchen & [page torn] room in it. You must be very busy, & ought to be happy to be so useful.  The Telegraph is�sent now.  I suppose they do not send it, because you are in Columbia, so I have not seen the report of your speech.  I dare say Mr. Speers has gone to Columbia to see if he can be appointed the one to digest the Laws.  I saw a bill was introduced relating to that matter, & I thought perhaps Mr. Speers would try to be elected, to do it.  I wonder who will succeed Judge Richardson.  I think you would have stood a good chance, if you had not had other views.  I do not think Mr. Wardlaw ought to be elected.  Two brothers ought not to be so favored, & besides he is not much.  I am surprised Mr. Poinsett was not chosen as Trustee in his place.  I see in the papers the death of Miss Crawford, & of Mrs. Brisbane, Mr. Thomas only remaining sister.  He had but two, the other died a few years ago.  She had I expect 12 children or more, & most of them daughters.  Mr. Gibbs also you saw at Glenn Springs is also dead.  I hope you have received your purse safely.  Wednesday I am going to ask Mr. & Mrs. Arthur to dine with me.  I saw Genl Thompson in the streets yesterday.  I got a message from Mrs. Town[e]s today.  They are well.  Truly, E.F.P.
