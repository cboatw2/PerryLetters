Letter 72

Thursday night, [26 March 1846]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received your letter last night, & was very much pleased to hear from you.  I can scarcely afford the time to write you even a few lines.  I am in the midst of housecleaning, & you cannot imagine the confusion that reigns all over the house.  It is worse even than usual for generally I have had only two rooms & the Entries whitewashed but this time I am having the whole house, but Mr. Wallace being obliged to go on & do one room immediately after the other, allowing me no time to fix, every part of the house is in the utmost confusion.  Tonight we sleep in the large chamber.  I am glad you are away, & if you are only careful, take care of yourself & come back safe, I will be thankful that your absence is prolonged longer than usual, for I believe in a fortnight, we will only have commenced getting in order, & I have very little assistance, only Delia & Mary today.  When I told Minerva I wanted her to help, she said she could not leave her child in the kitchen.  Charlotte & John would kill it, & this evening when I told her, I could not have believed she would have sat in the kitchen all the afternoon doing nothing, when even her mistress was in the house working hard.  She said, cleaning the house was not her business.  Her place was in the kitchen.  Eliza I have been obliged to let iron, so that Delia might assist me.  March tonight helped move some of the Furniture.  He is most obliging.  I like him very much.  I much prefer him to Jim, because he has such a good temper, but Jim is a valuable servant, but is so often ill natured.  Monday morning Jim planted the Yam potatoes.  After that it rained so much & the next day they were not able to do anything.  It rained almost incessantly Monday & Tuesday.  Yesterday Jim & March ploughed the lot where your office is, & planted the Lucerne, & also ploughed the middle lot.  Today at the farm, they were building the fence.  March said it was too wet to plant the Corn.  I dare say they will do their duty, while you are away.  Mamma & myself hear constantly from Susan.  She seems satisfied & contented & Mr. McBee she thinks a great deal happier there, than he was at Mamma�s, & I do not wonder at I;, & his associates also she thinks much better than those here, for though plain, they are all worthy persons.  Alexander is almost constantly with him, & Pinckney very often.  Mr. Bigham is so kind & generous.  Susan wrote today, that he had made her a present of a gold pen.  He insisted upon her taking it.  Susan says the�with such good worthy persons, is preferable to the heartless intercourse of the village.  She seems to appreciate the quiet retreat she has found, so I hope she will remain.  In her letter to me today, she said she felt to you as she would to an own brother.  I think she & Mamma value you a great deal more than they did, since they have come in contact with others of the  Male sex & seen how far superior you were to them.  They now have more confidence in your judgement, & are more willing to be guided by you.  Perhaps it would be well if you were to write a letter to Susan, a kind one, giving her all the advice you think she needs, encouraging her to perform the duties devolved on her to persevere in remaining where she is, speaking well of Mr. McBee, & I think she would consider it as a mark of friendship, take it kindly, & be benefitted by it.  Let me have the reading of it first.  Mr. McBee thinks me perfection, looks, manners & everything, & that therefore I ought to like him.  Mamma in one of her notes to me, speaking of Susan & Mr. M said Susan did not expect to marry one like you, for you were an exception, so for the first time, I told her, (in answering the note) my real opinion of you.  I said you were an exception, that we might look�in vain to find your equal, that I knew of no fault you had, & though by Christians, you would not be called a Christian, you were more perfect than any Christian I knew of.  So now what do you say to that,  The children are well, but are obliged to be rather neglected now.  As I look at them covered with dirt, I think the housecleaning is no advantage to them, they will require some cleaning & putting in order too.  Willie has been learning today a peice of poetry to speak tomorrow.  Frank today, said to me, �I want horse to go to Factory.�  I said, very well get me.  I thought he was joking.  He went out of the room, & after awhile, he came back & said �there�s no horse.�  I said where have you been.  He said, �to stable,� & the little fellow had really been all the way to the stable to see if there was a hose there.  Do not be uneasy about us.  We are getting on quite well.  I hope you will be able to go & see your Mother before you return, for you are so much nearer to her now, than you are in Greenville, that you may not find it convenient to leave home to go see her, for a long time.  It has been very inconvenient to me to write tonight.  I do not think I will be able to write by anyone going to Pickens, unless someone goes Monday, & then I would write to you Sunday, so do not be disappointed if you do not hear.  I will have Tuesday, to get the house fixed somewhat in order before Sunday.  I have not a particle of news to tell you.  There is none in the Mountaineer which came this evening.  It is past 10 oclock, the children are all asleep.  Only one more letter has come for you, from Mr. Miller�candidate for Bursar, the Literary Messenger & the Union have come.  Mr. Luther gave me at the Factory ? a ream of Letter paper.  I  had no idea it was such an extensive establishment.  Old Mr. McBee is about building there a Woolen Factory.  Yours &c, Liz
