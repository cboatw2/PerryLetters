Letter 72

Sunday morning, 29 November [1846]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have a few moments to spare before going to church this morning, so will devote them to you.  You must excuse my shabby looking letters, but I have no conveniences for writing.  The paper Aunt Harriet has given me, the pen & ink are Aunt Anna�s , & the pen very ba�.  I wrote to you yesterday, but I received such a pleasant letter from you last night, that I think it deserved an answer immediately.  I am delighted at what you tell me of your prospects of being a Judge.  Even if Judge Oneal [O�Neall] is not elected, you must try for the vacancy created by Chancellor Johnson, if there is the�prospect of your succeeding.  Your claims you must press, for you have as many claims as any of the Candidates I have heard mentioned.  I would much prefer you should be Judge, than President of the Bank, for the former is an office for life, & more respectable than any other, & with a stated income coming in regularly, & with no trouble to get it, we can put up something every year.  So whenever you think you can be elected you must try for it, for I think it is an office you must desire.  Your judgement is good & I depend on you  for doing what is right.  All I say is, then if there is a probability of your being elected, you must try for it.  Law business is getting scarce now, & the bench would be a most desirable place for you, & I am sure you would do honor to it.

	Sunday 1 oclock.  I have now returned from church.  I went to St. Michael with my Aunts.  I heard Mr. Trapier Keith.  Mr. Trapier who has resigned sat in one of the pews.  He must have felt strange to be there instead of in the pulpit preaching.  Dr. Croft has just been here to pay a visit.  He is on his way to St. Helena.  He asked if you had written anything about his case.  This afternoon I am going to the Hugonot church with Aunt M� McCall.  I spent a very pleasant day yesterday at Aunt Emily�s.  She Gave each of the children a toy, & Aunt Sarah Hayne who you know lives with her, gave me a China cup & saucer.  Aunt Susan Hayne (Mrs. Wm Hayne) has given Anna a dress & me a Jar of Sweat meats.  I wrote you I would leave here Monday week.  I think perhaps I will remain here a day or two longer, but some day week after the following week, I will leave, & will write you that you may meet me at the Depository.  With regard to my funds I will tell you how they stand.  My dresses being made up, hat trimmed, childrens clothes made, & some necessaries bought left me with so little I foiund I would not be able to pay for the making up of the stools & the shoes, of which I had 3 pr, 1 for Ann & 2 for myself.  So I went to Mr. Enston the cabinet maker & told him I could not pay for the stools now, but would when we sent money for our Groceries, & if he preferred not waiting for the money, I would not have the stools made up at present.  He said he would wait for it.  I also went to the Shoe makers & took back the shoes, & will have them made up another time.  I would like to have had more money, there are so many things I see that I would like to get, that it would take a great deal of money to supply my wants.  I hope I will be able to get a few presents for Greenville friends, & something for the children.  I would like also to have made a present to the Aunts with whom I am staying, but if I am not able, the pincushions & the stool I have given them lately will answer.  All the money you can get now, you will have to keep to pay your Grocery bill, so you must be very economical.  I yesterday selected the groceries, & I expect it will be a high bill.  As for having my bust taken, I will not consent.  A portrait is what I wish, & for a little more I could have that taken.  Besides you have not the money to pay for it.  I am glad you have had yours taken, but I do not wish mine.  All the money you can spare, you may spend in paying  our board in Columbia, for I would like to stay there several days, as long as you could afford.  Should I may never be there again, & wish to see everything.  You must wait & go to the Theatre with me.  I would like very much to go to the Theatre.  Write me at what house you think I will stay. You can stay at the Congaree as your room is engaged there & I at some other house, if you do not wish to leave the Congaree.  Mrs. Martin has much more time to write than I have.  She is not engaged as I am, visiting, shopping. & dining out.  Write good letters for the Mountaineer.  At any rate you must not be lower than District Senator, but Judge I prefer, & if you can be elected you must be.  Dr. Croft says you could be.  I believe I would be almost too happy.  Then I wish I were with you in Columbia to electioneer for you.  The Mantle would not fall on a worthier than yourself.  Your good judgement must direct you.  My Aunts send their love.

	The children are well.  I write in a great hurry.  I should think you could find out before the election comes on whether you could be elected or not,.  You must act as you think best.  E.F.P.
