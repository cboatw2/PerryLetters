Letter 163

Tuesday night, 26 November 1850
Greenville

My dear husband

		Reuben returned this evening, but brought no letter from you, for which I was very sorry; but  I hope you were so busy talking to Col. Brockman enlightening him & others that it left you no time to write to me.  I am glad you reached Mr. Felkes in safety, & that the horses did not give out as Charles predicted.  Reuben says they are well, only tired, so they shall rest awhile.

		You are now in Columbia in the midst of the excitement.  The papers that came today, I see are full of Judge Cheves speech, but I do not intend to read it, as I have not you to do away any impression it might make on me.  I thought I would try & enlighten someone, so I sent some papers last night to Mr. Nicol to read, the Chronicle & Sentinel containing Mr. King & Mr. Clemens� speeches, & another with Judge Nes� letter, & he said he would read anything I sent him.  A letter today came from Mr. Thomas McLure of Chester C.H. begging you to send him the first number of your paper & mentioning a gentleman  to whom you must also send it, as he thought they would like to subscribe for it.  The names of the gentlemen were John Rosborough Esqr, Chester C.H.; Peter Wylie, Do; Dr. A.P. Wylie, Do; James Drennan Esqr., Chesnut Grove; Danl. G. Stenson Esqr, Cedar Shoal; William Heath, [Do]; William Moffat, Lewisville, Chester District; William A. Rosborough, [Do]; James Hemphill, Esqr, Chester C.H.

		I went to see the Miss Andersons yesterday afternoon to carry them some books & papers.  Miss Anderson told me Mr. Cox told her, that Slavery was abolished in the District of Columbia, so either he is very ignorant, or he says, what he knows is not so.  I almost wish the State would secede this winter, get into a scrape as Mr. Pettigru says, & then perhaps she would be brought to her senses.  

		Mr. Arthur came to see me yesterday.  I did not say anything wrong that you would have disapproved, but I expressed the state of matters to him & how the paper originated &c, & he was very mild, & agreed with me in all I said about Politics &c; said Mr. Watson presented the Southern Association paper to him to sign it.  He told him before he was a Minister he was a Democrat, but now he had done with Politics.  So now I have seen Mr. Arthur & talked to him.  I have better feelings towards him than I had.  I think I gave him a great deal of information.  But I think the Episcopal Church on account of the Members, it is composed of, it is really high time now for me to leave.  Who do you think has joined it?  Why Mrs. Choice that vindictive ill tempered woman.  She is still a Baptist in heart. So she was not satisfied with sprinkling, or she thought that not sufficient to wash away her sins, so yesterday she was emersed by Mr. Arthur, & next Sunday is Communion Sunday, so I suppose she will commune.  Mrs. Joe Powel who I met at the Miss Andersons told me that when she was ill, she heard Mr. Arthur administered the Sacrament to her; so if so, it was after taking that solemn ordinance, she went to Mr. Nicol so infuriated because she had voted for you so it had certainly not changed her heart, or improved her temper.  The Lords Supper is a feast of Love, & when I think of Mrs. Jones who said she hated me; Mrs. Choice & Mrs. Walker who hate you, Mrs. Rowland who has always seemed so unfriendly to us both, Dr. Crittenden who is so violent against you; Dr. Irvine who is ready now to see his count[r]y in war & bloodshed; I cannot but think it is sacrilegious  to unite with such; so next Sunday I do not think I can feel it my duty to go to the Episcopal church.  I am afraid I will commit a greater sin in going than staying away.

		 Tonight a letter has come from Mr. W.M.D. Crowder, Due West, asking for a place in the office of the Southern Patriot.  He says he can work either at the Case or Press, & the terms whatever is usually paid to Journeymen in the upcountry offices; says he can give you references as to attention to Duty.  Two Chronicles & Sentinels have come, & that is all.

		Last Saturday night a Mr. Campbell from Anderson came to see you on business, but he said the business was not important.

		The children & myself are well.  When Fanny was saying her prayers, I told her to pray that Papa, Willie & Frank might come safe home, & she said �bring Papa, Mr. Duncan Willie & Frank safe home.�

		Eliza & Minerva as usual are complaining.  I never knew so much cramp in the stomach as they have.  Minerva sent in this morning for some Brandy, because she had cramp in the stomach, & then sent word to say she could not work, & she has been in her room all day.  When she sends for Brandy again, I will send her pepper or pepper tea, for as the spirits do not cure her, it is no use to waste it.  If all persons made as much fuss as she & Eliza do, in their situations, it would really be dreadful.  Theye not delicate creatures indeed.  I hope Willie & Frank have behaved well, & given you no trouble.  I long to hear from you.  I have very little to write about.  I hope though in the minority, you will have a pleasant time in Columbia. 

		Dr. Simons scholars are to speak in the Methodist church next Friday morning, & receive Diplomas; young ladies, mind Susan Hoke says in his advertisement he says his school has been most flourishing, consisting of a majority of the respectable families in Greenville, that it is entirely a Southern Institution; & he hopes that parents will send to him, instead of sending to Philadelphia & New York, that he will assist in establishing that non intercourse with the North, so desirable at the present time. Mrs. Temple is going away, so I dare say, she & Dr. Simons did have a quarrel.  He has angered  another teacher an English lady I heard, & yet he says his institution is all Southern.  Any humbug can succeed, after him.  I was at Susan�s this afternoon, her baby is well now.  Send Susan Hoke�s Music by Mail.  It is �Roll on Silver Moon.�  It is now time to stop.  I will have more to write about when I hear from you.  As soon as the weather gets cold, the hogs shall be killed.  Charles killed the smallest one  yesterday, was to give us some fresh meat.  Good night, your attached Wife, E.F.P.
