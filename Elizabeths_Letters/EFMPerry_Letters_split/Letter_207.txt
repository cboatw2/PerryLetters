Letter 207

Tuesday morning, 9 oclock, 4 May [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received your letter & Wilie�s & am obliged to you for them.  I was holding Hext while reading them, & gave him the envelopes to play with.  Mary was taken sick two days after you left, & though almost well now, does nothing in the house, & very little of anything in the kitchen.  Lindy works, Milks, minds her child[,] helps wash & iron, so of course can do nothing in the house.  Eliza works for Mamma, Susan, Ann as well as my family, so I can take her as seldom as possible from her sewing.  Sarah or Charlotte have to mind Hext, so it leaves you perceive almost nobody to clean the house.  So I have lived in greater discomfort than I have known at housekeeping, & the house is dirtier than I have ever seen it, but I am far happier than if Minerva were here with her insolent tongue & things were cleaner.  John Smith disappointed me & did not come yesterday to whitewash. & says he cannot come until Thursday.  If so the house will be confusion the night you return, but I have sent to ask him to come tomorrow, & allow me one day to clean up before you come back.  If he cannot come tomorrow, I will have to put off the whitewashing until next week.  I like it done every year, because we are obliged to clean every corner, & cleanliness promotes wealth.  But when I tell you it was fever Dr. Crooks thought Mary had, you will be thankful that she is soon getting well, & that all the rest of us have continued well.  All of Dr. Crooks negroes are getting well, & Mary is almost well.  She only takes Bitters to strengthen her.  She is so careless I expect her to be sick as long as we have her.  Frank is well, & none of the others have as yet taken the Mumps.  You tantalize me when you tell me of Mr. Rhett�s resignation.  He is right, for as a Secessionist, he misrepresents the State, but no other Secessionist ought to be elected his Sucessor.  You of course ought to be, but as you do not try for yourself, & have no friends so disinterested as to try for you, your claim will always be passed over.  If you had only got some friends to bring you to the Governors notice, I am certain you would have received the appointment, & what a triumph after being defeated for the other house, but of course you will be overlooked, so I am provoked as I am always with you, for doing nothing to promote your interest, but as usual letting others get ahead of you.  Some honor of this kind would be the making of your family in this  world, so you ought to make every honorable exertion for your advancement.  Persons like Mr. Martin of Abbeville always express what you ought to have & what is due you, but no one tries to get you your due.

       I am glad your Daguerreotype is taken & so fine a one.  Copys are always cheaper after taking one, so I wish as my present, you would have a Daguerreotype taken like the one you are to send to Mr. Livingston, only finished, & bring me.  A second one should be taken for far less than the first.  I hope Judge O�Neal[l]  will write your life better than you did.  Altogether I was not satisfied with it, & look to him to do you justice.  I am glad Mr. Finley spoke cordially to you.  I know our family in their hearts respect you, but in politics having been always on opposite sides, gives them a reserved feeling to you, & you yourself are reserved to them, for your manners, as I very often tell you are repulsive & you think others cold to you, when it is only a reflection of your unintentional coldness to them, you need me by to soften things.  Politics creates bitter feelings as I know by experience.  Think of the Cunningham family who formerly were your best friends, have now changed into enemies.  You say you did not recognize Mr. Finley, so he might have thought you rude, when you did not mean to be rude at all.

	You must not forget to have my thimble mended.  I hope Willie will come back very much improved.  Yesterday afternoon we had a fine rain, which was greatly needed, & today Charles & Reuben are ploughing the bottom land & planting it, as it is in good condition to be done.  Charles attends to the garden every now & then.

	Mrs. Poinsett is now at her place.  I believe her son is with her.  Last Sunday afternoon Mr. Arthur had no service, & we went to the Baptist church to hear Mr. Furman, but he is away. & there was a Prayer meeting held instead of preaching.  Mr. Elford made a prayer a very good one.  After service he called to me as I came out of church, & said he had an Editorial sent him that morning of yours, which he would send to me to read.  I told him I had read it, & sent it to him.  He said he thought it had been sent by mistake to him.  You know Mr. Duncan brought it & sent to me, & I sent to Mr. Elford, & he was not up, & seeing the Envelope directed to me, & not knowing who sent it to him, thought there was some mistake	.  I have not sent him the Temperance communication yet.  It is directed to you, & he I expect will not publish it, & I want you to read it.

	I like you, wish Anna to be modesty itself, but at the same time polite, & I think it was rude to refuse the prayer book.  If a fan is offered me & I do not wish it, for fear if I refuse I will hurt the persons feelings.  Little attentions ought to be accepted with politeness & at the same time modestly.  A little girl who is afraid it shows her to be bold.  If she looks at a boy, perhaps is bolder than one who looks at him with perfect indifference.  I wish our children to be modest, easy & polite, but not forward & bold & rude.  I think with our training they will pursue the right course, as we ourselves have.  

	If I have time I will write to Willie.  We will all be very glad to see you.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
