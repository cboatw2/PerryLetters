Letter 119

Monday morning, 8 May 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		Again like a good wife do I take up my pen to write to you.  I wish to prevent your being at all uneasy about home.  I almost hope you will not be in Columbia to receive this, that you are in Laurens, where you ought to be, until your cases come on.  I will now think of all that has occurred since I wrote you on Friday.  Mary is getting quite well, & in a week when her baby will be a month old, she will go about her ordinary duties.  Jim is well now.  He drove me to church yesterday morning, & has gone to the Farm today.  Mrs. Butler was seated, it was early, & I had a long talk with her.  She asked where you were, & said I must soon go & see her.  She sent me Saturday a very pretty note, Miss Rodgers wrote me, & enclosed in a letter to her.  Miss Rodgers thanks us for our kindness to her & you for the beautiful breast pin & says she hopes to see us both at the North.  She has been sick she says & would have written before.  After church Mr. Arthur requested the Members to remain in, as he wished to say something to them, & the business was, that the pews should henceforth be free, persons still occupy the same pews they did, but instead of paying pew rent, call it a subscription.  He thinks adopting this plan persons will go to the church, as the pews are free, the congregation will�, the subscription will amount to more, than the pew rent does, but I think he is entirely mistaken, that many who now pay pew rent will pay less when the subscription is [final two lines on this sheet obscured] will now pay much less.  It would make no difference with me, for 20 dollars is little enough to give to Mr. Arthur for his preaching to us for a whole year. But I am certain also, money loving persons will pay as little as possible.  I carried Mrs. Rowland home.  She seems to be without horses at present.  She asked how Mary was, said a general interest had been felt in her on account of her suffering so much.  In the afternoon I walked with all of the children to Mamma�s.  Before I went a violent storm of wind & rain had occurred.  It was a whirlwind, but did not last very long.  At Mamma�s, I found two Oak Trees had been uprooted, one, a monstrous one, larger than our Oaks.  Susan has had headaches all the week, but was up.  Mamma & Ann have both been particularly unwell.  I told Mamma that Mr. Luther McBee thought Mr. Orr would be elected.  She said that was different from what he told Susan, & she supposed he judged from what he had heard, that he told Susan he was standing with a circle of gentlemen, who were talking of the Election, & Mr. Elford said he thought Mr. Orr would be elected, but Mr. Beattie said he thought you would be.  Now Mr. Elford is your friend I believe, & his opinion at that time was that Mr. Orr would be elected, so when your friends think so, it ought to alarm you, & make you determine to do all, that can be done to ensure success.  These four weeks Mr. Orr has spent in Laurens I am afraid will do wonders for him, so on your return from Columbia, you must spend a few weeks in Laurens & rub out all the tracks he has made.  You must not be too secure for yourself.  It is that feeling of security, that makes me fear for you.  I am afraid that Mr. Orr & his friends not feeling secure, will try so much harder than you & your friends do, then they will in the end distance you.   

 		This morning at daybreak a storm of thunder & rain came on but it cleared up soon, & since I commenced writing, the thunder has commenced, & it is raining also & is very cloudy, except for Delia & Lindy who will have to come from the Spring.  I would be glad of the rain, for we need it greatly.  I put down my pen to go upstairs to shut the windows, & in the big room I found the rain pouring down into the Wardrobe, so I opened the Wardrobe & found my dresses wet, Boston�almost�& all the things in a fair way to be washed.  I will have the Wardrobe moved from behind the door, for it is too much trouble every rain, to remove the things out of it.  You must have the Leaks stopped.  I had to mount the Step Ladder & put three basins on top of the Wardrobe, & I am afraid more of the plastering will fall down.  It is raining very hard.  Mrs. Earle went to see Mamma last week.  She said she had intended having a large wedding for her daughter & inviting all her friends, but now on account of Mrs. Thompsons situation, she would have a private one.  She said Mrs. Harrison was so envious of her daughters, & said such horrible things about them, that her daughters now would not speak to them, that Anne Harrison had not been to her house since her daughter Emily married Mr. Williams, that Anna said, Mr. Williams intended addressing her, but Emily supplanted her.  Anna Harrison also went to Mamma�s, & she asked her if she had heard of the great match her cousin was going to make, that she was going to marry a man nearly as old as Maj. Turpin, & who has illegitimate children in every direction, & that Elias Earle�s assurance was really great to think he was running for Congress.  It was presumption in him to offer for the Legislature.  My dear there is one book I wish you to buy me.  I enclose the advertisement that you may see it.  Mrs. Cunningham told me no female should be without it, so buy it for me.  My dear husband, I will send to town for it, if you do not, so save me that trouble, & buy it in Columbia now.  I am sorry to write on such coarse paper, but I have no other in the house.  Willie & Anna are at school, Frank & Charlotte are together upstairs & Fanny in the cradle asleep.  Miss Rodgers calls her the Rosebud, & it is an appropriate name for her.  No letters have come for you, only newspapers, the Cultivator & Southern Review.  Mr. Edward Earle has gone to Augusta & from there goes to Pendleton to address Miss Calhoun.  Susan says she has given him a hint to return & she will accept him.  If this is so, Mr. Burt is mistaken in thinking she will only marry one who fills a large space in the world.  Mrs. Thompson is dying.  Mrs. Butler says it was a mistake in thinking she was better.  A Catholic Minister preached here last night.  A Catholic congregation I believe is to be formed.  I long to hear from you.  I will�on one letter until I receive another.  I will conclude by saying you must fulfil[l] the expression, running for Congress, & not let Mr. Orr do the running, & you the walking, for if so, you will be left far behind�, E.F.P.
