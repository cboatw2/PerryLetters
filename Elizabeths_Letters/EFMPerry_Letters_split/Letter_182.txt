Letter 182

My dear husband

		It is raining today.  We indeed have unpleasant weather,  I hope it is more cheerful where you are.

		Mr. Suddeth has not been to look at the Cows, so the first good day Reuben will carry them off.

		The Carpet came yesterday.  I think it a beautiful one, & the Rug very pretty, & matches the Carpet exactly.  I will make up the carpets as soon as I can, but the days are so short, by the time the house is fixed, the day is gone.  It will take me a long time to do it.  I never had so much to do as I have now.  Your Shirts have taken so long to make, that all the other work has been neglected, & I now feel as if I never can get through particularly as Elisa helps so little, but I will not fill up my letters with complaints.  I will only add that yesterday I got warm dresses for Anna, Hext & myself, & though very reasonable only 20 cts a yd still they amounted to nearly 8 dollars & have made such an inroad in my purse.  I would not be surprised if my funds failed too soon.  If so, I will have to draw on you & hope you will not be displeased.  You have no idea how expensive	the clothes a Lady & 5 children amount to, dressed in the most economical manner & without many necessary comforts for FlannelI have not known for years.  I have bought myself two cheap dresses to wear at home the whole winter & part of the Spring.  My other dresses are not suitable for home as they are Silk or too light, & would get ruined immediately.  

		Anna wrote a long letter to Aunt Mary Hayne last night.  She has just come home from school, & is practicing on the Piano.  Only 3 girls at school, so she came home early.  Willie & Frank have not come yet.  The umbrella�s are so broken, Willie was to stop at Mr. Nicols & buy a new one.  Mr. Irwin told Frank he thought he had gone to Columbia.  Perhaps he sent in his bill from that thought, that he might get his money before Frank left, & not seem so unreasonable as to send in an account afterwards for schooling which he had not given.

		Mary seems pretty well now, & I am thankful for we live in confusion when she is sick.  Minerva & herself are our most useful servants, & we miss more when they are sick.  All of our colds are better.  I hope yours is.  I long to hear from you.  I am glad you will not be here in the confusion of taking up & putting down Carpets.  You will enjoy only the comfort of them.

		Mary says the Bull that has come back, is ours.  I have not been out since you left & have seen no one, so have no news to tell you.  I hope to see the Southern Patriot tonight.  I think I am its youngest admirer, perhaps because I was the originator of it.  

		I have now to write two letters to Aunt Mary McCall & Aunt Harriet McCall.  I am glad the 73 dollars for the carpet she received safely.   

		Minerva is out of bed now & better.  John came in yesterday.  Charles is still there.  Reuben hauled Mrs. Cauble two loads of wood yesterday.  Today he burned the chimneys.  Minerva is making some Cake & Lindy helping her.  Elisa is making Willie a Jacket.  Sarah is cleaning the knives, & Fanny helping her.  Charlotte is holding Hext & trying to get him to sleep.  Anna is practicing, & I have just finished my letter to my dear husband.  E.F.P.
