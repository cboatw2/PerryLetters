Letter 220

Monday morning, 11 oclock, 6 December 1852
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have written to Eliza Hayne & Anna by Mr. Elford who goes this evening & I will now write to you.  My whole time now almost is taken up in writing.

	You said I might send you a bill of Groceries, so I have made out one which I think you had better give to Mr. Elford to get for us  at the same time he does for himself.  It is much better for someone to select them than to leave it to the Grocer.  I have lost a bill I intended to make it out by.  I have put down the necessaries, & only a few of the luxuries, not as many if it were summer.  In the Spring we can get more luxuries.  We have so many servants we use a great deal of Sugar, so what I have put down is not too much but you can make any alteration you wish.  We need a pr of fine dogs, a Fender Shovel & Tongs.  Perhaps Mr. Elford had better get them.  A neat set will do, not the handsomest do I care for.  Aunt Mary McCall has a box for Susan & myself.  Mr. Elford will either send it to you to bring, or send it by someone coming before you do or bring it up himself, whichever is the quickest way for we need the box now.  It contains the only dress I intend to buy for myself this winter, & a bonnet, & a few other things, which I stand in immediate use of.  I have written to Anna that if she wishes it, she can return with Mr. & Mrs. Elford, & save you going down for her, for you will be anxious to get home as soon as the Session is over, & I would like to go down with you in the Spring.  I would like Anna to be in town a few weeks longer & not return as soon as you do.  Mr. Elford may return he says in 10 days, or may stay 3 weeks.  He will go & see Anna, & she will go & see Mrs. Elford.  Aunt Eliza wrote word that she had wished that Fanny was with Anna.  It was a pity Anna could not have been with Mrs. Martin sooner in Columbia, & not only the last day; Mrs. Martin intended to have her the whole time, or she & Sarah together have her.  Mrs. Martin borrowed a house ready furnished.

	No Mail came today, so of course would not hear from you, but I hope you wrote me a long letter yesterday & that I will get it tomorrow.  I think of the contents of one letter until I get another.  The letter yesterday I liked.  I do hope either the State or the Presidency will give you some Office.  If you try you will get an Office, but you have to feel an interest in it yourself, & get others also to interest themselves also.  

	Edward mentioned at Mamma�s that Mr. Sam Mauldin was deranged & had taken Laudanum, because he thought his family all wished to get rid of him.  So I dare say there is some truth in the rumour you heard.

	I have not heard from Anna since you mentioned you had seen her off.  I hope to hear soon from her & also about her from Aunt Eliza, who I am sure will write.  I dare say she will need more money.

	This is Sale Day.  I do not know if many persons are in.  Mr. Hoke has not bought the Hogs yet.  The weather is mild & cheerful now.    We are all well.  Lindy�s baby is improving.  She has more time to attend to it, than she used to have.  When the child gets older we will not need both Charlotte & Lindy.  I wish Johnny would be put to some trade at once. But I suppose if Eliza�s child lives, he will have to mind that.  

	In these holidays Willie has so little to improve him I wish he was with you.  In future he always shall go down with you.  It improved him to associate with gentlemen. 

	I believe I have nothing new to write you.  I wrote yesterday except the Patriot I have not seen a single paper since you left.  I have rode out 3 times, & paid not a single visit.  I am busy all the time at home.  I will write again tomorrow.  After hearing from you I have more to write about.

	I hope the Secessionists will run you for Governor, vote for you & elect you.  If I were with you, to have urged your acceptance when they first proposed it to you there would have been no difficulty.  Your attached Wife, E.F. Perry

I enclose the Grocery bill & added a few things I wish Mr. Elford to get, but you can leave out anything you think best, & make any alterations.  The Calico is for comfortable.

Dear Anna

	I wrote a long letter to you yesterday, & have just written to Eliza, so can write you only a few lines.  I send you a veil & a pr of pantalets that I forgot to put up for you, & which you may even now find useful.  I am anxious to hear how you are, & how you feel, in the City, away from those you have always been with from your birth.  While in Columbia with your Papa, were not seeing him, you knew he was not far off, & did not feel lonely, but now you are even without him.  I am afraid you feel strangely.  I dare say by this time however you begin to feel at home, & are passing your time quite pleasantly, & surrounded by so many to whom you can claim relationship, gives you a home feeling.  I hope to hear a good account of you.  I would like to know what you have bought for yourself, that I may then determine what other things to get.  The silver comb if not too dear you must get.  I suppose one would be got for 3 or 4 dollars & it will last always, will be useful to Fanny after you are done with it.  Just before you leave I will write for a few presents for Christmas.  It will be cheaper buying them in town than here, particularly the Candy.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford will remain in town one two or three weeks.  That will be only a little longer than you & Papa will be in Columbia.  He will be anxious to get home as soon as the Legislature adjourns, & I would be glad for him to be saved the trip to Charleston, so you can if you like it return with Mr. Elford.  I am certain there will be opportunities constantly offering.  The Gradys I believe go down with him. 

	It is reported that Mr. Sam Mauldin is quite melancholy & took Laudanum to destroy himself under the idea that his family wished to get rid of him.  How sad for his wife & children to have him in that state.

	You must go & see Mrs. Elford if you can & Mary Crayton if she is in town.  Be a good girl.
	
	I am going to have some Ginger nuts made for you, to remind you of home, & send by Mr. Elford if they are nice.  If you do not receive them, you will know they were not made well enough to send.  Mr. Elford will send or bring anything.  Buy the�for Becky, & some little present for each servant.  Inquire the price of dolls ready dressed for Fanny & Annie, & also dolls not dressed.  

	Be a good girl.  Mr. Wardel is today fixing the peice to the Piano, Mr. Bacon spoke of.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

Dear Papa

	I wrote to Mama yesterday, & I will write you a few lines today.  I received your letter yesterday & one also from Mama at the same time.  Hers was dated the 5th so it must have had delay by the rail road accidents.  My [letter] ought to have got to you sooner than it did.  There are a great many accidents occurring at the present time, on the railroad.  I am very glad that I got down safely, & hope to get back safely also.  I am sorry that you were kept so anxious about me.  I do not think that I am worthy of so much love, but will try to be so.  If I had thought that you would be so anxious, I would have written the very evening that I arrived.  It was very late when I arrived, though no accident occurred.  I forgot to ask you for the carpetbag key before I left although I was thinking about it all of the time.  If you have an opportunity of sending it down, I would be very glad.  I hope your arm is better and that will be perfectly well when we return to Greenville.  I think those young ladies that you spoke about in your letter did not have much manners to be so noisy as that but I hope they will not annoy you so again.   When I was in Columbia I enjoyed myself quite well, but you and Mama both seem to think that I did not.  I enjoyed myself exceedingly well, and hope that I did not give you much trouble.  I enjoy myself here exceedingly well also and hope that you are enjoying yourself also.  I do not think that yours is much enjoyment for you have to attend to your business.  I am sorry that you feel lonely but I suppose as you are at the Statehouse all day you will not find much time to feel lonely.  You must write to me if you can find time  but I expect that all the time you have to spare you will write to Mama.  I think I would rather you come down after me if it would suit you.  I do not think that Mr. Trimmier will go up for two weeks to come but I will go to see him and see when he is going up, but I would rather you come down for me.  I am sorry to ask you for a little more money but if you have not got it do not worry yourself about it.  Though I have not spent all that you gave me yet I expect it will go, but if it does not go I will  give you back what is over.  I have not bought all of my clothes yet 10 dol[lars] would be enough.  I think I have been visiting my aunts almost every day.  I have been to see all but one.  I would write you a longer letter but I am going to dine at Anna Turnbull�s today and will have to stop to get ready.  This is a very long letter.  If you have time to write me only six lines I would be glad but if you have not time I will not mind it.  I hope you will continue well.  Tell all of Mr. Janney�s little girls howdye for me.  Your affectionate Daughter, Anna

P.S. All of aunt Eliza�s family are well.  Aunt Eliza thanks you & mama for letting me come down and begs to be remembered.

My dear husband

	I received two letters from you this morning. & one from Anna which I will enclose to you.  I was glad to see the one Anna wrote you.  I was reading your letter aloud to Willie but when I got in the midst of the scold, I stopped horror struck, merely glanced at it, went into the rest of the letter, & have not read the scold yet.  When you know it is my love for you, my exalted opinion of your character that is my opinion you surpass even the �Father of his Country� that is this feeling that makes me dissatisfied . that you who are so far above others have not received the rewards & honors, that your inferiors have.  You ought not to scold me, but sympathize with & try & gratify me.  I must say with the exception of scolding you wife now & then, you are the best husband that ever was.  You have retained more of the spirit of a Lover, than husbands generally do.  I feel that I am first in your heart, & perhaps if I were not quite so confident, it would be better for you, for if I were not, I would be more careful to retain your heart & perhaps would never dare to resort  to scolding, but now I am so well satisfied of your love, that I try it as I please.

	My dear husband if you had been in Congress, you would have been the admiration of the United States, & I believe you would then have aspired even to the Presidential Chair, but now what can you attain to nothing at all, & will be never more than a Member of the Legislature, & a Village Lawyer toiling for meat & clothes for his family.  This is beneath your deserts, your fellow men know it, & therefore they talk of elevating you, but never do, & I cannot help being provoked, but I wont be again.  I will live on hope.  I like Mr. Morgans feeling, & wish the people of Greenville would have heard you.  You are so well fitted to serve & benefit them, which is the reason I feel grieved when you hint at abandoning your present position.  You are by nature meant to serve your fellow�, Frank Pierces�s destiny was meant to be yours, somehow a mistake has been made, & you have not fulfilled your destiny, & I am afraid it is marrying that has prevented it.  It is the single men that are advanced most easily,  Mr. King for instance the Vice President.

	Last Sunday in church I looked at some of the Wives, & I thought to myself, none have such a husband as I have.  Mrs. Choice looked so cross & unhappy.  Mrs. Arthur looked vexed & strange.  Mrs. Butler Thompson they say has trouble with her husband; Susan at my side had so little to make her happy.  Mrs. Car� husband & indeed all so different from you.  It is your superiority that has made me repine.  I wish you in an enlarged sphere, known & appreciated.  If you would have been in a City & constantly associated with minds on an equality with your own, you would be happier.  You will call this scolding, but you have brought it forth by scolding me.  Mr. Sam Mauldins condition is truly sad.  I do not think he ought to have been left in the Asylum against his wishes.  If he is so miserable, even as to destroy himself, he would not be accountable for the act.  He could be guarded & go at large.  It seems so sad, to have him in the Asylum, when he is as conscious as he is now.  He ought to be confined in a room in his own house.  If he recovers it will make him miserable to think where he has been.  I am sorry for his Wife & children.  Mrs. Bollings daughter (Mrs. Childs) Mrs. Westfield told Ann was perfectly deranged, & is in Greenville at her Mothers.  Mrs. Hugh Stokes is very ill.  Mr. Joab Maudin is to be married at a sad time.  Mrs. Mims is getting better, but I heard had not recovered her mind yet,  Mr. Hillhouse is to be married to Mrs. Clines Sister.  Mr. W[iiia[m Easley is to be married to Mrs. Tom Sloan�s daughter at Pendleton.  I am glad, I hope he will have enough to occupy him at home, & not meddle with the business of others   The Easley you had a suit against married in Georgia & has gone to Texas.  Mrs. Rosemond  whose sister married an Easley. & cannot bear the Easleys, says they have cheated her sister, says Miss Winn is a bad girl,  Col. Town[e]s came for your office key yesterday to attend to some business he was concerned in with you, but I was out.  I see Sam Town[e]s & Campbell back again.  Tom Butler I hear has moved his family to Mrs. Stones, & Campbell has bought his place & moved to it.  I am sorry to have such a person on our Farm road.  Mr. Carson has given up going to California, & bought a Farm on the Saluda river, & going to move there the 1st of Jany.  I am sorry in your Patriot letter you mentioned Dr. �lands opinion of California.  I wish nothing said to discourage the vagrants & ragamuffins from going.  Mr. Carson I know had not energy enough to go so far.

	I will certainly go to Columbia with you next winter, & carry Willie & Anna.  Hext will then be out of the way, which he is not now as he nurses at night so much he keeps me awake.  Next Tuesday he will be 18 months old.  He is quite well, so are all the rest.  I know of no sickness now in Greenville. The two Cows & Calves are now at home, & today we commenced using the Milk of the one first Calved.  The short tailed one we expected to kill when fat, Charles says is with Calf, so we will have enough milk.  I will try & live in comfort when you come back.  

	Mrs. Westfielfd told Ann that at the Mansion house the other night Mr. Cureton said Luther & Mr. Leary were both intoxicated.  Do not mention it of  Mr. Leary, but if true, how sad.  He was not at church Sunday, which seems strange, for he is in the village.  I hope he will not give way, for he is a good man.  I will tell Willie to try & prepare for college next Fall.  Hamlin Beattie is 17, Willie only 13, but much smarter I expect than the former.

	I am glad your arm is so much better.  I suppose Dr. Kent feels proud of his in a sling, as much so as Genl Shields.  Nothing comes from the Post office for you.  I am sorry accidents come so often on the Rail Road.  Do be careful when you come up.  Take a safe seat, & be on your guard.  Bill is a noble horse & will bring you back with Selim with ease.  You must try & watch him.  If my bill of groceries is too large curtail it; leave out anything you wish.

	The 15th is so soon for Anna to leave Charleston.  She had better stay & come up with Mr. & Mrs. Elford.  It is not worthwhile preparing her to remain so short a time.  Mr. Elford said he would take charge if her with pleasure.  

	The weather is clouding up & looks again like rain.  It is too warm I think to kill hogs, though everybody has killed.  We have plenty of beef.  Mr. Hoke has not bought any hogs for us yet.  We do not wish them till the weather is cold.  I rode yesterday to Mr. McClanahans for the receipt, which he had not sent.  Mrs. McClanahan receipted the bill.  Charles & Reuben are cutting & hauling the wood.  The servants are doing well.  Yours truly, E.F. Perry
