Letter 234

Tuesday evening , 21 December 1852
Charleston

Dear Mama

	We were all out this morning shopping, & that is the reason why I did not write to you.  I will not have time to write but a few lines.  Aunt Emily has invited us to drink tea this evening with her.  It has been raining & thundering today but this morning was beautiful.  Aunt Eliza says that she knows that Aunt Emily is going to send for us, if it pours down.  It  has stopped raining now.  Aunt Anna & aunt Martha are going in the country,,,that is Thursday.  They are to take tea with aunt Eliza tomorrow evening.  All of my relations are kind to me & they all send their love to you all.  Cousin Sarah Gibbes invited me to tea yesterday.  I went.  I spent a very pleasant evening.  She has three daughters & four sons.  Two of her sons are grown & one of her daughters.  The next daughter is fifteen & her next just eleven.  She sends her love to you all & says she is very sorry for Aunt Annie, & aunt Susy.  Cousin Eliza says she will try to have a cloak made for Fanny.  I saw Miss Mary Drayton in the streets this morning & she said that Mr. & Mrs. Elford  were going next Tuesday or the end of next week.  I expect that I will go up with them.  I am enjoying myself exceedingly well.  I have bought six bibles for the servants. Cousin Eliza says she will get the other two for the servants if you wish her to do so and the two for Willie & Frank.  I have just received a letter from you but have not time to answer it.  Give my love to all, especially to Papa.  Your affectionate daughter, Anna.

P.S. Aunt Eliza, Cousin Eliza, & cousin Susan send their best love to you all.

My dear Anna

	I have just received two letters from you, and one from Aunt Eliza.  I write to say as there is such a difficulty in having work done, I will give up having Fanny�s cloak made.  If the materials are bought & a pattern sent, I will have the Cloak made here.  I will make it myself.  If a ready made Worsted Cloak would have been got, it would have saved the trouble of making one.  If cloak patterns cannot be got, perhaps a S� a large one will do.  If so get [page torn] materials for a S� & a pattern.

	I wrote to Eliza to have a Cloak made for me; at least that I would wish one, but as there is such a delay, it will be best to inquire the prices of ready made Cloaks, black silk & other dark kinds.  It will be better to give more, & be saved the trouble of buying materials & waiting to have the Cloak ma[de].  There is such a delay in fitting oneself with suitable winter clothes, so that this winter I am obliged to have some things.  Last Sunday I wore a hat with a feather, & an old black Silk dress, & felt very shabby indeed.  As Eliza wil[l] be confined to her room for a month I got Margaret [to] let Clara come & make a dress for me, the first she has ever made alone.  She is now in the room with me making the dress.

	Tell Aunt Eliza Aunt Mary McCall sent me two beautiful dresses.  The blue one was got at Browning & Semans 25 cts a yd.  The whole peice looks beautiful, much prettier than yours at the same price.  The Cashmere is 75 [page torn] & is embroidered.  I send a pattern, but not of the part embroidered.  Mary said belts were not worn, the dresses were peaked, but I intend to have my dresses made my same favorite way & so need a belt for each dress.  Ask Eliza to buy me a belt for each.  They can come up in [page torn] large envelope, if no opportunity occurs.

	There are a great many stores here, but the shopping is very limited.  If we get a dress, we cannot get trimmings for it.  You would not price a pr of Gaiter boots to fit, & some simple things we cannot get, & the Stores are so frequented by Greenville Loungers, it is disagreeable  to go in them & the merchants are acquaintances , & they talk & press their goods on us, so it is very awkward to refuse.  The shopping [l]ine is more like disagreeable visiting in the City.  It is a business matter{&} I am surprised Mr. Elford did not deliver my packages immediately.  He is more careless than I thought.  He is not as punctual & exact in business as your Papa is.  

	Mr. Elford�s little daughter is not expected to live.  He has been written for & may come back before he has time to let you know, before you can get ready to come.  If so I will let you know of the first opportunity I hear of.  It may be inconvenient for your Aunt to have you longer, & I do not wish you to impose on her hospitality, so you must consult her wishes about lengthening your visit.  She has been very kind indeed to you, & has afforded you a great pleasure by introducing you to your relations.  You cannot return her kindness [page torn] it deserves, but you must show your value of it, by making her some useful present.  You must get money from Mr. Elford & pay for what I wrote for, & also if you need any.

       [G]et at Klinckes a Jar of preserved Ginger & give to your�in my name & get a present for her Eloisa & Susan.  
       
	If you buy the dress & trimmings & bring it home, Eliza can make it when she gets well.  A dress for 25 cts a yd as pretty as the blue Aunt Mary has got me at that price, & which [pagetorn]  send a pattern of will do.  Beg Eliza to get me two belts to suit [page torn] patterns I send.  I will write to Aunt Eliza soon.  Tell her I [w]ould be gratified if she would write to your Papa about you.  Your Mama, E.F.P.
