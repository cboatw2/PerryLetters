Letter 103

Wednesday afternoon, 11 October 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		Mr. Taylor has just sent me the list of boxes showing how many votes you received.  You got altogether 23 less than you expected, & Mr. Orr 18 more than you expected, so that your calculation in that way was pretty correct, but at the separate boxes in some of them you were so much mistaken, that it makes me more anxious than ever. For the Sullivans were so successful in their exertions as to cause you to be beat at two boxes.  Therefore in Laurens, they may be equally successful, & occasion your defeat.  It is all decided now, though I am in the dark.  Last night, Mr. Hoke read me a letter from Mr. Sitton to Joe Powel.  He said it was thought Mr. Orr would beat you in Pendleton District 800 or 1000 votes.  Your vote in Greenville will makeup for that, but unless you get a large majority in Laurens you may be defeated.  I know of 10 men in this village who voted against you, so I have heard, it may be a mistake, some of them & others no doubt voted against you that I have not heard of yet.  Old Maj. Turpin did vote for you.  He had said he would not, but he did.  Butler Thompson, Charles Stone, Isaac Henning, Joe Hayden, Tom Turpin, Gaines, Mr. Penible, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Walker & Mr. Choice voted against you.  Mrs. Wallace was here this morning, & she said Mr. Jacobs said at her house, that Mrs. Walker said to him, if you were elected, she supposed you would call your dogs & feed them.  Mr. Lester said Dr. Sullivan was electioneering against you, saying you called the people vagabonds.  Col. Town[e]s, Mr. Smith & the two Earles are elected to the Legislature.  Mr. Lester says he knows of a dozen men at least, at Shockley, who if they had voted, would have voted for you, & yet did not leave their work to go to the Polls.  Mr. Dill did wonders for you at the dark corner.  Mr. Hoke worked well here & if he had had more like himself, says he would have saved you many more votes, but there are very few electioneerers, like Mr. Hoke & now I understand how much can be done on the day of election.  I am more uneasy than ever, for good electioneerers are in the class of Mr. Orr�s friends.  Your friends are generally those who do not pull & drag people to the polls, & force a ticket into their hands.  At Pickensville you got 73 votes, Mr. Orr 144.  Perhaps it was only guess work.  I do not know that the votes were counted out.  At Brushy creek you 35, Mr. Orr 60.  At Pickens C.H. Mr. Sitton said you were running ahead, at Bachelors Retreat Col. Orr, but he thought that a mistake.  At Gantts & the Trap you beat; at Stantonville & McElroy Mr. Orr.  I suppose tonight we will hear certainly from Laurens.  That news will decide the election.  Mrs. Butler was here this morning.  She says Butler Thompson told Dr. Butler he was going to vote for you.  I hear he voted against you, but it may be a mistake, as it was with Maj. Turpin.  The two Dr. Crofts came to see me yesterday.  Their father sent for the managers to come & take his vote.  They went, but afterwards said they would not take it, it was illegal.  A young Guinn would have voted for you, but because more than a year ago he went to Texas for the purpose of settling, but did not like the country & returned.  Mr. Kilgore told him he must not vote because he had not been here 2 years; he had been more than a year.  Your friends are too scrupulous.  If Mr. Orr had such, he would get no votes at all.  I hope & pray Laurens may have done you justice, but Mr. Orr has powerful friends there.  I have seen no gentleman today.  I hope some of them will write, & tell you more than I know.  Mr. Thirlkill did a great deal for you.  At Doiuthits Mr. Orr beat you 11 votes; at McCulloughs 11.  Elias Earles brother voted against you.  Mr. Hoke says if they had known that, the first day of the election, they would have paid it off on Elias.  I am so sorry Mr. McKay was not elected.  Col. Town[e]s saw a narrow escape.  Mrs. Wallace says she heard people saying Col. Orr was the poor mans friend; that you never bowed to anyone except when you were a candidate. She contradicted it.  Your Law cases have made you so many enemies.  Genl Thompson was electioneering for Mr. Jones, & said he did not know of four other men, who were so disinterested as he was, that he always acted from  principle, he disregarded his interest.  Genl Thompson says he gained you 500 votes by voting for you.  I rather think he lost you 500, by telling, how many places you would be beaten at.  He might have gained you thousands, by writing & speaking to his Whig friends throughout the Congressional District.  I am afraid no one comes to tell me news today, because they have heard bad news.  I am sorry to close without hav[ing] something more definite to tell.  Mr. Sitton said at Pendleton you were getting one third.  Col. Irby Mamma heard , pretended to be for you, but was electioneering against you. I hope this is [fal]se.  The village has seemed to me very quiet.  I can [word obscured] imagine such important events have been going.  [Word obscured] hope you received my letter safe by Genl Tompson [word obscured] message Mr. Durbec sent me, saying you were doing well in Laurens, was a mistake of the servants.  I was sorry it turned out so.  If Genl Thompson influenced 500 votes, it was strange he did not influence his son.  My dear husband, your character for pride, & your abusing the opposite party in Law cases, has injured you to an immense degree, so I hope in future you will pursue a different course, look & be more sociable, & not be so abusive in your speeches.  Your course has been of great advantage to Mr. Orr.  If you had gone about more, you would have convinced the people it was not pride you had.  There is nothing they dislike as much as that.  I have heard more chicken stories.  A Mrs. Gunter, said she would not come to this house to be degraded, that persons who came here to sell things, were made to stand out of the house, said she heard it from good authority.  In Laurens I am afraid all that stuff will have injured you a great deal.  I am really sorry I have not some very good news to tell.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
