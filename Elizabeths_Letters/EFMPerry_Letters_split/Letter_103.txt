Letter 103

Friday afternoon, 14 May 1847

My dear husband

	Only to prevent your being uneasy, induces me to write now, for I am in the greatest confusion.  Mr. Wallace unexpectedly came this morning to Whitewash, though I had engaged him, I had forgotten he was coming, or thought he would not keep his promise.  Just as I was going today to go out to visit he came, & I was almost sorry to see him.  I had then to have the Carpets taken up, Curtains taken down &c. & after that I went out, as I had kept Jim on purpose to drive me.  It rained a great deal yesterday, & the ground was quite wet, so I had a good excuse for keeping Jim, & it was well he was here to move the furniture.  I wished to finish off my visiting, so that next week he might plough steadily.  He said the rains we have had lately, will make the Corn grow fast.  I paid 4 visits only this morning. As I went out late.  Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. S�ham, & Mrs. Pinckney McBee, & then I stopped with Susan at old Mrs. McBee�s.  They were at dinner.  They pressed me to get out & dine, so I did.  When I returned I gave Mr. Wallace his dinner & now I am seated in the Dining room which is dismantled of its furniture, & the servants washing the paint.  I assure you a Housecleaning is dreadful, & you ought to be thankful to be absent while they are going on, for the parts not cleaning, are in such confusion there is no place to sit in comfort.  Susan moved back to Mrs. McBee�s.  I could not ask Mr. McBee to stay here, for I wish to be at ease at present, & Mr. McBee did not like Susan to be here without him, so we determined it was best for her to go back,, & so she went, & he has behaved well since she returned. & the family also have been kinder to her.  I received your letter Wednesday night, & was much gratified by it.  All who see me ask the news from Columbia, so I am glad when I can have something to tell.  It does not seem to me Mr. Kilgore will make a good President of the Rail Road.  If it did not interfere with your Law business, I think they ought to have thought of you.  They would not have got a better one than yourself.  I am glad you will have seen Mr. Webster, as it will be pleasant to meet him in your own State.  You say Col. Dawkins & his new Wife have gone to Charleston to see him.  I had not heard Col. Dawkins had married a third time, for certainly his second Wife who he married 2 or 3 years ago,  you do not call a new wife.  I hope this new wife will be more fortunate than the other two, in being the means of carrying down his name to posterity.  I suppose Col. Herndon has lost his vanity now he is an old married man, & finds it too troublesome to dye his grey locks.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  The proceedings of Thanksgiving day, the illumination &c. was in the Mountaineer this morning, as also your speech.  The only news I know is, that Jane Walker is to be married in a few weeks to Mr. Gourdin.  Margaret Croft is making her clothes.  I long to see you.  Willie has not yet got head, & the boys know if he gets up, he wont get down again, so they study hard, but I tell him I know he will get up soon.  Frank Hoke has lost his ball for�so Willie says you must bring him another.  Write me all the news.  I have litterally nothing to write about, & no materials for writing, such shabby paper, & bad writing.  You will hardly care to receive the letter, & my gold pen will hardly make a mark, the Ink is so think.  You ought not to insist on my writing every Mail, & sitting so steadily to write disagrees with me entirely.  I must now conclude hoping this letter will at any rate be the means of preventing your having any anxious feelings about us.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
