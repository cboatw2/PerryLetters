Letter 31

Monday morning, 4 December 1843
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you this morning by Col. Townes, & it was only doubly welcome from having received one last night, for like the drunkard & his glass, getting one letter only makes wish for another.  I have now three letters of yours to answer. If you know what pleasure they give me, you will feel yourself well repaid for writing them.

	Since writing the above I have been out to shop with Susan.  I have now eat[en] dinner & will go on with my letter.  You must not be uneasy when you do not hear from me, but conclude that I have been very busy, & have nothing to write about.  Anna�s arm is getting better.  It does not seem to have given her much pain.  It was a bad burn, but not very bad.  I have been obliged to send Willy out of the bed into the crib.  We were so crowded, that if we moved in the least we would strike each other, & little Frank was in great danger.

	Willy is delighted at the presents you have bought him.  You must do as you think best about the horse.  I do not know what to advise you.  The Camera Obscura must be very pretty.  I am glad you have sent some oranges to Ann.  She is pleased at being remembered.  Susan says she liked the Cocoa nut you bought last year very much.  So you had better bring her two or three & if you see any presents pretty & reasonable for Susan & herself I would like you to bring them, or at any rate one for Ann.  It is not like the value of the present, but the remembrance that I like, so you need not bring anything costly.  Mr. Mauldin has some pretty prayer books for $1.25.  I wish you to give one of them to Susan at Christmas as a present, but if you were to see a very pretty one at that price, you might buy it for me instead of Mr. Mauldins, but not a cent more must you give.  Susan says Ann wants you to buy her some good Lavender water.  You know it is to smell.  I hope the watches will keep good time.  I will be careful of mine in future.

	I am sorry you have been obliged to sacrifice your Rail Road stock, as it was in reality worth 1500 dollars.  You have lost 540 dollars.  I am glad however that you can pay your debts.  I hope next year as you will be�that you will be able to support your family, invest 1000 dollars profitably, & pay a visit to Washington.

	Mr. Foster has sent 52 barrels of corn.  I hope you will pay for it as soon as you return.  I gave John your message this morning.  He thanked you & seemed pleased to hear of his son.  I hope you will see Thomas & bring a letter from him when you return.  I believe John did not live happily with his first wife & you know coloured persons seem to have a right to many wives. If they are separated from one, they console themselves with another.  I dare say George has found a helpmate in Columbia long since.  Have you seen him?  He ought to send a present by you  to his wife.

	I received a letter from Pamela last night, who said she had not been able to invite before.  Her Mother arrived as she was about finishing her letter with Mrs. Yancey�s two children.  She left Mrs. Yancey in a critical situation with a third attack of bleeding at the lungs.  She is too sick to think of any removal during the winter & too feeble to have her children with her.  Pamela says she feels her solitude more than ever, that her head & eyes are so weak she is not able to occupy herself as she used to, that she has often wished for me to be with her.  It was an affectionate letter.  I will answer it this week.  I wish you would pass a night with them on your way home.  You would then see Mrs. Cunningham who you have not seen for such a long time, & Pamela to will be there as I expect she will not go to town until Mrs. Croft goes.  Mr. Hayne has sent one of Mr. James G. Holmes Therapeutic chairs to Ann which she finds a great comfort.  Indeed if she had it not, Susan says she would have been obliged to have been held constantly by Mamma or herself.  It can be rolled all over the house.  You can lay down in it, or sit up, & has a place for the feet.  Susan says it is a delightful chair even for a well person, that it cost twenty dollars but looks as if it were worth a great deal more. 
  
	This is Sale day.  I have never seen so many persons in the village.  We have had very bad weather.  Today is almost the first good day we have had since you left.  The streets are very muddy.  Some reviews have come the Westminster & Quarterly, & a letter from Mr. Fabers agent, Mr. Matthews.  He says Mrs. Faber will take 2000 dollars for the house clear of all expenses, & that you must not forget the Furniture; that you can have it valued by two disinterested persons & sold separately or to the person who buys the house.  You would think such a rich lady as Mrs. Faber would forget the little Furniture she has in Greenville, but she remembers it & is afraid you will forget it.  I wish you would have it valued, & take out your fee in furniture, for I would like very much to have the Wardrobe, some chairs, looking glass &c.    

	I am glad you bought a new hat.  You must bring your old one home, & also another that I think you left in Columbia once.  Your hatter can alter them to fit himself & James.  You ought to have sent them by Col. Townes or Mr. Ward.  I hope you did not wear your new cloak in the rain to the Post office.  My letter was not worth the wetting yourself & cloak & risking a cold likewise, & now that I think of cold, you must gratify me & get something to cover that spot on your head, that will feel the cold so much this winter.   When persons say you look young, they do not see the back of your head & think how young you look, considering you are so old as to be bald headed.

,	Mamma has just sent word by Sarah Gridley, that I must give her love to you.  I think with Mr. Pettigru that there are a poor set of Candidates for Judge.  The country little know what I have deprived them of.  If it had not been for me, you would now be Judge or one of the greatest Statesmen of the day.  You ought to be President of the United States.  The best President you would make, we have ever had.  But I hope you are happy & that it is all ordered for the best.  Let us be economical & now put up money, & in time you may go to Congress.  The country would be better if it had your good Judgment to assist in directing its affairs.  

	I repeat, you must not be uneasy when you do not hear from me.  Your letters give me great pleasure.  I must take Frank so adieu my dear husband.  E.F.P.

Willy thanks you for his presents.  How large is the horse you think of bringing.  Can you not describe it exactly.
