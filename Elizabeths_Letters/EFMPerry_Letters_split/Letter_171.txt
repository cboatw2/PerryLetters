Letter 171

		Monday [Wednesday].  The weather is still cold.  Russel Middleton used to be a particular friend of Mamma�s.  His Mother & his Aunt Mrs. Dehon were both intimate friends of Mamma�s.  We staid in the country at his Fathers once, & he was from a child good & pious.  Mr. Hutson is some kind of cousin of ours, related to the Colcocks.  Mr. Burnett we knew at N. Haven, also Nat Heyward we knew there.  He & his mother are our cousins.  I am very sorry cousin Frederick Ford was defeated.  He is good & poor.  There is not a particle of news to tell you beyond Miss Lewis wedding.  I�, even the Mrs. Gowers, who Mrs. Arthur does not visit which makes it more accountable Susan�s not being; from this time we will all certainly have very little to do with them.  Christians so calling themselves have certainly less of kindness, charity & love than any others, but they are not Christians & have no right to the cause.  Today I suppose you will speak, & I pray may have some effect & present your state�herself.  I hope your resolutions will be adopted.  E.F.P.
