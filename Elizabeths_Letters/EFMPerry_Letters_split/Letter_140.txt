Letter 140

Monday night, 26 November 1849
Greenville

My dear husband

	I write to you by Mr. Elford who left yesterday so I did not intend writing by tonights Mail, but I heard something today that worries me & until I communicate it to you I will not feel at ease, so I will send my letter by someone who is going in the Stage tonight.  Yesterday at the Church door, Mr. E� Jones handed me out of the carri[a]ge, & he said he was obliged to go to Columbia, & was sorry he had not gone before the weather became bad.  Ann today said he was Candidate for Solicitor in place of Genl Whitner.  I hardly think he has the presumption to oppose Genl Whitner, so the thought has struck me perhaps Genl Whitner is going to resign.  If so, you are the one to take his place.  You once said Mr. Young would, but I wish you to think of it, if Genl Whitner is not a Candidate, for you deserve the place, & it is a stepping stone to a seat on the bench, so if there are to be new Candidates, do you think of it,  for as you are so well known to the Members you would stand a good chance; so I have now relieved myself, & if I had not I would not have slept well tonight, if I was worried & you are not here to console me, I am kept awake to recollect if Genl Whitner is going to give up, as I think he must be, do you offer, if you think you would be elected, & I know you would be.  I believe the Legislature would elect you to anything you offered.  It is only the ignorant people that will not.  I long to hear how Willie is coming on.  I went for Anna yesterday at Mrs. Town[e]s.  She had spent her time quite pleasantly.  Mr. Town[e]s is going to spend the winter in Florida, & if his prospects are good, come back to his family in the Spring.  Mrs. Town[e]s says she is very lonely.  I went this evening with Mrs. Dr. Williams to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Anna Williams goes to Columbia in the Stage tonight, to take in work, & improve herself, as a Mantua Maker.  She says she is poor, & has her children to support & educate, & must do something to enable her to.  Dr. Irvine also goes, by whom I will send this letter.  Mamma Susan & Ann paid me a visit today.  I expect they will dine with me Wednesday.  The horses will go on ploughing tomorrow.  It rained yesterday afternoon & last night.  The household are all well.  Miss Vance is to be married Thursday night.  I repeat if you do not see anything you think I will like as a warm covering for the Winter as a Shawl�or so forth, do not get me anything.  Frank goes to school & makes no objection.  No letters came for you last night.  Tell Willie I hope he has been a good boy, & I am anxiously waiting for a letter from him.  I wrote today to Eliza & told her Willie had gone with you.  I must now close so as to send my letter to Dr. Jones before he goes to bed.  Yours affectionately, E.F.P.
P.S. Get Willie all that is necessary to make him look genteel.  I expect to see you quite renovated.  I always wished you to be Solicitor, when Genl Whitner gave up.  You deserve it, & then the salary the Solicitor gets every year, for going to Columbia is somet[h]ing, & now Law business is getting scarce, you ought to think of something  to add to your income.  I think there must be some mistake, if Genl. Whitner has no intention of giving up, but if he has, no doubt Mr. Jones would be a Candidate.
