Letter 23

Sunday night, 27 November [1842]
[Greenville]

My dear husband

	According to promise I take up my pen to write you a few lines.  The children have just gone to sleep.  They are both upstairs, & I hope will sleep soundly until I have finished my letter.  I neglected getting from you good pens & paper, so my first letter will present to the eye very little to boast of.  Tomorrow I will provide myself with better materials from Mr. Nicol, & you must make many apologies for this one.

	The children are both well, & behave pretty well.  I asked Will at supper what I should tell you for him.  He said, Tell Pa to buy me a horse, & that I have been a good boy.  There was no service this afternoon at the Episcopal church, so I let Delia go out, & took charge of the children myself.  I amused Willy by telling him stories about the pictures in his book, & he seemed very much interested.  Anna in the meanwhile walked about tearing up paper, snatching every now & then at Willy�s book, & busying herself in various ways, & looked so sweet & healthy, that I wished you were here to admire her.  

	I heard this morning Mr. Pinckney�s fifth sermon on the Millenium.  It was an interesting one.  He gave no reason for not preaching this afternoon.  I saw Mrs. Sam Earle at church.  She is now staying with her mother.  She said she intends coming to see me tomorrow.  She rode home in the carri[a]ge with Susan & myself.  Her mothers carri[a]ge was full.  She said she was sorry you are not a member of the Legislature & that she heard a great many regret you did not offer.  You may be sure I agreed with her. For I will never cease to regret your refusing to be a member.  If you have any regard for me you must offer for the senate the next time.  I am sure you could beat any one man in the district, though you do not stand so good a chance when four are to be elected, & for the senate you will have the trouble of electioneering but once in four years.  Mrs. Earle said her mother since she had seen Willy in church was almost crazy about him.  She thought him so beautiful, & now quite abused her child  because Willy was so much prettier than him; that until her Mother saw Willy, she had thought her child quite pretty.  Susan slept here last night.  She had been so much disturbed the previous night on account of Ann, that she wished to have a good nights rest, to enable her to sit up tonight & relieve Mamma.  They think Ann suffers as much, if not more than she ever has done, & they are constantly witnessing her sufferings.  Now I feel greatly for Ann, but I cannot realize how she suffers, for I am not in the house with her & do not see her at the time she suffers the most but I know she is a great sufferer.  Last night was the seventh night she had not slept.

	Aunt Eliza in her last letter requested Mamma to invite you & myself to pay her a visit this winter, that she would be very happy to have us with her.  She says nothing but Mr. Hayne�s desperate  situation would induce him to offer for an office, & that she will feel bitterly his defeat, that she thinks his few real friends & they are few indeed will exert themselves greatly.  I really think my dear husband you might do something for him.  You might ask Mr. Johnson, Mr. Cox, Mr. Earle to make Mr. Hayne at any rate their second choice.  I would be gratified at your doing something for him.

       	Judge Earle the morning he left authorized Mr. Choice to give George a ticket to look out for an owner for himself at 300 dollars until Thursday.  Mamma is strongly inclined to purchase him & I have advised her to, but she does not like to take so important a step without consulting you.  What a pity Judge Earle did not come to this determination before you left.  George seems suddenly to have acquired the use of his limbs & looks quite well.  He says he will give up drinking &Mamma can supply him with Tobacco (she says).  She will only lose 18 or 21 dollars interest a year, & that is not as much as she pays now for the hire of an additional servant.  George can work well for 10 or 15 years at least, & when he is too old to work, the expense of supporting him will not be much. He is very anxious Mamma would purchase him.  He dislikes leaving Greenville & his wife.  All to whom he has applied say they would like if they could to own him very much, that he can do everything so well.  You know we have never had proof of his being dishonest.  We have only suspected him.  With Mamma he would be out of the village, away from temptation, & John who is perfectly honest would be a guard upon him & himself has the superintendence of the Stable & Crib. So that George [if] he is dishonest would not have it in his power to be dishonest as he had here & when Mr. Croft takes home Rachel he can cook for Minerva & he can cut up wood, & keep the garden & whole place in such good order.  If Mamma thought you would approve of it, she would buy him instantly, & she wishes she could hear from you before George leaves but as no one is authorized to detain him longer than Tuesday he will have to go, but if you approve of the purchase, she wishes you to ask Judge Earle to let George return to Greenville & she will be his purchaser.  If Judge Earle has a kind heart he will certainly consent, if it is only on account of George�s wife, but not being himself a husband, perhaps he will have no sympathy on that point.  But I really think it is cruel to treat a man at George�s time of life in that way, now that he is in Greenville & former connexions, he ought to be allowed to remain for the rest of his life, & not for a hundred or 2 dollars carried to a strange place, separated from his wife, and perhaps be unhappy for the remainder of his existence.  Perhaps to have gai.. my cause I ought to have been less warm, & taken less interest in the subject, for now from obstinacy you will take the other[word obscured by repair tissue]advise Mamma not to buy him & refuse to say anything to Judge Earle but I request you to consider the subject well.  I am certain you will come to the conclusion to request Judge Earle to send George back to Greenville & let Mamma become his owner.  He servants have done quite well except Eliza one day[word obscured by tissue repair]me a little, but if she behaves well the remainder of your absence she need not forfeit her present.  I miss you of course but do not be anxious about me or hurry back on my account.  Stay as long as you ought.  Write me all the news.  I am ashamed of my letter.  If I thought it would get safe I would send it by George, but I afraid he might not find you.  My next shall be more creditable.  I have no news to tell.  I wrote more than I intended on this last page & have had to cut the sheet longer than I purposed�have therefore spaces left at the bottom of these pages & not room enough on this page.  I have been reading an account of Colts suicide.  What a warning his fate brought on by his own conduct, ought to be to others.  Mr. Simms ought to make it the foundation of a novel.  Good night.  Ever your affectionate wife, E.F.P.
