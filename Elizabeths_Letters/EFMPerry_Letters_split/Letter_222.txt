Letter 222

Thursday, 1 oclock, 9 December 1852

My dear husband

	I received a letter from you today, for which I am very thankful, for yesterday I did not hear & was getting uneasy.  I am pleased at your being made the heroe of the Poem at College Commencement.  You must get a copy of it for me to read, & publish it in the Patriot.

	I am sorry for poor Mr. Mauldin.  Is he really deranged or miserable from taking opium.  He seems too conscious to be altogether deranged & to be out in the Asylum. But I may be mistaken.  An old lady named Mrs. Wiliams who sells Butter was here yesterday & seemed to think that the whole family drank, says the Father was a dreadful man, & never drew a sober breath, & at last shot himself, that several brothers killed themselves drinking, & insinuating that all the brothers living drank, but I think this latter suspicion is not true, so only mention it to you.  

	Mr. Easley was to have been married last night to Miss Sloan of Pendleton.  I hope he will now have trouble enough at home to keep him from troubling others.  Mr. Joab Mauldin is to be married tonight.

	The Collegiates must have acted very badly at the Commencement ball.  The Ladies were not rewarded for going so far to attend a Ball.

	Mrs. Barclay was rather forward I think.  I heard Mr. Barclay had left her, & she had to take in work.  I did not know he was dead.  She is a northern lady.

	 I received a letter from Anna today.  She is well & enjoying herself very much she says.  I wrote to Aunt Eliza that Mr. Elford would be a good opportunity for her to come up, that she would be long enough in town to see all her friends, & not too long to inconvenience her.  Aunt Eliza�s letter about her was gratifying.  Aunt Anna Turnbull wrote word that Anna was so much altered & improved since her former visit, that if she had entered the room alone, she would not have recognized her, that she thought her quite pretty, & she was sociable.

	Last night it commenced raining, & today is gloomy & drizzling.  I rode to Mrs. Stokes yesterday to know if she had engaged her Butter to me, as her servant had said, & Mrs. Stokes said yes.  The road was so bad.  I thought of your journey home, & I am afraid you will find the roads after so much rain dreadful.  You must consider whether it will be best for you to come in the Stage or have the carri[a]ge sent for you.  If you come in the carri[a]ge you had best if you have heavy baggage send it in the Stage to make the load lighter for the horses.  If you feel quite well, the Stage journey perhaps will be best.  You will come quicker & save your horses, which the bad roads may injure, as they have heretofore.  

	My dear husband I think with you that our happiness depends a good deal on ourselves, but some persons have much more to make them happy than others.  I don�t think Mrs. Mauldin now can be happy.  We who are so blessed in each other, may talk of happiness, but I can mention numbers who I should think were only miserable.

	Frank at last has holiday.  His school broke up yesterday.  Willie & himself cut wood, not a very elevating employment, but very useful.  Fanny & Hext are quite well.  

	Mr. Lasly paid me a visit yesterday to consult about his house, says he will finish planting Wheat, cut logs, & commence raising the house when you return.  Dinner is now ready, so I will have to stop. I was very busy, so could not write as soon as usual.  I will write again tomorrow, & hope to hear from you again.  I want if possible to write to Anna after dinner.

	I know of no news to tell you.  I read the Patriot yesterday, was sorry you had not written on to a later date, later than you had written to me.  I think the last anecdote might have been left out, but perhaps it would please some tastes.

	 I have now done dinner.  Becky this far does well, works well, & makes the servants happy.  I hope we will find her a comfort.  The prayer meetings I hope will have a good influence on the servants.  I have not time to read over my letter.  I am so anxious to send it to the Post office in time.  Yours truly, E.F.P.
