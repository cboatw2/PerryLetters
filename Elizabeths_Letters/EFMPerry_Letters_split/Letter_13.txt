Letter 13

Sunday night, 13 December 1840
Greenville   

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you, and it has given me such pleasure that I cannot rest until I have expressed it to you.  I read the Cheraw paper before I opened your letter.  I know from your sending it, that it contained something complimentary to yourself, and I am very much pleased with it.  The description is so correct, and I am glad to find that you are appreciated by some at last.  Oh if you only lived among the intelligent and refined how much you would be valued.  I am grieved to think that if you were a Candidate another year, you might not even be elected; you who ought to be considered an honour to your district.  I wish you would write word to have that peice published in the Mountaineer that it may open the eyes of your Constituents.  What a discriminating man Col. Dudley is.  I like him very much, & have the highest opinion of his judgement.  He was right in putting you at the head of all.  Perhaps he has the same opinion of you as Mr. Luther McBee thinks I have.  The other evening at Mrs. Croft�s, he said to me, �Why Mrs. Perry thinks there is nobody equal to Major Perry.�  Without my intending it, he discovered my real opinion of you.  By the way I wish to tell you  that I like some of the Whigs very much, & he among them, as I wish you to be just, liberal & honourable towards them.  I wish I had given you this advice at first, but I hope you have acted upon it from your own high sense of justice & honour.  Mr. Adams is a particular friend of Mamma�s; though like Mr. Rhett, from not being in the same place. They have not seen much of each other lately.  The acquaintance commenced in New Haven. 

	I am delighted to hear that you have made such a triumphant speech.  I wish I could have heard it.  I hope to have that pleasure some day.  You ought to send a great many of that Cheraw paper to your constituents, that they may see what you really are.  I am much comforted to find that you have only followed the last & best part of my advice.  I was quite worried to think that from the high opinion you had of me, you might be influenced by me, contrary to your own judgement.  I am glad to find that you had a higher opinion of yourself.  My only advice to you now, for I cant help giving some,  is to be just, liberal , & honourable to all parties; not to be influenced by party spirit.  For all parties are alike.  There are good & bad ones  among all, & the next political subject that comes up, you do not know  who you will be thrown amongst; perhaps the very ones you now oppose, so that ought to make a man moderate, liberal, just & honourable.  But you know all this as well as I do & better too.  I am going out of my proper sphere. But I was afraid you might be unjust to the Whigs because you thought I disliked them very much, & I wish you to understand that you must act well towards them in the legislature whenever you think proper.  To conc[ink blotted] do as you think best.  

	You must not bring Mamma an expensive Butter Knife.  You cant afford it.  You must bring a plain one.  Susans & Anns presents have cost so much, that you ought not to spend much on the butter knife.  Mamma would not care for such an extraordinary handsome one.  Ours were very pretty.   Susan & Ann are very much pleased & say they will keep the presents in remembrance of you as long as they live.  I am afraid the knives & spoons you have bought are too pretty, through I should judge they were reasonable.  I must take care next year to have some nice pickles to bring the pickle knives into notice.  They will then be quite useful.  [ink blotted] recollect that children of Will�s age wear pretty little cloth caps of various [ink blotted] ; perhaps you may see one that may suit him, & it will look better for winter than a straw hat; not a fur cap, but a cloth cap so you may display your taste in selecting him one; a pretty little cloth cap suitable for his age & size.  I have seen velvet ones also, but they perhaps might look too fine.  I leave it to your taste, but if you do not see a pretty suitable one, then bring him a Fathers love, & it will be as acceptable to him I am sure as anything else.  The other day Dr. Crook was here.  Will went to him, but did not take him for you again, so tell Mr. Burt on a nearer�to him, Will finds there is not the least likeness  between Dr, Crook & his Papa.  I am certain he will recognize you, but I long to have the opportunity of seeing the recognition.  I do not think the Legislature will adjourn the 18th as they generally fix on one day, & afterwards upon another a few days later.  Mind do not leave as usual beforehand..  Write word if they change when I must expect you.  I hope you will go to see Aunt Brewton; indeed you must.

	I am glad I was mistaken in thinking Mr. Rhett had thought there was any interruption to the friendship  that existed between our families.  I was afraid he must have thought us ungrateful.  I always liked him very much, & am glad you have become acquainted with him.  I see by the papers Col. Richardson is elected & am very much pleased at it.  It was not at all a close a[word obscured by tissue repair].  It is quite late.  I will stop for the present & finish my letter tomorrow.

Monday.  I will have time only to close my letter.  I am very busy.  Margaret is here finishing Susans dress.  She disappointed us last week.  Susan is sick with a bad headache, so I have to take her place & have not a moment to spare.  What has become of the Fee bill?   I hope you will alter it before you come home & satisfy the people.  Do not buy Will a cap, unless you see a reasonable suitable pretty one.  If you do not see one of this description, I will make him one.  Remember do not bring any unless it is pretty.

	I will write again to you by the next Mail.  Miss Harrisons wedding is put off until the 19th.  Mr. Hoke will be here Wednesday night.  Mr. Croft leaves Thursday morning.  He took tea there Susan & myself Friday night & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mrs. Smeddons family, Mrs. Marant, Miss McBee, Mr. McBee, Mrs. Carson, Mr. & Mrs. Beattie & Mr. Hamlin were there.

	You ought to send a Cheraw paper to your Father & mother & a great many to Greenville.  Do send one to Mrs. Dr. Butler?  I have a great mind to cut out the peice that relates to you & send it to her by Mamma.  When she returns her visit as she intends to do this week I wish her to see who it is she presumes to insult & whether such a man would be great afflicted at her[word obscured by tissue repair] to speak to him.  She really thought herself a great consequence.

	I must tell you of an incidence that has occurred that will surprise you.  One of the Shoults you put up in the pen to fatten & kill that we might eat, a few days ago had four pigs.  John did not discover it until two of the pigs were eaten up.  He then let out the Sou & the remaining pigs.  I am waiting to kill until you return.  The one hog we killed we have been living upon.  Together with some beef I bought, we have felt no want of meat.

	Do if you think of it inquire the price of plated cake baskets.  I do not wish any at present, but when you can afford it, the next thing I would wish you to buy for the house, I think would be that.  I would only wish to know the price.  In Charleston I have seen them for 10 dollars a peice, but in Columbia I would expect they would be much more expensive.  You must have spent a great deal in the things you have bought.  But I think they were all reasonable.  Yours truly, E.F.P.  I have written you in such a hurry I scarcely know what I have said.
