Letter 13

Sunday morning, 6 December 1840
Greenville

My dear husband

	I am alone & disengaged, therefore will take this opportunity of writing to you.  Mr. Pinckney being away there is no service at his church, and Mr. Croft proposed reading the services and a sermon, at his house and inviting a few friends to join with him.  He invited all of us to attend and to pass the remainder of the day with them.  Mamma Susan & Ann have gone.  I have remained at home with Willy.  This latter personage I have just dispatched to the kitchen with Delia, that I may have a little quiet to enable me to write to you.  The weather is quite gloomy.  It snowed last night & the sun has not shone today.  For a few days past we have had considerable rain. 

	I have been reading for a few days past, �The Young Lady�s Friend�.  I think it a valuable book, & will take many useful hints from it.  It recommends Mrs. Hamiltons �Letters on the Elementary Principle of Education,� and �Hints on Nursery Discipline.�  The first I have often heard highly spoken of, and the latter, the Author says, is a valuable little book.  If you can find them I would like you to buy them for me.  They may assist me in bringing up Willy well.

	I hope you are against Mr. Henry�s resolutions.  I think the Legislature has no right to instruct Senators.  If they elect them, they ought to let them act as they think best; if they disapprove of their conduct, they need not elect them again.  I am sorry you introduced the Resolution to vote for VanBuren & Johnson as only half the resolution was adopted, & it will just get you into trouble for nothing.  It will make you more unpopular with the Whigs.  You had much better have let someone,  who has not such fault finding constituents as you have, or whose constituents have not such high opinions of themselves and more confidence in their representatives than yours have in you.  I hope you will not introduce the Penitentiary again.  It is of no use.  It is an unpopular subject, & will seem like obstinacy in you to be pressing it on the people.  A Penitentiary  wont do for this State at any rate at present.  The State cant afford it; it will be an expense.  There are not criminals enough to support one.  There are only two persons now in Greenville jail, & if the Penitentiary reforms society as you say it does, why then there will be fewer criminals than there are now.  There will be nobody to put in , & it will be a useless building.  After all the money expended on it, it will do where crime increases, not decreases.  Do don�t introduce the subject at pre�.  Some years hence will do.  The Rail road I expect is as great an embarrassment now as the state can bear.  I am sorry you did not introduce the Fee bill.  I told you not to let anyone get the start of you, but my dear I will stop giving advice.  I promised not to give anymore, & you are perfectly competent to judge for yourself.  I would not give you any if I thought you were influenced by it.  I only think by opening my mind to you, I may suggest some ideas that may not have occurred to you before.  I think your judgement perfect, & all others so imperfect that they generally think contrary to you, & that you know ought to be taken into consideration before you act.  I expect I am the most presuming wife there ever was, but you are the most indulgent of husbands.  Remember act as you think best, but I hope you are against Istruction (you are too noble & independent for that) (except from me).

	I forgot to tell you in my last letter when I requested you to buy the dozen large & dozen small knives without forks, to buy also a pair of Salt spoons.  We have but one, the other is broken.  If silver is expensive, buy Mother of Pearl.  They answer just as well, perhaps better, or buy any kind you think best.

	I am quite uneasy until I hear how your cold is; do take care of yourself.  I hope to get a letter from you this evening.  I sent James to Dr. Crook�s today to have a plaster put on his back.  The Doctor told me to send him.  He is better but not well yet.  I do not let him ride the horse.  John waters him.  The Doctor said he must keep quiet until he was quite well.  Mr. Hoke went to town Saturday morning.  He is to bring up the box from the Miss Seabrooks. A glass for Mamma�s picture &c.  He was very obliging, said he would do anything, if it was only put  down in writing, that he might remember better.  Mrs. McBee invited us all to tea Thursday night to meet Mrs. Croft.  Susan & Ann went & spent a pleasant evening.  I have not yet heard who is elected Commissioner in Equity. Mr. Townes or Mr. Butler.  I will stop writing for the present until I hear from you tonight.
