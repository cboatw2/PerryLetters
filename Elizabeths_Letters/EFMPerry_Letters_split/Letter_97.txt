Letter 97

Friday afternoon, 5 May 1848
Greenville

My dear husband

		I will according to promise, write you a few lines, though I have nothing to write about.  I have just written a letter to Eliza Hayne to send by Mr. Wells.  I have sent her money to buy me, �the Carolina Housewife,� so you need not buy it for me, nor either of the other books I gave you the list of.  Keep the list, as I do not wish to forget the Titles of the Books.  At some other time, I may get them, but not now.  I thought it best for Eliza to get �the Carolina Housewife,� because I was certain it could be got in Charleston, & in Columbia they may not have it.  Yesterday afternoon Mrs. Town[e]s & Mrs. Elford came to see me.  In the evening I got a note from Mamma saying Susan & Ann were both sick, Susan with dreadful headache, & she was very sorry, she had been unable to see you before you left.  This morning Jim came over & hoed a little in the garden, but I expect he could not do much.  He is not there now, perhaps he may have gone to the farm.  Today I let Lindy go with Charles to dross Corn.  She can go when it is necessary instead of hiring boys.  I have told Charles that any boy Jim hires, to send away.  We are not going to pay anything for hiring.  I sent the Peacocks & the Pigeons to the Farm. They are a good riddance, & if they cannot stay there, will have to�their exit out of this world.  This morning Mr. Littlejohn made his appearance.  He says he got here yesterday, two hours after you left.  He wished to know certainly when you would return, & to tell you what his business was, which ought to be commenced before the Equity Court sat, so I advised him to write to you, & gave him pen, ink, & paper, & he sat down in the Drawing room & wrote you a letter, & I sent it to the office for him.  The wind is now very high.  I hope you are making good use of your time, & wiping out the tracks very fast.  You are a person, that can accomplish anything you choose, & in this instance I believe it depends entirely upon yourself, whether you will be successful or not.  My opinion of you is such that I believe you cannot be seen & known, & then the vote cast in favor of one far your inferior.  The unfortunate reputation you have of being aristocratical, renders it absolutely necessary, that you should go among the people, & show them by your kindness & familiarity, that if you are aristocratical in appearance, you are not so in character.  It is�they should judge from appearance, for you know appearance indicates character.  
The truth is you are reserved, & reserved persons always appear proud.  Do not waste time in Columbia, but if you find your cases will not come on soon, return to Laurens & spend your time there to some purpose, or if your cases do come on next week & you will also be detained in Columbia part of the week following, arrange it, so you can return to Laurens to the Muster tomorrow week, & then return to Columbia.  You must not depend on your friends exertions for you.  There is no friend that you can depend on as you can on yourself.  Believe me it is yourself alone that will elect you.  Do all you can, & be thankful for what aid your friends give you.  I have no objection to their helping, but it is on you the chief burden rests.  Fanny is crawling over the floor.  Charlotte is now my principal servant in the house & to take care of Fanny Lindy helped Delia wash yesterday.  We have done without Mary pretty well, so if ever we need it, we can dispose of some of our servants, particularly as the young ones grow up.  So if your property increases in no other way, it does in the value of your servants.  I have no news or anything interesting to write you.  It is only a little more than a day since you [page torn].  Last night was our hottest night.  Today for the first time I think, we have had no fire built.  This is a bad season for providing, no vegetables, so you would not be from home at a better time.  If I do not write by the next Mail, it will be that I do not know whether you are in Columbia.  Mr. Wells leaves tonight in the stage.  Write me as often as you can, though I would not have writing to me, interfere with your other duties.  I have written fast without stopping once, & I have managed to fill up a letter with nothing.  I cannot think of any advice to give you except to try your best, for your Clients, & try to make the Laurens people your Constituents.  With best wishes for your success believe me.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.
