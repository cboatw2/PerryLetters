Letter 88

Sunday morning, 29 November [1846]
Charleston

My dear husband

	I have a few moments to spare before going to church this morning, so will devote them to you.  You must excuse my shabby looking letters, but I have no conveniences for writing.  The paper Aunt Harriet has given me, the pen & ink are Aunt Anna�s , & the pen very ba�.  I wrote to you yesterday, but I received such a pleasant letter from you last night, that I think it deserved an answer immediately.  I am delighted at what you tell me of your prospects of being a Judge.  Even if Judge Oneal [O�Neall] is not elected, you must try for the vacancy created by Chancellor Johnson, if there is the�prospect of your succeeding.  Your claims you must press, for you have as many claims as any of the Candidates I have heard mentioned.  I would much prefer you should be Judge, than President of the Bank, for the former is an office for life, & more respectable than any other, & with a stated income coming in regularly, & with no trouble to get it, we can put up something every year.  So whenever you think you can be elected you must try for it, for I think it is an office you must desire.  Your judgement is good & I depend on you  for doing what is right.  All I say is, then if there is a probability of your being elected, you must try for it.  Law business is getting scarce now, & the bench would be a most desirable place for you, & I am sure you would do honor to it.
