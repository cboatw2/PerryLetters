Letter 2

	Thursday morning you will be here, and I assure you, you return to a wife who loves you, she loves the husband who now returns to her, more than the lover she greeted last year.

	Mamma and Susan are waiting for me to go out with them.  This is my excuse for a short letter.  Excuse the paper on which I have written.  If you are as interesting as you were last year, it is unnecessary to make an apology.

	Last night was most tempestuous, yet today is�.  Uncle Wm is married last Tuesday in the country.  Believe me, Yours very affectionately, E.F.P.
