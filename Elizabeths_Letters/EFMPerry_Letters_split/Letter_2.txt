Letter 2

18 December [1837]
Charleston

My dear Sir

	I received a letter from you yesterday and answered it immediately, but in reading my answer today, I am not altogether pleased with it, and have determined to write another.  In future  I will always send a letter the day I write it, for if you keep it any time, and read it over often, you find so many errors to correct, that you are not satisfied, and in the end 
destroy it.

	I was as usual very happy to hear from you.  When deprived of your presence, my greatest pleasure is to hear as often as I can, that you are well, happy and enjoying yourself.

	I am sorry my supposed neglect has been the occasion of ruffling your good temper, but I do not think I have neglected you.  I have not only answered all of your letters but written others besides, which now I am very sorry I sent, as you thought me unkind, and your feelings were hurt.

	Never mention that word purchases to me.  I am sick and tired of it.  If I have been unkind, and neglected you, that has been the occasion of it.  If you have reproached me, that word has occasioned your reproaches.  This is the last letter I am to write to you, and I expect to receive but one more from you.

	Thursday morning you will be here, and I assure you, you return to a wife who loves you, she loves the husband who now returns to her, more than the lover she greeted last year.

	Mamma and Susan are waiting for me to go out with them.  This is my excuse for a short letter.  Excuse the paper on which I have written.  If you are as interesting as you were last year, it is unnecessary to make an apology.

	Last night was most tempestuous, yet today is�.  Uncle Wm is married last Tuesday in the country.  Believe me, Yours very affectionately, E.F.P.
