Letter 4

Sunday afternoon, 1 December 1839
Greenville

My dear husband

	Having rained the whole week, the walking is so bad, I have not been able to go to church today, and as the baby is quiet with Delia, and I am now at leisure, I think I cannot spend a part of the day better than in writing to you, particularly as I this morning read the Services for the day, and one of Bradley�s good sermons, so my conscience acquits me.

	I hope this letter will arrive in time to prevent your doing what has worried me since I received your last.  Buy a Rattle for the baby at $6.50!  My husband, how could you think of such a thing when I told you to buy a Rattle.  I meant a common Straw one, such as I have seen for 25 cts or 50 cts at furthest.  If we were rich, and had money to throw away, I would not spend such a sum on a�to be and you to buy a Rattle for $6.50.  If you had the money to spare, and had got something useful, or entertaining, such as a Waggon for him, or a Musical box for me, I would have no objection, but to give so large a sum for a handsome toy, when you could have got a common one, for little or nothing, to answer the same purpose. Is what provokes me.  I think it an actual sin to spend money in such a way, and can hardly think you have done it.  If you have, do I beseech you carry the Rattle back to the Jeweller, and get him to exchange it for something more useful or interesting.  If you can think of nothing else, a Musical Box, if it does not cost more than $6.50, which you know I always said when we  had money to spare I would like to have, but if you can think of anything more useful get it.  Do not keep the Rattle.  The bell I bought the other day for 37 ? cts will answer the same purpose.  For once get over your scruples about changing your mind, and exchange the Rattle, the prettier it is, the more loth I would be to put it in a baby�s hand.  The little Waggon I would like to have above all things.  That would be indeed useful.  Willie should ride in it every day.  If you have no other way of getting it home, you must box it up and bring it in the Stage.  I would deny myself of anything to get it for Willie.  Riding will be such an amusement for him.  I will be disappointed if you do not get him the waggon, and truly grieved if you bring home the Rattle.  I do hope you have not bought it, or if bought it, that you will exchange it.  In this instance my dear husband please your Wife.

	Your letters with that one exception, have given me much pleasure.  I would like to hear every Mail, if writing to me does not interfere with your other business.  You have seen Professor Lieber.  Robert says he has a Wife, that himself, his wife and son, have been at his father�s house. A �refresher� in Mr. Alston�s case would be very acceptable, and cause you to be indebted to the settlers on Paris Mountain.  Judge Butler�s reason for liking you was a very good one.

	I have not been out of the house since you left.  It has rained every day until today, the Sun is shining beautifully, but the ground is wet.  Mr. Townes has a son.  Minerva says she heard it is so small it can get in a quart cup, that it must have been born prematurely.  I do not know that this is correct.  I only heard it from Minerva.  Mrs. Sloane is to move into Mr. Roberts� house next week.  Roberts left yesterday morning.  He has been to see me twice every day since you left, after breakfast, and at supper.   When he bid me good bye, he said, �he was much obliged to you and me for our kindness to him.�  I sent by him the box your recollect Aunt Elizabeth Hayne left with me.  I put in it a pin cushion apiece for Susan and Ann; a little Shoe for Susan Hayne;�box I filled up with eatables for Robert.  I have finished making Delia�s Calico dress.  It is made as nicely as Margaret could have made it.  She looks so improved in it you would hardly know her.  I am afraid Willy even feels strangely in her arms.  This last mentioned personage is now asleep in the cradle.  May he have a long nap.  I love him more and more every day.  He increases in interest daily.

	I think I may get a letter from you this evening, so will stop writing, as I may wish to add a little more tonight.
