Letter 58

Wednesday morning, 6 May 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have taken my seat in the library, to perform my promise of writing to you by tonights Mail.  You have left here so recently that of course I have nothing to tell you.  I have not been anywhere, & have seen no one.  We are all well.  Mary worked all day in the garden yesterday, & hoed all of the beds.  She made great havoc among the strawberries, Edward & herself, for in the morning, I observed a great many almost ripe, & in the evening, I could discover not one.  Today I have sent her to the farm, & will let her remain there the rest of the week, without coming home at night, so that she can commence working early in the morning.  Today Delia will finish ironing, & tomorrow go on with the garden.  Eliza is still at Mamma�s .  This is the third day she has been there.  March took the Mare to the farm yesterday, but left it at home today, said they had no use for it there.  I was downstairs this morning by half past 5 oclock.  I was in the garden, & worked an hour until 6, when we had breakfast.  The house was all fixed & dinner given out by 8 oclock.  So you see how industrious I am.  I think I will earn the use of the horses on Saturday  I sent the money to Mamma yesterday.  She wrote word she was very glad to have it.  Susan�s headache was better, & she says she will stay with me before she goes back to the Factory.  As I told you, I have nothing to write about, & I am very busy, have a whole basket of clothes to mend, besides other work.  I do not expect to write to you again until Monday, when I will answer the letter, I hope to receive from you Sunday night; so unless I have something in particular to write about, you will not hear from me again until Wednesday.  I hope & trust you will reach Columbia in safety this evening.  Take care of yourself, for the sake of your wife & children, to whom you are justly so dear, so important., gain as many cases as possible in the appeals Court, particularly try your best for Dr. Croft.  You have the measure of Willie�s head.  You know what kind of hat can be got for him in Greenville, so you can judge whether they are cheaper in Columbia.  I should think they would have a much better assortment there than here.  In general I like wide rims to keep off the wind, but I will leave it to your taste, to do as you think best.  The hat, the ball,� & books for Willie, & the India rubber for me, is all that I wish you to purchase at present.  The India rubber may be elastic, so as to cut in strips, to stretch & put between the teeth.  If you can afford it, perhaps you had better purchase a dozen small knives; our large ones are quite good, & we can do without a carving knife.  We have a good carving fork, so the dozen small knives is all that I care for, or that is necessary for you to get.  If you were to happen to see Mrs. Taylor, I really would be obliged to you if you would ask her to cut out for me & send me a picture of a suit of clothes such as boys of Willie�s age wear.  I believe I have told you all my wishes now.  I hope you may be able to get the money Mr. Chaplin owes you.  I wish you could pay your bookstore bill, but that I suppose is impossible.  I must now bid you adieu my dear husband, believe me as ever, Your truly attached wife, Liz
