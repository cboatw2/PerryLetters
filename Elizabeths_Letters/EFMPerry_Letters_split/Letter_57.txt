Letter 57

My dear husband

	I met Genl Thompson on the road yesterday as I was walking to Mamma�s, & he asked me what message he should give you at Pickens, if he should say we were all well.  I told him perhaps I would write a few lines, & he said he would call for them tomorrow.  The children are gone up to bed, & instead of passing the evening, reading or working, I will converse with you, & you must promise not to scold me once.
