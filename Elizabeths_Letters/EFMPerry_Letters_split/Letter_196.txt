Letter 196

Friday night ? past 7, 12 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received two letters from you. & though I wrote to you [to]day, I was so hurried, I wrote but a few lines, & as I have more leisure at night, than in the day, I will write to you now, instead of tomorrow.  If anything occurs tomorrow worth relating, I can write again.  I am truly sorry to hear you have been sick.   I will be very anxious until tomorrow night, when I hope to hear from you, that you are getting well.  If I do not hear, I will be very uneasy.  You ought to have attended to yourself long ago.  You have been so long threatened with sickness, you are too careless about you health when you know how important you are to your wife & children, sickness can often be kept off with a little care.  I had a headache day before yesterday.  I took a dose of Salts & Cream of Tartar, & it carried off my headache & did me good, & I feel now quite well.  If you had had the headache, I would have induced you to take medicine.  You would have left it to nature , & perhaps been sick in consequence.  Do write me every Mail, & keep me informed of your health.  I will be very anxious to hear every night of your welfare.  Sunday I was able to write you but a line, but I knew that line would be a comfort to you, so wrote it.  Mr. Elford has not written very lately to his family as they are uneasy about him.  If you have heard anything of him, write me that I may tell Mrs. Elford.  I sent tonight to the Printing office to tell them you received no papers now, & beg them to send you one of all hereafter published.  They sent word they thought you were receiving them.  They often send me 4 Tri weeklys.  I would easily have sent you one every Mail.  I have kept two of every paper.  I will send you the papers, whie you remain away, though I am thankful it will be only a few days now.  If the Legislature adjourns Tuesday, I will write you but once more.  You will get this letter Monday, & I will write on Sunday so you can hear Tuesday.  I hope & trust my next letter from you. will say you are quite well.  Do consult a Physician about your cold.  It ought to be cured at once.  You have trifled with it too long.

	This morning I went to see Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. Beattie, Mrs. Turpin, Mrs. Wm Roberts, Mrs. Crooks, & Mrs. Dr. Irvine, Mrs. Beattie was out, Mrs. Wm Roberts at Union, Mrs. Dr. Irvine sick, so I only saw her sister Miss McMahon.  This afternoon I went to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Yesterday I went to see Mrs. Dr. Williams.  Mrs. Brooks I was going to see, but met her in the road.  I went to see Mrs. Westfield.  So I am making now an effort to get through with my visits.  Everywhere I am greeted with a scold, for not having gone sooner.

	I met Mrs. Hopkins the Minister�s mother & Miss Hopkins the sister, at Mrs. Thompsons.  I have owed them a visit for years, & Mrs. Farr I also met there, & owe her a visit of long standing.  I like Mrs. Hopkins & her daughter much.  Miss Hopkins will make a good teacher for children.  Mr. Capers they say, lets the children play too much.  Mr. Gailliard is to have both boys & girls, which I disapprove of, so perhaps we had better send Anna to Mr. Hopkins.  It makes girls bold to go to a school with boys.  I think they should be kept at a respectful distance from each other.  

	None of us now have colds.  We are all well, & if you only are well, I will be thankful.  Going out at night does not agree with you.  When you return you must not go out at night.  The papers must be brought to you here.  It is the night air perhaps that has kept up your cold. 

	Mr. Wardell brought home the Sideboard today, done up beautifully, looks like new.  He was to ask $3.50 if I was not entirely pleased, 4 if I was, , so I gave him a Table to varnish, & said he must do that, & then I would give him 4, at least that you would give it, for I had not the money to give.  I had no idea I would need so much money when you left, , but the necessaries of a family amount to so much,  If the money spent was not put down, it would be impossible to believe that it was all gone.

	Mamma is very much pleased with Mrs. Pearsons servant.  She sent to ask Mr. Elford about her, before you left, but Mrs. Elford never sent an answer.  The servant was staying at Dr. Koch�s working for nothing.  When Mamma heard of her & took her at once, & strange to say, Mrs. Buice sent word today that she had engaged her, Maria says she never heard of it, & that she had looked all about for a place, & when she was at Dr. Koch�s so near Mrs. Buice, it is strange Mrs. Buice did not send for her.  I hope Mamma will be able to keep her.  Mrs. Williams says Dr. Koch beats his Wife & children, that the neighbors have to go in to prevent him.  Mrs. Turpin says he taught a young lady who staid there. & he begged her to pay in advance, which she did.  The whole 36 dollars she paid him.   He told me he taught Mrs. Turpin, but I expect it was a story.   He told me he�nothing at Dr. Turpins which surprised me.  Mrs. Turpin says, he wished Dr. Turpin to give him supper before anyone else, & that he was intoxicated.

	Anna says I must tell you, she is making a quilt for Hext, for his cradle, as a Christmas present.  How glad you will be to kiss little Hext again.  He eats bread & biscuits & sucks chicken bones & spareribs, & likes all these things better than nursing, except when he is sleepy. & at night, then nothing satisfies him but nursing.

	Miss Crittenden & Dr. Blackman are engaged I expect.  Anna told me she saw them pass yesterday locking arms, & she was looking up in his face & talking to him.  Genl Thompson is expected, but has not returned yet.  Mr. Jones I hear will keep the children, as I should suppose he would, for he has the best right to them.  Mrs. Genl Thompson is sick in bed.  Her sister is still with her.  One of Genl Thompsons fine horses, Willie says, he heard was dead.  Mr. Latta must be a kind old man.  Miss McMahan today, told me he was very kind.  Mrs. Latta she says passed through Greenville not long ago, on her way to Pendleton to see her son.  Mr. Latta has been married twice she says.  I wish the son had purchased here.  He would have been an acquisition.  Miss Lucy Brockman is engaged to Mr. Julius Earle.  Mrs. Young her sister, told Mrs. Henry Thompson so, & she is to be married soon.  The weather is now cooler, so I think there is no danger of the meat spoiling now.  

	I long to see you, & when you get safe home, you can remain here for four months, & when you leave I will go with you.  I believe though, the Circuit commences again in the Spring.  Take care of yourself for my sake.  Your dear Wife, E.F.P.
