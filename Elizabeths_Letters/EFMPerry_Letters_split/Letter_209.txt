Letter 209

Tuesday, quarter past 1, 23 November [1852]
Greenville

My dear daughter

	You only left yesterday, but I am certain your Paper will be gratified to hear from home as soon as he reaches Columbia, so I will write now, that you may hear the very moment you get there.  This letter will be travelling along the Rail Road the same time with yourself.  Little will you know of it, that there is a letter travelling along with you telling how we all are.  I am sorry you had such a bad day yesterday but am glad that today the weather is so fine.  I hope you are well & behaving well, & that your Papa feels better than when he left.  We are all the same, as we were yesterday morning.  I have been busy today helping Mary fix upstairs, which has been in great disorder for several weeks past.  I am now tired so thought I would rest & write to you.  You must tell me everything in your letters, who you see, what they say to you, how you enjoy yourself &c. &c.  I was gratified to see you display some feeling on leaving home, for though I wish you to enjoy yourself when you leave home, I wish you to be attached to home & prefer it to every place.  I hope & believe you will spend your time pleasantly.  Everything will be new to you.  If you can get a very pretty Silver comb in Columbia at a reasonable price, get it, but if not, wait until you get to Charleston.  After you have made all the purchases you need, write me word how much money you have left.  Your Papa had better give you 30 dollars.  Buy some Castile Soap to clean your teeth with the morning after you get to Columbia. I forgot to give you any; 6 cts worth is enough, & you will find it very useful.  It whitens the teeth, & cleans them easier in this cold weather, than the water alone.  I forgot to put up your Barege Sack,, & one nice pr of  fine tucked pantalets, I saw in your drawer today, which I ought to have packed up.  Do not forget the Castile Soap.  I am going to buy 3 peices this evening for each of the childrens room.

	Nothing more from the Post office this morning.  Fanny missed you yesterday & wished you were here.  Willie little while ago came from school with your bucket in his hand, grumbling that he had to bring it�Mrs. Hopkins called him in as he passed & begged him to bring it home.  I am glad it has been found.  Fannys shoes were broken, & as it was so wet I let her stay at home today.  Frank has gone to school.  Willie is now learning his lessons.  Fanny is seated on the floor putting on her stockings which  she had taken off.  Hext is in the little dining room playing with the�to the stove.  Charlotte has gone to Mrs. Mauldins to carry Mary Mauldins book mark & pocket handkerchief you left for her; the other book marks for Mr. & Mrs. Hopkins Fanny will carry tomorrow.  I have no news to tell.  Charles has gone to the Farm to get wood.  I have been busy cutting out clothes for the servants & helping make them, but I go to bed regularly at 9 oclock.

	I hope you will not have to stay long in Columbia.  As you have gone down so late, you will have but a short time to stay in Charleston.  

	I will write perhaps again tomorrow, but if I do not you may know I have nothing to write about.  Write to me & behave like a lady, & tell your Papa to write.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. This is the first letter I believe I have ever written to you.
