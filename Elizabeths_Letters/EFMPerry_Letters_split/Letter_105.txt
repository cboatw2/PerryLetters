Letter 105

Friday morning, 26 November 1847
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received your second letter Wednesday night, & was very much pleased to hear from you.  It would have been a great disappointment if Mary had returned from the office without a letter, for a letter from you now is the principal incident in our lives.  You say I must write if it is only to say we are all well.   I have not much more of interest now to tell you, so you must blame circumstances & not me, if you receive uninteresting letters.  I wrote you Monday.  I must now think of all that has happened since Tuesday & Wednesday.  It rained incessantly, so that Willie & Anna were obliged to stay from school, but they each said their lessons to me.  They are both smart children, & learn with great ease.  Willie learns now a history lesson every day.   Wednesday Jim killed the smallest hog.  He said the other hogs would kill it, if he did not.  They fought it constantly so I made no objection, & we now have some fresh meat to eat.  I sent a peice to Mamma .  It is very fat meat.  The weather has not continued long enough to kill all of the hogs.  Mr. Phillips has not sent any hams yet.   Wednesday Mr. Croft sent me some Packages from Pamela.  He had just returned, & had passed one night at Mrs. Cunningham�s on his return.  Pamela sent your books �Moultrie�s American Revolution,� �Drayton�s Memoir,� �Hallam�s Literature�.  She sent you a beautiful�& Mrs. Cunningham sent me a small book, called �Woman�s Mission.�  Pamela wrote me a letter.  They had but recently arrived at Rosemonte, & she had been sick with Chill & Fever.  She had intended going to the Lower Country this month, but as she had just reached home, she did not know now when she would go; perhaps not until the Spring, when she expected again to go to the Island.  The purse, she said she finished the very day Mr. Croft arrived.  She intended writing a note with it, but Mr. Croft was�so short of time, she was not able to, so I must present her kind regards & beg you to accept this simple offering of her conviction of your honesty & purity of purpose in public life, & whenever you looked at it in Washington (that den of corruption) it must serve to remind you that your fiends look to you on all occasions to display that love of Country, which disregards party interests & individual aggrandizement!  I wish I was as certain my dear husband that you will have the opportunity of so acting as she is.  I am afraid this Rail Road business will injure you greatly in Anderson, but even if it has injured you there, I know your first duty was to Greenville, therefore it cannot be.  I only hope Mr. Orr is as much injured in Laurens as you are in his District & that you are at any rate even, (but here comes the suggestion).  Mr. Orr has been successful in his efforts for the Road, & you have not been.  Mr. Orr�s friends will be so grateful they will do all they can to elect him, however I will not worry.  I know you act as duty inculcates & I hope in the end you will be rewarded.  I hope you have not estranged Genl Thompson & Mr. Read from you.  It is well if you can, to retain them as your friends, as they are the leading Whigs in this Congressional District.  The Canvas in which you are now engaged is so extensive & so important, that great circumspection is required to ensure success.  You know I always wish you to act honorably & independently.  All I ever fear is, that when there is no reason for it, you will act independently, & without cause injure yourself, just to show your independence.  I think you are justified in honorably doing all you can to retain & make friends, but ! will go on to other subjects, that I know you think more within my sphere.  The Book Mrs. Cunningham has sent me, Pamela says they had read & were very much pleased with, that they knew I would like it, it would give me many ideas as to governing children.  

       I was interrupted in my letter by a visit from Mr. & Mrs. Rowland.  Mr. Rowland said as the Greenville & Laurens Stockholders withdrew , from the Convention, those who were left, applauded them, that they were treated with no respect.  I am very sorry the Convention should so have ended & that Greenville should have lost the road.  What do you think now will be done. Will Greenville do anything again toward having a Road?  Yesterday morning Jim cleaned out the Stable yard & in the afternoon I rode with the children to Mr. Buists�s to know when he was going to Bachelors Retreat.  Mrs. Doloc wishes me to send something by him.  He is going there to assist in the ordination of Mr. Hillhouse.  They are to have a 3 days meeting.  I had not been on the Spartanburgh road since I paid a visit to Mr. Buist with you years ago.  This morning Jim is hauling wood  & this afternoon, I intend going to see Mrs. Pearson.  Fanny is sweeter than ever & gets more interesting the older she grows.  She knows me now, & I love her so, when she cries to come to me.  She also knows Delia, & sometimes likes to go to her from me.  She is my little comfort at night.  A father is necessary to a child, when she is looking & behaving so sweetly.  I always wish you were here to see her.  Frank is shaking my desk, & saying he wishes Pa would come.  Almost every morning & in the middle of the night, when he wakes, his first exclamatiion is �has Pa come�?  I say no, he says, �well then I dreamt he had come�.  One morning he said,  �I dreamt Pa was baptized�.  I asked him who baptized him, he said, �he baptized himself�.  When the children behave badly, I tell them I will write & tell you, & it distresses them very much, & they beg me not to.  I think they have behaved pretty well, since you left.  The servants do as usual.  Minerva ought to be satisfied.  I have as little cooking as possible, so as to allow her plenty of time to make her clothes.  I have been very busy making Delia Mary & Lindy�s clothes.  I have not touched the Worsted work.  Except going behind the Carri[a]ge, I do not miss Edward in the least.  Lindy with ease does what he did.  I would like when he returns, to put Lindy with Mary McLeod to learn to wash iron & cook, so that she may be a useful servant.  She has a good temper & I want to make her a valuable servant.  At Mamma�s they are as usual.  Susan has had headache lately.  Mamma says she would like you to get a chair like ours, even if you had to give more.  I must now close & will only say if I have given more advice than you care for.  You must  consider it only as a vent to my thoughts, that I have no one to listen to me as you do, & that I have perfect confidence in my dear husband that he always acts as duty & honor dictates, & that his good judgement will carry him safely through life.  I hope even to a better world , in spite of his wifes interference.  E.F.P.
