Letter 105

Sunday morning, 30 November [1851]
Greenville

My dear husband

		Today is just such a day as last Sunday, except it is raining more, so none of us have gone to church.  We are all seated in the little dining room, & Willie & Anna are also writing to you, but I do not know that their letters will be worth reading.  They seem at a loss what to write about, & appeal to me every moment.  We have had some good weather, but as usual it has not continued long.  Hext is in Charlottes arms, & Fanny & Frank are plaguing us all.

		I received two letters from you last night.  I suppose as usual the Postmaster was careless about Mailing one of them the day before.  So in future I will not be uneasy when I do not hear from you.  I am glad everyone is so kind to you.  I hope you are spending today pleasantly at Mr. Latta�s.  You must accept all your invitations.

		I wonder what Col. Brockman wishes with 200 dollars, for he does not bring 15 dollar bibles to his Wife.  I thank you for your remembrance, but I must say I would rather you show your love by saving your money for our future support, for though it is very pleasant to spend it, you ought to recollect that you are our sole support, & now when you make, you ought to try & lay up something for the time when you will not be able to make, so you ought to deny your generous inclinations, so do not be extravagant, buy only what is necessary, & only buy such books as are really interesting.  The Bible is the best book, but the pictorial bible I have seen, the pictures are small, & not very interesting.  If you see any pretty present that Ann would like I would be pleased at your getting it, but only  something reasonable, & in buying for the children get a little present for Vardry.  You are his Godfather, & never give him 
anything.  Susan is grateful at your merely remembering him, not the value of the present does she care for.

		I have had to buy Reuben Shoes, & an Umbrella, & sent some money to town I owed, so if you would send me 10 dollars I would be obliged to you.  My money has not given out, but it may, so I would be obliged to you to replenish my purse.  I read your letter in the Southern Patriot today.  You provoked me by mentioning Mr. Jones name.  You ought to treat him as you do the Mountaineer, & not deign to let his name appear in your paper.  The little he does in the Legislature is not worth recording.  Only in one instance ought you to have named him. & that is you ought to have mentioned Mr. Jones said there were not 300 Union men in Greenville District.  His conceit & vanity provoke me beyond endurance.  He cannot forget that he stood at the head of the ticket & is still saying I suppose that he represents the District not you.  I suppose he says, he governs it, that you have no influence at all, & then at the next election he will wan� & get the votes of your friends again.  Col. Brockman & Mr. Duncan & yourself ought to keep aloof from him, & not condescend to notice him & except to mention his folly & conceit which should be known to the people of Greenville, I wish you to mention him in no other way.  You ought to mention how he tried to put down the 4th of July meeting.  Mr. Jones self conceit, & a toothache I now have, have put me in a bad humour for the present & Hext is crying, so I will stop & nurse him & begin again in a better mood.

		Margaret H� left the Jail this morning.  Mr. Elford will take this letter.  I think you had much better not go to Charleston until the Spring when you go down to the Court of Appeals.  Now if you go, you will be neglecting your duties, & you would not stay long enough to warrant the expense of going down & coming up on the Rail Road.  In the Spring you can buy Groceries & other things we need, & take one or two of the children.

		I hope you will be appointed a Delegate to the Baltimore Convention.  It will be a pleasant trip for you.  So that you enjoy yourself, I am wil[l]ing to remain at home quietly, & think only of you, & wish you advanced, because you have always acted so disinterestedly & nobly you deserve it & unless one is rewarded by office & honor, they are not appreciated for their conduct by the world, they are the same men, but they are not esteemed  as they are, when they meet with reward.

		I see Mr. Hopkins is going to keep a school, so there will be 3 schools, besides the Academies & Mr. Arthurs.  Mr. Elford says Mr. Arthur takes the Patriot.  I felt vexed when I thought he did not; for as you go to his church, & pay him so much, I thought he was in duty bound to take your paper, but it does not seem to have enlightened him.

		Dr. Koch was here yesterday a little while.  He begged me to ask you to attend to the business he asked you about, says he could pay some of the money required to board Mrs. � at the Asylum, that he wishes to know how much they would charge for boarding her 3 months, so attend to it for him, do not think it too little a matter.  It is important to him.  I am glad you have introduced a bill for giving the Election of President to the people.  All the Anderson petitions were good.  You must introduce their petitions as bills, give election of Governor to the people, have basis of representation altered, the free school fund more equally distributed, & taxes more justly levied, & in short�South Carolina a free State, & the Upper country equal to the Lower.

		I like to read your letters in the Patriot, & always wish they were longer & contained more.  I have written to you every day now since you left but one, when Anna wrote.  

		I have told Mr. Elford to buy Hext a Straw carri[a]ge & chair & 2 yds of Carpeting that is needed.  He is to buy a Carpet for Mamma.  He is obliging & a good judgement, & I would rather him shop for me than anyone, so let him make the purchases I have mentioned.  They are necessary & will be very useful, & I would rather buy these things for Hext than you should buy anything for me.  Hext needs both carri[a]ge & chair now.  I intended writing to Aunt Mary to buy them, but I much prefer Mr. Elford should.  He knows exactly the kind & will send them up quickly.  I will pay for them out of the next money you make for me, rather than he should not have them.  I hope to hear tonight from you.   I hope you will mention all Mr. Jones falsehoods in your letters.  They ought to be known.  Yours truly. E.F.P.

I thought you were going to vote for Mr. Ashmore as Commissioner.

My dear husband

		According to promise I have taken up my pen to write to you, but with literally nothing to write about.  The clock struck 4 as the stage drove off, so you really got up unnecessarily early.  Another time I will not arouse you as I did.  I slept soundly until morning, when I awoke feeling very much fatigued from my disturbance in the night.  The children slept late, & as it proved to be a very unpleasant day, we resolved not to go to church, to hear one of Mr. Arthurs old sermons, so we read the services at home, & got through only a little while ago.

		Mr. Tindall left an advertisement about his writing in the walk, with a bird drawn on paper with a pen.  I told the children whichever of them behaved the best should have the bird so I put their names on paper & whenever they misbehaved gave them a mark.  Thus far Willie & Fanny have behaved the best, & bid fair one of them to get the bird.

		I received a note from Susan [a] little while ago.  She asked if you had left, & said you had gloomy weather.  It has been cloudy all day, gloomy & dull.  I hope you are wrapped up warm, & getting along comfortably.  I told Reuben to go to Mr. Suddeths & ask him to come tomorrow to look at the Cows, that if he went this morning, this afternoon he would go to church.  He said he would, but I have not seen him since, & do not know if he went or not.

		I have had the dining table moved into the small dining room, & we will take our meals there now.  It makes it so pleasant to have the table in a different room from the one we sit in.  When you come back I hope the rooms will both be fixed nicely carpeted & cleaned, & our chamber also looks more comfortable with a carpet which it has needed so long.

After dinner

		We have eat[en] dinner, & it is now raining a little.  The winter has continued gloomily.  I hope the end will be pleasanter than the beginning.  If you would like Willie & Anna or one of them to commence writing under Mr. Tindall let me know & I will let them begin.  I see from his advertisement  that he does not charge unless you improve.  Hext is doing pretty well, seems not have experienced any bad effects from the Magnesia.

		My eyes hurt me in consequence of my loss of sleep last night.  I can hardly keep them open, & as soon as I have done writing, I will lay down on the sofa & take a nap.

		Take care of yourself & come back quite well.  I have read the Patriot through, your Editorial twice.  Bill Smith�s letter is an amusing one, & the peice on the Union from the Louisville Journal very good.  I hope Mr. Duncan, Col. Brockman & yourself are getting along in friendship & harmony.  You have stood by each other too long, to be separated easily. 

		The children are talking, Anna is writing to you, but I do not know that she will send her letter.  I will finish before her.

		I believe I have nothing more to write, having parted so recently.  I will conclude as usual with a little advice.  Distinguish yourself this Session, as I think you generally do, introduce all the improvements you mentioned in your Editorial last night.  I think the road tax for the poor man is unjust.  The Election of the Commissioner ought to be given to the people, as well as President & Governor, & indeed all the changes you named ought to be adopted by the State.  Do all you can for the best interests of the State & your District Greenville, get money to build a new Court House, & in short prove yourself to be as hitherto the best member ever sent from Greenville, & I hope you may yet meet the reward you deserve, & which you have not got yet.  Adieu.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I am sorry I have not better pens to write with, but as they are very bad, you must make many excuses.  Mr. Elford I suppose left this morning.  He will take you a letter from Anna & myself.  Willie thought his not worth sending.  He will write to you soon.

		I received a letter from you last night.  I was very glad to hear, & wish you would write every Mail.  I am pleased you are treated so well by the Secessionists.  I suppose, as Mr. Elford says, they thank you in their heart, & look upon you as one who has saved them from disgrace, though for their own credit, they feel compelled to abuse you.  I hope they will reward you, for the good you have done them.  Mr. Memminger is a mean man, & you have not been half hard enough upon him.  You ought in your paper to bring all inconsistent, selfish people to the view of the people.  I hope all such speeches as the Representative from Greenville lately made about their being so few Union men in Greenville, you will make known to the people, who are so misrepresented, through your paper.  I cannot bear for deceitfulness & falsehoods to pass unnoticed, & not injure the person who acts so�but�get him along prosperously & favorably.  Such people ought to be disgraced at once.  It is a wonder how such should have been honored by the people.  I hope the days of such are numbered.

		The servants tell me Mr. Walker & family have left for Georgia this morning.  I hope you will not be grieved to hear the sad news.  I wish others of the same description would follow.  Yesterday was a damp, rainy, disagreeable Day.  I had toothache almost all day, & the cold penetrated me, & I have to wear a large shawl & flannel over my face; but today I feel quite well, & this first day of winter has made its appearance bright & cheerful, & most charming for the washing of clothes, that most necessary business every Monday.  Anna is at school, & will have holiday in a week.  Willie has driven the horse & wagon to the Farm to help Reuben bring home a load of wood.  Charles is spading the garden.  Frank cut some wood, & then went in the streets to see some playmates.  Fanny makes herself very useful helping lay the table & put away the dishes.  I told her I would write you word she was the best & you must bring her a doll, or some pretty present.

		I believe Green Hughes is just passing now to receive his sentence.  I suppose the Governor has not pardoned him.  I am glad you are getting along very well.  I wish you to be happy & contented, as it is possible for you to be, without your wife by your side.

		Hext is well, & as sweet as ever, & waiting patiently for his Carri[a]ge & chair to arrive.

		Our colds are quite well.  That is the childrens & mine.  Lindy is a little hoarse; the rest of the servants are pretty well.

		I have not been out once since you left, & am so busy, I do not know when I will go out.  The winter clothes for the children, are not hardly commenced making yet.  The rooms at present look very neat.  The Piano [is] in the dining room, where the Sideboard stood. The Sideboard looked so shabby, & got broke a little in moving.  I sent it to Mr. Waddil to do up, & when it returns will put it in the little dining room, as that is the place for it, when we eat, & it will save a great deal of dirt, from the servants not coming in & out constantly to it.

		Willie looks quite well & hearty.  Next Spring you can carry Frank & himself down with you.  You recollect in a few years Willie ought to be at college, so your expenses will then increase, so you must save your money now, for those times.  Col. Brockman must give you his note bearing interest, & then he may keep the 200 dollars as long as he wishes.  

		Your review of Mr. Calhoun�s works has not been published yet in the Patriot,  I hope they will soon print Mr. F��s peice of poetry addressed to you.  You must write & tell them to.  The paper will do badly with neither of its Editors here.  Old Mr. Reese�s letter has not been published either.

		I hope you are feeling well & looking well.  Tomorrow you must make a good speech on giving the Election of President to the people, & after that introduce some more important bills.  The basis of representation ought also to be given to the people, & you know all that ought to be done, to put South Carolina on a footing with the other States.

		I do not think the College will flourish under Mr. Manly as it has done under Col. Preston.  I am sorry Col. Preston has to resign.  I thought Mr. Thornwell or Mr. Henry would be elected President.

		 I know of nothing new to tell you.  I hope you will put off your visit to Charleston till the Spring, & then Willie & Anna can go down with you.  You are sent to the Legislature by the people to attend to their business, & ought not to leave it, even for a day.  If you will go to town, go after the Session.  You can then stay longer, & will not be neglecting your duty.  The expense of going on the Railroad up & down is not worth incurring for the short time you will stay now.

		I write so often, I have nothing to write about & am sure you think so too, & will not be sorry I have come to the end of my sheet. Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.

My dear husband  

		As I heard from you last night, & consequently have more than usual to say to you, I will write before I commence my work.  Willie, Anna, Frank & myself all received your letters last night, & were very much pleased to get them.  In all your letters you ask what you must bring me, so now I will tell you.  I love to make presents, as much as you do, so do bring me, a pair of Indian Shoes, such as you have bought for Hext.  I wish to give them to little Susan.  I have never made her a present yet, & would like to give her a pr of Shoes just like Hexts, & buy me also another Indian pocket book, that I may give it to Ann.  She is at present very poorly, & would be pleased to be noticed kindly by me in some way.  I would like one or something else for Susan also.  If they are not very expensive, buy one of the pocket books for Susan, or I will instead give it to Vardry as a present.  So remember these are the things I wish you to bring me, two Indian pocket books, & a pr of Indian Shoes, anything made by Indians is a curiosity, & even if not useful, is interesting to keep.  My bag is of no use.  It is too large, & the beads come out constantly.  I hope Anna�s is prettier than mine, & a smaller size.  Now do not forget to bring me three things if the Indian has not gone.  These are all the presents I wish, & you must not bring many things to the children, save your money to clothe & feed us this winter, & to pay your Doctors bill, Blacksmith�s, Saddler�s &c &c to buy a new carri[a]ge & horses next Spring, & to take me to Columbia with you.  The children if you gave them a Carte blanche, would very easily fill it up, but you cannot think of gratifying all their desires.  They will each write to you, & you can select out of them what you choose to bring them.   	

		I am sorry you could not dine at Mr. Latta�s, & particularly the cause that prevented you.  If you see him, Mamma says you may tell him, she has not forgotten his kindness, to her on board the vessel as she was going to Philadelphia, & if he has a pretty place, & any suitable seeds to plant on a Lawn & improve her place, she would be much obliged to him.  I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am afraid you are too kind to the Secessionists,  When you mention a Secessionist, you praise them up too much.  A Secessionist who has the heart to ruin his State & principally for his own selfish views, or the bad judgment to think he is right in wishing the State to Secede does not deserve praise.  The Cooperationists are the safest of the two parties, as they can do no injury, have to wait for the other States to join them, but the Secessionists would ruin the State now at once.  I like Mr. Owens bill, that the people have resolved against Secession.  I hope you will make an able speech on his side.  If the Convention does meet, arrange it, that it will not meet when the Baltimore Convention meets to nominate President, as you�to go to that, & will have to go to the Columbia Convention.  I do not understand how it is that Mississippi has no Governor, as the Patriot says, & I suppose she has not, as I see Mr. Footes name mentioned in Washington. 

		If Mr. Burt wishes you Governor, I am sorry he does not edit a newspaper now, for if he did, he would make known his wishes to the people.  He commenced editing at the wrong time, when he injured you, & stops when he would benefit you.  If you tried for Office, I expect you would get it, but I hope you may still get it one day.

		I am sorry a Baptist will be elected President of the College.  My idea of that Sect is always associated with ignorance & cont�[word faded], & a Minister, the young men will feel a prejudice against.  They are generally so sanctimonious, & put on the appearance of religion, where very often it is wanting.  

		Willie is again hauling wood.  He drives the wagon.  The children all talk constantly of you.  Your letters pleased them very much.  Fanny & Hext the next time you must write to.  Mamma has a bad cold & Ann poorly.  I rode in the Buggy yesterday for the first time to see them.  Mamma has made an arrangement with Mr. Saterfield who has been overseeing for Mr. McBee to cultivate her place next year, & make everything for her, & attend to the whole place.  He has a wife but no children.  I wish you would get such a person.  I do not wish ever to rent your place to a large family.  They will burn too much wood.  Mr. Saterfield says your place well attended to, would yield so well you would have to buy very little provision, or none at all.  He is a friend of yours, says it is not easy to find another like you & he takes the Patriot, so of course he will have me for a friend.  He will cut wood, raise hogs, work in the garden.  His wife [word faded] Chickens & Eggs, attend[s] to the Cow, & do[es] just Mr. P� white overseers & family do.  So I hope Mamma will be more comfortably fixed than heretofore.  Negroes hire is so dear now 105 dollars a year for a man.  She is obliged to take Mr. John Townes woman, who has just been confined, so will have a young infant along with her.  She can get no other.  She will go in a few weeks.

		We have bright cheerful weather now, & even Commencement day turned out better than you supposed.  At least it was a charming day here.

		I have read the Patriot through.  It is the only paper I see.  I hope you will get some subscribers to it, while in Columbia.

		You made your speech yesterday I suppose, on the Election of President.  You can improve it, & write it out, & publish it in the Patriot, or publish the one you made before.  You occupy an independent position.  You are between the two parties Cooperation & Secession, can see the faults & virtues of each, & write of them accordingly.

		I am glad you are to dine  with old Mr. �.  Tell him I am the Originator of the Southern Patriot, & even the Editors themselves were about to give up, I encouraged & made them go on.  He ought to hand down my name to posterity in poetry. 

		Do not be extravagant, my dear husband, bring me a present in money when you come home if you wish it.  So instead of buying so many things now, come home with a pocket full of money, but buy the Shoes & pocket books I have told you.  E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I received a short letter from you last night.  You mentioned your Bill for giving the Election of the President to the people was lost you did not say; you made a good speech, but I hope you were satisfied with your effort, & not mortified at your ill success.  You know nothing is to be expected from the present Legislature.  They were elected before the people were enlightened & go against all reform.  The next Legislature will be different.  You can then introduce all the reforms you wish, & be supported.  You are now rowing against the current.  Next Session the current will go along with you.

		I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am glad Dr. Thornwell was elected President of the College.  I am sorry a Baptist for Dr. Thornwell�s place was elected, for I should think he would interpret the Bible according to the Baptist creed, which of all creeds is the most illiberal, & he will pervert the minds of the Students.  It is too small a denomination to be represented in College.  The students are generally of other denominations.  Mr. Wilkes� bill to repeal the Convention I like, & Mr. Owen�s bill �that the people have declared against Secession &c.�  They are just such bills as I suppose you would have introduced.  The Secessionists had better do all they wish now before another Session.  I hope their power will have departed, & all their acts repealed.  Then I hope you will be the Leader, & for once in a majority, & I hope you will be rewarded so do not be discouraged, if now you fail in your endeavors to free the Upper Country from the bondage of the lower.  All Reformers you know have to persevere, meet with opposition at first, but in the end are appreciated.  

		Next winter I must go down with you.  I love to hear public speaking, but above all else my husband speaking.  I would like to have been among the ladies in the Gallery listening to you.  Hext will be a fine boy to introduce next winter.  He will surpass Willie & Frank.  I kissed him for you, & delivered your messages to the children.

		Willie all day is so busy hauling wood.  He has very little time left for reading, & the exercise seems to agree with him.  He looks healthy & well.  When you return he can sit in your Office & read, & resume his studies, & the 1st of January he will again go to school, & Mr. Leary will have I suppose so few scholars he can attend well to him.  Anna�s school breaks up today.  Mr. Capers sent her bill yesterday for 6 weeks, 3 dollars.  My money had not given out, but except for your timely assistance last night of 10 dollars, I would not have ventured to have paid it, but this morning as my fund was replenished, I did pay it, sent 3 dollars by Anna, & felt quite independent.  There will be so many schools to choose from, when Anna begins again, I am as uncertain who she will go to, as who will be next President.

		Mr. Chalmers being a Secessionist, I would not have listened with pleasure to his speech; the Union man only would have pleased me.  They are to be admired for their independence if nothing else.  I love the Union men, those who come out openly for the Union.  The Cooperationists & Secessionists I have no sympathy for, they are both equally bad, but the latter more dangerous.  They both act from selfish motives, for their own aggrandizement, where they do not, they are ignorant & under a delusion that amounts to derangement.

		I would be glad for you to do something for Dr. Koch�s wife, but when you return, do not let him annoy you.  He is a perfect bore.  He has been here repeatedly after wood, which he has no idea of paying for, or he would go somewhere else, tells all manner of stories about his not being able to get anyone to haul it, & came yesterday to borrow Meal.  I sent him a little sausage, said I gave it , but would spare no more, & I do not see him now when he comes.  One or two loads of wood does not satisfy him.  He wishes us to supply him altogether.  Our horses are not equal to such a task, & I am not going to send him any more.  I do not believe he has a single scholar now, & he loses them by his own misconduct.  I think him so poor a Teacher, that I would hardly consent he should teach Anna for nothing.  He has disgusted her with Music, from the really hard peices he has given her which she plays, but more as a task than anything else.  Today is very pleasant, bright & cheerful.  I hope you have the same weather.  We sit altogether in the little Dining room, which is very comfortable.  The larger room we are keeping clean for you, but I have a fire made in it every day, in case anyone calls.  Mr. Elford seemed to admire the Carpet very much.  If he writes from Charleston, & you from Columbia, the Patriot will be interesting.  Mr. Reese�s letter & Mr. F��s poetry are published in this mornings paper.  I am afraid they will be published in the Weekly if next week, too late for the Session.  They put off publishing it so long, I was afraid they were not going to publish it, so I wrote yesterday to ask them to, & accordingly they did.  I wished you to see C� Reese�s letter at once, as I knew it would gratify you.  I am still staying at home, busy all the time, not one moment to spare.  The afternoons are generally windy,, or I would go over to see Mamma.  I must soon make one desperate effort, & return all my visits, & then stay at home with a clear conscience.  I have written to you every Mail but one or two when I got Anna to write, so you have heard every Mail.  It is a great comfort, & I begrudge the not hearing Monday night.

		The children have not commenced under Mr. Tisdale.  They seem disinclined to.  When you return if he is here, they can commence.  As I have not much to write about I will conclude with some advice.  You know I am very generous to you in furnishing a constant supply free of charge.  I do not wish you to be in debt to me, as you certainly would, if I charged.  So this is it.  Do your duty as a Legislator& a Patriot a Member from the Upper Country.  Do all your Constituents expect of you, & which you are so well able to do.  Satisfy your conscience, do not be disheartened at ill success.  Expect it now, sow the seed & after awhile it will appear & yield abundantly & though I am much afraid you will never be rewarded  in a tangible form, yet I will hope even against hope, & try to think you will be.  I appreciate you, but that does not satisfy me.  I wish you to be appreciated by others, & you will never be, unless you meet with honor & Office. In Greenville Village particularly, I wish you to be held in the consideration you deserve.  I cannot bear that all should not see & be made to feel how much you are their Superior, I hope you will one day occupy a position that will make them feel it.  Then I will be satisfied, for you will then be appreciated & your children after you.  This winter you are treated better in Columbia than you were last winter, & next winter as Mr. Elford says, you will be treated still better, for those who are making themselves so important now, I hope will be at home, & an entirely different set, more of your own views will surround you, so good bye, E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

		I received a letter from you last night, short as usual, but as I know you are busy, I will not complain.  It is a great satisfaction to hear every night.  I dare say it would surprise many old married couples to know how essential we find it to our comfort, to hear of each others welfare every day when once a week, or not at all would satisfy them, but I believe we are an exception to the general rule & our love increases, instead of diminishing.  I hope you will never find one to supply my place, & I do not think I would ever find one to supply yours.

		I am sorry you did not intend to take part in the discussion on the Convention bill.  You ought to have done what you could, & perhaps you could have said something to influence the vote, & then you would have written out your speech & published it, so the people would see it.  Your speech last winter, had not much influence in the Legislature, but when published  & read by those who did not hear it, it had its effect.  Whenever you can be of service by expressing your thoughts you ought not to remain silent.  Publish your Electoral Bill speech, & let the people read it, & they will think differently from the contemptible Politicians like Mr. Hutson, & in the end express their rights.

		I will tell Mr. Koch the terms of admittance into the Asylum when I next see him.  Susan says she hears he beats his Wife with his fist.

		I told Reuben this week to kill hogs, & he said they have not been up long enough in the pen, to make them fit to eat, that next week he would kill them.  The weather has been very suitable for killing hogs, & everybody seems to have killed.  We have not been in want of meat yet.  We have commenced today to use the Beef that was smoking & have [word faded] a little bacon & some Fowls.

		Last night I bought some Fodder from Mr. Fosters negro, 185 bundles, for $1.85 cts.  I was sorry to have to pay the money, for I need all I have to supply the family with clothes.  The clothing of a family of 19 comes to a great deal, a weight of responsibility rests on you.

		Mamma at present has a girl of Mrs. Pearsons.  She went to tea yesterday, & seems clever.  She is young & she said her wages were 6 dollars a month, but if she could not get that, they would be 5.  She looks not older than Mary, & has already been Mr. Crofts cook.  I hope Mamma can get her for 5,  It is so much better to have a servant without children, & if she does not get Mrs. Parsons servant, she knows of no other than Mr. John Town[e]s, who will have with her, a child or two.  Susan walked in this morning to shop a little & paid me a visit, but she told me no particular news that I could tell you.

		Willie is again hauling wood today.  He likes to drive the wagon very much & as exercise in this fine weather is good for him, I let him go with Reuben.  Little Annie is dining here, & Anna is busy with her, or she would write to you; perhaps she will tomorrow.  The �Cadet of Temperance� was sent here yesterday for the first time.  It is an interesting little paper.  If you have no objection I will let Willie subscribe for it.  You are entitled I suppose to it, being an Editor yourself, & as it is published in your Printing office, but as it will be an encouragement to them to have an additional subscriber, I thought I would send Willie�s name, with 50 cts.  You must notice �the Cadet of Temperance� in your paper.

		Mr. Foster I forgot to tell you will haul the Corn next week.  Our Corn has not given out yet.  Charles is still spading the garden.  We are all quite well.  I have no complaints.  I must soon stop, so I will as usual give you some advice.  I wish you to let no opportunity pass in the Legislature, when your opinion can be of service, that you do not express it.  Do what you can to benefit your Constituents.  There are not many Members from the Upper Country who are able to speak & be of service to the people, & from the lower Country there are always a plenty to stand up & encourage her in her encroachments.  So those few who are able to be of service & to speak in defense  of the Upper Country must do it, but you know your duty, & do not need me to tell you, so I must stop.

		Do not put yourself to any expense to bring presents  for the children.  They break & destroy everything so soon, & your expenses at home are so great, particularly now, provisions of every kind are high, that you must keep your money to support us.  Bring them some little things & bring the 2 pocket books & the Indian Shoes I mentioned.  Your true & faithful wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		This afternoon I wrote you a few hurried lines to go by tomorrows mail, & prevent your being uneasy.  Until this now, I have not had a moment to spare today to write to you.  

		The children & myself went to church this morning.  It was Communion Sunday, so when I got home it was so late dinner was ready.  Mamma & Ann Susan & the children dined here, & just after dinner we went to the Episcopal church to attend the funeral of Mrs. Evans, Mrs. Ioor�s daughter, whose death I am sure would greatly surprise you.  If Mr. McBee had not mentioned that she was in the last stage of Consumption.  Your telling me that alone prevented me from being greatly shocked when the invitation to her funeral was brought here this morning.  Mr. Arthur mentioned in his discourse that he believed she had safely gone to heaven, that last Wednesday she partook of Communion & seemed to derive great comfort from it.  Mrs. Ioor was not at the funeral.  Her brother & a person who I suppose was Mr. Evans, were the only mourners.  So lately we saw Mrs. Evans go up to the Altar to be confirmed, & in so short a time after she has been carried to the same altar in her coffin.

		Mrs. John Jones is very low.  It is said she cannot hold on long.  When Mr. Henning�s funeral took place, she requested the bell might not be tolled, & this afternoon it as not tolled on her account.  Mr. Tom Butlers son the second, is very ill, not expected to live.  Mrs. Carson has has one sick but he is getting better.

		I saw Mrs. Perry Duncan at church this afternoon.  She told me she only returned from Georgia yesterday.  She has altered in her appearance so much.  She used to look fair & delicate, now she looks coarse & ugly, & her eyes seem affected, but do not mention this opinion to Mr. Duncan.  I told her I heard of Mr. Duncan constantly, & he was quite well.  I saw Mrs. Elford also at church, & told her she must not be jealous, but I had been writing to Mr. Elford.  Mamma begged me to write to him to buy her some Clover & O� grass seed, & I did, & told him if he could get some pretty reasonable Dining Table covers, to get me some.  The Carpet & Piano in the Dining room has made the old ones look to shabby.  I told Mr. Elford that I wrote to him instead of you, because I had written to you, not to go to town, as you had heretofore been a very obedient husband.  I knew you would not go, & these things we wished purchased in Charleston, but the letter will have arrived so long before he does, that I am afraid it may be returned here, & he may not get it.  I read your letter in the Patriot.  I am sorry you remain so inactive in the Legislature.  You ought to speak & do your best to have influence & to be listened to with respect.  You ought to express your views & not be silent.  You ought to speak so the whole State can hear you, & not express your views merely in private conversation, but I see you need me to direct you in future.  I will always go down with you  Never was  husband blessed with so wise a wife.  Do you not in your heart think I have more wisdom in affairs generally than most of the female sex.  I must be more than ordinary, for you to be satisfied with me.

		I was very much provoked this morning to see Mr. Campbell not only in front of us, but exactly in front almost touching where you sit.  Mr. & Mrs. Arthur were in Dr. Simons pew, which I suppose they are to occupy now.  I think it a great peice of impertinence in him to put himself in that place, & that Mr. Arthur knowing how he has treated you, ought to have told him it was improper in him to put himself in contact with you, & ought not to have let Mrs. Arthur taken that pew.  Mamma & myself both think it derogatory to your dignity to be seated just behind Mr. Campbell, so we both think that you must change our pew for Mr. Poinsetts, the pew we first sat in.  We can occupy it until he comes up, but I rather think he will never come up again, so we can keep the pew altogether.  Mamma says she likes to be far back.  It suits her, but that Mr. Poinsetts pew is the one suited for you, & that you ought to sit in, so you must not object to my proposition:  I can take no company in going to church, if Mr. Campbell is to be stuck in front of us every Sunday.

		Mr. Arthur�s sermon this morning was a Missionary one.  A collection is to be taken up next Sunday for the cause, & Mr. Arthur is to preach at Spartanburg, & there will be Lay reading, so he gave us the sermon today, that he would have preached next Sunday if here.  He proved that the Episcopal was the first denomination of religion preached in this country, that years after the Pilgrim fathers came over, & afterwards the Catholics under Lord Baltimore & they had no right to come over & cause Schism.  His whole sermon as usual was to prove that the Episcopal was the best, & the only true church.  These sermons I do not like, for I have always felt, that one church was as good as another, but the form of Worship in the Episcopal church I like.  The Baptists I disapprove of, because they will permit no other Christians to commune with them.  They are illiberal.  During the Communion service Mr. Arthur said he earnestly requested the Communicants to take off their gloves when they received the Communion, that it was much more respectful than to keep them on.  Mamma says it is a custom in the Episcopal church to commune without gloves, but she had never regarded it as of any importance, but Mr. Arthur now regards form altogether & perhaps he believes in Transubstantiation.

 8 oclock.  Willie has returned from the office, & brought me a letter from you.   I am glad you mention perhaps you would take part in the Convention Debate, for you ought to.  I am sorry you have bought so many things for the children.  I wish I would impress it on you, that it would [be] much better for them to show your love by saving money for them, to educate them, & send them to college & fit them up in whatever business they are to follow.  I hope you will see the Indian & buy the pocket books & Shoes.  Some of the presents you bring the children, I will give to Susan�s.  It gratifies Susan that you should remember her children, & you ought not to forget that she complimented you Vardry�s godfather.  Mamma sends her love to you.  Willie has bought himself a knife with his own money so does not wish you to bring him any.  Frank you ought to bring a cheap one to, or get one here for him, for 35 cts.  You can get good ones here.  Willie has a turn for Drawing.  He ought to have the Drawing pencils instead of Anna.   Reuben will kill the hogs Tuesday if the weather is cold.  The Lunatics letter I will not publish.  The children perhaps will write to you tomorrow.  I hear Mrs. Walker goes tomorrow & Mr. McLeods family, but I do not know if they do or not.  The servants say no.  I must stop.  If I have anything to tell you tomorrow, I will get Willie or Anna to write for me.  They all have holiday now.  Adieu, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I have just returned from Mrs. John Jones funeral & will write to you.  Genl Thompson it was thought would have returned last night, but he did not.  The funeral was at the Baptist church.  Mr. Hopkins preached a strange sermon for a funeral one.  It was on St. Paul, his belief in the gospel.  If you had not seen the Coffin, you would not have known it was over a corpse he was preaching.  It was a long sermon, & when he had finished it, for it was written, he closed the Bible, & made a few remarks on the character of the deceased, said she was perfectly resigned to die, & in her last moments said she was not afraid, only that she might not have patience to bear the lingering approach  of the dread monster, & begged her friends to improve her death, & prepare to follow her.  Mr. Tom Butler�s son William is dead, died last night, so Mrs. Whiteford Smith told me today.  Only one son is left & 3 daughters, & Mrs. Butler expects before long to be confined.  Mrs. Stone & some of her daughters were packed & ready to start to town when a servant being sick detained them.  Then the little boy was taken sick.  The servant got well, & the little boy died.  I know of no other sickness at present.

		Now that I think of it, do my dear husband when you return, take your seat in the safest Car.  So many Rail Road accidents are happening.  I think it dangerous traveling on the Road, & be careful also not to have your pocket picked of the little money you will have left.  I see in the last Patriot someone on taking his seat in the Cars leaving Charleston, had his pocket robbed containing 500 dollars.

		The children & myself received your letters last night & thank you for them.  They are very much pleased at the presents you have bought them, but I am not.  You must mean to make them sick with sugar plums.  I wish you would keep your money to buy necessaries we need, & to support your family, & pay your yearly bills.  So do not buy anything more for the children or myself.  I you really wish me to go to Columbia with you in the Spring, keep your money to pay any expenses, for I am afraid you will not have enough to carry me.

		Only one commission I will give you, & that is to buy me a Receipt book called �Miss Leslie�s 75 receipt book.�  By me two of them.  They are small books & do not cost much.  One of them I wish for Susan.  They are the best receipts published, so if you can get them, bring me two.  The hogs were killed yesterday.  It was so warm, we had no fire & windows up, & I disapproved entirely of having them killed, but today is rather cooler, & Charles says there is no danger of the Meat spoiling.  

		Mr. Foster sent a load of Corn today 8 barrels, so Willie says.  It came when I was away.

		You have before this received the letter in which I told you of Mr. Campbell�s impertinence, in sitting exactly in front of you.  I now seriously tell you, that unless you change your pew & take Mr. Poinsetts, I will give up the Episcopal church, for when I go to church I wish to feel pleased & composed, no disagreeable thoughts intruding themselves on my mind, & to have a person who I look upon as one of your greatest enemies, sitting exactly in front of me, so I cannot move my head, without having my thoughts disturbed by him, is out of the question, & I do not intend to put up with.  It is a peice of insolence we can render ineffective by outwitting.  He wishes to be just in front of you, that you may see him, & think of him, but he will find he is mistaken.  That your dignity is not  [to] be treated in that way by a vain, conceited creature.  Our pew is too near the Stove, which will be a good excuse for changing it, but I now say distinctly, that I give up our pew.  I am not going to occupy it again.  I read the peice of Newspaper you enclosed in your letter.  I was not pleased with it.  What it said in your favor, was so short of what you deserve, that I set no value on it, & I did not know there was such a bitter feeling against you, as the Writer states.  I thought Secession being dead, that you were looked upon with kindness, & did not know anything you proposed, would be opposed.  I hope this is not so.

		You ought to have spoken on the Convention bill, as it was of so much importance, you ought to have been able to say, that you did all you could to prevent its passing.  The older members ought to have spoken, &�left it to the younger.

		Mr. Hutson, as a boy, was a bragger & boaster & self conceited & insignificant.  My relations have been your enemies as well as ours, & my relations are the last persons I would apply to if in want. My relations I look upon as enemies, & it is they alone, that prevent my having any wish to visit Charleston.  I wish to go to New Haven, but I do not care to see Charleston.  Hext, Wilie & myself can go to Columbia with you next Spring, Willie to escort me about  when you are engaged.  Hext of necessity has to go with me.  

		I am glad you thought of Susan�s children in buying Sugar plumbs.  I am sorry for those children, & wish to give them something to show my regard.  Susan will be pleased at your remembering them.

		Frank cannot read your letter to him, but he knows what presents you have bought him, so he takes up the letter & begins, �my dear Frank, I have bought you some crackers, & a gold pen & some sugar plumbs,� & then he comes to a pause, then begins again.  Fanny is very much pleased with the Mouse, & her stomach full of sugar plumbs.

		I am going over this afternoon to help Mamma do some work.  We all long to see you.  Do not leave until the Legislature adjourns.

		I hope you do all you ought to do, & do not remain inactive, when you ought to be active.  

		You may tell Mr. Ashmore the Upper country is my home.  I go for it entirely & for the Upper country Candidates on all occasions.  I wish he had told you, the compliments the ladies paid you.  I hope Mr. Richards & the pupil are married now.  In haste, E.F.P.

My dear husband

		I did not hear from you last night, which disappointed me greatly.  I hope it is the Postmaster in Columbia�s fault, & that tonight I will get two letters, at any rate one.  When I receive no letter, I have not much to write about, as I write so often.

		Yesterday the children & myself all went over to Mamma�s & spent the afternoon.  Susan was there with a bad headache.  She suffers with them almost all the time.  Ann also feels poorly.

		Mamma says Mr. Hutson is so distantly related to us, she does not look upon him as a relatiall.  His con� is so remote, I do not even know what degree it is.

		Mamma has at present a girl of Mrs. Pearsons, who she likes very much.  The girl says her wages are 6 dollars a month, but if she cannot get that, she is to take 5 dollars, & that she has tried all over the village, & cannot get a place.  When Mamma heard of her she was working for Dr. Koch for nothing.  She told Anna yesterday that Dr. Koch had got wood from so many persons, & not paid for it.  Now, no one would carry him any, & some cold days had been without fire, that he had but one mattress for his whole family, & two blankets.  She told Mary at the Spring, that Dr. Koch bought a Possum, & one day he would cut off one leg, & give it to cooked, & the next day another, & so on, until it was all gone, that his Wife sits down & cries.  The law is that if a man is strong enough to support his Wife & family they are to look to him alone for support.  But there ought to be a law for families situated like Dr. Koch where the father will not work to support them.  The son & daughter ought to be taken from him, & put to trades, & the Wife & young children sent to the poor house.  Dr. Koch is a worthless creature .  He sets up for a gentleman, so he is above working.  It was presumptuous in him to charge 1 dollar a lesson for Music when he is as poor a teacher as can be.  Anna[�s] improvement is owing only to me.  If I had not attended to her she would have learnt nothing.
	Fanny came running in just now to say Anna said I must tell you, she was teaching her, her lesson.  Fanny got her spelling book out of the Library, & carried it to Anna to teach her.  Willie was seated in the room looking over a little book.  I told him he had better read Baker�s�, so I might give a good account of him.  He went in the Library to get it, & I have been rattling some bones, & I sent to tell him, I would write you word he was shaking bones, instead of reading, so he stopped, & I hope now he is reading.  
	Mrs. Walker I believe goes today.  Her negroes have already passed  I have heard so often she was going.  I won�t believe it until she is actually gone.
	I wish you would ask Col. Ashmore what the ladies said about you.  I love to hear you complimented.
	Mary says Mrs. Barnard Cleveland�s father, old Mr. Jim Cleveland is dead.  
	The weather now & for several days past, is like Spring.  I hope you will have such to come home in.  The nights are as light almost as day.  I wish you would consult the best Physician in Columbia about your cold, & ask if your tooth has anything to do with the flowing from your nose, & if you had better have it drawn, & you can have the gold to be artificial tooth fixed in a way to do without the decayed tooth.  No one is better off for a decayed tooth in their mouth.  It is best to get rid of it.  Do attend to this matter now while you are in Columbia, & can ask advice of a good Physician.  For my sake do it, for if your cold is not put a stop to at once, you will go into Consumption.
	We are all well.  I see Miss Cornelia Crittenden & Dr. Blackman walking together every now & then.  I once heard Mr. Walker tell her, she would be satisfied only as a Princess, but I think she has lowered her pride, instead of a Prince to take an unknown Dentist.  
	I hope to hear tonight from you.  I suppose no Election has been made to the Female Academy.  Mr. Erwin I believe is the only Candidate, so I hope he will be elected.  Frank can then get rid of him, & there are so many Female schools, we are not obliged to send Anna to him.
	I must now close after writing a letter literally about nothing.  When I commenced I did not know I would fill a page.
	Do your duty. The next Legislature I suppose will be composed of Members of entirely different politics from the present.  Since the people have been enlightened by the Patriot, & you can then carry your measures triumphantly, without any difficulty, so do not be discouraged.  Your affectionate Wife, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	I have been visiting this morning, & have just returned.  It is 1 oclock so I have not much time to write to you.  After dinner I am going to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Willie is going to drive me in the Buggy.  Reuben is at the Farm cutting wood, & Charles wants Jock to plough some beds in the garden this afternoon.  This morning Willie drove me in the carri[a]ge.  I received your letter last night, in which you mention you had to be in three places at the same time.  I wish to know how you managed.  I expect self interest governed you, & you went to Court.

	Frank says you must bring each of them, that is Willie & himself a pack of Crackers, but I expect you can get them cheaper here. 
	Some of the news I heard this morning is, that Mrs. Campbell has a daughter.  Two weeks ago it was born.  I am glad Mr. Campbell had not a son to boast of as a Secession boy.  Miss Lewis is engaged to Mr. Ioor, to be married the 30th of this month.  Perhaps you will recollect I predicted this match, when I saw them together at Professor Hale�s lecture.  I said he would be glad of a little property & she would be glad of a husband.  I went to see Mrs. Arthur this morning, as I am going to change the pew.  I thought I would go just to see her, to show her I was not vexed with her, though knowing you do not speak to Mr. Campbell.  She had no business to take the pew she has.  Mr. Campbell does not wish to sit behind you, you who have never illtreated him, & yet wishes you to sit behind him, he who has abused you.  You will say it is a little matter, & it is, but it is matter enough to make me feel very disagreeable at church, a place where I ought to feel pleasant, so I will arrange matters, that my seat may be pleasant & free from insolence & impertinence.  Mr. Campbell last Sunday sat with his face turned entirely towards our pew, so we could see the whole of his face.  I think he is the most vain, conceited person I ever saw.  He beats Mr. Jones.  Next Sunday, his self conceit will be pulled down.  I found Mr. Arthur reading the Patriot.  He said the verses were very complimentary to you.  I Iold him the Author wrote word.  I ought to be proud of my position as a Wife.  I like him, much better than Mrs. Arthur.  I hope to hear tonight from you.  I read your letter in the Patriot this morning.  It was such a short one.  I am really surprised you do not take part in the Convention bill, & the Bank bill, that you do not raise your voice to defeat them.  It is what you owe your Constituents. To do all you can for them, to relieve them from Taxes, & oppression.  I am glad you are grateful for my advice.  If I had time, I would put you under further obligations, but I am obliged now to stop.  I will write you a longer letter tomorrow.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

Friday night ? past 7, 12 December 1851
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received two letters from you. & though I wrote to you [to]day, I was so hurried, I wrote but a few lines, & as I have more leisure at night, than in the day, I will write to you now, instead of tomorrow.  If anything occurs tomorrow worth relating, I can write again.  I am truly sorry to hear you have been sick.   I will be very anxious until tomorrow night, when I hope to hear from you, that you are getting well.  If I do not hear, I will be very uneasy.  You ought to have attended to yourself long ago.  You have been so long threatened with sickness, you are too careless about you health when you know how important you are to your wife & children, sickness can often be kept off with a little care.  I had a headache day before yesterday.  I took a dose of Salts & Cream of Tartar, & it carried off my headache & did me good, & I feel now quite well.  If you had had the headache, I would have induced you to take medicine.  You would have left it to nature , & perhaps been sick in consequence.  Do write me every Mail, & keep me informed of your health.  I will be very anxious to hear every night of your welfare.  Sunday I was able to write you but a line, but I knew that line would be a comfort to you, so wrote it.  Mr. Elford has not written very lately to his family as they are uneasy about him.  If you have heard anything of him, write me that I may tell Mrs. Elford.  I sent tonight to the Printing office to tell them you received no papers now, & beg them to send you one of all hereafter published.  They sent word they thought you were receiving them.  They often send me 4 Tri weeklys.  I would easily have sent you one every Mail.  I have kept two of every paper.  I will send you the papers, whie you remain away, though I am thankful it will be only a few days now.  If the Legislature adjourns Tuesday, I will write you but once more.  You will get this letter Monday, & I will write on Sunday so you can hear Tuesday.  I hope & trust my next letter from you. will say you are quite well.  Do consult a Physician about your cold.  It ought to be cured at once.  You have trifled with it too long.

	This morning I went to see Mrs. Arthur, Mrs. Beattie, Mrs. Turpin, Mrs. Wm Roberts, Mrs. Crooks, & Mrs. Dr. Irvine, Mrs. Beattie was out, Mrs. Wm Roberts at Union, Mrs. Dr. Irvine sick, so I only saw her sister Miss McMahon.  This afternoon I went to see Mrs. Henry Thompson.  Yesterday I went to see Mrs. Dr. Williams.  Mrs. Brooks I was going to see, but met her in the road.  I went to see Mrs. Westfield.  So I am making now an effort to get through with my visits.  Everywhere I am greeted with a scold, for not having gone sooner.

	I met Mrs. Hopkins the Minister�s mother & Miss Hopkins the sister, at Mrs. Thompsons.  I have owed them a visit for years, & Mrs. Farr I also met there, & owe her a visit of long standing.  I like Mrs. Hopkins & her daughter much.  Miss Hopkins will make a good teacher for children.  Mr. Capers they say, lets the children play too much.  Mr. Gailliard is to have both boys & girls, which I disapprove of, so perhaps we had better send Anna to Mr. Hopkins.  It makes girls bold to go to a school with boys.  I think they should be kept at a respectful distance from each other.  

	None of us now have colds.  We are all well, & if you only are well, I will be thankful.  Going out at night does not agree with you.  When you return you must not go out at night.  The papers must be brought to you here.  It is the night air perhaps that has kept up your cold. 

	Mr. Wardell brought home the Sideboard today, done up beautifully, looks like new.  He was to ask $3.50 if I was not entirely pleased, 4 if I was, , so I gave him a Table to varnish, & said he must do that, & then I would give him 4, at least that you would give it, for I had not the money to give.  I had no idea I would need so much money when you left, , but the necessaries of a family amount to so much,  If the money spent was not put down, it would be impossible to believe that it was all gone.

	Mamma is very much pleased with Mrs. Pearsons servant.  She sent to ask Mr. Elford about her, before you left, but Mrs. Elford never sent an answer.  The servant was staying at Dr. Koch�s working for nothing.  When Mamma heard of her & took her at once, & strange to say, Mrs. Buice sent word today that she had engaged her, Maria says she never heard of it, & that she had looked all about for a place, & when she was at Dr. Koch�s so near Mrs. Buice, it is strange Mrs. Buice did not send for her.  I hope Mamma will be able to keep her.  Mrs. Williams says Dr. Koch beats his Wife & children, that the neighbors have to go in to prevent him.  Mrs. Turpin says he taught a young lady who staid there. & he begged her to pay in advance, which she did.  The whole 36 dollars she paid him.   He told me he taught Mrs. Turpin, but I expect it was a story.   He told me he�nothing at Dr. Turpins which surprised me.  Mrs. Turpin says, he wished Dr. Turpin to give him supper before anyone else, & that he was intoxicated.

	Anna says I must tell you, she is making a quilt for Hext, for his cradle, as a Christmas present.  How glad you will be to kiss little Hext again.  He eats bread & biscuits & sucks chicken bones & spareribs, & likes all these things better than nursing, except when he is sleepy. & at night, then nothing satisfies him but nursing.

	Miss Crittenden & Dr. Blackman are engaged I expect.  Anna told me she saw them pass yesterday locking arms, & she was looking up in his face & talking to him.  Genl Thompson is expected, but has not returned yet.  Mr. Jones I hear will keep the children, as I should suppose he would, for he has the best right to them.  Mrs. Genl Thompson is sick in bed.  Her sister is still with her.  One of Genl Thompsons fine horses, Willie says, he heard was dead.  Mr. Latta must be a kind old man.  Miss McMahan today, told me he was very kind.  Mrs. Latta she says passed through Greenville not long ago, on her way to Pendleton to see her son.  Mr. Latta has been married twice she says.  I wish the son had purchased here.  He would have been an acquisition.  Miss Lucy Brockman is engaged to Mr. Julius Earle.  Mrs. Young her sister, told Mrs. Henry Thompson so, & she is to be married soon.  The weather is now cooler, so I think there is no danger of the meat spoiling now.  

	I long to see you, & when you get safe home, you can remain here for four months, & when you leave I will go with you.  I believe though, the Circuit commences again in the Spring.  Take care of yourself for my sake.  Your dear Wife, E.F.P.

Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a short letter from you.  I was in hopes to hear you were quite well, & am uneasy at your saying, your cold & feverish symptoms were not much better.  I hope Lee�s pills which you say you were to take again, will do you good.  I write tonight because tomorrow I go to church.  I may not have time.  I hope & trust this is my last letter to you for a long time.  If we had arranged it beforehand, I would have written a letter to you at Newberry Wednesday evening or wherever you will be that evening, but it is now too late for that.  I am glad your speech had effect & was listened to with attention.  I hope the exertion will not injure you.  Tomorrow you can have a quiet day, free from fatigue & excitement.

	I am glad you think you will gain your Rail Road cases.  Mrs. Elford was uneasy at not hearing from Mr. Elford, but tonight she has heard, & he is well.  At 9 oclock I will send to the Patriot office for the paper, & read your letters which give me great pleasure.  No one enjoys the Patriot more than I do.  

	Mr. N� tonight sent me a Jury ticket to send to you, & get you to bring him up the money.  I enclose it in this letter, & hope you will receive it in time to get the money for him.

	This morning I went to see Mrs. Elford, Mrs. Harvey Cleveland, & Mrs. Col. Irvine.  The latter lady was out.  Mrs. Elford says Mrs. Bruce had engaged Mrs. Pearsons servant Maria, so Mamma will be obliged to give her up & hire Mrs. Town[e]s� who has children.

	A great trial has been going on today in Mr. Stokes Office, of negroes for gambling.  Mr. Erwin Jones watchman Lem, Mr. Douglas man, Mr. Washington Green�s, Mr. McBee�s & others.  Some were found innocent, some whipped & dismissed, others sent to jail.  Mr. Elias Alexander had his man Adam tried, & it was said, if he was whipped Mr. Alexander would have gone crazy.  I believe he was cleared.  Cass with the wooden leg was also cleared.  

	Maj. Earle Mamma tells me is ill, perhaps near his end.  How he has destroyed himself.

	I rode in the Buggy this afternoon to see Mrs. Brooks & afterwards to Mamma�s, so I am visiting in earnest.  I long to get through, & be able to stay at home as much as I please.  I hope to finish almost before you return & then devote myself to you.

	Hext tomorrow is six months old.  He is now seated in Lindy�s lap by the fire.  I am writing upstairs in my chamber.  The children are all asleep.  Fanny has not progressed much in her book.  Anna gave her two almonds in advance to learn a lesson, which she has not learnt yet.  She would be a good little girl, if it were not for the teasing of the servants & children, which ruins her temper.  Anna has been busy making a quilt, so stays satisfied at home.  Willie has been hauling wood again today.  Frank knows all the hogs that have been killed, the negroes whipped &c.  It is worth leaving home to have the pleasure of returning to it as you will have.  You leave it often enough to value it.  I stay at it too much, to value it.  In future you will have to carry me to Columbia with you, then you will be satisfied.  Next winter the Rail Road will be so far advanced, the journey will be nothing.

	The weather tonight is quite cold.  The meat is safe.  Several persons killed today.  Mr. Foster has sent 3 loads of Corn, 8 barrels in each load, the servant says.  Mr. Brooks told me Mr. Furman would most likely be elected to the Baptist church as Preacher, & that he is a hot Secessionist.  Last summer, went about making stump speeches.  How weak minded ministers are.

	Mary has not brought the Patriot yet.  I will stop writing & go to bed, & finish tomorrow.  I slept very little last night.  Was kept awake thinking of you, so I am very sleepy now.  I hope tomorrow night to hear better news.
  
	Sunday, 2 oclock.  My dear husband, I have just done dinner, & will finish my letter to you.  I went to church this morning, all of us.  I took possession of Mr. Poinsetts pew, & like it very much.  It is more private than ours.  We will keep it until Mr. Poinsett comes up, but I rather expect he will never come.  If he does, we will take some other vacant pew in church.  There are several unoccupied.  Mr. Arthur preached.  He did not go to Spartanburg as he expected.  A horse fell with him & lamed him which prevented him.  Mr. Cox read the prayers.  Mr. Arthur�s was extempore, & as poor a one, as I ever heard, tedious & laboured, & really teaches us one virtue patience.  Mrs. Westfield says Mr. Ioor has addressed several young ladies on the Grove, & they all refused him, but Miss Lewis with her little property, thinks him good enough for her.  Mamma says he looks quite sad.  He must know that his object in choosing such a lady is wid�.  She is very unloveable, with her one eye.  Mrs. Ioor has taken the house Mr. Walker the merchant has been living in, so we will have her for a neighbor.  

	It was a house of Butler Thompson�s I believe that is�not Genl Thompsons.  Edward told Mamma a tale of Butler Thompson�s being thrown out of a Buggy, his horse killed & himself hurt, but I do not know how true it is.  Reports are so false I am afraid to mention them.  

	The weather today is very cold.  Do be careful of yourself as you come home, wrap up warm, & do not increase your cold.  I hope & pray you may be well when I hear from you tonight.   I am miserable when I hear you are feverish.  If you are sick you must be at home, where every moment, I can know how you are.

	I do not know whether you will be here Wednesday or Thursday.  Mr. Goodlet says the Legislature adjourns Tuesday 12 oclock & that you will set off in the Cars the same day.  Be careful to get a safe seat in the Cars, & take care of your pocket book.  What a strange law to pass for a man when in debt to have so much of his own property secured to him.  Business will have to be stopped for no one will give him credit.

	This afternoon Willie is to drive us out in the carri[a]ge.  There is no service at church.  It is so cold I can hardly write.  My hands are cold.  I have not time to read over my letter,  Your must excusae mistakes.  Yours truly, E.F.P.

My dear husband

	Willie wrote to you last night, & I cannot seal up his letter, without adding a few lines.  I always have so much to say.  Anna is very much pleased at your praises.  Frank is anxious to write to you, but does not yet write legibly.  Fanny is very busy & industrious & often asks if she is not the best.  Hext is well & sweet, & will be very much pleased with his Indian Shoes.  He wears Shoes & Stockings now, , & the Indian Shoes if he does not wear much, he can keep in remembrance of you.   You must be sure & buy me another pr to give to Susans baby, & the two pocket books.  These are all I wish you to bring me.  For the children anything you bring will please them.  Toys & candy is so dear in Columbia, you cannot bring much of either.  

	It seems to me the State is getting in a more dangerous position than ever, for after the people have declared against Secession, the leaders are determined to go on with their designs.  The Patriot has yet an important part to act.  The danger is not over, as Judge O�Neal[l] said.  You have still to open the eyes of the people, & save them from disgrace & ruin.  What a pity we cannot have peace like the other States.  I am sure we would not know we were ill treated & dishonoured, if the Politiciasns did not tell us so.  Well after they have Seceded, I hope they will be satisfied.  You will do your duty, & that is all you can do.  But what is most provoking is that all will be taxed, even those who are opposed to contemplated action, so I hope you will try & exempt those who are opposed, from taxation.  They should not bear the burden.  Even Mamma, whose income is only sufficient for her necessary expenses.  Mr. Barnwell, Mr. Rhett, & such should hear it.  

	I hope to hear tonight from you, & to see the Patriot.  It is the only paper I have seen since you left.

	I am sorry you did not dine with Professor Brumby.  Whether busy or not you ought to have gone.

	The weather is charming today.  We are all well.  I have now a particle of news to tell you.  I have been out but once to Mamma�s, & owe everybody a visit, so nobody comes to see me.  I am very busy seeing for the children.

	If you saw a suitable present for Mamma, I would love you to bring it.

My dear husband

	I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.  Soon after receiving it, I set off & came to Mamma�s, where I am spending the day but fearing you may be disappointed if you do not hear from me.  I have begged writing materials of Mamma.  I wrote a note to Mr. Elford, requesting him to send you the Patriot tonight, as I will return home too late to send it.  I hope he will not forget it.

	I hope Mr. Dyson will offer you a fee large enough to induce you to go to Newberry.  I would like very much for you to return with your pocket book filled with 100 dollar bills.  You might go to Newberry, attend to the case, & return here the middle of the week, & be in time to receive business here.  I could have your Office opened, so that everyone that went in, would come down to the house, & I would tell them to keep their business until you returned, that you would be here the end of the week.  I am glad Mr. Jones is somewhat humbled, though I am afraid, it is not really so.  I am delighted at what has occurred, as now you will never let him be on the footing he was before.  You will never again condescend  to speak to him.  Have you heard that Mrs. Eliza Dawkins is married to Mr. Poole of Spartanburg a clerk in a store there.  He was 20 the night he was married & she is about 40 I suppose.  Mrs. Choice I hear was very angry when she heard of it.  I suppose the family objected, as I believe none were at the wedding.

	You will be surprised to hear that Fanny commenced going to school yesterday afternoon.  In the morning Vardry & Annie went, & Fanny felt that she was debarred of a great pleasure & fretted so, that I let her go in the afternoon, & she came home perfectly delighted, & has gone today.  I am glad for her to be kept from servants, for often she was seated on the ground playing with John & behaving & speaking badly.  This morning she dressed with pleasure at the thought of going to school, & took up her bucket & walked about the house delighted, her sweet face glowing with pleasure.  Hext is well & crawls over the floor.  All are well.  

	Reuben & Charles are ploughing Oats.  No one has been to see you, that I know of.  Gov. Cobb�s Secretary wrote a letter last night saying he had received neither receipt for the money he sent, or the Patriot either, & begging you to inquire into the matter, & to acknowledge his letter & send the Patriot regularly.  I sent the letter to Mr. Elford.   Write again to me, & I hope that you will write that Mr. Dyson offered you the large fee you said you would accept.  Attend to the case the beginning of the weeks.  They can try it Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday at least.  Return quickly in the Stage & attend to your business here also.  I will make Willie sit in the office if you wish it.

	I must now stop.  If you do not get a Patriot, borrow one, & feast on it.  Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. Mr. Carson talks of carrying all his family to California, but I expect it will all end in toil�.  A Pension for Mrs. Paris has come & an Eclectic. [page torn]
