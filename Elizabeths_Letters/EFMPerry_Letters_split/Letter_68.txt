Letter 68

Sunday night, 7 December 1845
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received a letter from you, & as usual it has given me great pleasure.  You ought to have attended the Governors ball.  If it was only for a little while, it would have given you so much to talk about to me.  If all the persons who promised to speak to the Governor had done so, I am certain he would have no hesitation in pardoning Wells.  I am afraid they have not performed their promises.  If you would only get the Judge to say as he did to you, that he ought to be pardoned, I am sure he would.  Do tell Mr. Duncan what the Judge said & ask him if he is not ashamed, & tell him if he thinks it will increase his popularity, the refusing to sign he is mistaken, & even if it did, would he for the sake of popularity, hang a man.  I am sorry he is one of the Delegation.  I hope the Governor will not be influenced by him.  Do bring back Mr. Wells pardon in your packet.  Margaret told me Col. Dawkins wife expected to increase her family.  If so how pleased he must be.  He must feel as if he had just commenced life.  I thank you for your liberality in sending so much fruit.  I am anxious to receive it.  It will add greatly to my supper, in appearance, & value.  Miss McBee gives her party next Wednesday.  I intend giving mine the Friday following.  As the Legislature adjourns so soon, I am hesitating whether to put it off until Thursday the night after you return.  I think it would be respectful to you, & a proper welcome for you.  If I thought it would give you pleasure to be at it, I would not hesitate a moment.  My only motive for having it during your absence, is that you dislike parties, & would prefer being away.  Oh for a magnetic telegraph that I might this instant consult you & know which you prefer.  I would rather you should be present, & yet I am afraid that you will dislike it.  My only resource will be to consult Mamma & Susan.  When you left, I expected to have it immediately.  Miss McBee requested me to put it off, until her friend came, as it has been put off so long it will make no difference to put it off a little longer.  My only hesitation is whether you will like it or not.

	Willie is disappointed at not hearing from you.  I told him he would hear tonight.  Frank is so interesting.  Willie said to him the other day, Frank I am going to whip Lindy.  Frank replied, � you shant ip my �.�  This morning in bed he pressed his arm hard on my face.  I called to him loudly to move his arm.  He commenced crying & said, �I tell Pa, Pa ip Ma.�  I would tell you many sweet sayings of his, but have not room.  They all look healthy.  Willie is a fine boy.  Anna is very affectionate.  If our children only turn out well, we will have great cause for thankfulness.  I dined at Mamma�s today.  Mr. McBee appeared quite well.  I hope marriage will improve him.  I liked him better than usual today.  Susan was sick in bed yesterday with a bad headache.  She was up today.  There was no preaching in any church, so I rode with the children to the farm after breakfast, to see Maria, who is still sick, but better than she was.  Dr. Crook is attending her.  March seems quite well again.  They have been planting Oats.  Lindy has returned home, & I have sent Mary to the farm to attend on Maria.  A drove of Negroes passed through today.  I wish you had been here to exchange James.  I saw the Drover in the road  & asked him what he would exchange him for.  He said a woman & two children, & you pay something to boot.  He will be back in the Spring.  I received a note from Pamela yesterday by Maj. Eddins.  She has given me no invitation this winter to visit her.  I am glad of it, for on account of my party being put off so long, I could not have accepted it, & now I will not be obliged to ask her to stay with me next summer.  What shall I say to your extravagance.  315 dollars in books.  I can only say it would have been wiser to have extinguished one debt, before you contracted another.  At this rate there is no hopes of my going to town next winter.  There ought to be a general rejoicing among the Lawyers in Greenville, as they all have access to your books.  However I am willing they should, I like to be obliging; only I am sorry after incurring so great an expense, you are not compensated for it by enjoying any superior advantage.  

	As you are a member of the Legislature, you ought to become acquainted with all the members.  Mrs. Keith has spoken highly of you in all her letters, so I would like you to become acquainted with her son Mr. Heyward.  Be sociable.  It would much improve you.  Behave your most agreeable, when you go to see Mrs. Martin & Mrs. Taylor.  Tell them I will go down next winter.  I am glad you are so busy.  From your being homesick, I was afraid you were idle, & had very little to employ you.  Do not forget to go to the person from whom you got the Candle[page torn] & get the Snuffers.  I expect it was Veal, Glaze or Mordecai, but I should think you would recollect.  Butler Thompson ought to be ashamed to go to Columbia, where he owes so much money.  I wonder they do not hold him to bail.  I am glad you were appointed to examine the Law students, for I think it quite a compliment.  Another English Review has come for you but no letters, & no one has come to see you.  Greenville looks very dull.  I know of no news.  Mrs. Jones sent for Mrs. Fabers keys.  I suppose they have bought the place.  Mr. Jones is in Georgia.  I would like to know if Mr. Earle is elected.  I see his brother in law has been.  Alston seems to manage Mamma�s business now, remarkably well.  Aunt Mary Hayne writes word, that she is in such bad health, that she would not be surprised at any moment that she died.  I hope you will be successful in your appeal cases.  You ought to make arrangements with Mr. Bauskett to pay you.  March drove me today, & did quite well.  If you keep him, he must be the coachman.  James had better work entirely at the farm, under Jim & Charles.  He will do more than any other way.  He wont do the work on the lot, & it is useless to have both March & him here.  The Cows are not driven off now, because there is no good pasture for them.  Yours, E.F.P.

Do not come home until the Legislature adjourns, or I wont be glad to see you, after that I will.
