Letter 147

Sunday night, 9 December 1849
Greenville

My dear husband 

		It is just 8 oclock, so I will spend one hour in writing to you.  I have read your letters to Anna & myself, & Willies letter to me, all of which have given me great pleasure.  This has been a rainy day, so we have not been to church.  I finished reading Lectures on the Pilgrims Progress lent me by Mrs. Pearson, & it is so interesting.  I wish you  to read it when you return.  I read this morning in the Bible to Mary, Lindy, Charlotte, Sarah & the children,  & tonight until the Mail came I began the Pilgrims Progress to Mary & Lindy, explaining it as I read.  I am surprised you did not send a letter to Mr. Wells, for you would have had more to write about now, than at first, & the people like news & business matters, more than sketches of character, which you[r] first letter consisted of.  I received the first letter you wrote to come by Mr. Keith Friday night.  He paid me a visit last night, said that he had just arrived, that he was not able to leave Columbia the day he expected, & put your letter in the Post Office.  He went on today to Pickens.  Unless your compliments amount to something in reality, it only provokes me.  What makes me unhappy, is my aspirations for you, & that they are not realized.  It is only your being elected to something honorable that can make me forget your late defeat, so you must embrace the first chance that offers.  I am vexed that you should have declined Genl Adams suggestion , for it is an honour to be a Candidate for Governor.  Even if not elected, you must consent to any proposal made you, & whatever it is, do not think it will interfere with your private interests.  I can attend to them, & I am willing to stay in Greenville, & live economically, so you are honoured, & if you wish to remove to any place, you can sell your property here to advantage, now, property has risen so.  To have a good chance for Governor  you must be �get out soon, so if anything more is said to you, do you consent, for the Salary is good, & for only 2 years will not interfere with your other business, for you have partners, & can have more during that time.  As regards being President of the Bank, I was willing for it, if you are.  It is from the State that with Mr. Elmore, & ever since has been a flaming Bank man.  I was glad to find Mr. Keith was against the Bank, & he says the majority of the people of Pickens & Greenville are.  I had begun to be uneasy about you, fearing you were as usual in a small minority.  I hope you will make an able speech on the subject.  You ought certainly to have dined with the Governor.  I hope you will be appointed Trustee of the College again, that is such a dignified office.  I am glad you are one of the Board of Visitors, & that you think you will be appointed a delegate to the Southern Convention.  Mr. Keith says some alteration ought to be made in the Court of Appeals that the  Charleston Lawyers shall not try their cases there in Columbia so you must attend to this as I wrote you.  Commissioner of Equity ought to be given to the people, but not Attorney General, Controller &c. to the Governor or people.  It would be giving him too much power.  He would favour his friends.  I see you introduced a bill of that kind.  Tom Butler knew not whether we were sick or well.  I heard he arrived one evening, & left that very night again for Columbia.  Now that I think of it, you must get the Sum allowed last Session for the Electors, & which you have never got.  There is one book which I wish you to buy me, & that is, �the Lady Alice or the new Una.�  Mr. Brown said it was one of the best books he had read for a long time, so do not forget it, & if you have money enough buy Ernest Maltravers, by Bulwer.  You have the second part called Alice, so ought to have the first.  In Anna�s letter you Say you have bought my Shawl.  I thank you.  I was going to quarrel with you for getting White, which was expressly what I told you not to get, but as the Shawl is so reasonable I cannot object.  I am afraid it will not suit my other clothes.  I ought now to have a  Winter �.  If you see a reasonable one you might get me one, a dark Silk or velvet.  About the Canary birds, I do not know what to say.  Anna is asleep & has not read your letter.  If you could afford it I would like them; perhaps it is the only chance we may ever have of getting them & four dollars for a p[ai]r including the Cage is reasonable, & you can have the Cage fixed in some part of your Buggy, & must bring up seed, & we can raise the birds.  Aunt Mary Hayne�them, &  can give me directions, so my advice is, if you have the money to get them.  I am glad you are so much pleased with Anna�s letter.  You do injustice to Frank.  Dr. Simons taught him nothing.  The short time he  has been going to Mr. Bradshaws, Mr. Burnham the assistant has taught him to read.  Today he has been reading in a religious Primer, Aunt Eliza sent him some time ago.  When you come back, he will be able to read it through to you, & he loves to read, as soon as a child can read he takes great interest in it.  He said yesterday he wished to write to you, that he would hold the pen, & I must move it for him, & you would think he wrote it.  Frank has too fine a face not to be more than ordinary.  Aunt Eliza was selfish in her kindness to Willie.  Self interest governs her.  Mrs. Isaac Hayne used to be very pretty, though with some defects, a long chin, & bad figure & walk.  I had heard she was faded, but have not seen her for years.  I am glad Col. Hayne & yourself are better friends.  Fanny yesterday morning when she woke up, said, �Ma, Pa sleep here.�  I said �no, Pa is in Lumbia.�  She said, �I want Pa to come soon, I want Pa to come now.�  We all would be very glad to see Willie & yourself, but all I think of is your happiness, & Greenville is so dull now, I am glad you are in Columbia among congenial spirits.  I am surprised you did not write to Mr. Wells.  I sent to him just now to know if he had received a letter from you, & he sends word no.  When you write again, enclose the letter to me, as I like to read it in manuscript.  I have not seen the last Mountaineer.  I put them when I send for them in the Library, without opening them.  The two Mrs. Town[e]s & Mrs. Elford took tea with me Friday evening, & we had a pleasant sociable time.  Mrs. Sam Town[e]s makes any place pleasant. She seems so free from envy, & bad feelings towards others.  Mr. Mauldin says Dr. Simons rejoices now he was not elected, says he was disappointed at first, but he would not be in the power of such a set of men as the Trustees on any account.  He has published a Circular, in which he says, his table will be furnished with the best of the Land, fresh & good from his Farm.  He is looking out for some white man to live on his Farm, & cultivate it on shares with him.  He dined at the Mansion House lately, & Mrs. Forbes says made his story out quite clear, that says the Board of Trustees consists of 10, that 7 form a quorum, that he got 4 votes, & besides Mr. B� wrote a note, saying he must get his & Mr. Roberts who was absent wished him to have his, & yet the Trustees say Mr. Stuart was elected unanimously, that he heard Mr. Stuart�s resignation was attributed to him, but he had no doubt, Mr. Stuart staid here long enough to see what kind of men the Trustees were.  Said you troubled yourself very little about who was elected.  He considers Mr. Stuarts resignation quite a feather in his cap.  Susan Hoke says she heard that a lady who went down in the Stage with Mr. Stuart says, he said he had amused himself with the people of Greenville, but I think this must be false.  He has however acted I think dishonourably & unjustifiably, accepting the place  & then resigning it,when it was not of the power of the Trustees to elect those they might have chosen  & had in their power, if he had not accepted, for Mr. D� who I hear was the second choice, & has been written to, has had a situation now offered him in Columbia, & therefore may decline this.  Mr. Smith also has a place, so Mr. Stuart has prevented the Academy having a good teacher.  His Wifes ill health is foolishness, for it must be the same now, as a few weeks ago, when he accepted.  I would like you to have voted for Arthus Simkins, on account of old associations.  Mr. Keith says Mr. Jones is a candidate for two Offices, neither of which are vacant, Solicitor & Brigadier General.  Genl G� it is thought, may resign.  He is�to be in time.

		Yesterday was very cold, today it has been raining & is warmer, but if it is cold tomorrow, Reuben & Charles will kill the 4 remaining hogs, & so save the Corn.  I have had the Gutters cleaned out.  You had better vote Richard Stone for a Director of the Bank, on account of Tom Butler who has generally been your friend, & Mrs. Stone who is mine. Mr. Keith says he thinks there are more members against the Bank than for it, that the vote that was taken on the subject of the special Committee in which there was a tie, some who were against the Bank, voted on that question with the friends of the Bank.  It is now getting late.  I will finish my letter tomorrow.  When I go to bed tonight, before I go to sleep, many things will occur to my mind, that I wish to mention to you, one sheet will not hold half I have to say,
