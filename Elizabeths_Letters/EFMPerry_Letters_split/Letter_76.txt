Letter 76

Friday morning, 3 July 1846
Greenville

My dear husband

	This is the first day I have sat up, & though weak, I will write you a few lines, so that you may certainly hear from me before you leave Washington.  I wish to reiterate again two peices of advice I gave you.  I have been uneasy about your gold ever since you left.  Do take it out of your trunk, & carry it about your person.  It seems to me it must be safer under your immediate care.  In your trunk it will be impossible  for your eye to be constantly upon it.  The other peice of advice is that you must not go to Columbia to attend the Court of Appeals.  Mrs. Thompson came to see me yesterday, & after what she said, I am more uneasy than before.  She says Judge Butler was very much provoked when he heard of the arrangement.  He knew nothing of it at the time, & thinks the Judges who wished to hold Court in August, ought at any rate to have held it at some healthy place.  Columbia is the hottest place in the world Mrs. Thompson says, & that whoever does attend the Court, will have for safety to go to the Sand Hills every night, & it would be particularly unsafe for one just from the North.  So I hope my dear husband you will consult my feelings, if not your own, & give up all idea of Columbia.  You have too many dependent on you at home,  Your life is too precious to run any risk.  As you have had but one day from home, of course I have little to write about.  Yesterday morning, Susan was so sick Mamma had to go to her, but she returned last night, is here now, & says she will take good care of me.  We had a shower yesterday afternoon which lasted about a quarter of an hour, & one at night of about 5 minutes.  Though so short, I hope they did a little good, & as a commencement has been made, that we will soon have more.  Willie came home delighted yesterday at having got head of his class, & says I must tell you of it.  Frank the morning after you left, when breakfast was ready, put on his bonnet to go to your office to call you.  He cried when he was told you were not there.  He often says, �I want Pa to come now,�  The beds today have been taken down, you know for what purpose.  I feel my dear husband that I cannot write a letter important enough to send to Washington, where you are surrounded with such great men, & have your mind occupied with such great subjects, what I say must appear so trifling & unimportant, as my letter though will contain the intelligence that your wife is better & your children well.  I hope that alone will be sufficient to gratify you.  Mrs. Butler spoilt my only good pen, so that I am not able to write as I would wish a letter going such a distance.  Do not forget to ask Mr. Yancey what he meant by I.W. Hayne being involved in Mr. Joyce�s law case, & the reason he thinks that induced him to leave Alabama.  Write me of everything that you know will interest me.  Tell me where to direct my next letter to.  You must see everything worth seeing, stay as long as you choose, & spend just as much money as you have it in your power to spend.  I would advise you to make your purchases at the close of your travels, just before you start for home, so as to allow yourself the means of going anywhere your fancy dictates.  I will try & manage everything well in your absence, so you must give yourself no uneasiness about home affairs.  When able I will ride to the farm, & read your written directions, & add some of my own, for I think of farmer as well as Lawyer, that I would do exceedingly well, but of course I attribute all my knowledge, to having been  the companion for years of a man of superior knowledge & information & when living with, one could scarce be ignorant on any subject.  I would close with this compliment, but I have a few more remarks to make.  I read all day yesterday
the Museum & nearly read it through.  The first peice was a review of the, �Collected Writings of Walter Savage Landor.�  It was very interesting & spoken of in high terms.  If you go into a Book Store, look at the work, & see how you like it.  If one had time to read a great deal, how much information they would obtain.  If I were to write down, after reading, what I had been reading along, I would never forget it, but as it is, it easily escapes my memory [page smudged] must pursue that course when she grows up, write her [page smudged]�of the book & what she recollects of it.  Books that I read years ago in that way, I recollect now.  My few lines have amounted to a long letter, so I must now recollect that it is the 11th days only & the first time I have sat up, & rest on the bed a little.  You must not be uneasy about me.  I intend to take good care of myself, & be well & blooming when you return.  I wish to be remarked as formerly for my youthful look, & not have it said of me as of others, �how faded she is,� & this, not for my sake, but for my dearest husband�s.  You know how much I always miss you, therefore of that I need not tell you, but I am comforted by knowing, that you are enjoying yourself, & if you only return to me safe & well, I will be rejoiced at the opportunity my husband has had, of seeing the world & being seen by it.  I intend to make the children so orderly in their behavior you will not know them on your return, not by whipping if I can avoid it, but by �speaking gently.�  Your truly attached Wife, E.F.P.
