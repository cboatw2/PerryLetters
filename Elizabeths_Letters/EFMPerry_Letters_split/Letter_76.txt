Letter 76

Monday afternoon, 7 December [1846]
Charleston 

My dear husband

	I will write you a few lines, as I have some leisure moments.  All the morning I was shopping, & riding; rode over the city with Aunt Anna, tonight we take tea with Miss Seabrook & her sister Mrs. Legare.  We were invited also to Mrs. Capers, but were engaged to the other place first.  Saturday evening we took tea at Mrs. Andrew Turnbull�s.  I have determined to leave here next Saturday, stay in Columbia Sunday & Monday & set off for Greenville Tuesday, & arrive there Wednesday the 16th.  About that time the Legislature will adjourn, so I hope you will soon follow me.  I have written to Susan to tell her what time I will be at home, & to let the servants know.  I saw by the papers this morning that Judge Butler had been elected Senator, & I also saw your name mentioned as a candidate for Judge.  I hope you will ascertain beforehand whether you can be elected.    You are so good a judge of elections, I should think you would tell beforehand how it would be.  I will be delighted if you can be made Judge but I would prefer your not being beaten.  However you will act for the best I know.  I have not got through with my visiting yet every day someone comes to see me & yet being always out myself, I have seen not half of my friends.  I have been treated more kindly than I expected, & Charleston seems much pleasanter than it did, when I was complaining at the Hotel & thought myself neglected.  It is delightful to be among so many relations as I have here, relations I think must care for a person more than mere acquaintances.  Klinck has not yet sent in his bill.  He is waiting for a vessel to arrive that contains some of the articles that we wished.  I think he is a good Grocer.  I can write only these few lines, for I wish to send the letter to the office before it closes that you may get it tomorrow.  Today I bought a present for the Aunts with whom I am staying.  I feel under obligations to them & wished in some measure to return it.  For Aunt � is so economical, she must think we have been an expense to her.  The children drink so much Tea, that it takes a good deal of Sugar to sweeten it.  She is as close a person as I ever saw.  She spends just as little as possible, but considering that failing, she has made us more welcome than I possibly thought she could.  Adieu.  Your attached Wife, E.F.P.

Meet me at the Cars Saturday evening.  If I change my mind I will write you.
