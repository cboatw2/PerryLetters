Letter 223

Dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning, & was very much pleased to hear from you.  I would like to write you a long letter, but I have not time now.  I have been writing to your Papa, & your Grandmama,  Aunt Susy, Aunt Annie, Fanny & Annie are all in the room, & I cannot collect my ideas well.  Your Aunt Susy & Annie have .been spending several days & nights with me, & your Grandmama & Aunt Ann come in for the day.  They as well as myself are gratified to hear that you are behaving well, enjoying yourself, & kindly received by your friends.  Opportunities are constantly offering up, I expect, so exercise your own wishes about coming back.  If it is more convenient for you to return before Mr. Elford does, you must. I leave it to you & to Aunt Eliza whose hospitality you must not impose upon.  Your Papa in his letter today says you must suit your pleasure about returning, & your friends, that it will make no difference to him, if Mr. Elford does not stay longer than he told me he would.  He seems a good person for you to come back with, but I wish you to do as you & your Aunt think best.

	I wish you had written me a list of what you had bought, & the prices.  I was waiting for that to decide what to get myself.  A small pair of Cuff pins perhaps you had best get, two pr of Gaiters for yourself.  Have you bought a bonnet? & what kind?  A dress & the Silver Comb, what is the price of the Comb.  I wish particularly to know.  Buy a Cornelian ring for Fanny & Annie such as Fanny had & Mary lost.  Tell me the price of a bonnet such as little girls of her age wear & a cloak of some kind & a hat & Cloak for Hext such as the old one he wears of Franks, or any other kind.  I wish some Stockings for Hext & Fanny, two pr of �for me to wear in the house, two pr of undersleeves for me to wear to church, two aprons for myself, a pr of Gaiter boots for Fanny, & gloves, but these things I would rather know the price first, before I decide to get them.  A dress for Fanny to wear to church also I wish, & if you can bring any pretty patterns of Aprons & Sashes for Fanny & Hext you must, & any pretty apron you see for yourself, or Sashe or Sun bonnet & either buy & have made for yourself or bring the patterns; a waist apron if you wish it get.  When you return home for a long time now, you will need to buy nothing more.  You will be well supplied for an age to come.  I am thankful that your Aunt is pleased with your deportment.  Continue to act as you have done, & when you return set a good example to your brothers & sister.

	Give my love to Aunt Eliza, El� & Wm Ed.  Write to me & beg Aunt Eliza & El� also to.  Your Grandmama & Aunts send their love, & say you will have a great deal to tell on your return.  I write in great haste.  Excuse all mistakes & bad writing, & write better than I do.  Do not follow my example.  I write every day to your Papa which fatigues me &�is talking in the room now, which confuses me.  Give my love to all of my Aunts & friends, & beg Aunt Mary for the Canary birds.

	Be a good girl.  You have a great deal to be thankful for.  Not many little girls have had such an enjoyment as you have at present.  It was kind in your Aunt to invite you to stay with her.  Do not forget to get a present of some kind for your Aunt, to remember you by; one according to your means, & something for Eliza & Sue.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

P.S. Give Mamma Susan & Anna love to all.  I will write you about the Candy & Cocoa next week, & also all I wish got.  I would like to hear the price of what I have mentioned first, but if I if I do not hear soon, will not wait.

Your Aunt Susan wishes two aprons of plaid Alpaca or such as your cousin Susan says are worn & a peice of black silk braid to sew round a skirt.  She wishes strings for the apron.
