Letter 165

Saturday night, 30 November [1850]
Greenville

My dear husband

		I received Willie�s & your letters today & was very much pleased with them.   I wish you would write me two or three letters every Mail in your absence.  They are my only comfort.  Mail days I watch for the hour hand to point to 12.  Tell Willie his was a pretty letter, & he must write me a longer one.  If you buy him so many books, you must buy such as I would like, any works by Mrs. Howitt is good, buy Mrs. Sherwoods works, Mrs. O��s, Miss Sewel�s.  There was a work called Evenings at Donaldson Manor, mentioned lately in the Carolinian, if it is not too expensive get, but it was mentioned as being nicely bound & handsomely illustrated, so I expect it is too expensive, & you will have plenty of use for your money, in other ways.  I do wish you could be elected Chancellor.  The very thought thrills me.  You might have let Col. Dudley nominate you & felt your prospects, even if you did not run.  It is well to be thought of for it, if not now, it will do you good for the future.  I see Col. B.G. Alston nominated for Governor, & yet I am sure he is not going to run, but it is a compliment for him to be spoken of. Do my dear husband if you think there is a chance of you being elected Judge or Chancellor, or running tolerably well, now, it may be of service to you.  Genl Whitner who has been beaten so often, perhaps now will be elected.  Her seems now to have a claim to it, from having been a Candidate so long, but 
You must not vote for Genl Whitner.  He has beaten you too badly.  I hope he will be obliged to continue Solicitor & then that aspirant for Solicitor will be disappointed and otherwise he may not be.  Mr. Memminger I suppose is conscious how interested his motive was in changing in Politics so he feels compelled to give up the Chancellorship.  I wish you could be elected.  It would be wise to let your friends find out for you, how many votes you would be likely to get.  You could ascertain I should think, beforehand  how many votes you would get.  When you ran for President of the Bank, you knew at first you would be beaten, & therefore you ought not to have run.  You always decline too soon.  You ought to let your friends find out, before you decline, what your prospects are, & if they find out they are not good, then it is time to decline.  I am glad Col. Hayne met you kindly.  I heard he was �lent in Politics, so I thought he would look on you as a Traitor & not speak to you.  I dare say you will see nothing of Mr. Taylor & Mr. Martin�s family.  They are very selfish, & even now to have no regard for us, whose house was once offered to them when they were in reduced circumstances  & had no home.  Mamma was like a Mother to Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin, & we were intimate with them�of our own cousins, but I now look upon them as less than strangers,  Eloisa & Sarah are now as cold & selfish as possible.  I am pleased at you fitting out yourself with new clothes.  If sack dress coats had been worn, I would have preferred one to a Frock Coat.  You must get Susan Hokes Music at once, �Roll on Silver Moon,[�] & send it by Mail, that is if it can be got.  I am sorry to tell you that Eliza�s child did not live a day.  It was 5 weeks or more too soon, & owing to her falls I suppose. was outwardly bruised & inwardly hurt, & also Mom Phillis not being here in time, might have been bad for it.  From the fact of its being born alive, I wrote to you in good spirits, thinking it would live, for Mary�s that was so delicate lived 5 or 6 weeks, & perhaps longer if she had been careful, but N� came to see Eliza a few hours after, & as soon as she saw it, said she did not think it would live.  Minerva came out of her room today but has done very little, & I will not give her more to do; let her do as she pleases, but I expect it will�with her as it did before; for I have never known two persons complain as she & Eliza have done.

		Mrs.. Arthur & Miss Lewis paid me a visit this morning. Miss Lewis had on a white Straw bonnet, & did not look near as well as in black.  She talks very little, if no more to Mr. Campbell she will not trouble him much, but I am glad they continue friendly.  I feared the paper & Mr. Campbell to be connected with them might have cooled them.

		Mary has just brought from the office a letter from Mr. George Gordon of Savannah.  He says he has a Mortgage on the Property lately occupied by Mr. Service, that he contemplated foreclosing & you will be so good as to inform him what time is necessary for the Legal proceedings in this State, & how long a Sale may be postponed after obtaining a decree.  He says he does not contemplate a public Sale until September, & not then at any�& positive sacrifice, rather than this he would desire you at the proper time to bid it in for him, & for your general services in the matter, please state the probable cost of proceedings &c.  This is all that is in the letter, so perhaps you had better answer it at once.

		It was suggested to Dr. Simons that it would not be proper for young ladies to speak in a public church, so he is to read the Essays himself.  It rained so yesterday, he postponed his exhibition as he calls it until Monday.  He is to confer Degrees.  He is certainly a great Humbug.  I am glad Mr. Fuller found him out, but there are many here, who would patronize him, just to show opposition to the Academy.  Mr. Brooks children now have left Mr. Davis .  Two of them go to Mr. Burnham.

		It would be bad for the State for Judge Cheves to be elected Governor, as he goes for Disunion, so you had better try & get a more reasonable man than he is.  I dare say his address will have a great effect, in making the State go for Disunion.  I have no news to tell you.  If tomorrow I can think of anything more I will begin another sheet.  I have a shocking pen.  Tell Willie I will write to him & Anna will too.  If you can buy a Male Canary bird bring it to me as my present.  It will be company for me when I am alone, & the cage ought to be used.  The Male bird sings.

		Mr. Rion I suppose was disappointed.  Because he was a prot�g� of Mr. Calhoun he thought he would be elected I expect.  Mr. Calhoun really is to cost the State a good deal.  He would be satisfied if he knew how he was remembered.  You must write to Mr. S� & others here & inform him & them of Politics &c as you have no other way of informing.  I am glad Frank is behaving pretty well.  Tell Willie he must not read books so fast.  He must borrow them from the Book�.  Good night, E.F.P.  Mamma is glad to hear all the news.
