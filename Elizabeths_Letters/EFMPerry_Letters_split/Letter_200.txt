Letter 200

Wednesday morning, 10 March [1852]
Greenville

My dear husband

	I received your letter this morning, & was very glad to hear from you.  Soon after receiving it, I set off & came to Mamma�s, where I am spending the day but fearing you may be disappointed if you do not hear from me.  I have begged writing materials of Mamma.  I wrote a note to Mr. Elford, requesting him to send you the Patriot tonight, as I will return home too late to send it.  I hope he will not forget it.

	I hope Mr. Dyson will offer you a fee large enough to induce you to go to Newberry.  I would like very much for you to return with your pocket book filled with 100 dollar bills.  You might go to Newberry, attend to the case, & return here the middle of the week, & be in time to receive business here.  I could have your Office opened, so that everyone that went in, would come down to the house, & I would tell them to keep their business until you returned, that you would be here the end of the week.  I am glad Mr. Jones is somewhat humbled, though I am afraid, it is not really so.  I am delighted at what has occurred, as now you will never let him be on the footing he was before.  You will never again condescend  to speak to him.  Have you heard that Mrs. Eliza Dawkins is married to Mr. Poole of Spartanburg a clerk in a store there.  He was 20 the night he was married & she is about 40 I suppose.  Mrs. Choice I hear was very angry when she heard of it.  I suppose the family objected, as I believe none were at the wedding.

	You will be surprised to hear that Fanny commenced going to school yesterday afternoon.  In the morning Vardry & Annie went, & Fanny felt that she was debarred of a great pleasure & fretted so, that I let her go in the afternoon, & she came home perfectly delighted, & has gone today.  I am glad for her to be kept from servants, for often she was seated on the ground playing with John & behaving & speaking badly.  This morning she dressed with pleasure at the thought of going to school, & took up her bucket & walked about the house delighted, her sweet face glowing with pleasure.  Hext is well & crawls over the floor.  All are well.  

	Reuben & Charles are ploughing Oats.  No one has been to see you, that I know of.  Gov. Cobb�s Secretary wrote a letter last night saying he had received neither receipt for the money he sent, or the Patriot either, & begging you to inquire into the matter, & to acknowledge his letter & send the Patriot regularly.  I sent the letter to Mr. Elford.   Write again to me, & I hope that you will write that Mr. Dyson offered you the large fee you said you would accept.  Attend to the case the beginning of the weeks.  They can try it Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday at least.  Return quickly in the Stage & attend to your business here also.  I will make Willie sit in the office if you wish it.

	I must now stop.  If you do not get a Patriot, borrow one, & feast on it.  Yours truly & affectionately, E.F.P.

P.S. Mr. Carson talks of carrying all his family to California, but I expect it will all end in toil�.  A Pension for Mrs. Paris has come & an Eclectic. [page torn]
