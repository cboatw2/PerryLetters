Letter 6

Sunday night, 8 December 1839
Greenville

My dear husband

	I have just received two letters from you.  There must have been some mistake in the Mail, or I would have received one last Friday.  I am anxious to see the things you have purchased, but you must run no risk in sending them; wait for a safe opportunity.  Do not purchase the Rattle.  The Waggon (unless it costs too much, for if it costs a great deal I do not wish you to buy it).  You must contrive some way of bringing home.  Could you not box it up, and bring it behind the Stage, as if it were a trunk?  The Waggons that carry cotton to Columbia, are these not returning by the way of Greenville in which you could send a box?

	You have not mentioned Col. Brockman.  I suppose you see him often.  You must not forget Greenville friends.  You are everything to them.  I think you might as well have given Mr. Powell a certificate.  I am not sorry he is rejected.  I feared him as your rival.  I see by the papers your bill has not passed.  
	
	Mrs. Beattie came to see me yesterday.  She said she had heard such accounts of my baby, that though she did not owe me a visit, she had come to see him.  She said Willy is thought the prettiest baby in the village.  That however is no compliment; the baby�s here are so ugly.  Willy might be the prettiest and yet ugly still.  I  think him the prettiest baby in the State.  He has not only pretty features, but he has a sweet, intelligent countenance.  He is so strong, lively, and active.  Mr. Pinckney said the other day looking at him, �you are certainly a wise looking little being,� and Miss Pinckney said, he seemed ready to fly away with animation.  I am shortning his frocks a little, making them all the length of pin� which you may recollect.  They are still a good ways below his feet.  Mrs. Butler, Mrs. Beattie and others say it is time for him now to be wearing Shoes, so if your funds allow of it, I wish to buy him two or three pair of Kid Slippers; you can guess the size.  Remember the bootees that come up to the ankle, but Shoes, with a Strap in the back, that comes�and ties in front.  If you have not money enough (I know it was pretty scarce with you) it is of no consequence.  Willy can by holding on to a Chair, almost stand alone.

	I dined with Miss Pinckney last Friday, and spent a pleasant day.   Willy staid upstairs with the children.  There was no one there but myself.  Mr. Pinckney was engaged all day on business.  I only saw him at dinner, and a short time afterwards.  He seemed depressed.  I know he feels deeply the death of his Wife, though he appears so cheerful in company.  He must feel her loss every moment on his childrens account.  I know not a greater affliction that can befal[l] children, than to be deprived of their Mother in Infancy.  No one can supply her place.  No one else has that instinct, by which she knows at once all their wants, and how to supply them.  Neither do I know a greater affliction that can befall[l] a husband , than to be deprived of a Wife whom he has married in youth, whom he has fondly, devotedly loved, preferred to all the world beside, and to whom he has been accustomed to impart every thought, wish, and feeling.  The loss can never be supplied.  No, not even by a second Wife.

	Mr. Pinckney lent me a Book to read on the �Lords Supper.�  I told Miss Pinckney she must return my visit.  They have things very plain.  It is a nicely furnished house; so comfortless, it has such a bare look.  Large windows glaring open without curtains, a carpet not covering the whole of the room, no fenders &c; a small pine table, in the Dining Room, not even painted, answers as a Sideboard.  Even Minerva said, �Why Mistress. Mr. Pinckney must be very stingy; I never saw such a scant looking house.�  Yesterday the working society was to have met, but it rained.  So they have not met but once since I joined it.

	Mrs. Coleman has been to see me twice, and left word she could never find me at home.  The weather has been such, I have been out twice visiting since you left, and those times she came to see me.  Her little niece (Mr. Young�s daughter) is with her.  I will be so busy this week working, perhaps I will not be able to write again until next Sunday.  Perhaps as it is, I write too often.  I only promised to write once a week, & I have written twice.  I hope you have received all of my letters.  

	I did not know what I was undertaking when I promised Mrs. Butler to make her baby a hat.  She has sent me the size of the head, and it is larger than mine.  That must be my first employment.  I have also a Calico Cloak & Bonnet to make for Willy to wear in the yard; a flannel night dress for him; and some flannel shirts; also to shorten some of his frocks and petticoats; and enlarge his caps, besides mending for myself, and various other things.  Willy will be six months old tomorrow.

	I have been to church today morning and afternoon.  The wind is blowing now.  It seems to be getting quite cold.  Mr. Hooker has at last cleaned the roof of the house, and put in the glasses.  Allan has not done anything yet.  He says he is employed for his master, will come as soon as he can.  Carlos has at last killed the Duck.  Jessie has not made her appearance.  Victoria is well.  Rose gives as much Milk as usual.  The Shoults get their [word obscured] portion of Food, so I suppose are satisfied.  Minerva, Delia and james were delighted with the Show.  For myself, last; though not least; I am suffering a little with pain in my face.  A Wisdom Tooth I think is coming.  I can hardly open my mouth wide enough to eat.

	Mr. Jacobs sends Butter every Friday, and I always weigh it.  Last Friday when the Butter came, we had not touched the Butter of the week before.  I have bought a bushel of Apples.  I like to give them to the Servants every now and then.  They are so fond of them.  I still have some of those left that you bought.  They improve from keeping.  I am sorry Wiliam Hayne is drooping.  I hope his prospects are not so. 

	It is time to go to bed.  Willy is asleep in the Cradle, Delia on the Rug, and it is twenty minutes past ten oclock.  I commenced writing late, so good night my good husband.  Ever Your affectionate wife, E.F. Perry
