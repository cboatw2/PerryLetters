Letter 244

Monday morning, 3 January 1853
Greenville

Dear Anna

	No mail comes today so I have not heard from you, but I cannot let the day pass without writing to you.  We again have bad weather.  Last week was tolerably good, & yesterday we were able to go to church, but this morning after breakfast it commenced raining & has now set in for a bad day.

	Willie & Frank & Fanny all set off for school today.  Fanny went to Mr. McKay, but the day being bad only the Brooks, two of them & Rebecca Croft & Harriet Crooks were there. So Mr. McKay said school would not commence until Wednesday, for tomorrow a snow is expected to be here.

	As the Baptist college does not commence until February we sent Willie to the Male Academy with Frank, but that school does not commence until Monday.  If we like it, Willie can continue there, but if he does not improve, we will send him to the college when it commences.	  

      Mr. Hillhouse keeps school in Dr. Irvines building back of the Baptist church.  Mr. Gailliard I believe is not going to keep school.
      
      Today I intended sending or carrying my box with my Cloak to Mrs. Robinson to take to town for me, & I have enclosed in a letter to you, my gold chain, for you to wear with your Medallion, when you take tea out, & a gold pencil case I bought once for myself, but it was too large for a lady, & I have never used it.  I send it, that you may make it a present to your cousin William Edward from yourself, as a proof that you feel grateful for the kindness he has shown you, since you have been under his Mothers roof.  If he has no gold pencil case. Give it to him. but if he has one, this will be of no use to him, so I will think of something else for you to give.  I will write you about giving Aunt Eliza a present, & also Eliza & Susan.  I will send the letter enclosing the pencil case & chain by Butler Thompson, who carries down Mrs. Robinson or by anyone I can hear of going before.  I hope I can send it soon.  I will tomorrow, if the weather permits go up to Mrs. Thompsons to carry the box & letter, & inquire when Mrs. Robinson goes.  
      
      I hope you are satisfied & not disappointed your Papa is not going down as he first intended.  His being sick, & Aunt Eliza, Eliza, & yourself all writing to ask you should stay, I have written & suppose you have received the letters, saying you might.  I hope your longer stay will enable you to see those friends, who have been in the country, & perhaps returned by this time.  What do your friends think of the Daguerreotype?  Do they think yours a good likeness?  None of the others did justice.
      
      I would be very glad if you would learn to embroider& embroider clothes for yourself, & Fanny, Hext & your Aunt Susy�s children.  If not too hard you must learn.  I wish you could learn as you grow older every kind of work, like your cousins Eliza & Susan.  It makes you so useful, & happy, & it is such a resource & makes the time up pleasantly.  I hope in time you will knit, Crochet, embroider, & do every kind of work, so if convenient, commence now, & learn as much as you can while in town.  If it does not give your cousins trouble to teach you, you are so quick in everything I think you can learn easily.
      
      You will be perfect in playing your peices on the Piano, practicing them so much, perhaps you will learn a new peice.
      
      I am afraid the box will not come for a long time.  A box your Papa packed in Columbia when he was there, has not come yet.  The bad roads cause delays.  You will have to hang up a bag for Fanny, if you expect the box of furniture to surprise her.  A stocking would be too small.
      
      Your Papa is getting a great deal better.  Give my love to Aunt Eliza, Eliza & Susan, & thank them again for being so kind to you.    I am glad you were able to visit alone.  You will learn to be independent.
      
      Annie slept here night before last, but she would go home yesterday, or I would have kept her longer.  None of your Grandmama�s family were able to come in to church yesterday.  Your affectionate Mother, E.F.P.

I sent you 8 stamps.
