Letter 240

Tuesday night, [1852]

My dear husband

	Tonight Reuben said that Kossuth ploughed well, & that that good quality ought to be mentioned in the advertisement.  I do not know what kind of advertisement Mr. Elford has written, but perhaps you had better write such a one as you would wish, & give it to Mr. Elford to put in next weeks paper, for someone then may buy him to use on their farm to plough.  He certainly is fit for nothing else, though perhaps some person who understands breaking a horse, may in time break him, but I very much doubt it, for he seems by nature to be a[n] obstinate bad horse, & I cannot understood how Mr. Redwood can be a truthful man, & at the same time say, Kossuth was a good Buggy horse.  I am truly thankful you are going to sell him.  I have not had a comfortable ride since you owned him.  Selim & Hocky  will do to draw together, until you sell Selim & get a fine pair.  Perhaps H��s�you can buy & use with him, but I would rather be without horses, than have such a one as Kossuth.  He is not worth his food.  Goodnight.  Write by Mr. Elford, E.F.P.

Benjamin Perry
