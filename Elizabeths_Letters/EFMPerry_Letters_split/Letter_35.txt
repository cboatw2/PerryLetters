Letter 35

Tuesday night, 3 December 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	Again have I seated myself at the desk to write to you, & this time literally nothing to write about.  But as I know you will be disappointed if you do not hear every Mail, I must even try & make out a letter.  I write to you at night, because in the day, it would be impossible for me to write, & at night too.  The children are all asleep, & I am undisturbed by them.  Ever since I received Pamela�s letter, I have been engaged preparing for my visit, mending clothes, & putting our own clothes in order, so that I have been completely occupied.  I sit up working until 10 oclock every night, sometimes until eleven.  I have felt in an uncertain state all the time, not knowing really whether I was to go, but tomorrow night my suspense will be ended, as I indeed hope, my preparations will not have been in vain.  If you say I must not go, of course I will not, but it will be a sore disappointment to me, & I think when you know how anxious I am to go, that you will consent.  The change will do us all good, & I hope you will not object.  I will arrange everything at home, to go on as if I were here, & I feel that when I come back, I can take a new start, & do better in housekeeping, managing servants, children & everything else.  A little freedom from care for a while would do me good, me especially, who have so few changes.  So do write word that you gladly consent to my going.  You must not be contradictory & refuse my going, because you find my heart is set on it.  Which you know is what I often accuse you of.  I would like to go tomorrow week, the 11th.  I will set off after dinner, stop at Goldsmiths the first night, & go to Mrs. Cunninghams the next day.  I will go slowly, so as not to hurt the horses, & Jim can [go] back with them, unless you would prefer his returning without them.  If your letter tomorrow night says that I had better not go,  think over the matter well & in a subsequent one, reverse the decree, still I will not leave home without your consent, & will now drop a subject which I am sorry I have dwelt on so long, but when you consider I have no one to talk to all day, & when I write to you, I think I am talking to you, you must excuse me.

	Mr. McKay came day before yesterday for your office key, that he might get some papers, connected with the Dunham & McBee case, which he thought you had to enable him to collect Costs.  When he returned the key. He said he could not find the papers.  He supposed they were in your trunk which was locked.  So I suppose you will get that money soon.  You must not write you are tired of Columbia.  You ought to be glad to be there, & must be contented, & think of nothing but your duties, until the Session is over, & remain at your post, until the very last moment.  As you have always complained of having so much to do, I should think that you would be pleased that in the Senate, there is so little done.  The Senate may not be so interesting & amusing as the house, but it is certainly a more dignified station & I should suppose you would rather be there, but as regards enjoyment & ease, I should think there would be the same difference between the Senate & house, as between a large crowded party, & a small select one.  In the former, we always find the most pleasure.  In the house too, a person who is fond of speaking, has greater advantages, for anything he would say there, would appear well, while in the Senate he must be more particular, & only speak when he has something important to say.  He has therefore few opportunities of distinguishing himself.  So what opportunities  do occur, you most embrace.  You were a distinguished member of the Lower house & I know will be of the other.  I feel that the state will do better, with you in its Councils.  Your abilities ought not to be concentrated on your family only, they ought to be used for the benefit of your country, as they now are, & so my dear husband, do not think of your Wife, children, servants, horses, Cows & pigs now, but think for what you were sent to Columbia for & for three little weeks, forget home.  Home will take care of itself, & goes on quite well without you.

	I suppose Mr. Duncan, Ware & Walker like sensible men are enjoying themselves.  You do the same.  I hope you become acquainted with Mr. Wm. H. Heyward as he is my cousin, & the son of Mamma�s intimate friend.

	You must feel strange at first in the Senate, & miss your old associates in the house.  My dear husband, as this is somewhat of a lecturing & advising letter I will tell you of the only virtue which I do not think you possess, which is ambition.  I think you are the least ambitious person I ever saw, but I hope in this respect you will improve, & if you do not naturally possess, you will cultivate that virtue, for virtue it is, when directed in a right course, & possessed by a good person.  

	Genl Thompson came to me, when he heard of Uncle Haynes death, to know the particulars.  He seemed particularly anxious to know, in what circumstances he left his family, & was glad to hear Aunt Eliza had friends who if willing, were able to assist her.  I have nothing as you see to write about.  I wonder at your wishing me to write so often, but as you say you wish it.  I am willing to write.  I am in hopes the [page torn] so constantly from home, will make you happy & contented.  One winter I would like to go with you to Columbia, take Willy with us & go in one carri[a]ge so that I would ride out constantly.  It will be delightful, perhaps next winter I can go.  So in anticipation of my company next winter, you must remain satisfied now alone & then when you come home, you will have so much to tell me.  It is worth leaving home, to come back.  I feel sorry for Col. Townes whenever I see him.  He looks so dull.  He must wish himself with you all.  Your family are all well.  From your Wife down to the youngest pig, with the exception of the mashed pig.  We churn so often with Flora�s milk alone, that when we use the other Cows Milk, we will not have to buy Butter.  The servants have given me no trouble.  Mamma�s family are as usual.  I have been there, & Susan comes in as often as she can.  Mr. Pinckney described Anns case to Dr. Brewster, & he says he is afraid mothing can be done for her.  Ann yesterday received a letter from a lady in Philadelphia who has spinal affection, & who Mr. Pinckney saw & requested her to write to Ann.  No letters have arrived for you, except Mr. Bancrofts.  The Power of Attorney for Mrs. Baker has not come yet.

Monday morning.  I will write a few lines today.  I this morning received an invitation from Mrs. Earle to her daughters wedding, which takes place next Tuesday evening.  Mrs. & Miss Jones have just been to see me, & Miss Pinckney has paid me a visit who I like so much.  I am so sorry they are to leave Greenville.  They will go early in January.  After having several rainy days, the sun is shining most delightfully.  I hope to be gladdened by a letter from you tonight.  You must write me all the news.  Ever yours, Liz

Benjamin Perry 
Columbia
