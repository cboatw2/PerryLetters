Letter 35

Monday morning, 20 May 1844
Greenville

My dear husband

	You see I have broken my promise, (not to write to you).  I am afraid you will be very angry as you think, the mind once made up, right or wrong, it must never be changed.  I hope you will forgive me this once.  I�ll try & not offend again.  It is charity to you that induces me to write, for I know how much at a loss you must feel now, having been three days without receiving any advice.  I must write a book for your especial benefit, containing advice on every subject, which you can constantly apply to when absent from me.  I think perhaps it is the want of this that has made you pursue such an inconsistent course, partly a Union man, partly a Nullifier, partly a Whig, & partly a Democrat.  You think a little with each party, & belong to no party whatever, & no party owns you, or supports you.  This is owing to your making up your mind on different subjects when away from me,  After consulting me, you find you are wrong, but having made up your mind, you can�t change it, & therefore pursue a course which you know is against your interest, & perfectly calculated to advance the interest of others.  However advice is to end my letter not commence it, so I will now tell you all the incidents that have occurred since you left, & as what is last said produces the greatest impression, close with the advice.

	When you requested me to write the same day you left, I told you I would have nothing to write about.  I might have had something very serious, for you had been scarce gone ten minutes when the Market bell rung, & there was a cry of fire.  Nothing alarms me so much except an election in which you are concerned, as the cry of fire.  Everybody seemed rushing round our corner, so I knew it was near us.  It was Mr. Murphy�s house.  A spark from the chimney set the roof on fire; fortunately it was put out immediately (long before the Engine arrived), or there might have been an extensive conflagration for the wind was blowing high at the time in the direction of the village & everything as dry as tinder.

	As soon as the alarm of fire was over, I dressed & walked to see Mrs. Faber.  I thought she would expect it.  Miss Lynah & herself were very glad to see me.  They said I looked well, & not like the Mother of three children.  Of course to seem still younger, I told them that I had had four.  Mrs. Faber said you looked quite well.  Miss Lynah will stay with her Aunt at Flat Rock until her Father�s family come up & then return here & pass the summer at Pattons.  Mrs. Faber has not hired her house.  Mr. Lowndes changed his mind.  The afternoon I spent at home & sent Willy & Anna to Mamma.  They were very glad to see them; said they looked & behaved sweetly, assisted in fanning Ann, & Willy has commenced planting a little garden under the drawing room window, which every day he wishes to go to water.  Just before supper Mr. Barclay came to see me & spent the evening.  He told me Mr. B� had sent for him to sketch his child, & as soon as he returns he is to paint what he sketched, so I am glad he has another engagement.  He went Saturday on Plough boy.  A letter came for you Friday night from Mr. Leitner, though it must have been in the office before you left.  On the back was the request, that if you had left, it might be sent to you.  I sent it to Col. Townes.  He said it was too late that night to put it in the Mail. But he would the next day.  A Hamburgh Journal also came, sent I suppose by Mr. Yancey, as it announces him as a candidate for the Legislature.
