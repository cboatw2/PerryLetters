Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived here this evening safe & well.  We had a pleasant time coming down.  Dr. Crook, Col. Wilson, McKay, Donaldson& many others aboard the cars.  We had to walk a part of the way & have our baggage changed where the terrible wreck occurred.

	I left Wiley at Newberry C.H. & he will return Friday.  I gave him three dollars to pay his passage back.

	We came very near being left this morning by the cars.  The omnibus was so long behind time.

	Jann[e]y is here & very kind.  I have seen Col. OHanlon.  He enquired about you all.  I saw Buist who enquired about Willy & says if he will read Homer he can enter Junior class very easily.

	I have bought a Raylin $20 as good as Sudd..at $30 pants $9.00 vest $6$1.00.  So I am clad for the winter.

	I have four letters to write this evening, & therefore must bid you good night.  I saw Col. Perrin who told me he would have the Bonds here.  I paid Dickeys money $1000 to Col. Goodwyn President of the Bank.

	Take care of yourself & the children & I will try and take care of myself.  I lost my trunk containing the ponbut found it at Hunts Hotel & all is safe.

	Let Wiley purchase some shucks for corn feed.

	Kiss Arthur for me & give my love to all the children.  Write to me in Charleston.  Mr. Arthur was aboard the cars & Jeter & his wife.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
