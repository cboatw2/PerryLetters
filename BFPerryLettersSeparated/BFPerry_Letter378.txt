Letter 378
5 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & Willie will go up in the morning.

	The Rail Road Bonds draw interest from 1st July last.  I have the two Col. Perrin sold me in my trunk.  Captain John Westfield has just offered me two at 80cts in the dollar, $850 for two Bonds worth $1000 & $35 Interest due 1st Jan[uar]y.  He is to wait with me till 25th December for the money.  I have agreed to take them & he is to give them to me in the morning.  He is on his way to the north& says by making sale of them to me he can raise funds of Cox to go on.  Tell your mother to write me immediately to have the money ready.  She can take the Bonds at what I give.

	I have just given Willie $25.00 to go & buy the furniture for his room of a student who is leaving & sells cheap.

	Willie will tell you all the news.  I will write to Col. Orr tonight about Frank.  It will be pleasant to have Frank provided for for life.  Willie can make his way at the Bar.  Hext will go into the army.  I am congratulated by all the Professors in having a son in college.  I think they will respect Willie on my account & that he will do well.

	I am very anxious to return home & would do so with Willie if I had not agreed to dine with Mordecai.  I know he has made large preparations & it would disappoint him.  I may go up tomorrow week.

	I have rece[ive]d a free ticket on the Charlotte Rail Road & now they charge me nothing on the Charleston Road so I can go where I please on the rail road without cost.

	Nothing of great interest occur[r]ed today in the Legislature.  I spoke a short time on the amendment of the Constitution.

	I thank you for your favorable opinion of our childrens exhibiting my talents.  You ought to tell them that they inherit talents from both of us.  It is well for a great man to have a great wife as much so as it is for a great woman to have a great husband.  The children partake of the talents of both.

	Mr. Pinckney has left a package for Susan which I will send by Willie.

	I must now close my letter & bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
