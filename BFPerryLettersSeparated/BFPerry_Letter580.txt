Letter 580
18 April 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I felt so much fatigued with the Convention that I concluded last night to stay here today & go to Charleston in the morning.  Mr. Janney urges me too to stay & take a family dinner with him & his daughters which I have just done.  He treated [me] to champaign & had rather a better dinner than usual.  Most of the members have gone & the House is lonesome.  We have had a fine rain & I hope most sincerely it has extended to Greenville.  I have spent the day in reading Life of Jackson & writing a letter for the Patriot.

	This morning whilst I was talking to Col. Watts & Simpkins a gentleman came up behind me & slapped me on the shoulder.  I looked round & who should it be but Governor Adams!  I felt very much like meeting a dead man & my eyes filled with tears.  He looks very well!  He seems full of life & spirit & says I must go down from the Court of Appeals & stay a while with him.  Dr. Geddings told him last winter to go home & prepare to diethat he could not live six weeks.  Dr. Fair told him he might live two or three months & perhaps not so many weeks!  He attributes his recovery to pills given him by Northrop of Charleston.  Dr. Fair thinks however that he is not cured & cannot be cured.

	  I rece[ived another invitation to stay at a private house in Charleston.  Mr. Pope said B of     Virginia was to stay with him & some others.  He had still one room left & invited me very kindly to come & occupy it.  I told him I was engaged to Dr. Porcher.

	I sent you a bundle from Mrs. Taylor by Duncan who went up this morning.  Duncan returns Saturday morning.  I suppose I shall not hear from you this evening as you expect I am in Charleston.  The rain will make it more pleasant travelling tomorrow & more pleasant after I get to Charleston.

	I will write to Frank this evening or when I go to Charleston.  Being all day by myself I wish I had gone home & returned Saturday.  But by going down I shall see more of the members.

	I hope you and the children are all well.  I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  I have just thought of a fix McMeekin of Greenville was in the other day in the Cars.  He & his wife who was a Charleston woman separated some years ago.  He went to Texas & got a divorce.  Then he went to New York & got married again.  He & his last wife got on the cars at Spartanburgh to go to Charleston & who should be aboard but his first wife!  They had to travel all the way to Charleston together.  Was he not in a bad fix travelling in the same car with two wives? and seated close together I understand!  His wives had an opportunity of seeing each other.  He must have thought the journey a very long one!
