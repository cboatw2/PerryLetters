Letter 235
5 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I have been all day today engaged in the Gardiner case, which will be tried or commenced next Monday or Tuesday.  I have been at the law office of Bradly & Carlisle with Dr. Gardiner & Col. Gates.  I am going back there as soon as I write you a line.

	On my return to dinner General Thompson informed me that he had made a contract with the Indians.  We are to have five hundred cash any how & five percent on a half million if we succeed.  This is a pretty good fee.

	I will write you again tonight.  My room is full again & I must stop.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
