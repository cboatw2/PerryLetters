Letter 315
16 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few moments to write before going down to the night session, from which I may not return in time to write you.

	I will send you an editorial to read & send up to Elford.  But, now, it just occurs to me that the cars do not run tomorrow.  I shall have all day Sunday to write you.

	This evening I met old Mrs. Ioor & Mrs. Edwards her granddaughter I believe.  I was going to pass by Mrs. Ioor not noticing her till she spoke.  I was glad to see her.  She came down last Monday I think.

	I have just seen Dr. Irvine & Col. Irvin on their way to Florida.  The Dr. has not yet said anything in reference to his sessions case.  I have not seen Mrs. Irvine.

	Mr. Leary is still here & wishes to settle in Columbia.  I saw young Douglass with him.

	We had quite an animated discussion today in the House in which I participated on the SavannahRail Road.

	There have been a great many robberies here.  Col. Irby lost one hundred & thirty three dollars last night, stolen out of his pockets whilst asleep.
