Letter 264
3 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College & will write you a few lines although it is now ten oclock in the night.

	Willie & Anna arrived here this evening about half after four. I went to the depot at three& found a good many waiting for members of their family.  The cars came filled with women kind principally.  All Abbeville came down.   Mrs. Jones & Betty Robinson were aboard.  Janneys House is like confusion compounded.  I gave up my room to Anna, Betty Robinson & Flora Jones.  They are stowed away very comfortably.  I took shelter with Duncan & Elford..   They gave up one bed to me & Willie.  But since that Willie & Willie Beattie have got a room in the garrett.  Duncan told me that Jones was very much effected by my kindness to his daughter & Betty Robinson who were roomless.  He proposed speaking.  I told Duncan I cou[l]d do nothing about it & had no objections.  His wife refused to look at me when I spoke to Betty Robinson.  Flora seems very kind.

	Willie & Anna got down safely amidst the crowd.  Miss Perrin sent her brotherto come & take a seat by her.  She is a very interesting young lady.  I left Anna under her chargeI went to College.  Mrs. Trotter enquired very kindly after you & Anna.  The room is full of ladies.  Col. Carn has his wife here.  There are several ladies from Newberry&c.  Anna has already rece[ive]d a ticket to the Governors Ball.  Col. Wheaton presented me with a ticket as one of the aides de camp.  I think Anna had better go to Balls.  She will see & learn a great deal.  I will let Willie go to the commencement Ball.

	Professor Lewis R. Gibb[e]s of the Charleston College has been elected Professor of Mathematics in the South Carolina [College] in the place of Professor Williams who is paralyzed.  We made the election this evening.  Dr. Gibb[e]s of this place invited me to his party last night but I did not go.  Notwithstanding my Editorials in the Carolinian the Dr. seems friendly & kind.

	I will send Anna to see Mrs. Taylor. Tomorrow we go to church.  The next day is commencement.  Col. Herndon saw Anna this evening & was pleased with her.  He said she was a fine specimen of Greenville
.
        I will now close my letter.  Duncan is just going to bed.  Elford is writing & will return home Monday morning.  It is now almost eleven oclock.  I will write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
