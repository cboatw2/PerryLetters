Letter 86
29 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I received your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  I had received no letter from you the mail before this.  I hope you & Willie have rece[ive]d the letters I wrote you some days since.  Tell Willie he must answer my letter.  Col. Summer enquires after him & I told him Willie said he must send his dog.

	I forgot to mention in my first letter that something passed between Choice & myself about swapping your mothers carriage for his.  He has a very large one coming on from New York, & intends keeping the present one for himself.  I told him it was not a suitable carriage for a gentleman, & that Mrs. McCall had one that was & did not suit her, that his would suit her & that probably they might make a swap.  He promised me to look at it.  His carriage would suit your mother very well & is remarkably cheap.  It cost only $325.00 harness & all, delivered in Hamburgh.  I think it a very fine carriage for a family & would suit your mother.  When I return I will endeavour to make the exchange if your mother desires it.

	I have been writing letters all day today to my friends in Pickens.  Keith sent me a long list of names to write to.  I think it is the best & easiest mode of electioneering.

	Last night I went to the Theatre with Major Henry, Col. Ware & Mr. Duncan.  The performance was only tolerable & the theatre is an old & uncomfortable building.  There were not more than one hundred persons in it.

	Tonight a boy brought me a letter & said that a man below was waiting for an answer.  I broke it open & it commenced Dear Father.  I looked at the signature and saw C.C.P.  I then turned to the superscription & saw it as directed to Col. Benjamin Perry.  I felt very sorry at the mistake.  It is very likely some of your letters may be sent to my namesakes room, & he will commence reading about Col. Orr & the rail road & Laurens & Anderson and suppose his wife has gone crazy.

	I have really nothing of interest to write you.  I did not go to church today.  Edward did go twice.  He put on his Sunday coat & looked quite neat.  He does very well but is rather small to be of much service at so crowded a table.

 	Major Jones came to me the other day to borrow fifty dollars, & said he was out of money.  I told him I had none to lend nor have Iyou must not speak of this however [page torn].

	I am very anxious to see you all.  Fanny cannot be sweater than she was when I saw her last.  How I should like to be with you all this evening.  I told Col. Ware that I thought [if elected] I should stay in Congress about six monthsthat I could not bear the thought of being from my family.

	Mr. Simpson came here tonight on his way to Washington.  He says Mrs. Simpson will go on in May next.

	Tell Pamela [Cunningham] if you are writing to her that I shall value very highly her present.  Mr. Calhoun & Burt are expected here tomorrow.  If anything occurs tomorrow I will write you again.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
