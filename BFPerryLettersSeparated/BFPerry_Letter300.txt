Letter 300
2 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees and it is now after ten oclock.  Wilie & Frank arrived here this evening safe, whilst I was in the State House.  I barely saw them before I started to the College & now they are just going to bed.  They went to the circus whilst I went to the College & Frank is greatly pleased.

	I hardly had time to read your long letter.  You have certainly got on a way of sermonizing.  I am always the same.  I do not believe that religion consists in being scared, or on the authored observing of religion.  I never expect to get to Heaven by going to church & saying prayers.  To be religious you must be good, in all the relations of life, & do your duty assigned you on this earth.  We must control the evil impulses & passions of our nature, & be kind to all & assist all we can help.  We must learn patience & endurance & long forbearance, & be content with out lot on this Earth because it is Gods will we should be here.

	There is a great crowd in Columbia tonight.  All the professors in the Furman University are here.  Nothing was done in the Legislature today buy make minor elections.  Your kinsman young Peroneau who sent back the Patriot so promptly is a candidate of assessor of Charleston.  DeSaussure came to me to enquire if I was supporting him & to announce him as a candidate.  I replied that I was not.  [Theodore Dehon] Wagner attempted to electioneer with me.  I voted for Dawson [on] the first ballet and the second ballot for Johnson, a brother of Judge William Johnson of the Federal court.  No election is yet made.  Reed & Fair have been reelected solicitors.

	The Speaker Simmons paid me a high compliment tonight.  He said he had no doubt about a question of order till he thought I doubted it.  That made him hesitate.  He knew I would not attempt to deceive or mislead him.  I must now conclude my dear wife by hoping you are in a better mood & not so [two words interlined, illegible].

	It has just occurred to me that the cars do not go tomorrow.
