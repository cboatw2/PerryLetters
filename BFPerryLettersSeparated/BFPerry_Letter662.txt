Greenville

My dear Liz

	The news from Charleston was not so bad last night as we expected.  But the fall of Charleston is pretty certain in the course of ten days.  The fight on Saturday was a very hard one & a great many killed.  It was renewed Sunday night & we have not heard the result.  If the Enemy was driven from Morris Island, Charleston is safeif not the city is gone.

	Your mother spoke to me last night aboutgoing up with Hext.  Shewas unwell  & you promised that she might go up.  Hext can bring her back in the buggy with Bill when you wish her to return.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  Lees army is in a critical situation but I think will succeed in getting out,

	I miss you very much & long for you to return.  But have no doubt you are making the servants do better thao if you were here.  I must try & come up & see you.  But the cxommissioners meet today & will be in session a long time.  I will send the& hope it will reach you safely.

	Give my love to the children.  I have just made $50 for advice.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
