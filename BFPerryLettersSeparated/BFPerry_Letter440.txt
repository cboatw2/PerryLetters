Letter 440
30 November 1857
Harvard College

Dear Anna

	I was disappointed in not receiving a letter from you on Saturday, the day on which I usually hear from you.  But I will write you a few lines, as you say you want me to write you once a week whether I hear from you once a week or not.

	My letter will have to be short for a very obvious reason, which is, I havent anything to write about.
	I have been enjoying the luxury of a holiday for a few days past, in consequence of this last week being Thanksgiving week.  Thanksgiving day is a great day in this part of the country, and is as much thought of as Christmas is among us.

	I received a letter from Pa the other day.  He is now in Columbia.  He had a run off as he went down but no one was injured.  But I expect he has written to you since he has been in Columbia.  This will be the first Commencement that I have not attended in Columbia for a good many years.  No doubt there will be as large a crowd as usual at it.

	I went yesterday to church three times in Boston, which shows how religious one will be when he is not compelled to attend Church.  In the morning I went to hear an Abolition preacher, but he didnt touch much on politics.  After dinner I went to hear a man who pretended to be in a trance, and to preach while in that state.  He merely shut his eyes, and preached away.  He was a spiritualist, and preached on spiritualism.  He also delivered a poem, pretending to be influenced by the spirit of an Italian poet.  It was all humbug, but no doubt would have delighted Gen. Thompson as he believes so strongly in Spiritualism.

	I went to see Mr. Winthrop the other night, which I think will be the last of my visiting.

	I will close this letter for want of room and words.  You must write to me as regularly as possible.  If I were you I would drop some of my correspondents.  Your affectionate brother, W.H. Perry
