Letter 389
10 February 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	I have written you two letters & desired information from you on both of them.  Your neglect in answering my letters is not only wrong, but wanting in this respect you owe your Father.  I hope you will not do so again.  Your letters to your mother, Frank & Anna is not a sufficient excuse for you.  They contain very little information as to the College, Professors, your studies & associates.

       I am very much pained to hear of the distrust once in College.  All who are concerned in these riots & disorderly conduct ought to be expelled at once.  They should be cut of from the College in order to prevent their cr[u]el example from influencing others.

	Honor & duty, the highest sense of honor, should make every student conform to all the rules & regulation of the College when he enters it.  He who violates them willfully does not possess an honorable heart.

	I charge you as my son & as you regard my love & your own honor & happiness & prosperity & success in life to keep aloof from all such conduct & from all who are guilty of such conduct.  Do not go out of your room at night.  Pursue your studies diligently.  Be obedient to the Professors, kind & civil to all of your fellow students and strictly keep & obey all the College laws.

	I gave you a letter to President McCay.  Did you deliver the letter?  Has he said anything to you in reference to it?  How often have you been examined by the Professors.  How did you stand your examination?  How do you like the College & Professors & Students?  Who are your most interesting associates?  Do you keep a regular account of all your expences?  When you are in want of money, let me know & what you want it for.  But do not go in debt for a single day.  This has ruined many a young man in college.

	You ought to have written who were suspended.  Their names will be reported to me as one of the Board of Trustees in May next.  It cannot therefore be kept a secret from me.

	Let me know how Buist, Hayne, Wardlaw, Cain, & Memminger are doing.  I hope none of them are engaged in the disturbances of the College, for I know them & their Parents & feel an interest in them, & also in Simons & Pinckney.

	I am glad to hear you have a good roommate & I shall always feel an interest in him on your account.  I think you did well to get off the first story wherefrequent & Thiery break through & steal.

	The College here is doing well.  The have one hundred & fifty students and a prospect of three hundred.  The Female college has seventy five.  Anna & Fannie & Frank & Hext are doing well and studying hard.

	I am sorry to say your mother has been unwell.  She had a high fever Saturday night Sunday & Sunday night.  Was confined to her bed till Monday morning.  She then came down stairs & lay on the sofa.  This morning she is better & no return of fever.  I hope it has passed over but I was yesterday very much afraid she would have a severe spell of typhoid fever which I dread as much as the smallpox.  It has been so fatal to the families of both of my brothers.

	I rece[ive]d yesterday a piece ofwedding cake and was shown a likeness of him & his bride both very fine looking.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Mr. William Hayne Perry
