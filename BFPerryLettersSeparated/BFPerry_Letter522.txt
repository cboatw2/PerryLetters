Letter 522
19 March 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you & the Picture of the Preble ship this evening.  Your letter was very gratifying, & I hope you will determine to persevere in your studies.  Let Decatur & Perry whose lives you have been reading, be your models & try & imitate their virtues.

	I go in the morning to Pickens Court & am not writing to you in the dining or sitting room & your mother at my side.  The children have just gone upstairs to wash & go to bed.  They are making a terrible fuss in their ablutions.

	I returned from Anderson Court Thursday evening.  We had bad weather & not a great deal of business.  One night after I had gone to bed at Anderson a musical band came & serenaded me & called for a speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  I had to get up & dress & make a short speech.

	We are all well & anxiously expecting the time when we may see you once more.  I am glad to hear you have grown so much.

	I must now close my letter & write one to Willie.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
