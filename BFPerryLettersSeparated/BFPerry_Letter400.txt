Letter 400
21 August 1857
Boston

My dear Frank

	We all arrived here yesterday evening & found Willie & Col. Memminger quite well.  They went out to Harvard College this morning & commenced their studies.  Willie caught a cold last night by going to the Theatre.

	I went to the Post office last evening soon after I reached here to get a letter from you, but found none.  We will return to New York in a day or two & write you to meet us in Baltimore as we may not be able to get down to Annapolis.  You can come up to Baltimore & stay all night with us & go back the next day as we go on to Washington.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies & making yourself a good boy at Mr. Greens.  You must behave yourself well, study hard & be obedient to Mrs. Green.  Keep out of all bad company.  We shall be glad to see you in Baltimore if you do not go to Annapolis.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  Give [page torn] our love to Mrs. Green & tell her to make you recite your lessons every day to someone.  If she can employ someone to instruct you & hear your lessons I would be glad.

	We are about riding out to see the city of Boston & I must therefore close my letter.

	God bless you my dear son.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Your mother, Anna & Willie send their love to you.

Mr. Frank Perry
Annapolis
