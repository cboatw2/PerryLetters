Letter 286
4 May 1854
Columbia

My dear daughter [Anna]

	I have rece[ive]d only one letter from younone from Willie or Frank.  Tell them they must write to me.  I am anxious to hear from you.  I hope however you are all getting on very well.

	I do not know when I shall be able to return to Greenville, perhaps not before your mother returns.  I am very busy in the Court of Appeals & next Saturday I have promised to go down to General Adams, fifteen miles below Columbia & stay till Monday.

	Your mother write me that she just sent you a long letter yesterday.

	You must write me how you get on with your household, and all about the children the servants, the horses &c.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
Greenville
