Letter 671
27 November 1863
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Recei[ve]d your letter this evening with hat & coat.  I am glad to know you are relieved on the scare of Alfred & Johny.  I had noabout the matter.  I knew the story was false.  I knew there was no motive to run off for the negroes are better than being free & I knew it was impossible for them to make their escape.  I am sure both Alfred & Johny will consider themselves greatly slandered.

	Polk Mauldin is here sick & goes up in the morning.  He has been in the hospital in Richmond & has a furlough for thirty days.  Mr. Boyce goes up in the morning to bring Mrs. Boyce down on Monday.  I have not yet seen or heard of Col. OHanlon.

	You must feed the cow better & she will give more milk.  Dont write to me about her anymore for I cannot help it.  If we have got a bad bargain it is too late to remedy it.  I acted for the best and that is enough & should satisfy you.

	I have just returned from the committee & it is now near eleven oclock.  I have no news to write you.  Lee, Fair, Trescot & myself made speeches on the death of Col. James Perrin which you will see in the papers.

	I think I wrote you that General Jones told me that Vardry McBee would be admitted into the military school.  Tell Susan to have him ready.  Tell Fannie I have not yet been to see Hallie C.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
