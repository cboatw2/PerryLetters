Letter 195
27 November 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter this morning & will not write you again, though I do not know when you will receive either of those letters.  The mails are all irregular& no doubt you began to think hard of my neglect.  Before you received my first letter.  I hope to hear from you again tonight but I do not know how.

	The cars below here ran off last night & killed Col. Richard Singleton & his grandson Van Buren, crip[p]led a great many other passengers & did other mischief.  This is a most horrible accident.  The rail road or culvert gave way, & cars, passengers & engines were all mashed up together!

	Anna & little Ellen Janney have just been in my room.  She seems very well satisfied but expresses a wish to go on to Charleston.  The weather & uncertain condition of the road here prevented me looking out even for an opportunity to send her.  I will carry her to church tomorrow, & Monday let her see Columbia, & then send her to Charleston.  My time is so much occupied here that I cannot pay any attention to her in the day time.

	We did nothing in the Legislature today, but elect solicitors commissions &c.  Jones was elected treasurer.  No one of any consequence was a candidate.  DawkinsBonham were reelected solicitors.

	The weather is now cold & likely to continue so.    Mr. Keith speaks of starting on Monday.  He is to call for the Greenville delegation tonight & give us an oyster supper.

	Anna took your letter this morning & read it & returned it to me this evening.  She says that she has written to you today.

	Col. Beaufort Watts asked me yesterday if Williams & Dyson had paid me $1,000 for a fee in the case of Scurry.  He said William promised him to do so.  I told him Dyson had paid me $500. & perhaps Williams might yet add $500 more.  The Col. expressed a great hope that he would.

	I have not heard or seen anything of Gladden & I shall draw on Hill for the $100 if not paid shortly.  Col. Brockman said he had the money to pay his note but he begged me to wait till holiday in January.

	I will now close this letter & write you again tomorrow if I have time.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
