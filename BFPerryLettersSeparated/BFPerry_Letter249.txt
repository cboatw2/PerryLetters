Letter 249
18 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you this morning whilst at Bradl[e]ys office before going into the court House.  General Thompson brought it to me but rece[ive]d none for himself.  Your letter was dated Saturday & Sunday & you stated that you had not rece[ive]d any letters from me Sunday morning.  I am always sorry to hear that you do not rece[ive] a letter from me, or that you have rece[ive]d two or three at once.  I am afraid you tire in reading them when so many come at once.

	I am glad to hear that Anna is like her papa & does not desire honors & distinctions.  Anna is a smart little girl & I have always thought she was a remarkable girl for her agesensible & affectionate.   Willie, too, I think will be like me & let honors sent him instead of hunting them.  He will I hope, however, will be like me in another respect & improve him mind & cultivate his nature, & moral feelings.  Frank is a chop of good looks & good principles & will be a favorite everywhere.  Fanny I think will make a great woman & a very handsome woman.  Hext has his tallents to devellope yet & god bless the little fellow.  How I would like to see him.

	I am not able to give you any good news as to Gardiners case.  We have made more progress today than any day heretofore.  I hope we shall get through next week.  I will make my speech first & leave.  It will take a day for each one of us to speak.  General Thompson is prepared for the worst & has his address already written to publish & in case Gardiner is convicted.  But I will never give up till a verdict is found.

	If I were to come to Washington to live I would like very much to have Elford as a partner.  I have no doubt at all that we could make a fortune here is a few years in various professional pursuits.  Bradl[e]y and Carlisle are making a small fortune every year.  Carlisle lives like a prince as I wrote you.

	I hope something good will come of my visit to Washington.  I ought to be compensated for my absence from home & from my dear wife & from my children.

	I am glad you have Susan with you.  do not hold everybodyat all.  I pity her & commiserate her condition.  But her misfortunes are owing into her want of worldly wisdom and patience & suffering and Christian forbearance.  By fretting at everything we soon become so that nothing can please us or satisfy us.  But as you say I must think with you on this subject & will promise to do so like a good husband.

	I will write for the Patriot.  But I am so much engaged that I can see nothing to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
