Letter 577
15 April 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely yesterday evening & sent right away your bundle to Mrs. Taylor.  The boy told me Mrs. Taylor had something to send me to carry home &c.

	My trip down was pleasant.  Elford, Gaillard & Stewart were on the cars.  At Newberry Dr.  & Col. Fair got on the cars.  I saw Wiley.  He seemed very well.  Dr. Mooney came aboard at Alston.    Col. Orr was detained at Laurens court.  There are only two delegates here yet from Charleston.  There is however a crowd of persons at this Hotel from all parts of the country, New York &c.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seem very kind & enquired much about you & Fannie, Willie & Frank.  Today she showed me a letter from Lulas teacher as I had shown her Franks letter.  The letter gives Lula a lovely character, highest intellect, & fairest loveliness.  Mrs. LeConte said she would very much [like] to see Frank.

	Mrs. LeConte gave me a most interesting account of Mrs. Charles character & history.  She would make a fine story for anovel.  I will tell it to you when I see you.  It is most extraordinary.  Best say nothing.

	Dr. Talley dined with us today.  His brother is building a fine House for Miss Thompson.  I was mistaken, she never was married but has tried often.

	I met Dr. Laborde & Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts who enquired after you kindly.

	I did not go to church today, but read life of Jackson.  Your uncle Arthur is frequently mentioned in the account of the battle of New Orleans and favorably.

	I saw Mrs. Lipscomb on the cars.  Col. Pickens daughter.  She has grown stout & looks well.

  	I bought Lord Elgins mission to China.

       Dr. LeConte says Judge Longstreet is not going to resign.  The college is doing well.

       Mrs. LeConte asked me what sort of fellow Willie said Memmingers son was.  Shew had heard he was curious.  She had heard about him in Paris.

       I wish you & Fannie were with me.  You she ever saw.  Old Dr. LeContes son is to be married.  The old Dr. is very ill & can[not] live long.

       Give my love to the children & believe [me] your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
