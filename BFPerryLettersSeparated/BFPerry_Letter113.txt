Letter 113
Wednesday morning, [18 October 1848]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines to inform you that I shall be detained here all the week.  I have been employed in several very important cases, both in law & equity, since I came here and in them will receive handsome fees.

	I was employed on Monday in a very exciting case by Mr. Richardson of Sumter, whose boy drove the carriage against Mr. Barksdale.  Barksdale immediately commenced an assault on the negro boy and Richardsona dish on Barksdale.  They both indicted each other & the boy was indicted.  Richardson is a gentleman of large fortune & was returning home with his mother in law Mrs. Spann the sister of Mrs. Colonel Calhoun & their families.    They were detained here two days.  Many of my friends came to me & told me not to defend Richardson & his servant that it would injure my election.  I replied that I should think meanly of myself if I shrunk from Professional duty on that account, that I was always disposed to do my duty, be the consequences what they may.

	I did not know Richardson, but he had seen me in Columbia & knew me, asked my professional assistance as a stranger &c.  I became acquainted with his wife, who is a very handsome & pleasant lady, & in her manners very much like her cousin Miss Calhoun.  Mrs. Spann reminded me a good deal of her brother Warren Davis.

	We had a large public meeting here yesterday at which I made a good speech.  Col. Orr also spoke & General Whitner, Sullivan, Young, Irby & Summer.

	My election is going on well as I could expect, though I have been too busy to electioneer any.

	I was at the Episcopal Fair last night & bought some little thingsa needle case for you & a pair of mit[t]s for Anna & some candy for Frank & Will & an emery for you.  I saw Mr. Arthur.  The church is a very pretty one.

	I recd your letter by Elford.  Mrs. Rowland must make Hodges pay the note.

	I have not seen or heard from Captain Cunningham and send no money except $30 paid me by Richardson for defending his servant.  His own trial put off till next Fall.

	The great equity case I mentioned to you & have been employed inalso in one other case involving eight negroes to assist Col. Irby.

	In great hastekiss for me the children & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
