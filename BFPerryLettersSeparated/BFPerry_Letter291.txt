Letter 291
14 May 1854
Charleston

My dear daughter

	We are all well & will start to Columbia in the morning. Perhaps we may be at home Wednesday or Thursday evening.  Your mother has been shopping a great deal  & has purchased a great many pretty things for all of you.

	I will write you again when I get to Columbia.  Tell Frank I will write the next letter to him.

	This is Sunday morning & I have just written a long letter to the Patriot.  I must now go to breakfast.

	We are very anxious to see you & the children again & to be at home.

       Hayne has grown so much you will hardly know him.  Kiss Hext for me.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
