Letter 570

Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter last week and was glad to hear from you.  Your mother & myself & your sister & brothers all take a deep interest in receiving & reading your letters.  And it gives us inexpressible joy to hear you are doing well in your studies,

	We are all well & your grandmother & aunts & family are all well.  Hext has gone to General Thompsons to stay with Preston for some time. Mrs. Thompson has gone to New York.  The General is at home.  Preston seems a fine boy.  General Thompson is going to teach Hext whilst he is there.

	Warren Perry & Hawthorn paid us a visit last week, and Ithe fancy to Warren for his horse & gave $90.00.  His Horse is a fine one, the fastest trotter in the village, & will march Bill.
& dear to your family.
	Edward Stokes returned the other day & took dinner with us.  I like him very much.  He seems a fine young man.  He goes back to Harvard the last of February.

	Willie does not seem inclined to become an Editor as you propose.  Nor do I wish him to.  I wish him to be a lawyer and not a politician.

	The weather has been very warm here but is now cold again.

	I hope you will write to Col. Ashmore.  He is a good friend of yours & takes an interest in you.

	I am my dear Son your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
