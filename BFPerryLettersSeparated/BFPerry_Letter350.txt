Letter 350
16 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I thank you for your letter & desired to have answered it sooner, but I have no time to write to you except on Sunday.  We very often sit in the Legislature till midnight & yesterday we met at eleven and adjourned Sunday.  Monday weafter twelve in the night!

	I was glad to hear you were enjoying yourself so much, & your little friend & her father were so much pleased to see you.  I hope she will come up next summer and stay with you.  You must remember me to Mr. Cain, & tell him I often think of him & should be pleased to meet him again.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last night & she enclosed one of your letters to her.  Willie staid with me till last Friday.  He returned from Charleston on Saturday after you left him.  Your mother has written you all the Greenville news.  I shall go home Thursday morning.

	There are no ladies at the Congaree House now.  They all left a few days after you did.  I sent up your writing desk by Willie.  It is a beautiful thing & you must take special care of it when you return home.

	Flora Jones has gone to Barnwell & is going to Montgomery with Mrs. Allen to stay with Mrs. Yancey.  I met her & Sally Thompson at a great Ball at Col. John Prestons.  It was one of the most splendid entertainments I ever saw.  Susan Hoke went home the day after you left.

	Frank writes me a letter every day or two & his last one was quite a long letter, and he gave me a good bit of news.

	I have ordered the Patriot to be sent you.  Mr. Elford has purchased the Mountaineer & the two papers have been blended.

	I must now conclude & go to dinner.  I think of you & Susan Hoke very often when I start to my meals.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
