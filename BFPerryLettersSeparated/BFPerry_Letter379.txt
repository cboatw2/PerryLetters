Letter 379
7 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & a cold rain day & I will spend it in writing instead of going to church.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from Fannie & one from Anna to Willie.  I am glad Willies admission into college gave you all such pleasure.  It is a high honor to enter junior class.  I hope Willie arrived safely at home last night & told you all about Columbia.  All who saw him were pleased with his appearance.  Burt regretted very much not seeing him.  Yeadon did not make his acquaintance which he regretted.

	I have not seen Col. OHanlon but twice.  Yeadon enquired how old our youngest child was & on being told six months, he said he was afraid that it would be a long time before his namesake would make his appearance.

	I have written to Col. Orr about Frank & told him you had your heart very much set on the appointment.

	Tell Fannie I thank her for her letter & she must write me another.  Tell Frank if I come home next Saturday he may go down with me on Monday.  I am anxious to see you all & Sunday is a miserable to spend in Columbia.  I shall get back on Monday to sit in the evening.  There is nothing, however, before the Legislature in which I take much interest.  It will cost me nothing to go & come back, & it will be delightful to see you & the children once more.  It seems almost an age since I left home.  So many things have taken place.

	I gave my note to Westfield for $850 for the two $500 Bonds.  I am to pay the 25th of December.  I shall write Elford to make payment by that to me.  Westfield has other bonds to sell but he asks &12.50cts more for each one of the others which is what I gave Co. Perrin.

	Tell Anna to write me.  [Peter] Stokes says that his little daughter writes him almost every day.  Tell Hext I will get him some presents & Hayne also.  I almost forget how Arthur looks.
	I saw Paul Hayne yesterday evening.  He is lecturing here, & says he is coming to Greenville.  He looks the same & enquired about you all.

	Tom Jones came down the other day & said he wanted Frank to come with him.  I see Pools son here.  It seems that almost one half of Greenville has been here.

	Col. Al[l]stons wife & daughter came up yesterday he says to console him in case of his defeat for governor.  But I suppose to enjoy the pleasures of his election.  She is a very pleasant lady & smart.  Most of the ladies have gone & amongst them Mrs. LeConte who was a great Belle & dresses most magnificently.  She seems [word obscured] ambitious of the notice of gentlemen as if she was a single lady wishing to make conquests.  I admire her husband a great deal more than I do her.

	I was invited the other evening to a large party at Captain Adam but did not go.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Theodore Croft wishing the appointment of aid to the Governor for Edward.  He writes most urgently.

	I have seen nothing of Alex Taylor or his family.  General Martin I see every day.

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot.  Must stop to have my room cleaned up.

	The members all seem astonished that I can find time to write my wife every day.  If they loved theirs as I do mine they too would find time.  But I do not tell them so.  Indeed I think most of them care very little about their wives when absent.  We are a model couple.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
