Letter 218
17 February 1853
Washington

My dear Liz

	I have just arrived here & it is now nine oclock in the night, but before retiring to rest, I will write you a few lines.  Mr. Burt with whom I am rooming has just gone to bed.  General Thompson has gone out somewhere & will probably come back late.

	I wrote you in Columbia & will now continue our journey & its incidents owing to my persuasion.  Thompson agreed to come by Charleston.  He was anxious to take the stages.  Burt told him I was very self willed & would have my own way about everything & he had better yield.   It was well we came the Boat rout[e], for we should have been delayed one day on the other rout[e], besides travelling seventy miles on stages.

	We fell in company with my friend Thompson the boot merchant in Columbia & several other merchants going north.  In Charleston I passed from the cars to the Boat without stopping.  I met Dr.in the Hamburgh cars & a great many other acquaintances.  Just as I was getting out of the car a woman came up to me & proposed putting herself under my charge going north, which I most uncivily declined on the ground that I was otherwise engaged.  Who she was I know not & did not ascertain, although she went on with us as far as Weldon.

	We passed through Wilmington without stopping.  General Thompson saw none of his friends there.  The evening I wrote you in Columbia he came to my room & wrote one page I noticed, whilst my letter contained Three.  I thought to myself he had been married only two years & I had been married fifteen.  Several amusing incidents have happened which I shall not have time to write.  When we got into the cars & on the Boat it was mentioned by someone that we were General Thompson & Major Perry.  Shortly afterwards a man by the name of Perry went up to Thompson & said he looked so much like his Father that he supposed they were somehow related, as they were both of the same name.  Thompson told him that he was mistakenhis name was not Perry and that my name was Perry.  The young man replied that he thought I was General Thompson & requested him to introduce him to me that he [k]new the family of Col. Jones into which I had married & that he understood I was a great Whig.  General Thompsonhim & said if he had taken me for a Whig he would have got into the wrong box most decidedly.  He had made the same mistake that Perry did.

	Yesterday at Suffolk in Virginia a party got into the cars.  Amongst them there was a young lady to whom General Thompson gave his seat by me & went into the baggage cars.  She enquired who the gentleman was who was so kind & on my telling her it was General Thompson, she observed that she knew him from character & that he had married a Miss Jones.  When the cars arrived at Portsmouth I escorted the young lady to the Boat & found that she was on her way to Washington in company with a friend & his family her relations.  We came on to Baltimore together.  I introduced General Thompson to her & we spent our time very pleasantly on the boat with her.  She proved to be a Miss Ballow & looked very much like Judge Cheves daughterespecially Mrs. McCordquite intellectual & handsome.  She said I reminded her very much of Governor Graham of North Carolinaboth in manners & appearance.  We also met on the boat a daughter of Commodore [James] Bar[r]on who killed [Stephen] Decatur in a duel.  She is married to a Captain Prendergrast of the Navy.  I made her acquaintance.  She lives in Washington & gave me a very pressing invitation to call & see her.  She was in company with Col. Payne of the Mexican Army & who was one of the commissioners thatin the Gardner case.  After I had been introduced to him he told Thompson that he had been more anxious to see me than any man in the United States.  He said pretty much the same to me the next morning & we have become quite gracious.  He has been summoned as a witness in the Gardner case & came on to Washington with us.  Miss Ballard also knew me when told by Thompson that I was the Southern Patriot.  Thompson said to Burt today that I was the most popular man in the Southern States of all the South Carolinians.

	In Baltimore we staid three or four hours.  I paid Redwood his money $517,36cts.  I bought a fine sack coat for $20 & six shirts for $12.00.  Burt & Thompson also fitted themselves up with clothes.  Baylis Crayton passed through Baltimore yesterday.  We reached here after dark& I have seen no one but General McQueen of South Carolina & General Hamilton.

It is said Gardner will not only be acquitted but vindicated.  Col. Payne has no doubt of his innocence.

	I hope you & the children are all well & getting on well.  It seems like a month since I left home.  I should like very much to see you all.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow & I will write you again tomorrow night if I have time.  But if the Gardner case is taken up I may not have time.

	I am quite well but will take some pills as I lay down to sleep.  Burt is now snoring at an awful rate & will prove an unpleasant roommate I am afraid.

	I must now stop & write Elford a letter for the Southern Patriot.  My whole passage here has been only &213 or 24 dollars!

	Kiss the children for me and tell Anna I will have her locket attended to & your broach also.

	Yours truly & sincerely.  Nothing special as to the President or his cabinet.  B.F. Perry
