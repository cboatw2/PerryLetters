Letter 470
28 February 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received no letters from you last week.  This we regret very much.  You ought to write once every week.  I hope however to receive a letter from you Monday night.  This is Sunday & I write you every Sunday.  But hereafter I shall be on the circuit & may not write you for two or three weeks.

	I suppose you have seen Willie & received your trunk of clothes & cake.  He left here yesterday & expected to visit Annapolis Monday or Tuesday.  He will tell you all the news from home.  But he is not, however, much of a news monger.

	Your mother says you must not let your cake get you any demerits.  She is afraid that you will have visitors at unreasonable hours.

	We received your drawings last week & all thought them very good indeed.  You have a talent for drawing but you must not let it occupy too much of your time.  Do not neglect your other studies.

	I am very anxious to go on & see you immediately after my circuits are over the last of April.  If I can I will do so & return to the court of appeals in May.

	Anna is about the same.  She does not seem to improve any.  Some times better & then worse.  I have great fears about her health.  All the rest are well.  Hext & Hayne are going to school to Miss Powell.  Fannie goes to the Academy or Female College.

	Your mother will write you in a day or two and tell you all the news.  I have none.

	Another month has now passed by & we shall soon receive another report as to your progress & deportment.  I hope it will be gratifying.  You do not [know] how much we all love you, & desire to see you successful in your studies.  You have a fine situation, & thousands of boys would be glad to be placed as you are.  Think of that & improve your time.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
