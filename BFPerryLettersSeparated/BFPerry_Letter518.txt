Letter 518
27 February 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letters last week & your drawings, and if you only knew the pleasure they gave your father & mother I am sure you would try to study hard & be a good boy.  Your examination was a good one & your drawings are fine.  I do think you ought to have been higher in drawing, or your fellow students have great talents in that line.  We were all delighted with your drawings.  Your improvement in your standing will make us more glad to see you in June.

	You must now determine to go on improving & take a high stand in your class.  Do not let other boys outstudy you & take off all the honors of your class.  Be as good as any of them, & show that that you have as much talent.  Keep up the honor of old South Carolina in the naval school and do honor to your family.  There is more pleasure & happiness in being well & good than in being ignorant & vicious.

	Willie left here yesterday morning & I suppose you have seen him or will before this letter reaches you.  He carried a trunk full of presents to you, and I am afraid they may direct your mind from your studies.

	We are all well but still in great affliction.  The death of Anna has been a severe bereavement to us, & to the whole community.  She is never out of my mind, and it seems I can never get over her death.  I would give worlds if I could restore her to life & see her once more.  But I hope my dear child we shall all prepare to meet her in Heaven as she requested.  The tears are now flowing so rapidly from my eyes that I must close my letter.  Your affectionate & loving father, B.F. Perry
