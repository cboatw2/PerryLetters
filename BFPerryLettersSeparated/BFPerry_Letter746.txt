Letter 746
25 August 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I have not yet finished the cases of Taylor & Herrick.  The Judge charges the Jury in the morning.  Corbin & myself argued the cases today & spoke about two hours each.  I have no doubt of the result, not guilty.  But my clients are terribly scared.  I told them I should charge the $200.00.  Herrick paid me $40 & said he would pay the balance.  I made a great argument & have the Judge & Jury with me.  But all future is uncertain.

	I will ride out this evening if I can get time, but I am very much fatigued & had to leave the Court House as soon as I got through with my argument.  I went back however & heard Corbin out.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
