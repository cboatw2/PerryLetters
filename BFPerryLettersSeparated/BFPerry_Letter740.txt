Letter 740
6 March 1867
Greenville

My dear Sir [Col. T. Edwin Ware]

	You once said to me many years ago not to sue you on your note & that you would regard it as a debt of honor.  I relied on your promise & still rely on it.  But in times like the present I must ask you to secure the debt in some way.  I do not ask you for the money though I am greatly straintened in my circumstances & hard pressed.  I think you ought to secure the debt as you have that of others not older than mine or of a more sacred character.

       Please call & see me.  I am with great respect, yours truly, B.F. Perry
