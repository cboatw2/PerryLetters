Letter 703
20 September 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your first letter the other day & thank you for it.  I would write oftener but I have not one moment of spare time.  I have only had time to go to the Convention twice.  Tonight the Board of Trustees meet.  I am all my time receiving visits, & signing applications for pardons & reading letters.  The Charleston Courier has published my message with complimentary notice.  I have recei[ve]d two Camden papers highly complimentary which I will send you.

	The Conventiopn is getting on very well & have agreed to most all of my recommendations or will do so.  I have telegraphed the President several times & he is pleased with our proceedings.  I am generally spoken of for U.S. Senator & there seems now no doubt of my election.  Who will be Governor is unknown.

	Willie made a speech the other day in the Convention.  He was chairman of a committee & made a Report.  Then he was called on for an explanation & he had to get up & explain.  He did very well.  I was present.  The Convention sustained his Report by a very close vote 56 to 50.

	Miss Maggie says she will go up with us.  Lula declines.  Willie has been to see both of them.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow.  Give my love to all the children.  I would write you long letters but I have not time.  M.  is absent & I cannot see him about the wheat.  It is foolish to be allarmed about the negroes & asking for a guard.  Your afectionate husband, B.F. Perry
