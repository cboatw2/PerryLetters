Letter 461
17 January 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received Captain Blakes Report of your studies & conduct last night which mortified your mother & myself very much.

	You have sixteen demerits in December!  What are they for?  Let me know.  The first month you had only two & the second month six.  Now you have sixteen!  This is advancing most rapidly in bad conduct.  I thought the longer you staid, the less your demerits would be.  Young Daly only had ten in one whole year at the military school in Charleston.

	But in your studies too, you have gradually fallen off.  In Arithmetic you have fallen from 68 to 89, in Geography from 26 to 57, & in Grammar from 26 to 39!  This is too bad.  You must study harder.  If you love your father & mother who love you so much, be a good boy & study hard.  Do not spend your time idly.  Keep to your books constantly & be sure you have got every lesson well.  Get Mr. Bradford to instruct you in your lessons.

	You must remember my son, that your happiness & success in life depends on your good behavior, industry & hard study.  If you are dismissed from the school you are a disgraced & ruined boy.  I have no property to give you & you have to make your fortune.  By great exertions & good luck I have placed you at a school where you may do well & succeed in life.  Turn over a new leaf & resolve to do better.  What would the people of Greenville say to you coming home in disgrace, dismissed from school.

	I was pleased with your letter to Anna & made an extract from it for the Patriot.  The people of Greenville have a high opinion of you as a good & clever boy & you must not disap[p]oint them.

	I hope you will write back to me, how it is you have got so many demerits, & have fallen off in your studies.  I hope too that you will write that you intend to do better this month & every month.  You do not know with how much interest er look forward to your Reports every month.

	I suppose Willie will be with you about the time you receive this letter.  If he keeps you from your studies he had better not stay more than one day,

	We will come on & see you in June.  And it will be such a pleasure to find you doing well.  Anna thinks she is improving.  But she looks pale & has a bad cough.  All the rest are well.

	Write soon to your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
