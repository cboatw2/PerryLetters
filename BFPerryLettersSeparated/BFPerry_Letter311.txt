Letter 311
15 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was not able to write you last night.  The Legislature did not adjourn till near eleven oclock in the night.  The Blue Ridge Rail Road was under discussion.  I was engaged in Court till half after one when Mr. [Thomas Martin] Wagner came for me to go & open the debate.  I made a short speech in favor of the Bill.  But I was too much fatigued to do justice to the road or to myself.  It is inconceivably perplexing to be running from the Courts to the Legislature.  I am first on our court & then in the other & needed in the Legislature all the time.  In this way I am not able to do my duty in any place.

	I am now writing to you in the House of Representatives and persons are passing by constantly & stopping to talk.  But I am afraid tonight it will be as it was last night.  The Blue Ridge is still under discussion.

	On going home last night I met your uncle Col. Hayne again & he walked with me to my Hotel.  He said he had heard my speech.  He seems very kind.

	I read your letter last night & think with you that I had better come home & go with Anna to Charleston.  It will be much more agreeable to my feelings to return home & see my wife & children than to go a differentafter the adjournment of the Legislature.  It will be better for Anna likewise than to come down alone or with some stragler.  Mr. Elford is in Charleston & will not return to Greenville till after the Baptist convention on the 20th.  I saw Mr. Pressly this morning who informed me that he left Elford in Town yesterday.

	If I have time I will write you again tonight after receiving your letter.  We adjourn next Thursday.

	I wrote Mr. Yancy the success of his case.  I have also succeeded in Major Seaborns case & wrote him too yesterday evening.  It gives me pleasure to communicate good news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
