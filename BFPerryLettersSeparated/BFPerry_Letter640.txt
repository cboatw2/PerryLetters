Letter 640
[ca. 25 November 1862], Tuesday
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have nothing special to write you.  You will see all that we have done in the Legislature in the papers.  I have seen a good many of our friends who all enquired after you.  Judge ONeall, Judhe W, Judge Duncan, Col. Isaac Hayne, Col. Aldrich &c.

	Hext is enjoying himself.  Mr. Janney told him he was glad he had come down & should charge him nothing.  I have not see Col. OHanlon or Col. A[rthur] Hayne.

	I have a good room with gas lights & shall not need the candles.  I have been busy all day attending to business for others.  I will go & see Hattie C tomorrow.  I saw Governor Pickens on his return from Richmond who told me he had written for Mrs. Pickens to come down & meet him.  He is staying at Janneys Hotel so I shall have the pleasure of seeing Madame.  I met Dr. LeConte this morning.  They are all well.  Col. Isaac Hayne said he saw a family likeness in Hext.

	I will write to General Easl[e]y to send fodder & shucks & about ex salt.  Tell your Mother Tupper said to me he would send her interest by me.

	I think it likely we shall have a short session & perhaps I may return home before it is over.  My Bill about impressing food & cfor food &for soldiers wives will come up tomorrow.

	I will enquire about your Mothers Bank Certificate & send Hayne to see Mrs. Taylor.

	The Hotel is very much crowded & Board $12 per day!

	The election for Commissioner is exciting some interest.  The letters of Th to the Post Master General & all the cdictions have been published in& distributed by Ashmore I suppose.  Mistress Moore is electioneering strongly for her husband.

	We had a robbery in this Hotel last night and one man lost $1,000.00 stolen out of his room.

	Take care of yourself & household & I will try & take care of myself & Hext.   I carried the watch to have mended this morning.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
