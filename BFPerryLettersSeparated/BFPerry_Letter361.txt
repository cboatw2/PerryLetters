Letter 361
6 May 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and also the bundle & thebox to Mr. Reynolds who goes down in the morning and who promises me to see them delivered to your aunts.  The Box to you, came up this morning, Mr. Wells says he will take it up in the morning.  I have put him in charge of it.

	He told me this evening that he had carried a receipt for you to Dr. Boatwright & it made four bottles.  He paid $2.00 & that you took only one of the bottles & returned the others to him.  This was a most untho act on your part.  To oblige you he gets amode , & because it amounts to more than you desired, you leave him to pay the $1.50.  He said he knew I would pay it when he mentioned it to me.  I did pay him.  You can send & get the other three bottles.  Dr. Boatwright asked me how you liked the preparation.  He said it was the best preparation of the kind that he had ever seen.  I never heard anything about it & could tell him nothing.

	I shall probably return home Thursday.  The Board of Trustees meet Wednesday night, & I shall not stay to my subsequent meeting.

	You can tell Willie to say to his college friends that I have not yet seen the Governor.  He was to come up tonight or in the morning.

	I got your preparation for bed bugs & will bring it up with me.

	The convention adjourned this evening after appointing as delegates to the Cincinnati convention Governor manning, Pickens, McGrath, Gadberry, Porter, McBeth, Wilson, Dudley, Moses, Farrow, Orr, Brooks, Sullivan, Palmer. Allen & Brown.  I could have been appointed but I could not have gone without a great sacrifice.  My business would have been ruined for the next Court of Equity.

I must now conclude my letter & go to bed as I did not sleep much last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
