Letter 354
Ca. 1855

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write to say I shall not be at home before Thursday evening.  Strouds case will not come on till Wednesday.  There was a good deal of business here.

	You may meet me at the depot Thursday evening.  We had a pleasant trip down Sunday morning.  Yours in great, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
