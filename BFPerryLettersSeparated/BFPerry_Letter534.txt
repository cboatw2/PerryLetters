Letter 534
4 June 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you a draft for $25.00 to assist in paying your expenses home.  You wrote for $15.00.

	We are all well & longing for the time when we shall see you.

	I have to tell you of the death of Miss Flora Jones!  She died this morning of cholera morbus.  Yesterday she was walking about.  But had been very sick.  Poor girl I wept when I heard of her death.  It reminded [me] of dear Anna.

	I have nothing more to write.  I am in a great hurry.  Your affectionate Farther, B.F. Perry
