Letter 227
27 February 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	Last night after I had gone to bed, they sent me from the Post office two letters from you & one from Sam Earle.  I was greatly relieved when I received your letters.  I had not heard from you for three days which appeared to me a very long time though I suppose there are many members of Congress who do not hear from their wives once in three weeks.  Your letters were dated Saturday & Monday.  General Thompson received one of the same from Mrs. Thompson dated Friday.

	This is Sunday & I am to fine with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  He has a fine library & collection of paintings & General Thompson says he has invited some friends to meet us there.  I find my little respect paid to the Sabbath here & very little going to church.  Very near to this Hotel is a very large Episcopal church which is under the charge of Mr. Butler whose wife figured so conspicuously  in the Anderdanck trial.  He is a clergyman of decided talent & eloquence.

I do not think your mother would be pleased boarding out & I am afraid Susan will not be.  Though I am in favor of your mother selling her House lot if she can for a fair price.  Real estate and every species of [property] has risen very much lately & is still rising.   Negroes are selling in Virginia for $1,200.00.  Women are worth $1,000.00boys 10 years old $800.00.  Major Miller & Willborn Perry who came on to purchase negroes here returned without buying, and stated they could purchase much cheaper in South Caroline.  Lands are rising everywhere & it will be a good time to sell.  There will be a terrible crash in the world before many years in consequence of these high prices & speculation.  If I can get a high price for my house & lot, I might be induced to sell with your consent.  Everything here is very extravagantbeing further north may be cheaper.

	You speak of wishing to go to Charleston in the spring.  I am very willing if we can provide the ways & means of going there & to the worlds fair both.  But I wish you to go there & see the world.  We will make a northern tour & you will be better pleased with Greenville.  There is nothing that makes me better satisfied with home than to go from home provided they have good sense & a good heart.

	General Thompson came in last night & informed me that he had seen the Cherokee chief & was about to be engaged by them again, & if so he would share his fees with me.  I hope something favorable will result from my visit.  I do not regret my trip however if nothing comes of it except my seeing the world & the great men of the world.

	This week I shall return my visits & see Mrs. Blake & get Anna medallion filled.  How much I wish to see you alllittle HextFannyFrank, Anna & Willie & yourself.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
