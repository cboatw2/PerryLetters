Letter 263
1 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have but a few minutes to write you before breakfast, & will conclude my letter after breakfast.

	Last night I went to the meeting of the Board of Trustees & did not return till late.  Just before starting I met Dr. Campbell who brought me a message from Hopkins Williams that he would be down this week & pay me a few in the case of the State against Scurry.  This will be [a] good break if the old man does pay me $500.  I met Redwood last night & paid him $175 which I had for B Kelly &c of Baltimore.  He told me that Redfield had in Baltimore a most beautiful & splendid Pony for me & was going to write me about sending it on to me.

	I saw Captain Cunningham last night.  He says Miss Cunningham is improving very much since her return from Philadelphia.  Pamela is all over in biles & sores which the doctors think are evidence of returning health.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I met Mrs. Anderson & her little son.  She says her son & Mrs. Beadons son were very sad after Anna left Charleston that she was so lively the boys were greatly smitten with her.

	There is nothing doing in the Legislature.  P. McBee came yesterday & says old Mrs. Butler is as low as she can be to be alive.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad to hear from you.  I am glad to hear Willie is working.

	There never was such a crowd before in Columbia.  Dr. Crook & Dr. Craft are here.

	I shall expect Willie & Anna Saturday.  You will receive this letter Friday night.  Tell them to be careful about keeping their seats in the cars & not to get out.   Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
