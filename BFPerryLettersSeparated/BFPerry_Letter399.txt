My dear Liz

	I have just dressed & will write you a line before breakfast.

	Yesterday morning I waked feeling very well & having had a sweet sleep.  But immediately after breakfast I was attacked with the prevailingwhich seemed to exhaust all my strength.  Chancellor gave me two opium pills which relieved me in the evening.  I was however able to be in court & attend to my business.  This morning I feel quite well.

	I have gathered up seven or eight hundred dollars and a prospect of collecting more.  I may have to remain here tomorrow.  Court will adjourn this evening.  I have not yet had any settlement with K

	I have been very successful in my cases & have gained one which establishes a new principle in South Carolina in regard to the sale of lands & the security of the purchase money.

	I have a great deal of writing to do this morning & must close my letter.  Mr. Elford will go after dinner.

	It is possible I may be at home Wednesday evening but perhaps not till Thursday.  II wish to try & see something about K business.

       I saw William Perry.  He says they are all well at his Feathers.  He paid me Four hundred dollars.  Your affectionate husband. B.F. Perry
