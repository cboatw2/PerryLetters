Letter 535
4 June 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you a draft on New York for $250.00 which I hope will pay your Bills mentioned in your last letter, & leave you $100 to travel with.

	But unless Memminger or some other clever person travels with you, I think you had better not  take the trip at all.  It is lonely travelling by ones self.

	You had better go out into the country & spend your time.  Go to the old town of Sherborn & see your ancestral kindred.  I want to know something about them.

	The is Saturday & I am very much engaged in my Equity business.  For two days T.P. Reed & myself have been on a Reference & just concluded it before the Commissioner.

	We are all well.  But I have the melancholy news to communicate of Flora Junes death.  She died the morning suddenly.  Yesterday she was walking in the yardate something which disagreed with her & died with cholera morbus.  Poor girl!  He death made me think of Anna & I wept at the startling news.

	I have nothing further to write.  We heard from Frank last night.  He wrote for $15.00 to help pay his expenses home.  How much less he spends than you.  It is a great matter to have a son educated by the Republic.

	I sent John to Laurens yesterday for Tim & hope he will be able to return with him.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
