Letter 758
23 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your long letter written Sunday.  I have also read 5 pages sent Susan yesterday.

	I am distressed that you worry so much about the Election.  It is nothing to grieve over.  I am better satisfied than if elected.  At one time from accounts rece[ive]d I said to my friends that I was afraid I was elected.  I am not [a] fit man to have a seat in Congress.  My health, age, & inclination all oppose it.  I wish to spend the remainder of my life with you at the farm, writing & reading.  The notices of the Press everywhere have been very flattering & show how much of representation I have made for myself by honesty, firmness, patriotism & talent.

	This is a much better legacy for my children than unprincipled success in holding office.  Willie has gone down to Abbeville this morning to contest the election.  Blythe only beat him [by] 107 votes and at one Box in Abbeville where there was no legal manager, the negroes gave Blythe 250 votes to Willies 8!  If this Box is thrown out Willie will be elected.  Moreover 150 North Carolina negroes voted in Pickenson the Rail Road.  Thirty young negroes under age voted for Blythe at Calhoun Mills in Abbeville.  But Willie is able to live without the office & his defeat gives him reputation.

	You are in Aiken & have nothing to occupy your mind.  Come home & you will be engaged in your household duties & have me to console you & reason with you.

	If Hayne can only improve in Aiken I will forget all my troubles & be thankful.  This is more so to me than everything else.  When I think of it I care nothing about office &.

	Fannie sends me word she rece[ive]d two letters from you last night.  We are all well.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. Hamilton last night.  He thinks of quitting the State.  I rece[ive]d a letter from the Atlantic Publishing Company in New York this morning wishing a sketch of my life & Photograph to put in a book of Eminent Men they are about publishing.

	I must close as I have business on hand.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
