Letter 357
3 May 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I went to the officelast night and could find no letter from you.  I told the fellow there must be a letter & he assured me there was none this morning.  Elford found your letter as he went in to mail one for himself.  It was lying on the desk.  He brought it up to me just as I was sitting down to complain of your negligence.

	I am now writing to you before breakfast & Elford & Mauldin who has been rooming with me will go up this morning.  I will send the letter by Elford.  I enclose you the $20.00.  I was glad to hear you were all well, & that you had got through with white washing.  I am sorry your money will not pass.  If you wished to purchase anything of the merchants I am sure they will not refuse the Bill.

	I called to see Antwerp yesterday & he paid me $32.50 for balance of Edwards bill.  This is rather better than I expected,

	The Rail Road Convention adjourned yesterday.  We had a great deal of discussion & some sparring between Judge ONeall & myself.  In my Report I give the President & directors a caution about their extravagance & selling bonds too low & the Judge did not like it.

	I saw Col. OHanlon yesterday.  He seems very kind & cordial & enquired after you & the children.  He said the other day in company with my friend Thompson & Mr. Green talking about the nominee from the Presidency he said he would be glad to see me nominated & that they all concurred  with him!  This is surely an evidence of strong feeling on his part.  He introduced me to Co. Ben McCulloch of Texas.  He is a rough unpolished &man & I think Miss Sparks had better have Col. Keitt.  He has been to see her & has also been to see Col. Pickens daughters so said.

	Col. Orr arrived here last night.  He says there will be a vacancy for midshipmen in September but that the applicant must be not under fourteen nor older than fifteen.  Frank is yet too young.

	Tell Frank I will get his sword.  But an officer has no use for a drum.  I hope he is not going to turn drummer.

	Dr. Fair has been very polite to me, but I have only seen Mrs. Fair once.  Mr. LeConte the new Professor & his wife are boarding at this House.  He is a very pleasant gentleman indeed & moderate & unpretending.  But his wife, whose acquaintance I have not made, seems one of the most magnificently dressy & pompous women I ever saw.  She is a New Yorker & came to the table, dressed as if for a Ball, with bare arms & shoulders.    She is a large woman & the Professor a small man.

	I have seen none going to Charleston yet.  I saw Edward Buist one evening.  He enquired about Willie.  President McCay & Professor LaBorde had called to see me at the same time & Edward seemed shy of them & staid but a moment.  The College is doing well.  There is a fuss about Dr. LaBordes defence of Dr. Lieber in the subject of slavery.

	I must now close my letter to you & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Tell your mother not to be in a tieabout selling her land,& quit saying she will take $7.00.  Hanckle will give $8.00 just as quick as seven.  He perhaps does not wish to buy at all.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
