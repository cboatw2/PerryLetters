Letter 755

My dear Liz

	I have just made a speech & eaten my dinner & will take the three oclock train for Winnsboro tonight.

	I had a fine large meeting at Yorkville & my speech is reported fully&in the Paper yesterday morning three columns.  Monday evening I went to Col. Rawlinsons with Col. Hamilton & staid all night.  He carried us in his carriage the next morning to Rock Hill where I made a speech.  Mrs. Springs sent me word at Yorkville that her carriage would be at Rock Hill to carry me to her House that evening.  I went with Col. Hamilton & spent the night & next day.  They were very kind & hospitable.  Springs is worth two or three hundred thousand dollars & Mrs. Springs & myself have made a match between her little daughter & only child & Ben.  She is ten years old, very sweet & pretty.  We are to exchange photographs of her & Ben.  I said Ben was to be a farmer & she said that is just what she wishes.  Springs insisted I should send Ben down to see them.
	I rece[ive]d your letter at Rock Hill directed to the care of Col. Cadwallader Jones & was truly glad you & Hayne arrived safely at Aiken, and that Hayne felt better.  This is my only trouble.  As to the election I care nothing about it though I begin to think I may be elected.  I saw Mrs.  Jones who was a daughter of Governor Adams & Emma Waters my.
	Col. Hamilton invites me to take tea with him tonight.  He made a speech at Rock Hill & exalted me most extravagantly & gave a history of my life.  I feel under great obligations to him.  I refused at first, to take tea, but he said he wished me to make the acquaintance of his wife & I consented.  I have had a most pleasant campaign so far.  Tomorrow I speak at Winnsborough [&] return home Saturday night.  I have a great deal to tell you when we meet.
	I begin to feel [Horace] Greel[e]y will be beaten.  Pennsylvania , Ohio & Indiana have gone against the Democrats!  But I will not despair of the Republic.  I have heard nothing from Home or Hext since you left.  I have made a great many friends here.  I do hope Hayne will get better.  A great many Radicals will vote for me.  Gov. Scott has said he wishes me to beat Wallace.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry
