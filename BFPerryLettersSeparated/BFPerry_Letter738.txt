Letter 738
29 November 1866
Columbia

My dear Liz

	This is thanksgiving day & the Legislature & the Courts have all adjournedtill tomorrow.  I am therefore at leisure to write you a long letter.  I wrote you a very short one yesterday before going into Court.  I was appointed to examine the applicants for admission in law on Constitutional Cases.  I suppose the Judges thought from my letter on the Constitutional amendment that this subject was appropriately mine.  The class consisted of fifty one studentsWells, Westmoereland & Dargan amongst them.  They all stood a very good examination & were admitted.

	I then went to pay my respects to the Governor & whilst in his office his daughter Miss Mattie came in for the purpose of getting money to shop.  I went to Radcliffe & bought me a beautiful set of shirt buttons or studs.  In the evening I attended the Board of Trustees & did not return to the Hotel till eleven oclock.  Governor Orr went off to& a christian & did not attend our meeting.  This morning I went with him to call on Miss Childs & Miss Mattie.  Miss Mattie told me that Dr. Hoke & his Bride were there last night & that Dr. Hoke went up to the Hotel  to see me.  I was at the College & did not see him.   Willie tells me he saw him & his Bride.  I suppose they will reach Greenville tonight.

	I was greatly shocked yesterday morning to hear that you had had a fire in Greenville since I left there.  I told Susan when she seemed so anxious to haveto her McBees Hall that it might be destroyed by fire & then her childrens whole fortune would be gone.  She ought now to see how correct my judgment was.  It is a most fortunate circumstance that the fire dd not extend over the village.  Alexander McBee went up to Greenville this morning & will not return till Monday.

	I think I shall go up Saturday & return Tuesday.  Looper has not yet been tried & may not be before the last of next week.  I have several persons complimenting very [word obscured] about my letter which I will carry up with me.  Chief Justine Dunkin  and a dozen orthers have paid me very high compliments for this letter.  It seems to have attracted great commendation everywhere.

	Judge Bryan told me he saw Fannie & that she was looking more beautiful than ever.  She will remain in Charleston till the 11th of December.  Mrs. Glover has gone to Orangeburgh & will meet her at Branchville on the [word faded].  They will go to Florida by Rail Road through Augusta &c.

	Governor Manning is very ill, & his election comes on next Tuesday.  It is thought Col. Campbell will oppose him.  I hope Manning will be elected.  He is a good deal better than he was.  Dr. Geddings came up to see him not long since & changed his treatment.  His friends think he will recover.  I hope so most sincerely.

	I have not yet seen or heard from Mrs. LeConte.  I do not know whether Lula is in Columbia or not.  One of the Trenholms sons is to marry Miss Bryce very soon.  Judge Bryan told me that he courted a very poor lady in Charlestonhim not long since.  He thought it a rare instance of dis on her part.  ,,, Trenholm is good looking but very small, & his intended, a very large lady.

	I have not seen or heard from General Hampton or his family.  I saw General Martin yesterday who enquired after all of you very kindly.  I have not seen Isaac Hayne.  Edward Stokes & John W, Stokes were admitted yesterday in Equity & I suppose will go up tomorrow morning.  Looper tells me he expects money soon from Augusta & will pay me whatever I charge for defending his son.

	I am glad that Blassingame sent for the corn & hope that P is right in his cor. The weather is very warm & looks as if we should have rain.  I hope it is colder in Greenville on account of the meat salted away.  I trust you & your household are doing well.  Having so small a famiy at present I hope you [have] no troublei in housekeeping.  I shall expect to hear from you this evening.  I [word obscured] the letters you sent me & if any others should come you had better keep them till I return.  If I do not return on Saturday send them to me on Monday or write {word faded] their contents.

	I must now close my letter & go to dinner.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
