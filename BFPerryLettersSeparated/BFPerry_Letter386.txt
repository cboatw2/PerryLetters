Letter 386
17 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Enclosed I send you a letter for the Patriot, & also one from Col. Orr.  I rece[ive]d your letter tonight about eleven oclock.  I dined with Col. Wilson & then went to the House.  I was invited to dine with Mr. [Francis] Lance & also with J[ames] J[ohnston] Pettigrew.  Tomorrow I am engaged to dine with Col. Hampton.  He invited me Tuesday but I was engaged.

	I went to see Willies room today & ordered it to be cleaned & the furniture moved into it.  I also looked at the furniture he bought & think he paid enough for it.  Mrs. Simons & the Speaker [James Simons] went down to the College yesterday to see their sons room opposite & are fitting it up very handsomely.  I saw President McCay & he went with me to the room & carried me over [to] his House.  I called at Mrs. Greenes & paid the fifty dollars towards Willies board.

	I have no time to commit on your estimate of moneys to be received in January.  We shall adjourn Saturday & I will reach home Sunday night.

	The Bundle of& the shoes for Anna have been sent me by Mrs. Taylor.  I have them in my trunk.

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Col. Wilson & many friends.  It seems I shall not have an opportunity of dining at the Hotel at all again this Session.  The Parish members have  taken a great liking to me & over burden me with their hospitality.

	In great haste kiss the children & believe me your affectionate husband.  It is now near midnight.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
