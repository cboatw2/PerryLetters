Letter 127
Friday morning, [1848]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	It will be out of my power to meet you at Mr. Cunninghams.  I have been employed in several cases since my arrival here.  One of them is more trying & will take all day.  I must be at home Sunday night.  You will come up to Mr. Barksdales Saturday evening & I will meet you there & go home Sunday.

	I need not say how sorry I am not to be able to see Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham, Miss Pamela & all the family.  But I will pay them a visit this spring on my electioneering tour.

	The election goes on as well as I could desire.  I hear the most flattering intelligence from all parts of the district except the Sullivan neighborhood.

	How happy I shall be to meet you & the children tomorrow.  But Court is now being called & I must stop.  Remember me to all.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Perry
