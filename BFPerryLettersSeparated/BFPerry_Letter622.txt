Letter 622
23 August 1861
Petersburgh, Va.

My dear Liz

	I have just been to see Miss Nelly Orr & spent an hour very pleasantly with her & her mother.  They seem good & affectionate & I like them very much.  Miss Nelly is good looking but not a beauty.  She is very intelligent & pleasant in her manners & expressed great interest in you & Fannie & Willie.  She was spared of another battle where some of her Greenville friends might be killed or wounded.  She & her mother both requested me to say to Willie and his friends that they must come to Petersburgh in case any casualty happened to them whilst in the army.  She says that a merchant here promised to procure an India Rubber coat & would send it to me this evening.

	We reached here last night about nine oclock.  We were detained at Charlotte five or six hours.  I saw Dr. Gibbon and he was very kind.  Judge Whitner rece[ive]d a telegram that his son was much better & not to come on.  But he & Mrs. Whitner left this morning for Culpepper.  I was sorry to part with them.  Mrs. Izard was in company all the way from Columbia & Co, McFarland & young Haskell.

	At Raleigh I saw Vardry McBee & Col. Burton who told me Captain Hoke was sick at Greensboro & Dr. Crook was sick at Chapel Hill.  But I presume they are at home by this time.

	This morning a number of soldiers in Sloans Regiment passed through Petersburgh before I got up.  Judge Whitner saw them.  Young Sloan brother of Mrs. Easly shot through thewas one of them.

       The cars were filled with troops from Georgia & Alabama.  And all along the road the ladies wouldnose gays &c.

       I shall go to Richmond this evening, stay there tomorrow & go to Manassas next day.

	So for the conductors have all passed me for half fare.  I have met a great many acquaintances going on to the army & also young Knotts who went to school at Greenville came up & introduced himself  & said he was going on to join the Brooks Cavalry.

	I told Miss Nelly when I took leave of her that I hoped some of the Greenville troops would capture her & bring her to Greenville as a trophy of the war.  She smiled as if it would not be an impossible thing.   Like some of the yankees, she might prefer being captured by a good looking cavalier.  She says Willie does not look at all like me & supposes he looks like you.  Her father lives in very handsome style.

	My love to all.  I hope I hear from you in Richmond.  I gave your letter to Nelly.  B.F. Perry
