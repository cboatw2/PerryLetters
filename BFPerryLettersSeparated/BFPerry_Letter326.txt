Letter 326
12 March 1855
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I shall be at home tomorrow evening.  Meet me at the depot with the B.

	I enclose to you my letter to the Patriot, which you will please send up immediately.

	I have sold the cotton at $7.29 per hundred.

  	I have nothing to write more than you will see in the enclosed letter.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
