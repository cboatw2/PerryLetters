Letter 401
28 August 1857
Philadelphia

My dear Son [Frank Perry

	We will be in potes Monday evening.  I think we would have to stop in Baltimore & intended writing to you to meet us there.  But your mother has made all of her purchases in Philadelphia & we shall not stop at all in Baltimore.

	We left Willie in Cambridge & Anna will go to Burlington tomorrow.   She was not so well pleased with the school as she expected to be.  There were a good many letters for her in Burlington.  however you have herHome.

[Final two lines of this sheet illegible] we hope to hear a good account of you from Mrs. Green.  You must present our best respects to her.

	Why did you not write to us in Boston?  We have heard nothing of you since we left Annapolis.

	Whenever you enter the naval school I will buy you the gold watch I promised.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Frank Perry
