Letter 393
6 May 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I feel very lonesome since you & the children have left me.  I met Miss Mary Jones after dinner & said I was lonely & she said I looked so.

	After you started I walked up with Willie to the Court House.  He went on to the College to study his lessons.  Whilst at the Court House I met General Thompson & Col. Preston.  Thompson looks pale but otherwise very well.  He says Mrs. Thompson is quite well, & he speaks in high terms of her surgeon Dr. Sims who went from the upper part of South Carolina & then was a man of no reputation.  He now makes by his profession $40,000 annually!  General Thompson & family will go up with me Saturday.

	When I returned from Court I wrote a letter to the Patriot.  Then I walked in the piazza & Dr. LeConte came & invited me into his parlor where Mrs. LeConte was.  She invited me to join her party & take a seat at her table.  I did so.  Col. Johnson was with me & we spent a pleasant time at the table.  Mrs. LeConte says there was an awful destruction of hoops & dresses last night at the May day celebration.  She said the hoops were pressed out of all shape & the strawberries & ice creams were handed over the heads of the ladies.  Every now & then she could hear the expression from some lady Oh me look how they have ruined my dress.   The Professor says two nights in succession have used him up.

	I met Governor Allston who carried me into his Parlor & regretted not seeing you.  He said two Miss Harlans   came up with him & enquired who they were.  He said they were in company with a fine looking woman who was a suspicious character & the conductor refused to tell him her name.  They must have been on board the cars with you.

	Professor Barnwell & his sister Miss E. Barnwell called to see you about one oclock & expressed great regret at your absence.  They left their cards, but I did not see them.

	Col. Preston expressed his regret at not knowing you were here.  General Thompson regretted that you were gone.

	The Board of Trustees meet in the Court House instead of the College Library tonight for the accommodation of Judge ONeall & Judge Glover who are in bad health.  I am glad of it, as it will save me a long walk in the night.

	President McCay called to see me this morning & sat with me an hour talking about the college.

	I hear the Greenville cars coming in & will quit writing to you & see the arrivals.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening & hear that you reached home safely & found all well Minerva better.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I wish I had kept Hext with me or Arthur for company.  I had rather have Arthur but for the nursing & care.  I found a tooth brush & handkerchief of Franks.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
