Letter 706
25 September 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter dated Friday & Saturday enclosing one to Lula which I gave Willie to deliver.

	I wrote you yesterday all the news I had.  In the evening I went to see Mrs. Herbemont who lives close by the Hotel & sent word by Col. Childs that I must call.  I saw her and her mother in law & spent twenty or thirty minutes very pleasantly with them.  She has two exquisitely beautiful mosaic marble tables purchased in Italy.  Col. Childs bought one & I took the other for Fannie $35.00.  It is worth two or three hundred dollars.  Mrs. Herbemont leaves tomorrow for the north & has sold her House to Col. Childs.  The table will remain with the Col. till the Rail Road is completed.  It is round with a chesstop of beautiful mosaic.  It is really a curiosity & so cheap that I was tempted to buy it as a present for Fannie.

	I have juist rece[ive]d the New York Herald & Tribune containing my message.  The former is complimentary & the latter abusive on account of excluding negro suffrage.  Governor Pickens, Governor Manning, W.W. Boyce & Col. J.B. Campbell are all spoken of for the Senate but all admit that I am first to be elected & each one wishes to be my colleague.  This is very grattifying .  Col. [Christopher William] Dudley has written an article nominating me for the Senate.

	The Convention will probably adjourn Tuesday night & if so I will get off Wednesday & be at home Thursday if not Friday.

       Mr. Heyward called this morning & sent his ciompliments to all of you.

	I have nothing further to write but remain your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
