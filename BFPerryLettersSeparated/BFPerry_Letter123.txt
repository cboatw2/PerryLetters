Letter 123
Tuesday morning, [1848]
Pickens C.H.
My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Col. Townes.

	I will probably be at home Thursday evening.  The murder case which I defend will be tried Wednesday.  I shall have no other business to detain me.

	In regard to the election I have nothing new to write.  My friends are greatly mortified at the result and my opponents are rejoicing.  Mr. Gantt told them they ought to be sorry for their country & not for him.  Elliott Keith says the people did not turn out.  A great many who would have voted for me staid at home, but my opponents were all out.  I have understood that Mr. Calhoun voted for Orr with an open ticket.  It is understood here that he threw the whole weight of his influence against me.    Col. Grisham says that was the cause of my defeat more than liquor.  The Rev. Mr. Kennedy said it was a great shame to see the people led by the noose by one man.  He said I was the most talented man in the congressional district so Boggs told me.  Kennedy was a strong nullifyer too.

	I must conclude & go, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
