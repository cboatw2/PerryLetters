Letter 137
13 November 1849
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines, though I have very little to communicate.

	Nothing has been done in any of my cases yet.

	Mr. Farley has gone to Memphis, & has entrusted all of his business to me.

       In the case of Dr. Teagues, argued last summer in the court of Equity, the decree of Chancellor Dargan has been rece[ive]d & is in my favor.

       Dr. Teague was so much pleased at the result that he paid me two hundred dollars this morning.  He will pay me the balance in Columbia about one hundred more.  He had already paid me $140 or 150 dollars.

	Mrs. Philson owes me $100 & promised to pay me a part this court but I have not yet
seen her.  Her daughter Mary Dillon has a very important case in court & poor woman is about being confined & not able to be at court.  This is her second slip.  You remember she paid us a visit two years since.

	It is very doubtfull whether Dr. Andersons case will be reached this court.  There is a woman to be tried here for murdering the mistress of her husband.  An unusual number of witnesses is bound over in the case.

I have been a good deal troubled with toothache since I came here & yesterday evening suffered

	I hope to hear from you Thursday morning.  It is not at all likely I shall be sat home before Sunday evening.

Tell Rueben to go on & sow & plough in the wheattake care of the horseshogs--&c.

	Cotton is rising & money is plenty in Laurensnegroes selling high $800--& will bring
$1000 it is said before January.

	I have not seen or heard from Mr. Cunningham or his family.

	I hope you & the children & servants are all well.  Tell Willie, Anna & Frank to learn their lessons well and be good children.

	Mrs. ONeall is better. Says the Judge & he has been home since he was at Greenville.

	I am my dear wife yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

P.S. They are making the necessary surveys for the Laurens Rail Road and all seem in good spirits.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
