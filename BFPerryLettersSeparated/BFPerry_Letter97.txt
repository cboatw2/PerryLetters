Letter 97
Friday morning, [17December 1847]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The Legislature will adjourn tonight.  I shall start home in the morningglad enough to get off & be on the road to my wife & children once more.

        I have very little time to write you this morning & will postpone telling you all the news untill I see you.

       General Shields has turned all Columbia crazy.  They had a grand illumination, torch light procession &c.  Yesterday the General accompanied by the governor & committee of arrangements, of which I was one, visited the House of Representatives which was crowded as I never saw it before with men & Ladies.  He made a speech sat awhile & then went into the Senate which was a squeezejammed full of ladies & strangers.  There he made another speech, shook hands with the ladies &c.  He is a single gentleman & I thought some of the ladies liked him the better for it.  He is about forty, good looking, fine countenance, & noble bearing.  He says he is only thirty-eight.  Yesterday I dined with him at the Governorsa very large party & pleasant.

	I bought a Broach as you directed which was the lastwas in the shop.  You can present it to Behethland Butler.  I am at a loss for a present for Anne, I have not room for a basket.  My trunk is full up & over.

	I am truly sorry that I cannot get home as quick as those who go in the stage.  Col. Townes will arrive as soon as you get this letter & Major Jones.

	Tell Willie I shall be happy to see him & am sorry I have not time to write.  Tell Anna that I am delighted to hear of her goodness & industry.  And say to Frank he is a sweet boy & I love him very much.  Fanny I will not trouble you with any compliments to but will tell her myself when we meet.  Col. Northrop says there should always be a baby in the family if the family is able to afford it.  I think with him.  Your husband affectionately &c, B.F., Perry
