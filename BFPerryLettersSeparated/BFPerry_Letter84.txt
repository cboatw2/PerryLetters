Letter 84
24 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I hope to hear from you tonight but I cannot write you after receiving your letter,

	The Board of Trustees meet this evening at ? past six oclock & I must attend them.  Yesterday I was engaged all day in the Court of Appeals & Errors.  The day before we did little or nothing in the Senate & today not much.

	I have seen Col. Taylor & General Martin.  They enquired kindly after you & said their families were all well.  I told Taylor that I had some packages for his wife, but it has been raining so much that I have not sent them up.  I saw Judge Butler this morning.  He looks very well.

	You may tell your mother I have engaged a chair at $3.50 if I can send it up.  I have bought me a Buena Vista coat, price $9.00, socks made out of--vest $3.50 & pantaloons $6.50 & boots $9.00.  These are my purchases & nothing else.

	I saw Mr. Symmes just now, who enquires after you & your mother.  He gave me a long talk about Congress.  Says Orr is a particular friend of his & he told him he ought not to have offended me.

	There was some talk of running me for Chancellor until Colonel Memminger took the field.  Hew is a candidate & General Whitner is not.

	Edward does very well & is some help to me.  He seems very much pleased.

	I really begin to wish to see you & the children again, & have been thinking how & what I will do when I go to Washington.

	Nothing new on the Rail Road subject.  What will be the result I know not.

	Kiss the children & take care of them & yourself.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
