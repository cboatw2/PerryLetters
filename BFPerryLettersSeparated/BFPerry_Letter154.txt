Letter 154
17 April 1850
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter yesterday in court, whilst in the midst of Dr. Andersons case, and I was truly glad to hear you were all well.

	I have no paper & must therefore beg you to excuse me for not answering your letter more fully.  I have no time to write.  We commenced Dr. Andersons case Monday & are not half through it yet.  The result is very doubtful.  The Judge is as ill-natured as ever & behaves rudely to every one.  My only comfort is that he worrys himself more than anyone else.

	The governor is as vain say very cunning in selecting Col. Elmore, but he will not be successful in his cunning.  Col. Elmore will continue in the Senate.

	I am sorry Edward misbehaved when asked about the flowers. Col. Irby would give me $800 for Jim but it is not enough.  Negroes will increase in value before next fall if cotton keeps up.

	I hope Reuben & Jim are going on well with their respective work.

	I may be at home Saturday.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

P.S. Dont forget to look for the Bonnett for Harriott Perry as I know she will be expecting it.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
