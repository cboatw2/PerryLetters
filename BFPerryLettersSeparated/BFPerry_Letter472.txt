Letter 472
10 March 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received a letter from Captain Blake stating you had been found deficient in your studies!  You do not know how unhappy this made your mother.  I have no words to express my grief and sorrow.

	I hope you will now begin to study & learn your lessons.  What disgrace will it be to see you returning home!  How can you look your friends here in the face after your dismissal!.  They will all laugh at you .  And you will be ruined.

	My dear Son only think how hard I struggled to get you in the naval school and what a terrible misfortune it will be to be dismissed.  If you have any love for your mother, any regard for me, or only consideration for your own happiness do study & redeem your character.  Dont let one moment pass in idleness.  Study all day & all night.  Do not sit on your book thinking of something else.  Say your lessons over & over again.

	I will come on next month if I can & see you & I hope by that time you will stand well in your class.

	When I have done so much for you, it is too bad to see you throwing away your golden opportunities.

	Think of nothing but study & good behaviour.  Remember next June you are to go on that cruise & see the world.  But if you do not study you will not go, but come home to be ridiculed & laughed at.

	I believe now, my dear Son, you will begin to study.  You said so, in one of your last letters, and if you only knew my heart I am sure you would.  Your affectionate Farther, B.F. Perry
