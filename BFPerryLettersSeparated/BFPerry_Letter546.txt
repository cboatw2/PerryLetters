Letter 546
2 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  I have to go into court at ten oclock to finish the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  I was all day yesterday engaged in the argument of the case & did not get to vote for Mc.  Thomas beat him badly.  Mr. Petigru argues the case of Stokes this morning & I was with him last night till a late hour preparing for the argument.

	I have drawn up a set of Resolutions to submit in the House today on Harpers Ferry.  There is no excitement here on the subject.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was glad you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist ministers, children & servants.  Mr. Young knows Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p]s father & says he was a Lawyer of considerable distinction, but a very rough, uncouth profane man.  He saw him once  sitting in the piazza of the Hotel at Court in the summer  in his shirt sleeves & barefooted!

	In conversation yesterday with a number of gentlemen Col. Isaac Hayne remarked that I was regarded as the extreme of non resistance in South Carolina & yet no other Southern State had ever yet come up to mu platform as laid down in our State Convention.

	I have just returned from the breakfast table where I had a long political chat with Edmund Rhett.  By the by he tells me that Mrs. Rhett has not been able to leave Charleston yet & he wishes she had remained at Greenville.

	I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
