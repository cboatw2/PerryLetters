Master Perry & Miss Emily
My dear little Grandchildren

	Your present of a fine, large & handsome chair, this morning, was a very agreeable surprise.  I had forgotten that it was the forty second anniversary of mine & your grandmothers marriage.

	I thank you kindly for remembering me, in so pleasant a way, of that important & happy event in our lives & which has resulted in having two such grandchildren.  I said to your grandmother this morning that I thought you Miss Emily the sweetest & prettiest little thing I ever saw; & that you master Perry was the noblest & most remarkable little boy, morally, physically & intellectually that I had ever known.

	I have an abiding confidence my dear little grandchildren that you will both do honor to your grandparents & to your dear father & mother.  Would to God, that I could hope to see you both grown & settled in life.  It would be the crowning wish of my heart.  Your affectionate loving grandfather, B.F. Perry
