Letter 203
7 December 1852
House of Representatives, [Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I rece[i]ved your letter written Sunday this morning.  The Mails could not be opened last night in time to get our letters & was scolded by the Barkeeper.

	I wrote you everything I knew or had heard of to Sunday evening.  I went to the Commencement in the College & was pleased with the performance of the young men.  P.E. Griffin of Society Hill delivered a very fine Poem representing a conversation between Sir William Wallace & Bruce.  In speaking the part of Bruce he addressed me so personally as to attract the whole College.  Governor Means said that Griffin had made me the Sir William Wallace of his Poem.  The first part of his address  spoken by Bruce was very much like some of the abuse heaped on me by the Secessionists, ambition, traitor &c. &c.  But at the close of the Poem finding out the real sentiments of Wallace, Bruce says to him, now I acknowledge you as a Patriot pure & devoted to your country.

	There was a very large concourse of persons in the College & a vast number of young ladies all wishing to look interesting & desirous of attracting the notice of the young of the other sex. Whilst I was standing on the Platform or Stage near the crowd as they were going out of the College, I saw Mers. Hodge & Thompsom & spoke to themdirectly after words a lady came by & spoke to me, said she supposed I had forgotten her, said that she was Mrs. Barclay, introduced me to her daughter, said she had been at my house, knew you & the children, & enquired most kindly after you.  I had no remembrance of her at all.  She got separated from her company whilst speaking to me & I walked home with her & her daughter.  But still I did not find out who she was.  Col. Garlington says he supposes she is the widow of Barclay the painter of portraits.  I am sorry I did [not] recognize her.  She was quite intelligent & seemed pleasant.

       Last night the Ball came off at& the college boys behaved badly & the young ladies refused to go back to the dancing room after the supper.  The Boy Henry who waits on me said the College Boys got drunk & yelled & screamed.

       I am glad you have heard from Anna & am very willing she should remain in [Charleston] Town as long as her friends desire her. But from her letter to me I think it likely her friends have not been very pressing in their solicitations for her to stay with them.

       I had a note this morning  from Miss S requesting me  to carry a bundle to Mrs. Arthus which she sent.

       I am glad you are getting on better with the servants & hope you will begin to look on the bright side of everything in stead of the reverse.  Our happiness is in our own hands, & if we makeu up our minds to fret & worry & opine at anything that does not go at as we would wish, we shall always be unhappyon the contrary if we look at the real  pleasures & comforts that we have we shall be satisfied & happy.  Instead of repining for honors & pleasures & property we cannot acquire, let us enjoy & appreciate those that we have, and thousands & hundreds of thousands as good as ourselves have not & never can obtain.  I believe the happiness of every individual is in his own hands.  If he wills to be happy he may be and if he desires always to look as the dark side of the picture & consider only his misfortunes  he will most certainly be unhappy, whether President of the United States or a king on his throne or a peasant in the woods or a member of the Legislature from Greenville with as good a wife & as fine children as I have.

	I am writing to you amidst the confusion of the House & have not time to read over & correct it.

	I shall be glad to see Elford this evening.  Poor Mauldin attempted to beat his brains out in the Asylum after being left there.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Glover clerk of the House will be elected Judge in the morning over Col. Dawkins & Col., Fair.

P.S.  Mr. & Mrs. Efford and Miss Crayton have just arrived & I think you for the letter & will write you tomorrow again.
