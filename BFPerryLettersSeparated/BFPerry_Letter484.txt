Letter 484
5 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & will write you a few lines before going down to the Board of Trustees.

	I was invited to dine with General Quitman today at Dr. Greens where he is staying, but declined the invitation.  I could not get back in time to attend the meeting of the Board of Trustees & I do not like General Quitmans political character & have written freely about him.  It will be a great dinner.  The Ball last night was a grand affair.  But I did not attend that & therefore thought it better not to accept Dr. Greens invitation.  The Governor insisted on my going & offered me a seat in his carriage.

	General Thompson went up this morning & I sent a jar of strawberries.  Miss Jones did not go to the Ball.  I saw her this morning as she was starting home.  She showed me my Jar of strawberries & asked me to look what a nice present she was carrying home to her sister.  I told [her] they were mine & I was sending them by the General to Anna.  She then promised to see that they went safely.  General Thompson had also purchased some & she supposed mine was his.

	This evening Elford & Town[e]s came down & Willie Beattie.  Elford tells me they have located the Baptist Theological Seminary at Greenville & seems much delighted at it.

	I have done nothing today.  The students were examined & all were admitted.  Moore & Knotts amongst them & Whitner &c.

	I will send up in the morning some apples & jelly if I can get them for Anna.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Hold this evening about his Anderson business & wishes me to write a letter to Sam[ue]l Earle forbidding him to pay out the money.

	I am tired of waiting for my law cases & it may be the last of next week before I can return home.  But some good luck may hasten the hearing of the cases.

  	The babies & their young mothers & nurses have all gone & there is now no noise or crying to disturb me.

	I am glad to hear Anna is improving & that Hext & Arthur are so much better.  I am sorry Anna does not like the Book.  It is said to be a very fine one.

	I will enquire about the books you mention.  I have bought several books.  The Bench & Bar of Georgiathe autobiography of Goethe & his Sorrows of Wert[h]erH life by his son.

	I hope McCullough paid the money to Col. Hoke & that Ware paid him also.

	I told Col. Owens General McGowan what I Had written to you yesterday & they told me I must write today that they were still & silent.

	Col. Carn is here & is killing himself drinking I am afraid.  His young wife has not made him as happy as his brandy.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
