Letter 75
14 May 1847

I will this morning conclude my long letter as I shall not have time to do so this evening after my return from the governors dinner.

	I expected to have gone last night to Dr. Liebers party, but I felt so much fatig[u]ed & exhausted that I could not muster courage enough to walk through the mud & sit up till twelve oclock again.  And these parties are dull placesgreat crowds of strangers thrown together & nothing to talk about.

	Mr. Webster dined with the Miss Hamptons yesterday & went to look at Hamptons negroes & see their mode of living &c.

	I have purchased for you Amy Herbert & Holmes Gardners but could not get the other books on your list.  The other purchases I will make in due time.

	I do not know when I shall be able to leave here, perhaps not before Tuesday or Wednesday next.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell them to be good & Papa will bring them something.  I am glad to hear Will has turned down four more boys.  I hope he will soon be head.

	I must now go to my breakfast.  I will write you again before I leave Columbia & give you an account of the dinner.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
