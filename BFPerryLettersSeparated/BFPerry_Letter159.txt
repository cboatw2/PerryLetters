Letter 159
12 May 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening & was very glad to hear from you & that you were getting through with your house cleaning.  You think I ought to be very kind to you on my return from the labour you have bestowed on the house in my absence.  I am always kind & ever affectionate.  You misconstrue my words & actions when you think otherwise.  And as to giving you money you know that is always done when I have it to give.

	I shall start home Tuesday morning & reach you Thursday evening, & I assure you I shall be most happy to be with you & the children once more.  I see someone has spoken of me for Chancellor in the Charleston Mercury.  Col. Herndon wishes me to run for law Judge.  But I am not inclined to run for either.  I agree with Mr. Barnwell that it is a wretched life spent in taverns & from home.

	I spent a very pleasant evening at Col. Prestons.  There was a large dinner party & several young ladies.  I had the pleasure of carrying one to the table & sitting by her all the evening without finding out who she was.  After dinner Mrs. Preston introduced me to another one whose name I did not understand.  We walked in the garden & she enquired about you & your mother & said you had paid her a visit when Miss McCall.  I think she said you staid with her.  Mrs. Preston seemed very kind & enquired why I did not bring you with me.  She is coming to Greenville this summer.

	I have bought you a pretty presenta trunk for bonnet & handkerchiefs two dollars & twenty five cents.  I have bought some candy for the childrena few oranges & have closed my purchases.

	Yesterday I looked at carriagessome very fine onesone like Mr. Coxs	 for $400but I think a finer finished one $650 a magnificent affairothers at various prices.  The carriage maker said he would swap carriages with me.

	I saw Markleys son yesterday.  He seems a clever boy & was glad to meet me.  Tell John I saw his son [who] enquired after him.  He seems a good fellow.

	I had an amusing conversation with Col. Goodwyn today about Col McCord & his wife.  She is a tyrant over her husband & pays him handsomely for his mistreatment of his former wife.  She will not let any of his children come to see him & has made the Col.  Settle all of his property on her & her children.

	I was not able to attend the speaking in college & today I felt disinclined to go to church.  I shall hear the opinions in my cases tomorrow.  But the most of them will be against me.

	Tell the children I wish to see them all very much.

	Yours truly & affectionately.  Mr. Sullivan returns with me to Laurens.  It is something to Have company.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
