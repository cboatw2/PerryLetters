Letter 723
14 December 1865
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I have just returned from Col. Childs where I dined with Gov. Orr, Gov. Bonham & others.  After dinner, Fannie & Miss Janney, Mrs. LeConte & Lula, Mrs. Caldwell & her sisters, Mrs. Gibbes & a few gentlemen were invited to meet me.  It is now eleven oclock in the night.  I went with Fannie & Miss Janney to the State House today & saw them vote for JudgesDawkins, Moses & Aldridge were elected law Judges.  [William Dalrymple] Johnson of Marlborough &[Henry Deas] Lesesne of Charleston were elected Chancellors.  Col. Fair ran well & so did Presley, but Sullivan only got eight votes.  Col. Melton came within three votes of being elected Chancellor.

	I rece[ive]d your letters written Friday and Sunday.  Sorry to hear of your troubles with servants.  Let Wiley do as he pleases.  He will take care of everything & manage well.  I am under obligations to him for his fidelity to Willie & wish him to stay with me & do as he pleases.

	You must not worry about politics.  I think everything is going on well, & Johnson will carry out his policy.  I have entire confidence in him.  We may be kept out of Congress for a while.  But as the President said to me in a telegram Congress will move off all right in a short time.  I care nothing about Summer & Wilson.

	I will send you a bundle of papers.  Mrs. King is writing for the Courier.  In one of her letters she congratulates me for my course in Charleston Convention.  Tell Mrs. Butler, General Ames has no power to give her transportation.  As soon as I hear from President Johnson again I will return home.  General Martin wishes me to carry his daughter to Washington when I go.  I gave your letters to Fannie to read today.  I wrote Mr. Barnwell a long letter about the college.  The Trustees will now meet & elect Professors.  The affair between Campbell & Warley was settled the next day.  Fannie will probably go with Mr. Cuttino & his wife to Aiken, or with Martin to Charleston.  But she will write as to her movements.  She seems to enjoy herself.  Willie is quite well.  I have written Buist to pay the money.  I sent you Harper & you sent it to me.  The likeness is pretty good.  You must read Mr. Pinckneys Sermon in the Courier.  It is admirable.  The churches in Columbia were not opened on thanksgiving day.  Howlike.  Mr. Jordan Pool is here sick, but improving.

	I must now go to bed.  Do not worry yourself with the servants or about politics.  Take care of the Children & make them read & study.  You ought to be happy & contented with a loving & honored husband, promising children, comfortable situation with friends &c.  Do not let trifles & worthless servants distract you, & politics which you know nothing about, worry you.  Look on the bright side of the pictures of life.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
