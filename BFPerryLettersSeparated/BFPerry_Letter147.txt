Letter 147
14 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am pressed to death for time to attend to my business in court, in the Legislature, writing out my speech on the Bank &c.  The Legislature meets tonight & I now have to go down there.

	I have just sent Willie to the Post office & he returned with your letter to him.  I was glad to hear from you all. If I could bring your bonnet I would, but this is impossible nor have I seen any very pretty ones.  Nor could I fit you.  It is too late to repent about the birds.  They are pressed too.

	I made a speech yesterday on the Bank & am now writing it out for publication.  It was a good speech & has beencomplimented in the papers & by the Legislature of all parties.  You will see the notice in the Carolinian.  The Telegraph also compliments it though a Bank paper.  Immediately after my speech the vote was taken & the Bill lost by the vote of Smith & Earle against it.  If they had voted for it it would have passed.  Col. Ware is going to vote against it in the Senate & I told him he was misrepresenting his constituents.

	Willie is delighted with your letter & is now sitting by me reading.  He goes with me every night to the House & goes to bed about eleven oclock.  He sits in the gallery & listens to the speeches & tells me at night all that was done & said by the members.

	How happy I shall be to meet you & the children again.  My name is still spoken of for high honors.

	General Martin sent me a large bundle for you.  I do not know its contents.  Yours, B.F. Perry

I have commenced on a sheet of Willies & have not time to get anything else.

	The Rail Road Bill giving $75,000 to the Greenville company has just passed the House for the road.

	I did not dine with the governor yesterday.  It was late when I got from the House.

	Elford returns today & will reach home Sunday evening.

	I will write you a long letter next mail.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
