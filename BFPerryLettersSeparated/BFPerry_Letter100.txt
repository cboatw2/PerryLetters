Letter 100
Monday evening, [13 March 1848]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I rece[iv]ed your letters this morning and was truly glad to learn that you and the children were all well & had safely arrived at the Cunninghams.  My election is going on as well as I could wish in this district.  At the muster which I attended on Saturday there was very little division.  The same may be said of the whole Ennoree side of the district.  I stopped on Sunday & heard a sermon from Mr. Lewis, eight miles from the village & the most flattering intelligence from the neighborhood.  Dr. Dillard told me to say there was no division in his neighborhood.  Major Cunningham said my prospects had been growing better all winter.  Frederick Nance said he had taken pains to ascertain from persons here today, what my prospects were & that I could not wish them better.  My speech last Court on the Wilmot Proviso & my address this winter have secured my election in this district.

	The Barksdale affair has blown over almost entirely.  I had a long conversation with him this morning & he seemed entirely satisfied.  I saw his brother with whom you staid & thanked him for his kindness.  He said he should have known the children from their resemblance to me & complimented you & them very much.  He is a most worthy & respectable gentleman, & one whom I have always esteemed.

	The evening after you started from home I spent in reading Kendall & found the House lonely in the extreme.  I never could reconcile it to myself to live the life of a widower.  Monday I saw a great many persons at Greenville & recd $60.00 from one of my clients, which came in good time.  Last Friday night I came to Jones & was most kindly recd.  The next day I went to the master & made a speech.  That night I staid at General Wrights & was much pleased with his family.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to see you at Mr. Cunninghams.  My business will not permit me to leave here before Sunday morning.  It would give me great pleasure to see them all but you must make my excuse.  To go there & return here would take two days.  We will meet Sunday night at home.  You had better stop again with Mr. Barksdale.  The other one does not live on the road.

	I need not say how happy I should be to see you & the children & really when I think of being absent from you & them in Washington, I wish your apprehensions realized about Coil. Orrs beating me.  I have no doubt it would be the greatest kindness he could do me.

	I invited the Col. To take tea with me this evening & we spent a pleasant evening together.  He has just left me.

	I will write you again if I have time.  Do not say or think anything about the Election.  Leave this to me to manage.  Take care of the children & yourself.  Give my love to all the household & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
