Letter 184
26 April 1852
Columbia

My dear daughter

	I recd your letter this evening & was very much pleased with it.  As you were so good as to write to me & your mother did not, and as I wrote to her last night I will [write] you this evening.

	Willie & Robert Duncan have gone to the theatre.  Mr. Duncan and Col. Brockman are out & so are the other two boys.  Mr. Center is unwell & in his room so I am all alone.  Just as I had finished this sentence Dr. Blanding came in to see me & sat till after ten oclock.  Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams were here just before.  I have no time to write or do anything.

	Tell your mother that I have written an account of the first days proceedings for the Patriot & will not write them over again.

	We Are all getting on very well, & the members seem very cordial to me.  My old friend Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger is here & at this house and we have a great deal shot.  The old gentleman is failing rapidly.  Edmund Rhett sits by me in the convention & we have had a great deal of talk.  He enquired after your mother & grandmother & aunts.

	I have just received a long letter from Mr. [William Alexander] Rosborough of Chester very complimentary.  I have also recd a dogrel poem in printHamilton, Petigru, Memminger, Thompson, myself, Butler, Orr &c &c.

	I saw Augustus Hoke here yesterday & I suppose he has gone home today.

	I will not close my letter which is more for your mother than you.  I will bring you & Fanny something pretty.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
