Letter 763
8 November 1872
Greenville

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you a draft for one Hundred Dollars, as I am not disposed to have you without money in a strange place, & I know you will take care of it & not spend it unnecessarily, or let it be stolen from you.  Have an eye to this.

	Your mother came in with me this morning & Fannie has just been here with Perry.  There was a horrible attempt night before last to burn up your aunt Susans House.  The fire was put in a parcel of lightwood under the house.  Just before day the cows got in the lot & in driving them out Ben discovered the fire powders& cotton had been used!

	They have not as yet made any discovery of the incendiary.  Suspicion has fallen on one or two negroes.  One Alexander turned off at the depot, and the other a strange negro from North Carolina, who was cutting wood for Susan.

	Willie is in Columbia attending the Fair & looking about as to contesting the election.  He has to go to Walhalla court Saturday.  Ben staid last night with Lewis Moonwent to look over his place & see his crop.

	Grant is elected.  I give up all hope of our country.  Thepeople seem almost as bad & foolish as the negroes.

	Hext wrote us this morning that he was elected for two months in the Hospital.

	Write me how you come on.  I was delighted to hear of your increased weight.  This is very encouraging.  Aiken may bring you out if you take care of yourself.  Let us hear particularly how you are doing in everything.

	I write in great haste.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
