Letter 33
3 December 1845
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just finished writing questions for the Students in Equity, who are to be examined tomorrow & I am one of the committee.  It is now eight oclock & I have to put the letter in the Post office tonight.  The preparation of questions has given me a good deal of trouble, & I did not know of my appointment till this morning.  There are four members of the Legislature and one member of Congress applying for admission in Equity.

	I have just received your letter of Sunday night &the Post letter also.  It had been lost in the Bar Room.  Hereafter I shall take your advice & go to the office myself.  Your letter advising me not to purchase any fruits for you has come too late.  This morning I started to you in Bensons wagon one hundred oranges, six coconuts, 1 dozen plantains, 1 doz Bananas, 1 keg of Grapes 26 pounds, delicious grapes. 50 cents worth of Almons  some ofnuts, some of Brazile nuts, 1 drum of Smyrna figs, 5 lbs of candy, 12 pineapples. All costing $16.85 cts.  They are all in one Box, except the grapes, which are in a keg & have also sent a large Box of Books, law books which I could not well do without.  I have paid for them in past by an order on a client in Charleston.  The balance I pay next Winter.  Jesse R. Gary owed me $100 for a case at Laurens.  The Books cost me $315.00 & cheap at that price.  I bought them of Mr. Carter & Allen.  I know you will be surprised but they are books I have long wanted & could not do well without.  All that I have, & all that I ever expect to make, have been & will be the product of Books.  My Books have been profitable & therefore I must cherish my Library.  I will pay for their balance $215 in some fees which I shall make pretty easily. Take good care of them & dont let the Box get wet before you put it in the house.

	You will receive the Boxes & key Tuesday next.  Benson, Wade & Lark were all down here hauling Gibbs property down.  Benson owes me & I have got him to take back the 2 Boxes & key.  Elias Earle has also sent up some Fruits and Speers sent up a Box full by some wagons.

	Tell Col. Coleman that the Rail Road Bill has been reported & read once in the Senate.

	I introduced some Resolutions today in the Senate on the subject of General Jackson, which I think are beautifully drawn.  They have been ordered to be printed & I will send you a copy.

	I have not time to write you more at present.  Kiss the children.  Give my respects to your mother & Susan & Ann & McBee.  I hope they are all happy.  Write me all about them.  The weather is cold & bad.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry
