Letter 554
[10 December 1859]
Saturday night
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I did not go down to the Legislature this evening as the weather is bad, & nothing of interest before the House.

	I received your letters & one from Col. Ashmore this evening.  The Colonel says my Resolutions are extremely all in Washington as the very thing, & that others submitted are all stuff.  He writes gloomily, & thinks disunion fast approaching.

	It is probable that our Legislature will adjourn to meet the first Monday in May.  It is to be voted on tonight.  I am very willing as I shall have to come down anyhow.  We did nothing in the Legislature today.  Last night we had a warm discussion on the Spartanburgh & Asheville Rail Road [Greenville & French Broad].  Col. [Allen] McFarlan[d] & myself spoke against it.  [James] Farrow and [Oliver Evans] Edwards for it.  There is no danger of the Bill passing.

	Col. McFarland told me the other day that his mother enquired about you & cried, & said you had shown her more civility at Greenville than anyone else.

	This morning Governor Manning came to me and told me that the people were preparing to tar & feather a Massachusetts stone cutter who had declared himself an abolitionist.  Shortly afterwards I heard the mob shouting.  They made two negro men take him and whip him!  This is horrible & so regarded by thinking men, but the people are run mad & I fear will commit outrages all over the State.  This poor fellow had simply told that he was an abolitionist.  I did not hear that he had in any way interfered with slaves.

	I have just heard that Mr. Everett & Mrs. Carson are to be married.  You know she was in Boston when we were there.  Everett must be seventy & she cannot be more [than] thirty five.  This will be a union between Massachusetts & South Carolina.

	John Cunningham tells me that Pamela is better than she has been for ten years.  She may get well in her old age.  Mr. Everett ought to have married her.  But he has got a much more buxom wife in Mrs. Carson.

	I told Mrs. LeConte that you said it was a pitty that Frank was too young for Lula, but that I was going to write you, I could substitute Willie who was about the right age.  She says Lula will make a good wife.  I hope not so gay, & fond of admiration as she is.  She goes to the State House every day & stays up in the gallery till we adjourn.  She says she oversees herself in looking at the members & watching their movements whilst no discussion is going on.  Mrs. Spratt is with her every day, & she is a very pleasant & smart lady.

	I will now go down & get supper & will write you again tomorrow.  I rece[ive]d a note today from Miss Dix suggesting me to aid in the passage of a law about the Asylum.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
