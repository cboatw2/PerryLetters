Letter 610
28 June 1861
Camp Hampton

Dear Papa

	This is the last letter which I expect to write you from this place.  We leave here in the morning for Richmond tomorrow at 12 oclock.  We will go to Petersburg by Rail-Road and then we will go by horseback the rest of the way to Richmond.  We will make a stop of 4 or 5 hours in Charlotte to rest our horses before putting them on the other train, and we will stop at least a night, perhaps longer in Petersburg.  So I will have a chance to deliver the letter to Miss Orr.  I sent up Monarch by todays train.  I found out that I would not only have to pay transportation for him, but would have to find food for him outside of the company corn, which would put me to a good deal of trouble and sometimes be impossible.  So I concluded to send him home.  Some of the other men who have servants have any horses for them except the Captain, who can draw three rations, and in that way can get on very well.

	If there is any actual necessity, I might buy a cheap horse in Va., though I think we can do very well without horses for the servants.  You ought to pay only half price to the R. Road for carrying Monarch up, as I am a soldier, and the transportation of their horses is only half price.  I expect we will be in Richmond some time to drill.  The whole legion will be there together.  We will be camped about 3 miles from Richmond.

	I am writing in great haste, and so must close.  I will send home some clothes.  I like the pistol very well.  The shirts were received.

       Give my love to Ma, the children, Grandma and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry
