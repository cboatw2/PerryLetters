Letter 465
7 February 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & were glad to hear you were now going to study hard.  But we were very much mortified to hear you would be lower this last month than you had been.  This is too bad & you must study.  You say you do not wish to leave the navy.  Why do you not study hard.  I do not know what will become of you if you are dismissed.  My dear son I entreat you by the love you have for your mother & myself to turn over a new leaf & make it a point of honor to learn well your lessons & perform every duty in your school.

	If you will only make progress in your studies I will send you money or anything else.  But not till you do so.  Let your report for February be good.

	Willie came last Monday.  He will go back the last of this month & stop & see you again.  We will send some things by him to you.

	We are all well but Anna.  She is about the same.

	I am going to ride out & must stop.  Your mother will write you in a few days.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
