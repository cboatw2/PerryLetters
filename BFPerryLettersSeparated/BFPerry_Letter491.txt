Letter 491
30 May 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you last Monday but none this week.  I was so busy last week that I could not write you.  I had to prepare all my Equity business for court next week.  I go to Spartanburgh Court & may not have time to write you.

	We are all well except & she is improving.  Fanny spent yesterday at Mr. Clevelands with Miss Mary your little sweetheart.  Hext has gone this morning to the Sunday school.  Hayne & Arthur are running about the yard.

	Your mother has written you that we have sold Wiley.  John has taken his place in the stables & does very well.  He will make, & does now, make a good hustlerdrives well.  We do not miss Wiley at all.  I sold him for $1200.  He is with his wife.

	The Greenville Cars yesterday evening ran over a poor drunken man & killed him.  He was lying in the track & the Engineer did not see him in time to stop the cars.

	We are glad to hear you are getting on so well.  You June examination is now at hand, and we hope to hear that you are not dismissed but have passed your studies well.

	I have nothing more to write but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
