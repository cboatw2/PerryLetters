Letter 322

Charleston

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line before going to bed. Anna has gone to bed.  It is now after nine oclock.

	We reached here yesterday evening.  Nikerson seemed very glad to see me & today at dinner s[page torn] me a bottle of old sherry wine.

. 	After breakfast I went to K & purchased groceries--a barrel of crushed sugar[page torn] ten centspowdered sugar at 9 cts and for servants at 6 cts.  I thought it just as well to purchase these things as to be sending to the stores in Greenville.  I purchased five boxes of candles.   [Page torn]was cheaper than tallowalso bought BuckwheatBrandy, champagne, coffee, tea, soap, prunes, doi[page torn] figs, oisters & pickle beef.

	After returning from K I paid Reynolds a visit & bought a most beautiful fashionable barouche &$275.00.  It is just like one purchased by Lowndes whose daughter was married the other day for her.  I am sure you will like it.  It can be made very close or entirely open.

	Anna went to see her relations this morning & delivered all your letters.  They were all glad to see her.  Your uncle Arthur called to see me but I was out.

	This evening I carried Anna to see Miss [Victoria] Murdens.  We were both pleased.  Tomorrow I will take her & leave her there.  She goes into a room with Miss Cane [Cain?] & Miss Palmertwo Senators daughters whose fathers I know very well.  Miss McLeod is also to be here from Statesburgh who says she went to school with Anna at Greenville.  Her house & everything seemed neat.  Judge Frost told me this morning he would like to pay Anna some attentionthat he has two daughters about her age.

	I will go up to Augusta Saturday & see what has become of Reuben & be at home Tuesday night if possible.  I may have to go on to Mrs. Harrisons at Marietta.  I think he went on with her women.  They can tell me his plans.

	Sam Townes is here in a drinking spreesay nothing about it.  He is bordering on delirium tremors & Dr. Dow attending himbut dont mention it.  He will come up with me if he is able to travel.  I have met Hastie & wife here who are both very pleasant.  Some Griffins & others from Newberry came down to go to Miss Boles school.

	I saw General Martin this morning & must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
