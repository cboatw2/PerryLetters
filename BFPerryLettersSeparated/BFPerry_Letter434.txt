Letter 434
26 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night but did not have time to write you.  I sent your bundles by Wells.  I rece[ive]d also last night a letter from Anna & one from Frank which I enclose to you.  I am glad you have determined to play Editor for me in noticeing  Bradfords articles.  I enclose you my letter to the Patriot which will give you all the news I have.

	I am now writing to you after breakfast. & shall not have time to write this evening as I am invited to dine with Governor Allston at five oclock.  Last night after returning from the college the Governor invited Mrs. LeConte & the Professor & Petigru, Memminger & myself to supper & to take a glass of champaign.  We spent a very pleasant time till twelve oclock.  Mrs. LeConte had rece[ive]d a letter from Lula yesterday.  I read Annas Letter to Elford who is rooming with me.  He said President Duncan said Anna & Mary Mauldin were as thoroughly educated as any girls in America so far as they had gone.

	I now have to go & meet a committee for Col. Memminger who has had to go down to the College.  I must also go & see Col. Pickens.  Col. Simpkins has just been to see me.  I saw all thelast night.  They seemed very cordial notwithstanding my Bill in the Legislature to cut off all their heads
as Judge ONeall remarked in his speech last night.  I replied to him & made a good speech & carried the Board with me in the election of President with the help of Petigtu & Dawkins.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I rece[ive]d a letter from R.B. Rhett saying his concerns nearly cured.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
