Letter 514
1 February 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I did not write you on Sunday.  And I am in such deep affliction, that I have no heart to put pen to paper.

	Your dear departed sister is not out of my mind one moment in the day.  I hope her death will have a good effect on all of us & make us seek religion.  You my dear son must prepare yourself for heaven as well as for this world.  You must be a good boy & be a comfort to your Parents.  Behave well & study hard.  Prepare for your examination.  Have a high standing in your class.

	Willie is with us.  When he returns your mother will send you a trunk full of clothes & presents.

	We are all very much obliged to you for your presents.  They are very pretty, but sad to look at, now that Anna is no more.

	We have rece[ive]d a great many kind letters in our affliction & I think of publishing them in a pamphlet as a mourning tribute to Annas memory.

	We are all as well as could be expected.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
