Letter 278
5 February 1854
Greenville

My Dear Sir [George D. Tillman]

	I have recently been informed that you heard & remember Mr. Tabers Address, last December in the College chapel, & that your opinion of the principles of the Address is in accordance with my criticism.

	I should be glad to hear from you in relation to this matter--your remembrance of the addressThe impression it made on your mind in regard to the education of the masses eviltheeffects of common schools & the system of reading and writing.

	I should like also your opinion whether or not the address is precisely the same that was delivered.  Are not some expressions modifiedsome left out & some added.

	  I do not know that I shall ever make any further publication in regard to Mr. Taber.  But your reply should be written with a view to publication.  I wish to show it to my friends & others.

	I had intended writing to a number of persons but after publication of the address, corrected with a view to accuracy, I concluded it was not worthwhile.  Judge ONeall & Dr. Lieber sustain me entirely in regard to criticism.

	I hope you have seen my reply to Taber & the letters accompanying the reply.  I have just written a second reply to his last publication in the Mercury.

	With great respect I am yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
