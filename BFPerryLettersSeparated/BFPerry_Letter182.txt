Letter 182
28 November 1851
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter of Wednesday & will write you a few lines, as you have been so good a wife as to write me every mail.  I hope your kindness & love will never grow less.

	I have just come up from the supper table when I saw Judge Butler, who enquired kindly after you all & especially Willie & Frank.  Really these two young gentlemen are quite famous.

	I have had a great deal of pleasant chat with the secessionists, & they all seem to look upon me most favorably.  My article about Col. Memminger & looking to the Lord & being dismissed has been published in the Carolinian & excited a good deal of amusement at the expense of Memminger.

	Tomorrow Mr. Middleton & myself are to dine with the students in college at one oclock.  We dine there to see how the students live.  They complain of the fare dreadfully.

	I have been placed on the committee to examine students applying for admission to the Bar next Tuesday.

	I have introduced my bill to give the election of Electors to the people & made it the special order of the day for Tuesday next.  I will make a short speech for it.

	Col. Brockman recd. A letter from Mr. Carter of Charleston very highly complimentary to myself in particular & the Greenville people in general.

	The secessionists are holding a meeting tonight & the cooperationists had a meeting last night.

	Old Mr. Reese who wrote the letter you mentioned has been a great while a strong friend of mine, and I am truly sorry he is going to leave the state.

	I am glad you & the children & servants are all getting better of your colds.

	My old friend Fre has been to see me, & was delighted at my presenting his memorial & having it printed.

	We are all getting on very well.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

P.S. I do not care to rent my Farm at all & especially to the persons applying.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
