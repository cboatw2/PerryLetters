Letter 408
20 September 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your examination will take place tomorrow.  Before you read this letter it will be decided whether or not you are a Midshipman.

        I saw your Lane as I came home going on & gave him a letter to you.  He looked like a good Boy.

	You must write me all about your examination & the students & Professors.

	You may tell Mrs. Blake that I know her sister Mrs. Pendergrast.  I travelled with her from Portsmouth to Washington in the spring of 1853 with General Thompson.

	I have just written a letter to Willie.  He has written but one letter to us since he has been at Harvard.  I told him to write to you & Anna.

	You must give my thanks to Mr. Miller for his attentions to you & to Mrs. Green.

	We are all well except Arthur.   He is getting better I hope.

	Willie Long has come back from the Asylum perfectly restored.  Mr. Westfield lost his little son yesterday.  There has been a great deal of sickness with children.

	I will send you tomorrow a certificate of moral character if required.  Perhaps Mr. Miller & Mrs. Green could give you one that would answer.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
