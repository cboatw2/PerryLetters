Letter 519
9 March 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received two letters from you last night informing us that Willie had arrived in Annapolis.

	We were very sorry to hear that you had got 28 demerits last month.  If you go on in this way  you will soon get your 200 & be reported to the Secretary of the Navy.  Do my son try to get no more.  You say you have had bad luck.  It is bad conduct.  There is no luck about demerits.

	We were glad to hear that your standing in your studies was good.  But you must try & stand higher in your class.  Let your sole aim be to rise & stand at the head of your class.  A boy will never do anything without ambition to excel.

	I am glad to hear you intend writing to Thomas at Fairfield.  Open a correspondence with him & tell about his studies to be admitted.  He will thank you for it & be your friend when he goes on.

	I have no news to write you.  The Furman University & the Female college have opened well & have a large number of pupils.

	We are all well.  Vardry has been deaf, but is getting better.  Susan & her children all took dinner with us today.  Your grandmother is better.

	I am constantly receiving letters from a cousin I have found out in Massachusetts.  He is a Preacher & a very intelligent & educated gentleman.

	Fannie is now going to school again.  Hext & Hayne are also going to school.  Arthur is grown a great deal & is very pretty & smart.  Fannie is very tall & almost a young lady.  You would hardly know her.

	We all look forward to seeing you in June with a great deal of pleasure.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
