Letter 384
15 December 1856
Congaree House

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely this evening & found very little done in my absence.  Dr. Furman has invited me to dine at his mess tomorrow & I may not be able to write you.  Enclosed I send a letter for the Patriot.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  Today was very cold, but I am glad that I went home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tom McL daughter is to be married this week & he came down with me to be absent.  He does not approve the match.  Peter Cauble is to be married also this week.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
