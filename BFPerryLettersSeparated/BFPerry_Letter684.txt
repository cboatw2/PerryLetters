Letter 684
7 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read the newspaper & will now write you a line or two before breakfast.  I recei[ve]d your letter last night, & was glad to hear from you.  I hope the Beeves are killed & that John is able to attend to his wirk again.

	I saw Fannie yesterday in the State House & introduced my friend   to her & Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  The members of the House went into the Senate Chamber to rattify  a Bill, & the ladies came into the Hall to look at some pictures.  Fannie has a bad cold, but was going to a party at  Mrs. Joseph LeContes last night.  I dine with the Governor today.  Capt. Williams passed through here yesterday on his way to Wilmington.  I thought he had gone on long since.

	Mr. L sent down last evening & paid me $256.61 fees in my sequestration cases.  This will help me pay my board Bill.  It is now raining and we shall probably have a long wet spell.  In reading the paper this morning I was shocked to see the death of Col. [James] OHanlon announced.  I wrote a letter to him yesterday about Hext & myself paying him a visit.  I had heard he was sick but did not suppose he was dangerously ill.

	I met yesterday in the streets William the son of my Brother Foster Perry with his leg cut off.  He lost it at Rome Georgia.  But he was looking well & cheerful.  He had come down to be placed on the retired list.  Wilbu & John Perry are in Virginia & Clark in the army of Texas.  Warren & William are at home.  Harriet & Elizas husbands are in the army.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter last night from Mrs. Cunningham about her card factory.  She is very much provoked & wishes me to oppose or restrict the Charter.  She sent me a bundle of papers.  I will see to what she wishes & write her.  John Cunningham is here & has lost one eye.

	Col. OHanlon died of inflamation of the bowels as did Gov. Hammond & perhaps brought on in the same way.

	The Legislature refused yesterday to elect Judges.  There is nothing doing & if it was not for Col. Wares case I would come home.  It is likely that Judge Magrath will be elected Governor.

	I have no news from the army except what you see in the newspapers.  Sherman is marching on Savannah.  The Governor has ordered all persons on this side of Savannah River below a certain point to move or destroy their property.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
