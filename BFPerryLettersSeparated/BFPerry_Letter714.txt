Letter 714
Friday, 3 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I wrote you two letters yesterday & as the mail goes out this evening I will write you again.

	If possible I will return home Tuesday evening to greet you & the family & receive your congratulations.  I hope you are now happy & I am now anxious to receive your letter tomorrow morning & learn what you have to say about my election.  All sorts of compliments are paid me by letters & the newspapers on my complimentary vote.  Buist paid me a very high compliment yesterday in the Senate for patriotism, honor, talents &c. but he did not vote for me.  It is amazing to hear so many compliments to Gov. Manning & myself on account of our good looks.  You woiuld suppose that we were elected on that account.

	This morning I rece[ive]d one hundred & forty Pardons which has put everybody in a good humor.  My pardon was amongst themalso General Thompsons, Elford, Gradys, Stokes, Donaldson &c.  You may tell them.  But poor Mrs. Pickens goes off today without hearing anything about Governor Pickens pardon.

	Willie was invited by Miss Martin to tea.  I think she is in love with him.  He went & found a few persons thereGeneral Kershaw, Wade Hampton, Jr &c.  Her father is a Methodist Preacher.  She is very pretty & smart.  She wrote him a note.

	The election of Judges has been postponed.

	Give my love to all.  I wrote to T Tupper for your mother.  He is in Charleston.

	I shall stay at home till I start to Washington about the 25th of this month.  I have to come to Columbia then & count the votes for Congress.

	Your affectionate husband, Senator & Governor &c., B.F. Perry

P.S.  Mrs. Pickens was very anxious no doubt to spend the Winter in Washington with her husband as Senator.  She is fond of society & Edgefield must be a dull place for her.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
