My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night on my return from court.  I dined with Col. Orr & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mason, Sam Townes perfect gentleman keeps the House.  Ben Yancey has turned union man & says England will crush the Slave States if they dissolve the union.  Tell your mother there is no danger of War or disunion.  The northern people are getting right again.  Their meetings in Boston & New York were glorious.  I am now very busy with my law cases& will get through in a day or two.  Yesterday my separate court of appeals was defeated in the House.  But Rhetts Bill passed the Senate & we will try & pass it in the House.  The House is now discussing the Slavery question.  I shall not be able to be there today.

       General Easl[e]y & Goodlett came down yesterday.  Easl[e]y told me a great deal of news about Greenville and the abolitionist extremist there.  Mrs. Spratt came up the other day & I told her she ought to have heard her husbands speech & I told her she ought to have come sooner to have heard her husbands speech on the Blue Ridge Rail Road.  She asked me in Spratts presence if he made a good speech.  I told her the Blue Ridge was between us whilst he was speaking & I could not see his performance well.

       I sent you two books by Poinsett Wells which I hope you rece[ive]d.  I know you will be pleased with the Gregson Letters.  I will speak to Stokes about sending the books.

       	I wish to see you all very much.  I must now go to breakfast.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
