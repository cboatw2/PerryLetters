Letter 25
20 June 1845
Pickens C,H,

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line by General Thompson & to thank you for your long letter.  Willie is quite well.  His grand mother was delighted to see him & so were all his relations especially Fosters wife & family.  He has been very much admired by all who have seen him.  His only fault is that he will stick to me too closely.

	I shall probably be at home tomorrow evening (Saturday).  One of my cases has been postponed & the other we are trying today.

	You did not write me how much you subscribed to the Church.  I hope not much.  There is no necessity for a new church at all, & I regard the whole project untimely.  But more of this when I return.

	 We have had a fine rain & I hope it extended to Greenville.

	In quite haste yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
