Letter 50
3 August 1846
Kinder Hook

My dear Liz

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter to read & hand to Col. Townes.  I have nothing to add to it.  I wrote it because I had a few leisure moments.

	I was very much gratified with my visit to Mr. Van Buren & spent the evening most pleasantly.    When you see Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett say to them that Mr. Van Buren, Mr. Gilpin & Lady & Mr. John Van Buren & Mrs. Van Buren all desired to be remembered to them & spoke of them in the most affectionate termssaid they were in hopes to have seen them here this summer.

	By waiting to see Mr. Van Buren I have lost two days & I assure [you] I hesitated whether to do so or not.  I thought however that you would desire it, & that you would be willing to postpone the pleasure of seeing your husband that length of time for him to make the acquaintance of the ex President.  I was pleased with Governor Wright, but had only a few moments to stay before the cars left.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone.  They are to meet me at New Haven tomorrow night.  They will be returning from Boston & I shall be going on.  My impatience to return home is now so great that I shall not enjoy what I see as I otherwise might.

	 I will write you from New Haven if I have time.

	I must now close my letter & start to the Rail Road.  God bless you & the dear little children & God only knows how much I wish to see you all again.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
