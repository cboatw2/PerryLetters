Letter 104
8 May 1848
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived in Columbia this evening at four oclock & found your letter.  I called at the Post office as I drove down street & enquired but my letters had been sent to Col. Maybins.  I was very glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home, because many things have occur[r]ed & I have seen several hundred persons.

	The weather is excessively hot & I am almost in a state of meltiness as Miss Fanny Kemble says in her book of travels in the U. States.  I shall therefore be very brief in my narrative.

	Thursday night I spent at Mr. Conners & was much pleased with him & his wife.  They are very pleasant & genteel persons indeed.  Conner was hesitating about the election.  Col. Orr had been there the night before.  I have no doubt he is for me & he has great influence.  I stopped at several houses above there & found them all for me.

	Friday morning I went to muster early & called at every house on the roadgot on Orrs track again.  There were not a great many persons at the muster on Friday.  That evening I went to Dr. Hunters.  He was not at home when I arrived.  I found that he is a single man & lives with his mother & sisters.  The place is a beautiful one & displays more taste than any I have seen except Rosemont.  Miss Hunter met me at the door, & I introduced myself to her.  She is a very pleasant, intelligent & handsome young lady.  After conversing a few minutes, she said you have not been at dinner, and in opposition to my intreaties observed that she would go & have dinner prepared.  The Dr returned & I spent a very pleasant evening.  Invited Miss Hunter to visit Greenville.

	Saturday Col. Orr & myself made speeches & the feeling of the crowd was decidedly for me.  Whilst speaking one fellow stepped out & said to me we are all going to vote for you here.  Someone else observed to Col. Williams that a nigger could tell the difference in our speeches.  Esquire Brown came to me & said he was going to vote against me but there was too great a difference between us & he should vote for me.  The expression was general that I had gained a victory & that the scale was turning rapidly against Col. Orr.  So Said Col. Mosely, Col. Williams, Major Anderson & so felt everyone.

	Saturday night I was going to Col. Kerns, but stopped at Pitts & he made me stay with him.    He said there are twenty votes you will gain by staying with me.  I replied then put up the horse.  He keeps a store & is a man of great influence & wealthhas a magnificent house, but lives as plain as any one.  He sent off for his taylor,, blacksmith, carpenter, hirelings & neighbors.  I drew my bottle of old brandy & it was drunk up directly.  I have never seen a kinder man than Pitts & I left him as warm a friend as Col. Williams.  He had been rather opposed to me.

	Sunday morning I went to Col. Kerrs & saw him.  He feels the responsibility of the change he is about making, & when I spoke of Miss Earle, the tears filled his eyes.  He is a most excellent gentleman.  He said whilst courting he had given me as one of his references.  He has a handsome house & richly furnished.

	I stopped at every house on the road till I got to the Newberry line.  My run will be general & almost unanimous in the lower end of that side of Laurens.  In the upper end of the same Ennoree side, Esquire Griffith told me a relation of his told Col. Orr he would not get ten votes!  Orr replied he liked for persons to speak the truth to him no matter how discouraging it may be.

	I saw Major Simpson this evening.  He came to meet Mrs. Simpson & two children & carry them to Washington.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here on their return from Charleston.  I was introduced to Mrs. Brown the engineers wife this evening.

	I shall leave here this week & go back to the Battalion muster on Saturday & return again next Sunday in time to attend to my cases in the court of Appeals.  So you see I am disposed to be quite industrious.  I do not know when I shall write you again.

	I drove today forty one miles between 7 oclock & 1 & ? after 3 oclock P.M.  This istravelling.  In conclusion let me say that my prospects are brightening & I could not have desired greater encouragement than I have recd.

	I have not been out of the Hotel since I came.  Have seen a great many persons however.

	Take care of yourself & the children & servants & household generally.  I am truly yours, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
