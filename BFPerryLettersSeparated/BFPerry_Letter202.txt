Letter 202
5 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I went to church this morning & heard a fine sermon from Mr. Thornwell.  It was late when I reached the Chapel & it was crowded.  Governor Means saw me without a seat & beckoned me on the platform & I sat by the side of him.  This politeness on the part of his Excellency I appreciated.

	The Hotel is running over with Ladies.  I never saw such a crowd of young ladies in the market.  They seem to show by their freedom of swooning that they are anxious to be courted & are here for that purpose.  I think it would make them happier than theynow are to be married.  But how long their happiness would continue is doubtful.

	Tomorrow is commencement and after that event we shall begin to be more quiet.  The ladies will begin to depart.  I wrote a long letter today for the Patriot & which you will see.

	Poor [Samuel] Mauldin was today placed in the Asylum.  He remonstrated most earnestly against the act.  It was, says Mr. Duncan, the most trying act of his life to leave him in the Asylum.  He begged & plead[ed] not to be left there.  It is a melancholly thing.  I drew up his papers last night for his restraint.  He had become dangerous to himself.  He is an opium eater & nothing but opium will appease his mind & nerves.

	Amongst the persons here are Leitners & Bobos daughters.  Miss Leitner enquired after you & Willie this morning.  I met a Miss Bobo who said she was at school at Greenville when we were married & attended a party at Mr. Crofts give[n] to us.  Col. Perrin & his daughters are here.  My friend McLure of Chester & his daughters.

	There was duel fought Friday between Dr. Keith & Mr. [Olin Miller] Dantzler of the House.  The former was shot in the arm.  He is here & walks about with his arm in a sling.  Dantzler was untouched.

	I met the reporter of the House this evening who is an Irishman.  He had been reporter for Congress and said that he had seldom heard such a speech as mine on the floor of Congress.  He said he had heard of my reputation as a debater but that I had far surpassed his expectations.

	This morning I shaved with my left hand.  This is a decided improvement in my arm.

	I recd your letter dated Friday morning last night & was glad to hear you were all well.

	I will write you after the commencement is over.  We have agreed to adjourn on Wednesday the 15th inst.  I will write you about sending the horses & carriage in time.

	Nothing yet has been done in the Legislature.  My speech will not make its appearance till Tuesday morning.  It is very long.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
