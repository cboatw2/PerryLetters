Letter 46
18 July 1846
Philadelphia

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Col. Townes describing everything I have seen since I left Washington & to that letter I refer you.

	I am now travelling with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  Yancey did not come on with us as we hoped.  We will go on rapidly together till we reach Boston.  There Col. Fair will leave me & return home & I will stop along to deliver my letters & see more of the country.  He will go with me to Niagara & Quebec.  I find it very pleasant to have a friend, & will more so when I get into Canada.

        I hope to hear from you in New York.  If you wrote within three or four days after you wrote me last in Washington I shall receive it.  But my stay will be as short one in New York until my return.

       In looking over Sullys Gallery of Paintings I was struck with the painting of Adam & Eve.  It is the most lovely picture I ever saw & if I had money would purchase it at $150.   You will see some account of it in my letter to the Mountaineer.  I am delighted with Philadelphia but have seen no one.  Your mothers letters I shall have to leave in the Post office.  I left Mrs. Heywards at Willmington as I passed through it.  I feel awkward in calling to see strange ladies & I suppose they would have some such feelings themselvesnow shall I be able to call & see Capt. McCall as I pass through New Jersey.

       I was looking at some bracelets for you this morning.  They are fashionableone only.  But I will take your advice & make my purchases as I return.  I saw a bedstead worth $2500, a wardrobe $1500 and the whole set for one chamber worth $8,000!  I saw some beautiful & new fashioned sofasFrenchprice $190some neat plain ones at $35.

       I have met in Philadelphia Dr. Thompson, son of Wallace Thompson of Union who is attending the medical lectures.  He has been very kind in showing us the city.  I find hacks here cost me a great deal.  They charge one dollar per hour for driving.  In Washington my carriage hire amounted to all most as much as my board Bill.

       So far my dear Liz I have been delighted with my trip.  I knew so little & had seen so little of the world before compared with other gentlemen.  I have learnt much & acquired much valuable information which I hope will be of service to me in other life.

       You must take good care of yourself and children.  Do not whip them.  I believe it is best to let them be unrestrained than to be punishing.  All children are bad & unruly.  Do not let Will study too hard.  I was glad to hear he was head again & hope he will remain there.  I will bring them all a pretty present.  How I do wish to see them& yet we are separated a thousand miles by Rail Road &c.  This is a long distance when I think of it.  Tell Anna she must be a good girl & I like to hear that she cries when my letters are read & hope to see Frank much grown when I return & hope also to see my dear Liz recovered & in good health with blooming cheeks again.  It has been almost a month since your confinement & I hope you are pretty well.  But you must not get well too quick.

       I hope the servants are doing well.  If they do not it is best to let them alone & not have any difficulty with them.  In Washington they had white servants entirely.  Here they have black ones.  I get along with the black ones best.

       I will write you from New York if I have time.    I hope there to see someone from Greenville.  General Thompson told me to write him when I returned & he might go back with me.

       Give my love to your mother & family & kiss the children for me.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
