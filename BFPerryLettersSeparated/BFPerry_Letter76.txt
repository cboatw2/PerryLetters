Letter 76
16 May 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your short letter by Fridays mail, & I truly regret that Susan & Luther are not doing better.  He is a great fool & I have no doubt a very disagreeable husband.  But Susan should reflect that she was not a stranger to him when they married, & she promised before her God to love, honor & obey him.

	General Thompson did speak to McBee as we came down about doing something for Luther.  He said he was afraid to mention Pinckney on account of his interest.  McBee told him Luther was not capable of doing anything, that he & Tench Corson had already spent for him $30,000.  This I should suppose hardly true.

	We had a pleasant dinner at Governor Johnsons & all made speeches, drank a good deal of wine, & went to the Ball.  Judges, Governor, Webster & all.  There was a very large assembly at the Ball, but very little beauty.  I did not see one pretty face in the room.  One of two things has certainly happened to me.  The Ladies are less pretty than they used to be or I have lost my perception of female beauty.

	Col. Dawkins & wife were at the Ball.  I had considerable conversation with her & she was the only lady I did speak to.  She seems pleasant & agreeable  She said all wives were ambitious for their husbands to be great men.

	Yesterday I was invited to dine at Dr. Gibbes with Mr. Webster & the Judges & Professors in college.  The dinner was the most interesting party I have yet been at.  Webster covered a great deal & his conversations were remarkably interesting.

	I went to church this morning & sat with Dr. Gibbes & Chancellor Harper.  Mr. Webster & lady were there.  The new Episcopal church is a magnificent building & beautiful inside. The handsomest church in South Carolina.  Mrs. Alexander Taylor was just in front of me.  I went up to her after service & she seemed really glad to see me, took my arm & I conducted her to her carriage.  She enquired after the children & yourself, said her children had the [w]hooping cough.  She invited me to call & see them.

	I recd your letter this evening dated Friday evening & was truly glad to hear from you.  In it you mention the expected marriage OF Miss Walker.  I heard a [piece of scandal which I will mention.  Dr. Ellet & his wife have separated on account of that littlefellow Theodore Gourdine!!  And it is said he seems rather proud of the

	I shall not be able to leave here till Wednesday or Thursday.  If anything should occur tomorrow I will write you again.  Kiss the children for me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
