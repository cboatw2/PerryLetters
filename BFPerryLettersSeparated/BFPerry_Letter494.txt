Letter 494
20 June 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We have not heard from you for two weeks, & are very uneasy.  We hope to hear tomorrow.

	I saw it stated that the Practice ship was to sail today, 20th.  If so & you go in it you will not receive this letter till your return

	We have not heard from you since your examination & that makes us more uneasy.  I hope however you passed your examination safely.

	We are all well except Anna & she is improving.  Your grandmother & Susans families are all well.

	I returned from Abbeville court last week.

	Lula LeConte is to be with us next week to stay with Anna some days.  The father & mother will come up the week after on their way to Flat Rock.

	If you go to Europe you must write us whenever you can & let us hear all about your voiage.

	Our House is finished & looks pretty.  We have got a room filled up for you when you return next summer.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Did you receive the draft for $50 I sent you two weeks ago.
