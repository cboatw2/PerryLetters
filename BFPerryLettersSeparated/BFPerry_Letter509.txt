Letter 509
26 December 1858
Greenville SC

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & hope you are now in Washington City & that you rece[ive]d the $20.00 sent you in time to bear your expences.

	I am glad you are well of your cough.  You must be careful not to catch cold in going from a warm room out into the cold air.

	We are all well except Ann.  She is very feeble, but coughs less than she did.  She says she feels badly & has a very soar throat.

	Your grandmother Susan & Ann took their Christmas dinner with us yesterday.  They are all well & talked a great deal about you & Willie.

	I have just written to Willie to call & see you as he comes home.  Your mother says you must send by Willie the things you bought in Europe & your old clothes for the servants.  When Willie returns she will send you some sheets &c.

	I hope you are getting on well with your studies.  Be good & studious.  The people of Greenville enquire very often how you are doing.  They feel an interest in you & you must be ambitious & rise in your class.

	We have a cold wet, dull Christmas & nothing new to write you.

	I think I mentioned to you that I had recei[ve]d a letter from our kinspeople in Sherborn, Massachusetts.  They say that the whole town is connected there with the Perrys & have invited me to go & see them.    Is there anyone in your Academy from that part of Massachusetts.

	My dear boy you have no idea how much we all wish to see you & what an interest we take in your success in your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
