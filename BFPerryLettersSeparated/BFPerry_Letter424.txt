Letter 424
8 November 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your mother rece[ive]d a letter from you night before last, but Mrs. Doctor Butler has it, & two other letters of yours to read.  The letter you sent your grandmother last week was sent to Mr. McBees & the old gentleman was very much pleased with it.  He said you wrote like a man instead of a Boy.  He made Vardry come down & read it.

	  I am glad you went to see Captain Blake & hope you will go & see Mrs. Blake.  You must also not forget Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You should have your likeness taken for Mrs. Greens daughter as she has asked for italso send one for Miss McR & give Miss Bartow one.

	You will see in the last Patriot that I have acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Bartows sermon & will publish it as soon as possible.  I admire it very much.

	You ought to tell young Rodgers that you know his aunt Mrs. Doctor Butler very well & hear from through me.  He & you too may be some kin.  Mrs. Butler says that three Brothers, our ancestors, came over from England about two hundred years agotwo of them settled in Massachusetts, & one in Rhode Island.  We are descended from the Massachusetts branch & your grandfather Perry was born near Boston.  Commodore Perry is descended from the Rhode Island Brother.

	Your mother will fix you up a box of books &c. when I go to Columbia next week & I will forward them by Adams Express.

	Your grandmother has been sick, but is now better.  All the rest of us are well.  The servants are well & the horses fat & sleek.

	Poor Mrs. Gridley died yesterday.  She had been bedridden for twelve months.  There have been a good many deaths in Greenville since you left her.

	I am very much pleased to hear you are going to sea next summer & will coast around by Boston & see Willie.

	You must send us your likeness, & I am glad to hear you are fat & hearty, & doing well in your school.  I hope you will try hard & avoid demerits, & study well.  You must study your lessons most attentively.

	Write me all about the Boys in the Naval Academy.  How many have you become acquainted with? & whom do you like best?  I hope your roommate is a clever steady & studious boy.

	I will try & go on to see you next May.  The Legislature meets tomorrow two weeks & you must then direct your letters to me in Columbia.  I will write occasionally, if I have time, while I am in Columbia.

       The students in Furman University are now preparing to leave here.  They all behave themselves well.  There has been no difficulties in the school.

       We hear from Willie once a once a week & from Anna every other day.  Willie says he has been out visiting in Boston & was invited to dine with Mr. Winthrop & to a party at Professor Pierces.

       I am very busy now with my law matters & arranging to attend the appeal court & Legislature.

       Give my love to your school & roommate Bradford & tell him to take good care of you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
