Letter 473
28 March 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter of 21st Inst last night & were glad to hear you were going to study better & do better.  I hope my dear Son you will not relax in your resolution.

	I was glad to hear you were pleased with you roommate.  Capt. Blake writes well of him.

	Anna is getting better & we think now that she may recover.  The doctors say so.  But she has been ibn great danger & is still confined to her bed.  But her breathing is much improved.  We have been in great distress about her, & you ought not to increase our distress by your idleness or bad conduct.  I hope you will not.

       Captain Blake writes you are doing better.  I am trying to arrange my affairs so that I may go on & see you in two or three weeks, but it is doubtful whether I can.

	The Students in the South Carolina College have had a great rebellion & ninety seven have been suspended till October & five more till May. They wanted holiday & tarred the benches.

	Willie Beattie has returned from Virginia & says the university is broken up on account of sickness.

	We are all well except Anna.  Becky is up & about again.

	Court was here last week.  We did not get half through.  Judge Wardlaw comes back to hold court in August.

	You must study hard & behave well.  Dont idle over your book but study & think of what you are studying.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
