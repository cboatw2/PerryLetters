Letter 367
21 November 1856

My dear Liz

	I have just breakfasted and will now write you a few lines.  I wrote you from Columbia.  The next I started from this place & reached here safely about two oclock.  The trip down was very pleasant although there was an immense concourse od=f persons on the cars.  Col. Wilson & Mr. Pinckney Huger & myself sat together & had a good deal of pleasant chat.  Mr. Huger told me his sister [was] in the cars when the terrible accident happened two or three days before.  But the car she was in jumped the gap in the road & she did not know that anything had happened till she heard the screams of the passengers in the cars below which were crushed to pieces.

	I found on my arrival here that the South Carolina Institute had a magnificent private parlor & bed chamber attached engaged for me next to the ladies drawing room.  Tell Anna I am in the Bridal chamber which she saw here once.  I wish you were with me.  It would be very pleasant.  I shall perhaps never be so handsomely accommodated again.  It would be pleasant for you to have a private parlor to receive your visitors.  The House is very much crowded & Governor Means seemed a little curious [at] my superior accommodations to himself.

       In the evening after my arrival Lawton & DeSaussure & the Vice President of the Institute called on me & carried me to the Hall.  It is beautiful & the paintings & sculpture are truly magnificent.  The whole collection is wonderful, beautiful beyond description.  The Standard & the Courier both sent to me for a synopsis of my address to publish after delivery.  But I preferred the whole address being published & declined.

       Yesterday evening Mr. Taylor the President & Mr. Reynolds called for me to go over to deliver my address.  I met in the parlor a large number of gentlemen.  Col. Hayne & Judge King &  Mr. Thornwell amongst them.  The evening was wet & rainy, but there were one thousand persons in the Hall, who paid twenty five cents each for admission.  If the evening had been good there would have been two thousand.  Reynolds said there was a general wish & curiosity to see me & hear me speak.  I told him I supposed they had a curiosity to see the Traitor who had done so much to keep the State in the union.

       I was an hour & twenty minutes delivering my address & then skipped over parts of it.  The audience listened with profound attention.  My voice filled the great Hall completely and all heard me distinctly.  The gentlemen on the stage congratulated me on the address & said it was one of great ability && would do good.  I think it was well rece[ive]d, & I have been much flattered.  After the address I supped with the Institute & got home at eleven oclock.  We had a very pleasant time.  Today I dine with Mr. Lawton & sup with Mr. Yeadon at ten oclock.

       I have a great deal more to write, but not time to do so.  I hope you & the children are all well.  Col. Hayne enquired how his little godson comes on.  I shall go up to Columbia Sunday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Gowers fine carriage to be raffled for & he has presented me with a chance.  Perhaps I may win it.
