Letter 31
28 November 1845
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from dining at Dr. [Robert Wilson] Gibb[e]s in company with Mr. Poinsett, the Governor, Judge Butler. Chancellor Dunkin, [Chancellor] Johnson, Mr. Barnwell, Seabrook, Col. Pickens, Col. Allston, Col. Preston &c.  The stage leaves in the morning & I must write tonight or you will not have the pleasure of hearing from me.  The other evening I went with Major [James Edward] Henry to the Post office & sent your letter.  He enquired how often we write to each other & seemed astonished.  He writes once in two weeks.  I have just sent to the office for letters now & hope to hear from you before I have finished writing.  I spent a very pleasant & agreeable evening at Dr. Gibbes & drank some most excellent wine.

	Last night Mr. Poinsett made his Agricultural speech before a crowded House of Ladies & gentlemen.  I met Mrs. Poinsett therealso Miss Blanding by whom I was seated during the evening.  She enquired after you with interest & agreeably surprised when I told her Susan was to be married that evening.  She called McBee her old friend Luther.    She seems quite a pleasant young Lady.  Our friend Gilmore Sim[m]s made a most flowery speech complimenting the Ladies & some domestic wine which a Miss Roberts presented to the society.  After he had concluded I observed to the meeting that my fiend from Barnwell had omitted one thing one thing He should have offered his wine to the ladies after he finishedhis speech.  Wherefore he came forward & did so to the amusement of the meeting.    Your shoes were greatly admired by Miss Blanding & other ladies who examined them in my presence.  Dr. Gibbes reported on them & this morning he carried them to have made up.

	 Today I have been all day in the court of Appeals arguing a case of Mr. Kilgores.  In the House of Representatives they had some speaking on Mr. Calhouns course at the Memphis convention.  The members appeared like Calhouns slaves and refused to assert their opinions.

	The boy has just returned from the Post office & brings no letters from you which is a great disappointment but I suppose you were so busied about the wedding that you had not time to write.  I wish I could have been at it.  Susan is, I hope, happy, as she should be & deserves to be.  I think I heard someone say today that General [Milledge L.] Bonham was married.  Mr. Cox was here today on his return from the north poor fellowlooks rather sad.  He goes up in the stage in the morning.  He left Miss Skinner behind him.

	I hope to see, next week, someone from Greenville which would give me great pleasure.  You said so much in your last letter about my writing about home, that I will say nothing on the subject.   Still I should like to be there & see you & the children & Will I wish he was here with me.  Kiss Anna & Frank.

	The weather is cold.  I hope the meat is doing well.  You must write me everything about the Farm, the children &c.

	I must now bid you good night.  Give my congratulations to Susan & McBee.  Yor husband &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
