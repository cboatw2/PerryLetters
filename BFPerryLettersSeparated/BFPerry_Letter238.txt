Letter 238
7 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from court & found your letter of Monday last.  I am so glad to hear from you that I will write you another letter to acknowledge the receipt of it.  No letters come for Genl. Thompson & he is distressed about it.

	I was admitted to practice in the court here this morning & the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up tomorrow.  I made a few remarks this morning in the case before the court & produced a decided change in the mind of his Honor Judge Crawford as to the right of the U, States to take up which case the district attorney pleases.  I feel that I am prepared to make a good speech in the case if it comes on.

	I am sorry you say you may not write me again.  I hope my letters received will make you do so.  I may be here eight or ten days yet.

	There is still a great crowd of persons in Washington & office hunters in great abundance.

	General Thompson speaks favorably about our Indian business & thinks we shall be successful and realize fifteen thousand each in the case.  In great haste, your affectionate and devoted husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
