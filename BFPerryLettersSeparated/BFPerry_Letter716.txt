Letter 716
28 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line although I have nothing to tell you.  Our journey down was fatiguing, but otherwise pleasant.  Met Col. Orr at Belton & Mr. Alex Robertson & his daughter at the Greenville Depot.  All pleasant.  Fannie staid at Nickersons all night & Miss Janney came for her.  Mr. Janney gave me a long account of his visit to the President.  He said the President  immediately asked How is your friend Gov. Perry.

	The votes for Governor are being counted.  Col. Orr read me his Inaugural in case he is elected.  It is a very good one.  I have left him nothing to say in his message.

       General Hampton called to see me last night & sat a long time.  He is somewhat afraid that he may be elected.  The Governor will be Inaugurated tomorrow whoever he may be.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from Gov. Pickens.  He is allarmed about his pardon.  Gov. Manning has gone on the where his wife is in Virginia & requested me to bring his commission.  I shall remain here till I hear from the President.  Gov. Aiken, General McGowan, Col. Farrow & Genl Kennedy are elected to Congress.

	Willie & Easley are boarding at Mrs. Caldwells, & I do not see much of them.  Dunkin called to see me this morning.  There was no quorum in the Legislature till today.

	Mr. Janney called to see me this morning & said Fannie & his daughter were going down to the State Housethe old College chapelthat he had a parcel of young friends at his house last night.  Seigling carried a letter to Fannie from Maggie.

	I will send your mothers money by Holland Friday or Saturday from Charleston.

	Write me whenever you can.  Fannie will write you often I suppose & her letters will be more interesting than mine.

	Give my love to the children & tell them to be good & study hard.

	The New York Papers are still full of Governor Perry & South Carolina.  I will send you some of them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
