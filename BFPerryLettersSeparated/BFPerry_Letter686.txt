Letter 686
8 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now past ten oclock in the night but I will write you a few lines by Beattie who goes up in the morning.  We have just got through examining all the witnesses who have come down & theirs will come hereafter.  It will be some time before the case is decided.

	Today has been drisling & Fannie did not come to the State House.  We were all invited to Col. Johnsons this evening, but I could not go.  I had to examine witnesses befoere Senates Committee.  He sent his carriage for Dr. LeConte &c.  Fannie went I suppose & no doubt had a pleasant evening.

	Governor Pickens & his wife are here.  They came yesterday.  I saw Mrs. Pickens in the Gallery today.  She saw me looking at her & bowed most graciously to me in the Hall.  I was engaged all day & did not get to speak to her.  I met Gov. Pickens & had some chat with him.  I sent him Mrs. Haynes letter.  He enquired about Paul & said he drank very hard some time ago.  I told him I had never heard of it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight enclosing two to Fannie.  I also rece[ive]d one from General Easley saying he could not let me have any more corn & explaining.

	I have no further news, & will close my letter & go to bed.  Boyce & Price speak of going up in the morning & but for Col. Wares case I would also.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
