Letter 413
28 September 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you a letter from Col Orr to the Secretary of the Navy.  General Thompson writes the Secretary today in your behalf.  I also write to Judge Evans our Senator in the United States Senate, to write to the Secretary of the Navy.

	Col. Orr says you had better take his letter & go on & see the Secretary if you do not hear from him in a few days.  I think you had better go at once & see the Secretary.

	I am sorry I did not hear from you tonight.  Col. Orr writes me he wrote a very strong letter for you to the Secretary.

	Enclosed I send you a check to defray your expences home in case you are not admitted into the navy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
