Letter 517
20 February 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you last week, & your mother received one last night communicating the refreshing news, as to your splendid examination.  We are all delighted to know that you have done well & hope from henceforth that you will study hard & determine to graduate with honor.

	You have no idea my dear son of the importance now to be attached to your studies.  Your future happiness & honor depend on them.  Their neglect will make you a poor miserable wreck through life & perhaps a drunken blackguard.  On the other hand if you study hard & behave well you make such a man as Commodore Decatur or Lord nelson.

	I wish you also my son, to be good, honorable & religious.  Never do a mean thing or a dishonorable one.  Never tell a falsehood on any account.  Be kind & gentle and pray to your God to make you a good boy.    Never curse or use profane language.  Never touch spirits of any kind.  The great danger of a naval officer is intemperance.

	Col. Jones has got an appointment for his son Thomas at West Point.  I should hardly suppose he could enter the Military Academy, and if he does I am sure he will not stay there long, for it is said he is stupid & bad & will not study.

	Willie will leave here tomorrow week the 28th of February & will probably pass Annapolis 2nd (Wednesday) of march.  He will carry your trunk & send it down from the junction if he does not go by to see you.

	We are all well.  I am going to have all the letters received about Annas death printed with Mr. Arthurs sermon in a book & will send you a copy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
