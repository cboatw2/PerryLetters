Letter 347
10 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now after eleven oclock but have just returned from the special committee Zeide way.  I have only been to write you a line.

	I recd your letter & was greatly shocked to hear of the sad fate of the poor little girl Sarah.  I do hope my dear wife it will make you all careful about fire & candles.  You know my constant apprehensions on that subject.  Do make the servants put out their fires & candles at an early hour.

	Willie is asleep.  I will keep him here a day or two.

	My candle is giving out  & I must bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
