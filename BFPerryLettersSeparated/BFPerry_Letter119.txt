Letter 119
Friday night, 1848, [ca. November, December]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Post Office with your letter & thank you for the punctuality in writing.  I assure you it gives me great pleasure to hear from my little family and I begin to count the days when I may return to them.

	I might go up in the morning with perfect propriety.  But I am sure if I did, Dr. Anderson would never forgive me.  His case came up today & I spoke three hours & did not quite finish my argument.      General Thompson & Mr. Young follow me & Sullivan concludes on my side.  I might now leave my authorities with him & go home, having done for Dr. Anderson all I can.  But he would not think so & the people would say I had not done my duty.  The court will not sit again till Monday.  They will be all day delivering opinions.    Consequently I will not get off before next Thursday morning.  Perhaps, however, better luck may befall me & I may start Tuesday morning.

	Col. Townes & Col. Ware went with me to the Post office & I believe both recd letters from home.    Choice & Walker came down this evening.  I have seen the latter but not the former.  They are on their way to Charleston.

	You say Susan is going to housekeeping & I must make a substantial present.  I do not feel any such obligation.  Her husband is or will be worth five times as much as yours.  His children will be rich when ours are poor.  I have already given several handsome presents to Susan, a diamond ring, gold pencil case, gold thimble &c. &c. and have never received the first memento from her.  Her conduct too towards me lately has been foolish & vindictive for my bold & generous & kind efforts to keep her from taking a step disgraceful to a wife.  My feelings towards Susan are not kind & I do not know that they will ever be again.

	I have made my dear Liz for you several purchases & for which you will no doubt scold me again.  But wait till you see the presents.  A handsome flowing blue set in china for dinner & tea, late & fashionable pattern just imported.  I went up to look at the Box after being packed, & to my astonishment saw a big hogshead, which it took to contain them as large as three or four flour barrels.  They cost $32.00.  I also bought the most magnificent set of waiters you ever saw for $2.00.  They are beautiful pictures, landscapes, birds, flowers &c.  Two beautiful spittoons & a butter box of beautiful ware, to keep butter in.

	When you have got through with the scold for thepurchase & begin to breathe freely again I must tell you of another purchase.  The most beautiful, ornamental & useful collection of toys &c. for you & the children amounting to $12.00.  Three knives, one of them a curiosity for its tinny size, inkstand ivory, letter press, glass ship, goose &c., a waxen cupid in a glass case semetrically made, Christmas cards &c., ivory match box, parlor ball, silk real, 2 medallions, pearl waxen, 4 cakes of wax, 4 exquisite needle cases. toy carriage, mory chair with a glass in the back, 3 pictures framed, one looking glass &c. &c.  What say you to all this.  I am afraid you will think I am crazy, & the next news you hear of me will be that I am in the Lunatic asylum.  But I like to grattify the children & hear their wonder on my return home.  I am sure too you will be pleased at my curiosity shop.  Moreover the Legislature have passed a resolution to pay me about thirty dollars for voting General [Lewis] Cass.  I must get a big fee from Dr. Anderson, Col. Dunham, Eaton &c.

	Yesterday there was a great todo, in the Legislature, in receiving a visit from Mr. Calhoun.  I did not get to speak to him & did not care to.  My feelings are soured towards him.  The other morning he met Col. Orr & introduced him to Mr. Campbell.  Campbellenquired who Orr was.  When I told him he said I was joking & seemed I hadat his vulgar blackguard looks.  He had evidently been in a debacle the night before & that he will go the same way that Sims has is evident.

	It is a mistake to suppose that General Thompson has been offered a seat in the Cabinet.  I had a very long talk with him the other night.  I must now conclude my dear wife & write a few lines to Willie.  Isaac Hayne returned from Charleston yesterday all Well.  Mr. Martin has something to send up by me.  Col. [Adley Hogan] Gladden is elected Bursar.  Col. [John L.] Manning will probably be elected Governor.  Col. [Francis W.] Pickens is here but stands no chance.  Miss Martha Calhoun came down in the last stage & was turned over between Newberry & Columbia in the night, but not hurt.  I saw Edward Earle this morning looking unusually smart & genteel.  I told him of the arrival & he seemed not to have heard of it, but it was all pretense.  Tom Pickens came down with her & told me of the accident.

       General Tompson seemed pleased that you thought Mrs. Tom Jones pretty.  I am glad you have displayed so much freedom in your arrangement with Mrs. Harrison.  When we meet we shall have a great deal to talk over & arrange & I wish it was Sunday night, but here I shall have to stay.  Dear little Fanny how I should like to see her smacking her lips with a bone in her hand.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry
