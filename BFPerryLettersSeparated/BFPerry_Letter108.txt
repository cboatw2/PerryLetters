Letter 108
2 July 1848
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I shall have to remain here till Tuesday.  We commenced the case of Anderson & Neely yesterday morning & did not get half through.  It will be a very long case & I may not reach home before Wednesday.

	I am however killing two birds with one stone.  Tomorrow is sale day & there will be a great crowd here.  I shall of course charge a fee proposition to the time occupied in the case.

	General Thompson told me yesterday that he never thought before I would be electedthat he believed now that I would beat Col. Orr five hundred votes in Laurens district.  I replied that had been my calculation all the time.  He made great efforts to get me to hoist the Taylor flagsent Mr. Garlington & Capt. Cunningham to me very much alarmed but I soon satisfied them to the propriety of my concerns & they admitted that their alarms were entirely groundless.

	There is a large Presbyterian meeting here today.  Mr. Buist is down here.  I was invited to tea at Wrights yesterday morning but could not go and to Mr. Garlingtons the evening before but declined.  I was also invited to a ball the evening I arrived here, but I was so much fatigued I could not muster enough of courage to shave & put on a clean shirt.

	I am very sorry I cannot go home today.  Sullivan and myself are both engaged on the same side of Andersons case & quite friendly.

	I write you in great haste & merely to account for not returning this evening.  Governor Johnson had 22 little negroes burnt to death in one house the other night.  Be careful of fire.  God bless you.  Kiss the children for me.  Your husband, B.F. Perry
