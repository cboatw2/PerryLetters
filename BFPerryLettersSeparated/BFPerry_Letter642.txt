Letter 642
3 December 1862, Wednesday
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have stolen off from the State House whilst my friend Yeadon is speaking to write you a letter.  It is now half after three & we dine at four if the House adjourns.

	I received no letter from you or Fannie last evening which was a great disappointment as I saw no one from Greenville.  But I hope you are all well.

	Last night I was told that there was a Lady in the Parlor who wished to see me.  She said she had come to git me to take her son & his estate worth $50,000 & become his Guardian.  She told me by way of inducement that he was a very smart boy of fifteen.  I asked why she did not become his guardian herself.    She said it was as much as she could do to manage her own Estate & she wished me to take her sons.  I told her she could invest her sons estate which was all in money in Bank Stocks & it would not give her much trouble.  She replied she did not like the responsibility.  I thought if she did not like the responsibility for her own child, I did not know [how] she could expect me to like it.  With great kindness I declined the gift of her son & his fortune having four sons of my own to look after & knowing  you were unwilling to increase our family.  The Lady was Mrs. Col. James H. Irby of Laurens.  She wished also to consult about various matters concerning her husbands estate & came down for that purpose & returned this morning.  It has been about twenty five years since I last saw her.  She was then a young girl.  She is now an old woman! In appearance.  Her whole soul seems devoted to money.  She had a son wounded in Virginia five or six months since & has not heard of him since.  She supposes him dead!  But she spoke more calmly of his death than she did about her property!  How avarice dries up the affections of nature!

	I sent my speech twenty pages for publication in the Charleston Courier.

	We are doing very little in the Legislature.  I am chairman of the Judisiary commmittee, the position above all others which I desire & Col. Dawkins is on my committee.  It is a committee of Lawyers & we have a great deal of business to do.

	I recei[ve]d a letter from Col. Spartan D. Goodlett last night.  He says his regiment is near Weldon, N.C.& is doing well & all well clothed.

	The election of Governor comes off next week but it is very uncertain who will be elected.  I shall not desire the office.  If a Chancellor is elected I shall run for the office & with good prospects of success. There are two Judges to be elected but it is doubtful whether they will be elected this session.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to dinner.  I feel pretty well today.  It is raining.

	You will see a list of the boys selected for the military school in the Carolinian.

	Dr. Croft has published his speech in the Carolinian Guardian & Yeadon says it is an emasculated edition of mine.  Boyce says Croft listened to me & imbibed my ideas & reiterated them as his own.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter of Monday night & was glad to hear from you & about Hayne.  My views on the Convention & Council are the same as they always were, utterly opposed to them as you will see in my speech.  But I oppose the wild notions of some who desire the powers of the convention to alter the Constitution.  You know I never change & am always just & rightnever lead away by passion or party.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tell Col. Hoke to get from Martin Edwards his receipt for his war tax & send me or give it to you in order to get back Edwards tax improperly paid.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
