Letter 648
8 December 1862

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & you have forgotten myrequest.

	I bought a tierce of Rice635 pounds for $50.80 cts & a barrel of good brown sugar 250 pounds for $137.50 cts.  It will be sent up by rail road.  Rice & sugar were both on the.  I think this will do us for a long time.  You must take care of it & use it very sparingly.  We must use rye coffee.  It is impossible to purchase coffee in this or the Charleston market.  Everybody now is using barley & cotton seed for coffee.  Mr. Freeman bought up some cotton seed parched & ground.  Yeadon told me they used it several days at his mess & thought it genuine coffee.

	General Thompson came down this evening but went on to Florida.  I did not see him.  He sent me word that all of my boys were at his House.  I hope they are now at home.  If Hayne has no shoes do try [to] buy him a pair.  It will not do for him to go barefoot [in] this weather.  He will catch his death.  Ben can stay in rhe House.  But the two had better have shoes.  These are small expenses compared to the danger of their going barefoot.

	I will not purchase salt at the present prices.  We must do with what we have.  A sack is worth $200!  We can buy a half bushel in Greenville.  That will do us for a long time.  I have only a few hogs to kill & I shall purchase hams & bacon next summer.

	There was some discussion today in the House exempting persons who own tanning stores from going to the war, & I spoke warmly against it & defeated the proposition.  My friend Col. Dawkins advocated it.  The galleries were filled with ladies.  Mrs. LeConte sent me a from the gallery by Yeadon which I ate before speaking.

	Dr. Croft & Ware & McCullough returned this evening.  I told Croft that I had made his whiskey Bill a special order for tomorrow at one oclock & had invited the ladies to come & hear him speak!  I told him he must speak himself & I think he will endeavour to do his best.  Mrs. LeConte was very amused at my description of Croft the other night & disclosed that she would not miss hearing his speech on my account.

	Dr. Reynolds of the college came up to me today & said he hoped he would have the grattification of living under my administration of the State for the nextand that he would rather see me governor than any one else!  But this compliment will set you to writing again about honors &c.

	When my speech is published you must send it.  I have no fears of its being either to me or to one.  Yeadon was sorely mortified at my argument.  But he is still determined he says to make me either governor or chancellor.

	I am very tired of this place & want to be at home.  If I can leave here I will go home Saturday.  There is no place like home although my wife& worries so much.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
