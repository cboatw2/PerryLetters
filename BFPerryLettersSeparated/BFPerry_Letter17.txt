Letter 17
Friday morning, [29 November 1844]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	As I suppose you would like to hear from me although I have nothing to write I will not omit sending a letter by the mail which closes this evening.

	I have written to [O.H.] Wells pretty much all that we have done in the Senate which you will see in the Mountaineer.  But we do comparatively nothing in the Senate to what is done in the other House.  Yesterday we had a short discussion on Col. Pickens Resolutions.    He came to me & asked me if I concurred with him & on being told that I did, he requested me to reply to Col. [Franklin] Moses, which I did in a short speech.  After the Senate adjourned he requested me to ride with him in his carriage & seemed very cordial *& kind.  He & the Rhett party have split & have no kind feelings for each other.

	I rece[ive]d your letter by Wednesdays mail and was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I wish to be present & see you all arranged in the dining room whilst you were writing.  Your description called every thing to my mind very forcibly.    There is no place like home after all, especially when we have a wife & children at that homeeven if the wife does worry her husband occasionally & the children fret him & the servants provoke him.

	By the by how do you come on with the servants.  I hope they all behave themselves & give you no trouble.  The children you can manage.  How are the horses, cows & hogs?  I hope Jim will take care of every thing.

	I think Mr. Aiken will be elected Governor & I shall vote for him.  I gave the letters to Mr. Seabrook & Roper.  Mr. Roper gave me one for your mother.

	Mr. Sam Earle is not so good at electioneering as some of his competitors & if he does not win he will be hard pushed.  The election between Elford & Butler is very uncertain.  They are beginning to be a little excited with each other.  Ware & Duncan are very well pleased with their situation & I suppose Walker is too, for he keeps pretty generally two thirds drunk.  I was ashamed for him the other night on committee.  But all of the [page torn]  is between us.  You must not [page torn] about it.

	I never saw so many candidates before in my life.  There are at least fifty to carry the votes to Washington.  Barclays father came & spoke to me the other day & enquired after his son.   He looks something like his son & has the scotch accent.

	I have gained an important case old Mr. McElroys case in Equity.  You remember he once took you for my daughter.  I have succeeded entirely for the old man & am proud of it.    Charles Sullivan was on the other side.

	You see I have made up a letter in some sort of a way so God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F.P.
