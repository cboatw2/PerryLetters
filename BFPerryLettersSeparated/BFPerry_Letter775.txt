Mrs. Fannie Beattie
My dear daughter

	Your mother & I thank you most affectionately for your magnificent present on the forty fourth anniversary of our wedding day.  Its value is greatly enhanced by knowing that it is the work of your own hands, a display of your own taste & ingenuity.  It is a beautiful cushion & whilst reposing on it we will ever think of our loving & affectionate daughter, who is endowed with genius, beauty & all the Christian virtues in an eminent degree.  I hope most sincerely that you & your most estimable husband may live to receive a similar present from our dear little Emily, on the forty fourth anniversary of your wedding, and that she may possess all her mothers loving dispositions genius beauty & accomplishments & be then as happily married as she is with a noble promising little son & a sweet beautiful little daughter.  Your affectionate & loving Father, B.F. Perry
