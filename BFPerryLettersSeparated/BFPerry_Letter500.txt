Letter 500
10 October 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you Thursday evening & were pleased to hear of your good resolutions not to get demerits & to study hard.

	I see your roommate was turned back & that is a bad sign.  I wish you were with someone who is a hard student & steady.  Do my dear son take an interest in your studies & have pride and ambition enough to behave yourself well & recite your lessons well.

	I shall be glad to see your roommate return with you next June & spend some time with you.  I hope he is a clever fellow, has good principles & studious habits.

	I have been very busy this week & start to Anderson Court in the morning.  My Professional business is increasing & I want Willie at home now to help me write.  You write so good a hand I wish I had you in my office.  But your destiny must be the wide ocean.

	I have no doubt it is a pretty hard life at sea, but then when you get to Port you have great satisfaction in seeing the different cities of the world.

	Anna is better than she was a few days since.  Arthur has a cold & bad cough.  Hext has a swollen cheek & toothache.  Becky & Charles are still invalids.  Alfred too is unwell this morning.  Your grandmother & Susans families are all well.

	The election takes place tomorrow & there is considerable excitement.  The friends of Vernon have got their ticket printed with a tadpole on it.  Ashmore said the bone & sinew of the country would support him but the tadpole aristocracy might vote for Vernon.

	In haste your affectionate father.  Be a good boy & study hard.  B.F. Perry
