Letter 243
10 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I now have a room to myself.  It is a great comfort.  I was glad when Burt went off though sorry in some respects.  It is horrible to be tied to anyone or have to room with anyone but my wife.  I never will again under any circumstances permit myself to be so imposed on.  But when we arrived here it was the only chance.  They gave Thompson a room without a fire place & me & Burt a room together with a fire place.  The same evening Burt went off I came up to my room & saw a gentlemans cloak &c on Burts bed & every indication that I was to have another room companion.  This threw me into a violent passion & down I went charging on the Bar keeper.  He said your friend Col. Summer has returned & wishes to go into a room with you.  I replied that I was very glad to learn that my friend Col. Summer had returned & that I wished him treated with more respect than to be thrust into my roomthat the Colonel was a gentleman & entitled to a separate room.  This I communicated to the Colonel also & he was provided with e room.  I would not again room with anyone if I could do so without paying board.

	I am not all alone & have just come up from my supper which has induced this long preface to my letter.  I am feeling & enjoying the luxury of being alone & thought I could not do better than to write you although I have already written you one letter this morning.

	The Gardiner case was not taken up today.  I suppose it will begin in the morning and in the morning I shall have no time to write you.  I rece[ive]d a note from Mrs. Blake as I went to tea saying she would be happy to see me this evening or tomorrow morning.  But I shall not be able to see her.  I cannot venturer out at night with my cold and in the morning I shall not have time.

	We had an interview with the Cherokee Indians this evening & General Thompson read a note from the Secretary of the Interior saying he could not make the treaty at this time.  It is probable that some time next summer will be fixed on for making the treaty.  If so you and I can come on to Washington & stay till it is over & then go to the Worlds Fair & New Haven.  This would suit exactly.  I shall always be happy to have you for a roommate at Washington.  It will give me great pleasure too to have you always as my travelling companion & guardian spirit.

	If I have time I will go & see the spiritual rappers again before I leave Washington & propound the questions you desire.  Thompson goes twice a day & talks with his wife, daughter, mother, father, friends, negroes &c &c.  Mrs. Cornelia Thompson his present wife has written him [to] not go any more.  She does not like it.  I expect she is a little jealous.  She says it is all nonsense and that God will not permit a spirit to reveal that which he wishes to conceal.

	You think I would idolize my second wife.  I dont think I could love her more than I do you.  But I hope both you & I have too much good sense & love for our children ever to marry again if either of us were to die.  I think a man is a great fool to marry the second time & a woman a still greater.  Senator Crittenden & his first wife have both been married three times.  I feel a contempt for such folks, and as to the woman I look upon her as wanting in virtue.

	I saw yesterday at the breakfast table an old tottering, gray bearded paralytic man come walking in with a buxome young woman.  They had just got married in New York & were taking a jaunt to spend themoon.  I should suppose and so thought when I saw them that it would be moon without anyto the bride.

	The office hunters & seekers are still here & some of them have their wives with them.  The Hotel is still full.  But a more anxious set of fellows I never saw.  General Hamilton told me the other day that it was intimated in the Charleston Courier that I was here seeking the consulate at Liverpool & that General Thompson had come on to assist me.  I have written a very severe reply for the Charleston Courier & not one to be published in that paper.  I see from the last Charleston Courier several extracts from my letters & notices of me stating that I am employed in the Gardiner case &c.  The Washington papers & the New York papers all announce me as one of the counsel of Gardiner & that I am from South Carolina &c.  Thompson says that if I acquit myself well in this case Gardiner will employ me in the Equity cases which will pay enormous fees.

	I have rece[ive]d no letters from you today.  Tomorrow I shall get any letters you have written on Sunday.  Saturday no mail leaves Greenville which accounts for my not receiving any letters today.  You must continue to write to me till I tell you to stop.  Let me hear all about the children & tell me what they are doing & how they are.  If you want money you can borrow of Elford.

       I see now I shall not be at home before the last of return week & perhaps not till Anderson court.  As I have got into the case I must stick to it.  It will give me some fame anyhow & perhaps be the means of turning over a new leaf in my book of fortune.

       	I met Dr. Hayne in the streets today.  President Fillmore has gone to Charleston where he is to be the guest of Governor Aiken for some days.  He then goes to New Orleans & returns up the Mississippi river.

       I hope your mother Susan & children & Anne are all well.  Remember me to them.  Give my love to the children.  It is now about nine oclock & the mails here just arrived from New York.  I will go down & look at the papers & then go to bed & make up for my loss of sleep last night with Beattie & Grady till after midnight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
