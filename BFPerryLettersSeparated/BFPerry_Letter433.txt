Letter 433
24 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I wrote you the other day & gave you all the news I could.  Since writing you Mrs. LeConte has read me portions of her daughters letters in which she speaks most affectionately of you.  Miss Tulula writes a sweet letter.  Her description of the school, going to church, & the running off of the schoolgirl from Syracuse, was very amusing.  I was charmed with her letters, so sprightly, lively and affectionate.  I hope you will cultivate the intimacy which exists between you.

	I sit at the same table with Professor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte whilst taking my meals & we have a great deal  of talk about you & Tulula.  I enquire every mail of Mrs. LeConte if she has heard from her daughter.  I like Dr. LeConte & Mrs. LeConte very much.  Col. Memminger & Mr. Yeadon sit with us & we have a great deal of pleasant conversation.  I wish you & Tulula could be with us to enjoy it.

	At present we have no ladies here, but they are coming in next week, & we shall then have crowds of them.  Mrs. Allston & her daughter will be here in a few days, & Mrs. Chesnut will come tomorrow or the next day.  When the ladies come here I shall have something to write you.

	I saw Buist this evening who is in college.  He has grown fat & looks much better.  I suppose he fares better than he did at his uncles in Greenville.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie last night.  He says he has not heard from you for two or three weeks.  You ought to write to him & Frank occasionally & not so often to Ginny & Mary Mauldin & the girls at Greenville.  Willie says he went to Boston the other day & had his likeness taken for ten cents.  He says if Frank was there he could have his likeness taken so cheap that he might afford to furnish all the girls who have requested his likeness.  I wrote to Willie that Frank said so many girls had asked for his likeness that it would break him.

	Mr. Elford is now in my room & talking to me.  He came here from Charleston & had no room.  I have two beds in my room, & I have given one to him.  This makes it more pleasant for me.  Dr. LeConte has just sent me his Essay or Lecture on solar heat which I will read after I finish this letter.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Fannie this evening.  She said she had just written you a long letter.  I am afraid we all write you such long letters that you hardly have time to read them.  But I shall be so busy after this week, that I shall not have time to write you long letters.

	Give my love to Tulula & tell her I have been very much impressed in her favor from her letters, & that I will give her choice of Frank or Willie.  You must also present my respects to your Virginia & Florida friends whose moms I do not remember.  I wrote to Frank to be sure & send his likeness to your Florida friend.  Has he done so?

	I hope your cough is better.  Write me about it & what Dr. Gantt thinks of it.

	Your affectionate Father.  Give my respects to the Bishop and all your teachers.  B.F. Perry
