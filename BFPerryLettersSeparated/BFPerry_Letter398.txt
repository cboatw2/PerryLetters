Letter 398
13 June 1857
Greenville

Dear Sir

	Your letter was received last night dated June 4th, and I can assure you has given me great concern & anxiety.

	You say that my remarks, in a letter from Columbia about a Bride have been republished in the Georgia newspapers and applied to your wife.  They are without name, place or date of occurrence, and it was not supposed they could identify or illustrate any one.  Much less were they intended to implicate the virtue or honor of a Bride.  Such was not the belief of my informant.

Flirtations are very common in fashionable lifer, & some times very provoking to husbands, but they do not necessarily imply guilt of a damning nature to a Ladys, nor is such implication due the term flirtation.

	I can assure you both my informants & myself did feel a deep sympathy & interest in the history of a Bride, and if I had supposed that my remarks would ever have been seen by her or by any of her acquaintances and by them recognized they never would have been published.

	I am ready to make the explanation of facts, as you desire, but really, it seems to me, that this would only attract public attention & cause enquiries to be made as to the person alluded to, which otherwise would not be.  If I could recall the indiscretion of my remarks, which we really made in deep interest & concern for a Bride, most gladly would I do so.  If there was any way, by which I could make correction, without giving renewed injury, it would afford me pleasure to do so.
