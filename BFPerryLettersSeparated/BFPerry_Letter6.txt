My dear Liz

	I sent you this morning by Col. Barton & Mr. Spriggs one box, one trunk & one bundle.  They will be delivered to you Saturday some time in the day by Col. Barton.  Be kind & polite to him in the day for he is a good friend of mine & has very kindly offered to carry any thing I desired to send you.

	The trunk will contain a bundle from Mr. Hayne Wells silver cup which he carried down with one Sears Bible and Pictorial illustrations which he sends as a present to my dear wife which you will value both for the gift & giver.  The trunk also contains three vol[ume]s of Harpers family library also Rowlandsoil & two other boxes or vials.  The contents of the Box are unknown to me.  Mr. B. Carrol told me last night that Miss Seabrook had sent it by him & sent for it this morning to send by Col. Barton.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  I am beginning to be very restless & anxious to see you & the children again.  I trust however you are all doing well.

	I argued Mr. McBees case yesterday & was more than two hours reading my argument in the Court of Errors.  After I had concluded Mr. Burt got up to speak on the same side & Chancellor Job Johnston said he did not wish to hear any further argument on my side & went out of court.  Judge Richardson did the same.  This was quite a compliment to my speech.  Mr. Burt addressed the other judges for about an hour & made a capital argument.  You may tell Mr. McBee that I have very little doubt of our success.  Judges& Richardson are with us.  So is Chancellor Job Johns[t]on and Judge Butler (I think) has been brought over by Burts & my argument.  He gave me a favourable intimation this morning.  Judg[e]s Earle & Wardlaw would not try the case.  Judge Harper is absent.  [Benjamin Faneuil] Dunkin & David Johnson will decide the case.  Judge [John Belton] ONeall is against me.

	I have just left the Court House after examining the law students.  My student Reid was admitted & all the others except one.

	The election of Senator is exciting great interest.  I think Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger will be elected.  Barnwell Rhett and Col. [Francis Wilkinson] Pickens and Col. Davie are also candidates.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler is not, & is provoked at the notice of him in the Mercury.

	I have not yet bought the Bells nor the gold pencil case for you.  You must write me on that subject.

	I was told by Mr. Middleton last night that it was understood that Col. [Edward] Frost & myself were candidates for the next vacancy on the Bench.  I assured him it was a mistake so far as I was concerned. Tell Will his horse will reach home in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be at home sooner myself than that.  This matter of Spriggs & Col. Barton will give me some trouble in the Legislature.  Col. Barton has offered me a fee of $500 if I can get the lease of the State Road for him for five years & $1000 if I can get it for ten years.  I will try.

	In haste yours truly.  Kiss the dear little children for me & give my love to your mother & sisters, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
