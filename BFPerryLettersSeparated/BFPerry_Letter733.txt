My dear Son

	I have rece[ive]d two letters from youone by Runnion enclosing the stampsand I have used eighteen of them.

	Norton knows more about the case than I do, but tell him  I recei[ve]d a letter from Thompson requesting what I have done.

	I have been very busy since you left.  Have filed three answers in Equity, issued one Bail Writ against J.H. Arnold & got three appearances from J. Looper besides giving advice in several cases of some importance.

	I am sorry to hear you are likely to have a long session.   says he has twenty or thirty notes of oldfor me to issue on.

	Enclosed I send you a letter & certificate which you will which you will hand Mr. Read & git his written consent to settle the case of Chaplin & send me back immediately as Jake wishes to go to Memphis.

	Hayne & Ben are still sick in bed.  Hayne is getting well.  Ben is still lingering..  Fanny comes home tonight.  The rest of us are all well.  Nothing new.  Willie Beattey sent for your horse this evening.

	Give my respects to Easl[e]y & the Greenville delegation.

	Looper was here the other day & gave a very strong affidavit about Arthur being drunk & furnished the testimony of Allen & others to the same fact.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
