Letter 224
24 February 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	There was no Southern mail this morning & consequently I have heard nothing from you today.  I hope to hear tonight or in the morning.

	I have just dressed myself & am going to the Presidents to dine at six oclock.  It is now half after four oclock.  Tomorrow I will write you about the dinner.  I did not wish to go to the dinner party alone & Col. Orr was good enough to introduce me to General Polk, brother of President Polk, who is going from the National Hotel & is to go with me.  I am to call for him ten minutes before six.  He seems a pleasant gentleman.  Sunday we dine with Governor Corwin, Thompson, Burt & myself.

	I have nothing to write you.  President Pierce keeps very close and sees very little company.  I hope to see him today at President Fillmore.  The case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up next Monday week, the week of Spartanburgh Court.  I do not know yet what I will do in reference to it.  I shall remain here anyhow till the last of next week.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Your affectionate, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
