Letter 178
14 October 1851
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot which will please & amuse you.

	Dr. Anderson has directed me to call on Sullivan & get $300 balance of my fee & Sullivan told me this evening that he would pay it.

	I was employed in a new case today which may detain me here some time.  The principal business I had here has been postponed by the other side

	The election here has gone in favor of cooperation, & will throughout the district.    My impression is that it will throughout the state.

	Write to me about the elections by tomorrows mail.  I hope you & the children are all well & doing well.  Hext, I am sure is a good boy, & I wish to see him very muchthis you may tell him.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
