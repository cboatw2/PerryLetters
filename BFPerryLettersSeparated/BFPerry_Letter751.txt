Letter 751
21 December 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz
	Jack got off this morning so quick that I did not have time to write you.  Hayne rece[ive]d a note from Miss Lowndes inviting him & Ben to the Entertainment at the Female college Friday evening.  A letter came to Ben from young Trescott inviting him to spend the Christmas with him near Pendleton.
	I am willing for you to employ Jack as you mention.  But it is too much.  It is not true that anyone in the country will give $11 per month.  We can employ any number at $8 per month.  But if he takes clothes & pays for washing it will all be the same.
	No letters last night.  Fannie came down to see you yesterday morning & sent  at twelve.  Hayne went to Miss Elfords wedding last night.  Church crowded.  We are getting on very well.  But it is lonesome without you.  I send you the Greenville Enterprize with your notice of the Library Society.
	Nothing has happened worth mentioning.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
