Letter 211
13 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Last night I made a speech to the largest town meeting ever held in Columbia on popular Education & was most raptu[r]ously applauded.  I spoke for an hour.  Professor Reynolds followed me in a beautiful speech on the same subject.  I have been all day writing it out for publication.

	I have just stopped to write you a line.  Your letter Saturday evening was read & as usual gave ne great pleasure.  I am truly glad that Tuesday is so near at hand.  I want to see you & the children very much.

	Col. Dawkins came up from Charleston Friday.  He says five sixth of the people there are indignant at Taber.  His coming here in relation to resign & he has done so, He was burnt there in effigy there too.

	I send you a letter which I recd from Dr. Douglass, a Senator from Chester for many years.  It is only a specimen of what I hear hourly every day.  Your affectionate husband, B,F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
