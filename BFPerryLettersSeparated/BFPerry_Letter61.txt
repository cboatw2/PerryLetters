Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rec[eive]d your letter tonight & herewith enclose you $25.00 which I hope you will receive safely and that it may be as much as you will need.  I do not think you will save much by remaining in Charleston as there are so many pretty things to tempt you.  The next week is the gay & fashionable week in Columbia.  The commencement in the college is on Mondaythe Ball that evening.  The inauguration of the governor elect will take place Wednesday.  He will no doubt give a party.  I went round to Dr. Roachs this evening to see General Thompson.  He & Mrs. Thompson will stay therealso Mrs. Walker & Jane.  Mrs. Roach told me that she could furnish me with a fine room the first of next week.  You can stay there or at Clarks Hotel.  He has room plenty and I desire you to stay in Columbia a few days & see the Town.

       I went to the Fair tonight & saw an immense concourse of ladies & gentlemen.  Coil. Hampton & his family were there selling all sorts of pretty things & eatibles.  There were some twenty or thirty different establishments belonging to different persons.  I bought a pen of Miss Yates for 50cts.  At another table Mr. Griffin bought a couple & paid $1.00!

       Governor Aiken & Lady paid us a visit this morning in the Senate Chamber.  He introduced me to her & I took a seat by her & conversed with her for some time.  Their little daughter was with them.  How immensely rich she will be.   I saw Mrs. Yancey at the Fair.

       I hope you see the Charleston Courier which contains an account of our legislative proceedings.  I made a speech on the Electoral question Tuesday about an hour long.  Col. [George Washington] Dargan replies to me & I shall reply to him.

       You must write me as soon as you determine to come.  If you could come up on Sunday next you might be at the college commencement.  If on Tuesday you can be at the inauguration on Wednesday.  But you consult with your own convenience.  Take special care of the children on the rail road.  Perhaps one of your cousins may come up with you.Arthur or Col. Hayne.  It would be well to have some friend to come with you.  If you desire it, you may stay until after the adjournment of the Legislature & I will come down for you & then I am sure you & the children will be safe under my charge.  But be careful & do as you like best.  It gives me great pleasure to gratify your every wish when I can do so.  My happiness in life is to make others happy.  I live for them.  Good night, kiss the children.  If Will comes up I should like to keep him until I go home.  Remember me to your Aunts.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

General Thompson & Col. Herndon had a fight yesterday in Gladdens Hotel.  But through Chancellor Johnson & myself they have made friends.  Col. Herndon said at the supper table that the General was broke.  Erwin Jones went & told Thompson.  He met Herndon told he lied & struck him in the mouth & thereupon a scuffler ensued.  Duncan ran for me but it was overneither hurt. They shook hands today & made friends very cordial[l]y.
