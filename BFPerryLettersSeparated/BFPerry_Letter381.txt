Letter 381
9 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I enclose you a long letter to the Patriot in lieu of one to yourself.

	I have nothing of interest.  We had considerable debate today on the slave trade & I took a part in it.

	You will see that Al]l]ston is elected Governor.  I went up to Mrs. Al[l]ston at the supper table & congratulated her on the election.  She seems very meek & modest about it.  Mr. Petigru was sitting by her side & he is much pleased.

	Dr. T. Croft is here & wishes an aidfor Edward Croft Theodores son.

	You must not trouble yourself about Willies room [word obscured] will do very well.  I will see about a set of drawers for him.

	I am glad you are having the hogs killed.  It is now turning warm again.

	I had a very pleasant evening with Burt yesterday.  He enquired very kindly about you & the children & says he is coming to Greenville next summer.

	Col. Dudl[e]y told me a great deal about Miss Sparks.  His daughter is just married & will be here this week.

	If you desire to you can come down with me next Monday as I expect to go home Saturday if the weather is good.  It would give me great pleasure to have you here but the company of ladies is very much broke off.  There are however some still here & others coming.  Mrs. Sullivan came yesterdayMrs. Allston the day before.  Col. Carn says Mrs. Allston elected the Col. on the first ballot.  If she had not been here there would have been another ballot, that she got him more than seven votes.

	I am glad to hear Arthur has another tooth.  How I should like to see the little fellows tooth & kiss him.

	I must now quit & go to bed as I slept very little last night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
