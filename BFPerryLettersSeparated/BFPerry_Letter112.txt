Letter 112
Tuesday night, [10 October 1848]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter by General Thompson, & it contains better news than he brings.

	In this district the votes are not counted.  I have beaten Col. Orr about two hundred votes in this district.

	There never was greater effort made by a man & his friends than Col. Orr & his have made at this Box.  He opened the grocery & had the Liquor free.

	My estimated majority is two hundred but this is uncertain.  It may be more or less.  The Whigs have all turned against me except a few gentlemen.  This reduced my votes from a majority of 500 to 200.

	I regard the Election as very uncertain.  From old Pendleton I heard Monday at 12 oclock we were even.  At Dr. Andersons he beat me {by] a few votes.  At the Trapp Thompson says I only beat [by] 10 votes.  Several other Boxes he mentions unfavorably in Anderson.  But this is all uncertain.  You perhaps know by this time.

	I did not receive your statement.

	I write you in great haste.  I do not expect to be at home till Saturday or Sunday.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I have written Col. Townes by this mail.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
