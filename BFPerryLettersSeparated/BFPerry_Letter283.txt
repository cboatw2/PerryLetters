Letter 283
2 May 1854
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & written on it & sent it to your mother.

	I have but a minute to write you.  I am very busy in Court & the mail is about to close.

	Old Mr. McBee & Foster Goodell came down this evening.  Goodlett saw Willie at Williamston.

	I was truly glad to hear you were all well.  When I get time I will write you a long letter,

	Tell Willie & Frank to write me.  Tell Hext I think of him often & I want to see you all very much.

	 Several of your acquaintances have enquired after you.  In haste, your affectionate father, B,\.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
