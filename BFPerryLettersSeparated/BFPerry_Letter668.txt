Letter 668
[September 1863]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ieve] your letter last night on my return from the Board of Trustees.

	You had better let the order of Mr. Waddle remain till I return.  Tell John to obey you in all things during my absencehaul woods as you directfeed the cow well & take care of the horses.

	Alston Hayne gave me the certificate of the Planters & Mechanics Bank & says the other isin the Bank of SC.  It stands in the name of Hext McColl.  I will enclose you an order for you & Susan & Anne all to sign.  Send it to me & I will send it to your uncle or you enclose it to your uncle & write him a letter.

	I have paid Hext $2.00.  He is enjoying himself but has seen nothing of Col. OHanlon.

	Jim Moore will be elected Commissioner tomorrow through thr influence of his wife.

	I have not yet seen Miss , but sent Fannies letter by Nat Butler.  Nat told Hext that he came down to see his sweetheart.  Hext says Fannie .

	The Battle of Chickamauga has been disastrious & every thing looks very gloomy.

	I have seen no one except those I wrote you in my last & have nothing to write.  The Senate have agreed to adjourn on the 5th of December.  I will probably be at home anyhow about that time.

	A circular from Ashmore came down last night against Thomas which helped to kill him.  He & McKay will go home in the morning.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
