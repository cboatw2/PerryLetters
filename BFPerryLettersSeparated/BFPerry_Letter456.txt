Letter 456
20 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Sir

	Enclosed I send you a hundred dollar Bill to pay the expenses of my daughter and any little matters she may owe in Philadelphia.

	This is Sunday & I cannot purchase a check on New York.  I leave in the morning for Greenville before the Banks are opened.  I hope you will be able to get the Bill off.

	I wrote you some time ago in reference to bringing my daughter to Columbia.  I am laboring under a severe cold & do not expect to be able to go for Anna as you have kindly offered to rake charge of her.

	I am with great respect & esteem truly & sincerely yours &c., B.F. Perry
