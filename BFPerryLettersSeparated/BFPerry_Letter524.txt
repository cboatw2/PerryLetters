Letter 524
9 April 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your very ac[c]eptable letter last night, and it was truly gratifying [to] your mother & myself to learn that you were coming on so well in your studies.  I always knew that if you would only study you could stand high in your class.  I hope you have now broken the ice, & will turn over a new leaf & be ambitious of distinction.

	In the course of two months your June examination will come on, & I shall then expect to see you stand well in your class.  This will make your visit to us more gratifying both to you & your parents.

	I go to Laurens Court in the morning & have just returned from Spartanburg court.  This will end my circuit.  I expect to carry Hext & Hayne with me.

	   Fannie has been sick, but is well again.  Arthur is quite well.  Your mother has been a little unwell but is better.  Your grandmother is poorly.  Vardry is very deaf, & your aunt Susan has great fears about him.

	This is a delightful day but we have had cold weather lately & the fruit is somewhat injured by the frosts.

       Dr. Randal Croft, Mr. Pearson & Miss Flora Jones are all sick.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
