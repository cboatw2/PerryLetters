Letter 79
21 June 1847
Anderson

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as you requested me to do though I have nothing to write you about.  It would be much more satisfactory to [me] if I could hear from you.  I hope however that nothing will happen till I reach home.  You must postpone as you promised and I will endeavour to be at home on Saturday.

	I shall leave here tomorrow evening & go as far as old Pendleton.  The next day I will stop & see Mr. [John C.] Calhoun & spend an hour or two with him.  I will also call to see Mrs. Sharp if I possibly can do so.

	It is pretty generally rumored here that I am to be a candidate for Congress & I believe is generally approved of.  Mr. Keith told me that it was the general wish of the people of Pickens district.  Mr. Sloan says he will not be a candidate as I have been informed.  Mr. Webb tells me that Col. [James L.] Orr had an idea of offering but that he would not oppose me.  The impression is that I will have no opposition if I become a candidate.

	Mr. Perrin is the only lawyer here from the other districts except myself.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not well.  Mr. & Mrs. Roper arrived here this evening from Greenville.  I saw Mr. Isaac Henry who told me something strange had happened in Greenville since I left home.  I did not see Col. [Benajah] Dunham as he hoped though whilst I was in Court I heard Mr. Roper saying this evening at the supper table that he was delighted with Greenville, that place was beautiful & the people very dear &c.  It seems he had been staying at this House sometime before he went to Greenville.  His wife is quite a contrast in size to himself.

	This has been a delightful day.  I hope Charles will go on with his plowing.  Sunday was a drizzling day & my mare behaved badly.  Broke the trace as I expected when I started, fretted a great [deal] with the fl.   I mended the trace & came on very well.

	You must write me a line by Col. Townes or General Thompson who will both come over to Pickens on Wednesday.  Write what letters have come for me.    How you & the children are doing [well] & the servants.

	I must now conclude this letter & bid you good night.  Kiss the children for me & tell them to behave well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
