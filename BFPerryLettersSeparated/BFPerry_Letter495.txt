Letter 495
3 August 1858
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Susan who said last evening that she would go this morning in the carriage with Peter.

	We are all pretty well.  I have been very much affected with headache & cold.  Willie has a terrible rising on his face, which he broke & has disappeared.  Hayne has bites & sores on his feet which prevent his going to school.  Hext is quite well & Arthur is very well except he frets at night.

	The Servants are all well & doing well.  I have had no trouble with them.  Clara seems a good housekeeper, & performs her part well.  John attends to the horses finely & at dinner waits on the table.

	Your mother has bought a fine large horse of Prince, which I she will feed well & take good care of will be as good a horse as Fernprice $172.00.  The Pony is getting mischievous.  He ran off from Willie yesterday evening & kicked him with both feet but did not hurt him.

       Judge Magrath, Col. Orr, Col. Keitt, Mr. Conner, Dr. Hamilton are here now, & Judge Wardlaw, Mr. Porter, Mr. Mitchell & other lawyers will be here this evening.  The Federal Court opened & adjourned yesterday.

       I want to see you at home again.  Home is rather a lonesome place without a wife & I dont wonder at all of the gentlemen getting married again who loose their wives.

       I hope Anna has improved & enjoys the climate & fare at Thomas.  I am sure Fanny & Annie & Vardry have enjoyed the visit.  I hope you have.

       There are no peaches, & the watermellons are so trifling that I do not think they are worth sending to you.  Clara is making some things to send to you in the way of

       A Box came from Eliza Hayne & a letter to you.  Last week Mrs. Stokes brought some peaches but they were not very fine.

       I shall be very busy tomorrow & the remainder of the week.  I have finished paying for Alfred & have taken Gowens note & Hil[l]houses.  This is about all I have done in the way of business.

       The weather has been warm, but this morning it is cool & pleasant & I have been sneezing againI do not like.

       The children have done well.  Mrs. Hoke offered to do anything she could for them.  Willie has been invited to Mrs. Mauldins & Hokes to tea, but his swollen face prevented his going.

       I shall be glad to take a little holiday next week & make my escape from the court, leaving you in charge of the House & children.  Give my love to , Fanny & Annie & believe me your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
