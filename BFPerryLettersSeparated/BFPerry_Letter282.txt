Letter 282
1 May 1854
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I have time only to write you that we are all arrived here safely, & your mother will start in a few moments to Charleston.  We took a ride over the Town of Columbia yesterday & your mother & Fanny & Hayne went to see Mrs. Taylor.

	Mr. Allston will meet your mother at the rail road depot this evening & carry her & the children to Mrs. Easton.

	I hope you are all well & doing well tonight.  I shall expect to hear from you tonight & will write Willie tomorrow.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
