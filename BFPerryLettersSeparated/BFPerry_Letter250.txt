Letter 250
20 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday morning and I shall have time to write a long letter in the course of the day.  I am now waiting for breakfast.  I hope when the mail comes to the Bar at nine or ten oclock I shall receive a letter from you.  I had no letters from you yesterday nor did General Thompson receive any.  It is some consolation when one does not receive a letter from Greenville that the other has.  But I receive two or three to his one generally.

	I intended to write you last night but I dined at Mr. Bradleys & did not return till late & then found the Cherokee agent Judge Hicks waiting to see me.  I am in hopes we shall be able to accomplish the Treaty before we leave Washington.  Judge Hicks had seen the Secretary of the Interior & he expressed a willingness to take it up as soon as he could Col. Thomas an agent of the North Carolina Cherokees came to see me yesterday & expressed the same hope.  This will be a comfortable thing if we can accomplish it.

       The Gardiner trial goes on slowly & the testimony very much against him.  I hope to get through in the course of this coming week.  At least I think we can get through the testimony & I can make my speech.  But everything is uncertain.  Gardiner is the greatest mystery I ever heard of.  He seems unmoved & perfectly innocent & indifferent.  He is a very handsome fellow & has a fine open countenance, a sparkling black eye, black whiskers & beard under the chindresses very neatly & is amiable & accomplished & talented0has been a universal favorite wherever he has been.  Still I am afraid he perpetrated the fraud.  I am likewise afraid he may be convicted.  This I would not say to anyone but yourself.  You & I are the same person you have often told me & therefore in writing to you I am only thinking to myself.

       We had a fine dinner yesterday at Bradl[e]ys & this evening he is to take us out to his farm eight miles from the city.  It is an old family mansion to which he moves in the Summer.  Brad[le]y has three daughters & one sonone daughter married & two single all being in the house with him and all grown.  His single daughters are pretty & one of them quite intelligent.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y looks ten years too old for her husband.  He got married at nineteen! And looks quite young now.  General Thompson made some remark to Mrs. Bradl[e]y about her husband which I dont remember.  But she replied to him by anto his having been twice married that gentlemen who had so many wives never grew old.

       	Late last night Mr. Carlisle came to our room.  He is a most excellent gentleman & was to have dined with us at Mr. Bradleys but his wife had some company when he went home.  I told you in a previous letter that she was the niece of the Spanish ambassador & one of her sisters to one of the Legation with a Spanish name which I cannot pronounce.  They live in great style.  Thompson says Carlisles mother was a greater woman & that he made his fortune by his& he is still a young man.  I thought his mother a very fine interesting old lady, & carried her to the table & had a great deal of talk with her.  If she ever was, as Thompson says, it is a magnificent change for the old lady in her old age.

       I will now give you some account of Gadsbys Hotel, the table, company &c.  You no doubt would like to see just how I am situated.  The Hotel is a pretty large one but not like the National.  In the dining room there are three large round tables at each one of which some twenty or thirty persons may be seated, all facing as it were each other.  There is nothing on the table but butter & bread.  You take your seat & a servant enquires what you will have for breakfast.  He then goes & cooks or brings you whatevet you directcoffee, buckwheat cakes, beef stake, mutton chops, omelette, eggs, fish, tea &c.  Sometimes you have to wait twenty or thirty minutes.  During this time you talk or read the newspapers.  They dine at ? after 2 oclock & at 4 oclock.  You eat at either table as you please. The servant brings you what you will have.  A bill of fare is by your plate.  Supper is any time between six and ten at night.

       I must now go to breakfast & will write you another letter if I have time.

       God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Your letter of Monday is rece[ive]d.  I thank you for it.   Will write you again this eveningno letters to General Thompson this morning.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
