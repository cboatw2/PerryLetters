Letter 12
Monday, 3 oclock, [27 May 1844]
Court House, [Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I only have time to write you a word or two.  I have been so much engaged that I could not write you last mail & it is the same thing now.

	You last letter gave me great pleasure, but your last one was sad enough in every way.  Poor Judge Earle.  We had a meeting of the Bar this morning at the request of the Judges.  Col. Preston was called to the chair & I offered some Resolutions which you will see in the papers.  I made a biographical speech to the Court of Appeals on Judge Earle.  Judge Johnson replied.  The speeches will all be published.

	I thought you crazy about Texas from your letter.  [remainder of paragraph interlined, illegible].

	It is possible I may start home in the morning.  If so I will be with you my dear wife  & my dear little children on Thursday night.  God knows it will be a source of great happiness & pleasure.

	I have much to write you but no time to do it in as the mail is closing.

	Kiss the children for me & tell them I have a great many presents for them.  Yours truly & lovingly, B.F, Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
