Letter 510
2 January 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received no letters from you last week.  But saw your arrival announced in the Washington Review.  We also see by the same Paper thatcompliments were paid the naval Students for their good behavior whilst in Washington whilst other students were playing the.  This is very gratifying to your mother & me.

	I hope you got the $20 I sent you before you started to Washington.

	I am sorry Col. Orr was not in Washington whilst you were there.  I see from the newspapers that he was in New York at that time.  I hope you called to see the members of Congress from South Carolina.

	We look for a letter from you now with great interest to hear of your trip to Washington.

	Willie will start home 19th Wednesday & will call to see you about Friday 21st Inst.

	Anna is about the same.  All the rest are well.  We have had a dull Christmasbad weather.

	I have no news.  Mrs. Bolling died last week.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
