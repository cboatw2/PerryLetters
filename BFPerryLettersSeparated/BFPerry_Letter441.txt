Letter 441
30 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter enclosing two of Franks.  This has been a day of great excitement here in the election of United States Senator.  Governor Hammond was elected by twenty five votes over Col. Pickens.  There was Great exullation on the part of his friends.  I do not feel mortified very much.  I feel sure that he will be a supporter of the administration & will do very well in the Senate.

	Governor Manning & myself went to call on Pickens & were the first to tell him the news.  He bore his defeat very well & said to me he never would forget my friendship & support.  I think Manning might have been elected.  But it is all over now & you know I always make the best of misfortunes.  I do all I can to prevent them & then submit quietly.

	My idea is to elevate & not lower the standard of education in the South Carolina College.  This I will do by mak[ing] it a university.  They who wish can take a full course.  After graduating at Charleston, Spartanburg, Greenville & Abbeville the students can then go & finish at Columbia.

	In regard to my opinion	about Perry it is correct & the court who tried him were wrong.  But it is my will to make him quit the state.

	I am truly sorry to hear of Spartan Goodletts illness.  Wells tells me he cannot live.  Poor fellowcut off in the prime of life, after all his trials & struggles against poverty & obscurity.

	Col. Memminger has just been in my room to talk about Hammonds election.  He regrets it very much.  I told him it was owing to the fanaticism of slavery.  Hammond had written ably on that subject, & every fool in the state thought his negro peoplein danger & Hammond the Man to defend it.

	I saw old Mr. McBee this evening as I & Governor Manning were going to see Col. Pickens.  The old man says nothing new has occur[r]ed in Greenville.  I saw Wells just now & he promised to take Susans bundle.

	George Wells & Ds son are both admitted into the military school here.  I see that E.D. Earle & B.T. Earle are admitted as well as pay scholars from Greenville.  Who are they.  Perhaps Elias D. Earles sons.  Westmorelands son is also admitted as a pay scholar.

	I have just come up from the supper table where I met Mrs. Herndon the old colonel.  Mrs. Herndon says she is going to send her daughter to Bishop Davis school next summer.  She & the colonel enquired about you & all the children.

	Col. Carn told me & Mrs. LeConte the other evening, that his wife had fallen in love with Anna. Two years agothat she was a devoted reader of my paper & so much an admirer of me that it had excited a little his jealousy. Col. Carn is from Walterborough you remember.

	The ladies are beginning to come in.  Mrs. Garlington is hereMrs. Chesnut &c.  But Mrs. Chesnut does not come to the table.  I have seen nothing of her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
