Letter 254
23 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I went to the Post office again yesterday evening & rece[ive]d a letter from you & one from Col. Ware.  I am glad you were in amood & wrote me aletter.  I thank you for it.  General Thompson was  not with me but rece[ive]d no letters from his wife.  I read him what you said about your mothers visit to Mrs. Thompson & the fine appearance of his boy.

	I am glad my dear wife that you value my letters so much & read them so often.  I was afraid that I wrote you so much & that I should tire your patience.

	I am glad so much respect was paid my old friend Col. Dunham at his funeral.  He was a public spirited & enterprising man.  I should have been most happy to have seen him once more before his departure

	I have nothing to write you.  The Gardiner case occupies my whole time & I see and hear nothing out of court of any interest.

	My Mobile correspondent & friend on the Kennedy case, Mr. Campbell has been appointed to the Supreme bench of the United States for the Alabama & Louisiana district.  I am glad of it for he is a gentleman & an able lawyer.

	Col. Ware wrote me a letter from Laurens court & was very anxious to see me.  He had not rece[ive]d my letter.  I wrote him a letter immediately & am surprised he did not receive it.  I shall write him again this morning & will certainly be at home by Greenville court if I have to give up Gardiner & his case.

	From present appearance I am afraid I shall not be at home much before Greenville court.  My patience is worn out by the dilitory proceedings in court.  I am heartily disgusted with the case & would leave it now, but for General Thompson.  He says it would prejudice the case, and he would die here if I left him.

	Yesterday evening I went from the Post office to see theof Mr. Henry an account of them for the Patriot.  I rece[ive]d the Patriot yesterday & read all of my letters with great interest.  I think they must be interesting to the people of Greenville & to the whole state.  They are copied into all the papers everywhere.

	After returning late last night from Mr. Bradl[e]ys office I took two pills with a mixture of calomel & I feel better this morning.  My cold has been a most dreadful one indeed.  I was under the necessity of using two or three handkerchiefs every day.

	I must now conclude as I have to write to Col. Ware & the Patriot.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
