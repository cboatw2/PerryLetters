Letter 761
30 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Son
	I wish you would write me occasionally & let me know how you are doing.  I wrote you the other day & Ben wrote Sunday.  I hope you have rece[ive]d the Enterprise sent you & it will be sent regularly hereafter.
	I am concerned about your room & board.  Do not let them put you in a damp or disagreeable room.  Change your boarding House first.  Ask George Croft to look you out comfortable lodgings.  When you want money write to me & I will send it to youno matter what it costs!  You must be comfortable.  It might be well to engage board for the winter & you may get it cheaper.
	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother in Charleston, but she said she had written you.  I am in hopes that you will greatly improve at Aiken.  But you must write me a line or two, a half page every two or three days & tell me exactly how you are doing & feel.
	Willie is at Abbeville court.  Hext wrote me the other day.  Fanny has been cleaning up the village House after Miss Trescott left.  Perry is quite well.
	Simmons shucked his corn last night & Johnson shucks tonight.  Jack Jenkins day before yesterday.  Calvin has hauled his up.  Ben & Jack are now hauling corn from Jack Jenkins.  Tomorrow they will haul from Simmons & next day from Johnson.  The corn is turning out well.  The potatoes are half dug & put awayturned out well.
	The cows are now running in the fields & Zion minds them.  One of the sheep died, & we killed the weather [wether] for mutton.  I have had Jack & mule cleaning out ditches.  A pointer puppy came from Carson in Virginia to Willie yesterday by Express.  The charge was $3.90 cts.  It is a tan collor rather poor & almost perished, when it got here.  But Willie has no use for it.
	The elections are over & I suppose your mother worried you no little in talking about them.  I am better satisfied than if I had been elected.  Willie was cheated out of his election.  But it matters not.  He can live without the office & do well.  He is well off.
	Your friends here all enquire about you, everybody enquires.  Your affect[ionate] Father, B.F. Perry
