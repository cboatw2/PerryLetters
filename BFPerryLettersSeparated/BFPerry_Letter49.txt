Letter 49
Pmk. 31 July [1846]
Saratoga Springs

My dear Liz

	I arrived here last night.  Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter which you will read & send over to Col. Townes.  It will give you some idea of where I have been & I have not time to rewrite it for you.  I shall leave here this evening for Troy, AlbanySpringfield, New Haven, Boston &c.  I shall not get your letters until my return to New York.  It seems to me that I have been almost to the end of the World & am happy that my face is now homeward.  You may well imagine my impatience to return to my wife & children.  I am heartily tired of travelling & will never care to go from home again.

	In Montreal I purchased three beautiful dresses for youone of silkone of a new sort of goods not yet reached the U. States & the other of a most lovely patternsilk & wollen.  I have purchased Anna two beautiful dresses & perhaps enough for three or four.  I have purchased Will & Frank a suit each.  I have also purchased for you a great many Indian curiosities which are beautiful toys, pin cushions &c.  And also a rarity from the Grey Nuns.  I have bought for myself some fine clothesall very cheap.    Your dresses are new & lovely.

	How glad I would be to hear from you, but I flatter myself that you are perfectly well & the children are all well.  It is (sic) has been more than a month since your confinement & I hope the bloom is restored to your cheeks.  This is the very first opportunity I have had to write you since my letter from Albany.

	Last night I met here some very pleasant ladies from South Carolina who seemed glad to see me because I was from their own statea Miss Nelson from Statesburgh who knows the Bradys & says one of them is to be married to Richard Harrison in a very short time.  She is a young girl about 18, and I have walked with her all over the grounds to the springs &c.  Miss Yates is here & has taken possession of Col. Fair.  There is a Miss Taylor here from South Carolina, granddaughter of Governor Taylor & a pleasant girl.  Mr. Seabrook & his bride Miss B are here who seem pleasant & glad to see us.  There are at this House about 500 personssome thousands at the other Houses.  The world seems very congregated here.

	In some of my former letters I spoke of the heat breaking out over my body.  The skin is now all peeling off and my hands look bad but are now pretty well peeled over.  I shall have a new & fresh skin on my return.  Yesterday I was bilious.  There was one effort of nature to relieve  I feel much better today.

	I shall part company with Col. Fair & Nance at Troy & I regret it, but they will not wait on me.  I must see Governor Wright & Mr. Van Buren before I return.  When I shall reach home I do not really know.  I wish to spend a day or two in Boston and a day at New Haven.  I may stoop a day in Washington & a day at the Virginia Springs.

	God bless you my dear wife & children.  Kiss the children for me and give my love to your mother & family and remember me to all my friends in Greenville.  I shall have a great deal to tell you on my returnenough to keep us talking for a long time.  Your husband, B.F. Perry.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
