Greenville

       My dear Son

       	We rece[ive]d your letter last evening & were glad to hear you were getting on so well.  Your letter was well written & does you credit.

       	Mr. Miller wrote your mother the other day that you were doing very well.  I hope you will now begin to improve.

       We are all pretty well.

       L came very near burning up the House last night.  She went into the Clossett to get her bed clothes & set the bed curtains in a basket on fire.  It blazed up like& with great difficulty the flames were extinguished.

       We heard from Willie yesterday.  He is doing well.  Anna rode on horseback with me last week.

       We will try & go on to see you after you return from the cruize this summer.

       Your uncle Col. Arthur P. Hayne has been appointed United States Senator in the place of Judge Evans who died the other day in Washington.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
