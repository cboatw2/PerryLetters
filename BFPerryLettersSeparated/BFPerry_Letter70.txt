My dear Liz

	I am not well this evening.  Last night I had an attack diarrhea prostrated me for a time.  Today I have been all day labouring in a capital case for which I shall receive no fee.  The poor fellow is unable to pay a lawyer for defending him.  He was convicted last court of the murder of Vance & got a new trial.  In the absence of Col. Leitner I have been assigned counsel for him by the court.

	I hope I shall feel better in the morning.  If I do not, I shall not be able to continue in the management of the case which will take all day again.

	I have seen Dr. Teague but have not had a settlement with him yet.  I mustin the morning.  I expect he will not feel very willing to pay me as much as I think I ought to have.

	Elford Thompson, Speers & Wells came down this morning in the stage, but brought me no news from Greenville except that my dog & Moonys son were all the talk theregreat threats are made against.  I hope Jim will not let him be killed before I return.

       I have not seen any of Captain Cunninghams family or heard from them.

       I came down all alone on Sundaystopped on the roadside & ate my dinner by myself.

       I hope to hear from you Thursday morning.  I shall return home Friday if [I] get no worse.  I find the Judge complaining in the same way with myself.

       This morning (Wednesday) I feel much better than I did last night when I wrote the above lines.  Sleep has in great measure restored me.

       Kiss the children for me.  I am anxious to see you all again.  In haste, your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
