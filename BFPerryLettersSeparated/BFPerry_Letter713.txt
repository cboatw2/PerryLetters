Letter 713
2 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you brace yourself up to hear my defeat in the best way you can.  This is very well on your part & you say further that you will not love me the less if defeated.  I hope now, my dear wife, you will love me the more, for my success, & feel proud that your husband is both Governor & United States Senator at the same time.  I do not know or feel at all changed by my new honors.  My feelings, hopes, manners & expectations are the same, & if I had been defeated it would not have cost me a moments uneasiness except on your account.  But I am elected & you ought to be happy & make everybody about you happy because you felt so much interest in the matter.

	I am glad to have Governor Manning as my Colleague.  He is a cordial warm hearted gentleman of good judgement & good principles.  He was once a Union man & his Father was a Union leader in 1832 & my friend.  Campbells friends offered to vote for me if I would vote for Campbell.  Then they voted for Manning & ran him in opposition to me in order to damage him with my friends & keep them from voting for him in opposition to Campbell for the short Senatorial term.  And they succeeded  in making the entire Greenville delegation & Spartanburgh vote against Manning the first time.  I knew the trick for Manning had informed me of it.  Col. Aldrich voted against me & Siegling, Miss Maggies cousin.  There was a great deal of manuvering & trickery, & would have been more if they had not known my strength in the Legislature.  Manning, Campbell, Trescott, Bonham & Dawkins all voted for me & they were all candidates & members of the Legislature.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry
