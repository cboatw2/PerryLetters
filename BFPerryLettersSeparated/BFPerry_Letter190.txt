Letter 190
29 September 1852
Mineral Springs

My dear Liz

	I am here quite well & shall leave this morning for Abbeville & will endeavour to return home Sunday night.  I feel much better than when I left home.  I had a fine sleep last night & this morning the air is cool & pleasant.  I think the quantity of mineral water that I drank last night had a good effect in making me sleep & feel well.  This is quite a pleasant place & I wish you were with me.

	Monday night I staid with my old friend Mr. Richardson the grandfather of Mrs. Thomas Gowen.  They were very kind to me & you must be kind to Mrs. Gowen.  Gowen sent down & got a milk can of Mr. Richardson whilst I was there & a baskett of butter.

	I met my old friend Capt. Hugh Wilson & wife yesterday & he seemed very glad to see me.

	The Bell is now ringing for breakfast & I must close my letter.  I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
