Letter 376
3 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The nine oclock Bell is just ringing & I have not had a moments leisure all day.

	Your letter has just been read.  Willie has been admitted into the Junior class alone.  There were fifty admitted into the Freshman & Sophomore.  Professor LeConte says he did well in his department.  Professor LaBorde admitted him in his department without an examination.  Dr. Lieber says he passed well.  Rivers says he did tolerably well in Greek.  I have not seen Preisdent McCay.  He called to see me this morning before he examined Will.  Willie is much pleased with his success.

	I did pretty well in my speech today on the Judiciary& there was a con[siderable] audience present.

	Miss Brenan gives a concert tonight, but I have not time to go or to go to Mrs. McCays party.

	Enclosed I send you my letter to the Patriot as you desired.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I wish you would answer all of my letters & say I am absent in Columbia & will write when I returnespecially the letters from Col. Dunkins sisters agent.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
