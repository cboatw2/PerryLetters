Letter 542
20 November 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I returned yesterday from the court of ordinary at Spartanburgh.  There was a trial of a Will case
In which I was concerned and succeeded in establishing the Will.

	This morning I have written a letter to Col. Ashmore, who was here during my absence & who will visit you tomorrow week as your mother has already written you.

	I shall start to Columbia on Saturday & hereafter address your letters to me there till the 21st of December.

	We are all well. & I have no news to write you except what you mother has written you.

	Hexts dog poor Watch was found dead the other evening & no doubt poisoned by some vial person.  Hext is very much grieved at the loss.

	I am sorry you sold your overcoat.  It was a pretty one & a remarkable one.  No doubt you are cheated in the clothes you got in exchange.  I am very much pleased with my overcoat & it is the admiration of all who see it.

	I hope you are now studying hard, as you say you will, in your last letter.   My constant & never ceasing command to you is to study hard & behave well.  In after life you will reap the reward.  Be ambitious to excel your fellow students in good conduct & in your studies.  Try & take a higher stand in your class.  Be high up, instead if low down.

	I am very busy & have not time to write you further.  In your next letter let me hear how the South Carolina students stand in their classes.

	Hext & Hayne went with me to Laurens Court week before last, & behaved very well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
