Letter 220
20 February 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I have not yet heard from you & it is one week since I left home.  This is Sunday morning.  It seems to me one month.  I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  I trust however that you are all well & doing well.

	Yesterday I went to hear & see the spiritualwith General Thompson & Mr. Burt.  I have written a full account of all they did for the Patriot which you will see & which would fill my letter to report.  Everything wasstrange.  I was at Burts again yesterday, & Mrs. Burt believes in the rapppings.  Frank Burt told her he was going to enquire all about & Armistead, whether they lived happily &c.  She told him that he and I ought to enquire about our wives at home & see whether they were not carrying on a flirtation in our absence.  I thought the age & appearance of Franks wife rendered such an enquiry unnecessary on his part.  Mrs. Burt seemed very kind, & I must have reminded her of old times before she ever saw Burt.  He said she looked for my gray hairs as soon as she saw me, & wanted to know what had become of them.  Burt is becoming gray.  She said she knew my head of old, & intimated  She has grown quite fat & will weigh about two hundred.

	Whilst writing the above Col. Orr came to dine with us.  Judge Butler also came to see us, & sat for an hour or two with us.  Col. Orr has just left & it is now near six oclock in the evening, and I must finish my letter.  I intended to write you a long letter.

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Orr & sent a pleasant evening.  Saw Mr. Soule of Louisiana & his wife.

	I have not yet heard from you.  I saw Herndon & Thompson this evening.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
