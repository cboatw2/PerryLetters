Letter 198
3 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night dated Dec. 1st and was surprised you did not mention Mr. Keith.  I wrote by him & he promised to call & see you & deliver my letter to the Patriot & am afraid that he has neglected to deliver that also.

	Yesterday I made a speech on the Basis of Representation, whilst this Bill for the division of Pendleton was under discussion which has now for me some honor.  Dr. Broyles told me it was the best speech he had ever heard.  There was a crowded House.  The Senate had just adjourned, & the Senators came in to hear me.  Mr. [William R.] Tabor the editor of the Charleston Mercury told me at dinner that he was very much pleased with my speech & had listened to it with great interest.  The Reporter of the Charleston Courier came to me for a copy of it & I have written it out for him.  I think the speech will be read with interest & gives the people some valuable information in regard to basis of representation.

	We have had a good deal of discussion in the Board of Trustees & I have generally taken an active part.  The question before the Board is a rebellion of the Students on account of the Commons.  Mr. Barnwell & Mr. Thornwell made capital speeches on the subject.

	The electoral Bill has been postponed till Tuesday next.  I may speak on that question.

	My name is mentioned in speaking of candidates for Judge., but it is too soon to expect that position after our political excitement.  The secessionists still talk of voting for me for Governor & Manning is a little uneasy about it.

	I saw Mr. Carter the book seller in Charleston yesterday.  He told me that I ought to expect some high appointment from {Franklin] Pierce.  That whilst at the North last summer he heard a friend of Pierces speak of me & said that Pierce himself had frequently done so & valued my character.  He took down my name in full to President Pierce.

	I hope to hear from Anna tonight.   Mrs. Brooks & her daughters are still here.  There are now a good many ladies coming in to be at the Commencement ball.

	Mr.  spoke to me last night & made himself known.  He enquired after your mother, you & sisters & children.  He seems a very excellent man, said he was with me in politics & always had been.

	Mr. Miller of Georgia & President of the Senate of Georgia was introduced to me yesterday & said he took great pleasure in reading my Paper & was a subscriber to it.  He got me to present his petition for the city council of Augusta about the bridge to the Legislature.

	Tom Butler was not elected to carry the votes to Washington.  A young man from Spartanburgh named Edwards now in college was elected.

	I am sorry you worry yourself about the servants.  Take everything cooly & dont expect them to do well.  We have good servants at this house.  I make my fire before day because it is no trouble, and a pine drys in my room & may kindle instantly.

       My friend G.M. Thompson the Boot and shoe merchant made me a present the other day of a superb pair of boots worth ten dollars.  This was clever in him.  I paid him the Bill for negro shoes thirty dollars.  I have also paid Lyons & sons the money collected for them of Kilgore amounting to $64.00.  I am now left with $300.00& $100 due me from Gladden.

       We had quite an accession yesterday from Greenville.  Sam Mauldin, Joab Mauldin, Dr. Pasley &
Hasan [Hamlin] Beattie.  It is rumored that Sam Mauldin is crazy & attempted to kill himself.  Sam Townes & Frank Townes will leave here this morning.

	I must now dress & go to Breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  I wish to see you all very much.  Anna was a great comfort to me whilst she remained here.  It is a great thing always to have someone near you when from home who is dear to you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
