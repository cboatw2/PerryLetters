Letter 624
24 August 1861
Richmond

My dear Liz

	It is now five oclock Saturday evening, and I have just seen Mr. Bartell of Anderson who belongs to the Brooks Cavalry.  He left Hamptons camp this morning & saw Willie yesterday.  He says Willie is quite well & stands the camp life better than any of themthat he has not been sick at all.  The Legion is now at O[c]coquan & will remain there till they march over into Maryland about the first of October.  But Bartell knows nothing about their movements.  I shall start in the morning, but will no doubt have some difficulty in getting a conveyance from Manassas to the Legion.

	I see every hour some of my acquaintances.  A great many come up & make themselves known to me from the middle & lower country.  Heise came up just now & has a long chat.  Barnett of Spartanburg has a son sick in the camp but could not get a passport.  He has gone to see Col. Chesnut.

	There is such a crowd here & such confusion that I am anxious to get off.  Indeed I am anxious to be quietly at home again.  A crowd has no pleasures for me like home.  Bartell says Willie has bought a pair of shoes with soles three inches thick to wear in camp.  When I get there with his boots, india rubber coat & bed covering & woolen socks, he will be well prepared for the winter & bad weather.  Gill was here the other day on his return from Petersburgh with their new company as I was informed by Doctor Austin.

	I have nothing more to write & simply write you again to tell about Willie.

	The boys John & Prince seem lonely in the crowd & came to enquire when I was going on.

	I have rece[ive]d no letter from you.  But Sharpe told me he left Greenville Wednesday morning & nothing new had occurred.  He is going on to join the legion.  He is from Georgia.

	I hope you & your mother, Annie, Susan & the children are all well & doing well.  I am anxious to be with you again.  When in Petersburg I told Nelly Orr that I would stop & tell her the news from the army, but I do not think now that I shall stop when my face is once turned homeward.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
