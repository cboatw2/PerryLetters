Letter 576
1 April 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I have just got through with court.  One case Chapman & Cool[e]y occupied three days.  Col. Orr
& Myself for Cooley, & Sullivan & Henderson for Chapman.  The costs of the case had amounted to $3,000.  There was a mistrial last Summer.  I gained it this time.  Oberly was convicted of an assault & Battery & sentenced to six months imprisonment.  He has now been in jail one year &has two more to stay.

	I am so busy here that I shall not go to Spartanburgh court.  Next week I go to Laurens court & the week after to Columbia & then to Charleston.

	We are all well.  Your letter to Fannie was rece[ive]d last week.  I have nothing more to write you.

	Study hard & be a good Boy.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
