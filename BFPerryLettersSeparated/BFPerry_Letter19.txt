Letter 19
9 December 1844
Columbia

My dear Wife

	I have just seen Mr. Burt who informs me that he will go up in the Greenville stage tomorrow morning.  This gives me an opportunity of writing you again.  I put a letter in the Post office for you this morning.  Since that time the Legislature have determined to adjourn Wednesday the 18th so I shall be at Laurens C. House Friday morning the 20th.  If you go down to Cunninghams you must make arrangements to send for me on that day to Laurens C. House.

	I do not believe that we shall be able to take Christmas dinner with Mr. Cunningham.  It will be too long for me to stay.  We can spend a day or two there after I arrive & then come on home.  This will do just as well as to spend Christmas with them.

	You had better start down the day after you receive this letterIf the weather be good.  But if the weather is bad do not go at all.

	I understand you have scarlet fever in the village.  Mrs. Walker writes to her dearly beloved that their son has had it very badly.  Be careful about the children catching it.    And take good care of them on the road.

	I have been in court today & have gained Mr. Fields casealso on another from Pickens in which two men were convicted of hog stealing.  My other cases not yet decided.  This case of Mr. Fields will be worth $100 more to me by a mistrial.

	I now have to go down to thew State House to attend the committee on Scriviner & Books of which I am chairman so I must close this letter.

	In regard to your visit do as you please.  Go when you please but do not travel in bad weather.

	Your husband with love & affection, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
