Letter 292
11 October 1854
Anderson C,H.

My dear Liz

	I hope to be at home tomorrow evening, but it is somewhat uncertain.

	One of my cases which would have taken a day or two being an issue how chancery. Judge Whitner declines trying, as he has been of counsel in the case.  There is one other which I hope to reach today or tomorrow morning.

	Mr. John Maxwell paid me fifty dollars as separate fee for my services in the case of himself & Anderson.  Keith & Perry will be an additional fee.

	I suppose the election is known by this time in Greenville, and I greatly fear that Powell is elected.  Keith has been beaten in this district.

	There was a great gathering last night at Mr. Robinsons in front of the Methodist Church, but I did not go to eat a hot supper.  There are a good many persons at B from below.

	I saw Mr. Sharpe Monday.  He says Mrs. Sharpe has been very ill for four weeks past but is now better.  He told me to say to Mrs. McCall that she would have written to her but for her indisposition.

	I hope you and the children are all well & doing well & that you did not let the election
give you any uneasiness.  I heard by Goodlett & Easl[e]y all the news of Monday from the election in Greenville.  In haste your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
