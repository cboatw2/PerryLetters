Letter 43
12 July 1846
Washington

My dear Liz

	I received your letter yesterday morning and was delighted to hear from home.  I went to the Post office to put in the letter I wrote you, & came very near coming off without enquiring for letters, not supposing you had had time to write me.  I assure you it affords me great pleasure to receive a letter [from] my home & my Dear Liz in a strange place.    And it seems to me that we shall have been separated so long that our meeting will be like a second marriage.  I am glad to hear that Will is head, that Frank misses me so much.  I hope they will all be good children & grow better by my return, & I will bring them so pretty presents.

	Yesterday I went to see Commodore Shubrick.  He now lives in Washington & has command of the navy yard.    He made a great many enquiries about your brother & family & seemed very kind.  Sent for his daughter to come down & see me & introduced me as the husband of her cousin Elizabeth McCall.  Said he would call & see me &c.  His standing in the navy is very high & he goes to sea in a few months.

	From Commodore Shubricks I went to the Capitol & was there introduced again to John Q. Adams who I find represents the district in which My Father was born.  He invited me to call & see him  Monday morning  & he would give me some information in regard to my name.  I had considerable conversation with him.  He looks very much like my Father, & I was so forcibly reminded of the likeness on first seeing him that I could not refrain from shedding tears.  I never will say aught against him again.  For I hold it impossible for any one with his features to be a bad man.

	I went into the Senate & there met for the first time Mr. [George] McDuffie who seemed very kind & invited me to take tea with him.  I was introduced to Richie, the venerable editor of the Union.   He enquired if I was major Perry of Greenville, S.C. and on being told yesHe replied you are a much stouter man than I expected to see.  I had always formed an opinion that you were a small man.  I had a long & very agreeable conversation with him.

	In the evening Burt & myself took a ride & went to the walls of the Capitol where some hundred of ladies & gentlemen assemble every evening to hear the Bank of music, promenade &c.  where I met Miss Howard.  I tried to avoid her but she literally ran after me, begged me to call & see her.  I found her with a member of Congress from Kentucky.  She must be crazy.  I met Mrs. Woodward & walked over the grounds with her & her husband and a Missfrom New York.  I met & was introduced to Winthrop of Massachusetts who is a gentleman.  About dusk we returned to Mr. Calhouns & took tea with Mr. McDuffie & Mr. Calhoun.  After tea Middleton came in who married a Vonness.  I had met him in the Library in the morning & had a good deal of conversation with him after an introduction by Burt.

	After sitting a while Burt & myself came to the Hotel where we found Col. Fair & Mr. Nance who had just arrived.    I am delighted to have Col. Fair for my travelling companion.  He will detain me a day or two longer in Washington.

	At the Box I found a letter from Col. Totteninviting me to dine with him on Monday at 5 oclock.  He had just rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Poinsett.  I find Mr. Poinsetts friends very much attached to him here.  And I could not have brought letters from a better source.

	You can form no conception of the heat of the weather.  It is actually purgatory.  Such distress & complaint I never had before.  My room is surrounded by Ladies & such doleful lamentations do I hear.

	You need be under no apprehensions about my money.  I believe my trunk the safest place.  Captain Rivers is here with his daughter going north & Mrs. Bryce of Columbia.

	Adieu my dear Lizmy love to the children & your mother & family, your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
