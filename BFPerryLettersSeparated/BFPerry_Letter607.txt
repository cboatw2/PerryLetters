Letter 607
16 June 1861
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & I have just seen Alexander McBee .  I saw Gibbs & Dr. Ferguson yesterday.  So I am pretty well posted to all your doings at Hampton.  I am glad to hear you are all getting on so well & pleased to hear of your promotion but would have been much more gratified to hear you were a commissioned officer.  This you will be after a time no doubt.  In the meantime get books & study hard your profession.  Devote yourself to it & make yourself proficient in the science of War.  Do not depend simply on theof your officers but study & read military books.

	Next to this & before it take care of your health.  Avoid fruits & drinking too much water.  Change your clothes when wet.  Do not eat anything but wholesome food & not too much of that.

	I wish to go down & see you this week.  If you are to stay long I would prefer going next week.  We should all be glad to see you at home before you leave for Virginia if you can conveniently do so.  McBee thinks you will be there a month before you start.  Jim Moore thinks so too.  I went to see himself. He came to see me yesterday.  He is pretty well except his face.

	 Tell Dr. Long that I have written a strong letter to Col. Hampton  for his appointment as Steward of the Hospital.

	Dr. Ferguspn thinks your horses well.  What about Wiley &.Will you have to pay their expenses or do you need Manorah?  All thesewe will arrange when I come down.  If you can get the naval pistol buy one.  I wish you well.

	McBee & Ferguson say your horses look well.  Give my best respects to all your messmates & friends, S, Ferguson, Thompson, Houstonand others.  In haste, yours affectionately, my dear Son, B.F. Perry
