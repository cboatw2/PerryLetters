Letter 345
7 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night just before I started to Col. Prestons magnificent party, & thankful I would write you till after my return.  But I did not get back till after two oclock & slept till Mr. Wells was about starting.  I have not yet had my breakfast & will write you now for fear I may not have time tonight.  Today the Electoral Bill is discussed.  I made a short speech yesterday on that subject.  Tomorrow the Bill providing for a separate court of appeals comes up, so it is impossible for me to think of returning home.

	I have just come back from breakfast & have to go to the State House in a few moments.

	I went to the party last night with Col. Alston & Harrison.  There were a great many persons there & I have never seen a more magnificent display.  I cannot, nor I have time to describe the party.  Col. Preston introduced me to Mrs. Preston, who asked me to take a seat by her, & we commenced talking about the mountains.  But in a few moments she had to rise to receive other company & I had to give up my seat.  It reminded me of much of the Presidents levee.  Mrs. Preston stood to receive her company.  The Col. was near the door to greet them first.  The rooms & entry (three rooms) were all full.  The ladies were richly dressed, & amongst them were Flora Jones & Sally Thompson.  Judge Withers had a very pretty daughter there about seventeen & vert talented.  Governor Manning & his wife were there.  Miss Sally Thompson says Governor Manning in Columbia & Governor Manning in Greenville are very different persons.  I went up to leave to Mrs. Manning & she held forth her hands & said she wad glad to see Major Perrythat I had treated her unfairly in visiting her house in her absencethat [I] must pay another visit & stay longer.  She is a real cordial. Warm hearted Virginian and still a fine looking lady.  We supped at one oclock.  About two oclock we broke up.  There was dancing, waltzing &c., good wines & rich brandy.  What a fine thing says Col. Watts to be rich.

	Tell Frank if I have time I will write him tomorrow morning & I will get his cap.  Willie will come back tomorrow & probably go home Tuesday.    Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
