Letter 501
16 October 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

       I read your letters last night & one also from Willie.  I was much pleased with your letter, & the information it contained.  I hope you will now study hard & stand high in your class.  I shall look forward every month with much interest to your standing.

       I write you in great haste as I am preparing to start to Pickens Court.  Your mother has given you an account of the elections.

       Anna is much better & improving fast.  If she gets no back sett this winter I hope she will be well by spring.

       I shall go on to see you this winter.  Col. Orr remains in Congress till next March, so you will see him in Washington if you go there.  But Col. Arthur Hayne will not be returned to the Senate this winter.

       I am pleased to hear you have grown so much.  I shall expect to see you almost a man in size and quite a man in manners behaviour & intelligence.  I take a great pride in you & Willie & you both ought to be ambitious and do well on my account as well as on your own.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
