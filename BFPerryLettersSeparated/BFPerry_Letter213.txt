Letter 213
15 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I recd your letter last night, which gave me great pleasure as all your letters do.  I received one from your mother at the same time requesting me to send to her all of your letters to me.    She says your letters to her are short, but well written.  You see my little daughter both I and your mother value your letters & how much we love you.

	I should be glad to see you before I return home, but I cannot go down to Charleston.  The Legislature adjourns tonight & we all leave here in the morning.  I hope to be at home with your mother, Willie, Frank, Fanny & little Hext Saturday evening and should like to have you in the group or family circle.

	You will come up with Mr. Elford.  I have sent him funds to pay your expenses & to let you have more money should you need it.

	Enclosed I will send you some stamps to put on your letters as you requested.

	We have bad weather & so much rain that you will not be able to see much of Charleston.  The winter is an unpleasant time to travel or visit.

	I am very much fatigued by our night sessions.  We sit every night till eleven or twelve oclock.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
Charleston
