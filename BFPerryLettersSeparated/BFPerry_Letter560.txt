Letter 560
15 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now nearly twelve oclock in the night & I will write you a third letter today by General Easl[e]y.

	My Court Bill passed by thirty votes about nine oclock.  This gives me great pleasure.  For eight years I have been striving to pass it.

	Enclosed I send you Franks letter.  I also send you two Books.

	Mrs. LeConte said tonight that she was now more anxious to see Frank than ever, & admired his letter very much.  She says the pictures will be very highly valued by Miss Graham & Lula.  She admired the poetry very much.

	Col. Allen invited me to dine with him today & I forgot to go.

	I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
