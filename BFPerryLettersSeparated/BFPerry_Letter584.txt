Letter 584
22 April 1860
Charleston

My dear Liz

	I am now at Dr. Porchers & have just returned from dinner.  Judge Jackson of Georgia formerly minister to Austria took dinner with us.  I am very much pleased with Dr. Porcher & Mrs. Porcher.  They are as fine a couple as I have ever seen.  I went to Dr. Philips church today with Gadsden King who married Mrs. Porchers sister & there was introduced to Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  The latter is a most lovely woman.  I saw & spoke to Isaac Hayne and his daughter.  She looks very pretty.  I saw & shook hands with Miss G B who looks as well as she did twenty years ago.  Yesterday evening I went with Dr. Porcher to see the first arrival of the cars from Savannah & there was a very handsome entertainment.  I returned took tea with the Dr. & went to meet the South Carolina delegation.  I returned near twelve oclock & found Dr. & Mrs. Porcher still sitting up awaiting my return.  I have rarely seen three finer looking ladies than Mrs. Porcher & her sisters Mrs. King & Mrs. Geddings.  I have been very fortunate in spending money since I left home.  Janney would not charge me anything.  I staid three days at the Mills House & instead of paying five dollars a day.   only charged me two dollars a day.  I saw general Martin & his son at the rail road celebration & a great many friends.  Mr. Webb enquired after you & said his mother had just rece[ive]d a letter from your mother.  Today I rece[ive]d three letters handed me in [the] presence of Mrs. Porcher & her two sisters & I told them you write me every day & I did the same which seemed to increase theirfor both us.  General Thompson& enclosed a letter for Dudley his wifes cousin from Baltimore.

	Tell Willie if Mahaffey takes the insolventact he will have to remain till court.  But if he takes theact he can go in ten days if his schedule is not contested.  I will try & come home this week some time.

	Dr. Porcher & family are going to Greenville next summer & perhaps to purchase.  Mrs. Porcher is a very talented lady & seems very happy in her family.  She has two little daughters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
