Letter 246
14 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you yesterday after I had written & deposited my letter in the mail in the box in which you state that you had rece[ive]d three letters that morning (Sunday) from me.  I am sorry that my letters reach you so much together.  It must be a task to read them all together.

	I was glad to hear that all were well & that you were preparing to have beef.  I think you might wean master Hext now & feed him on beef stake.  You stated he was twenty 0ne months old.  I dreamed about the little fellow last night.  How happy I should be to see you all.  No consideration could induce me to absent myself from you & the children as these members of Congress do from their wives & families.

	Yesterday I dined with Judge Butler & his mess. Consisting of Senators Mason & Hunter of Virginia & Atkinson of Missouri & Holmes of Charleston.  I spent a very pleasant day.  Judge Butler & myself took a long walk in the forepart of the day & were starting to walk again after dinner when we met two Englishmen calling to see him.

	The trial of Gardiner goes on today.  How long it will last no one can tell.  You will see a report of the whole case in the daily Republic of Washington.  You cab get the Republic at the Patriot office.  I will not stop until the evening & write you a line after I come out of court.

	It isa now eight oclock at night & I have just returned from the Court House.  We sat in court till half after four oclock in the evening & then Mr. [James M.] Carlisle one of Dr. Gardiners lawyers insisted on Mr. [Joseph H.] Bradl[e]y & myself going home with him & taking dinner.  I am glad I went, for he lives in more magnificence than the President himself.  He married the niece of Madame Calderon, the wife of the Spanish Minister, & his wifes sister is married to one of the Spanish Legation.  His mother, wife, sister in law & her husband the Spanish secretary, an another Spanish attache.  Bradl[e]y & or some of the Navy were present.  His house is a palace & furnished like one.  I went up into a chamber to wash my hands, & thereby saw the whole house.  His wife and the whole household were so cozy & familliar, that I felt at home amidst all the splendor around me.  I was in a pleasant mood, & had become very intimate with Carlisle & made myself easy with his wife, mother & childrenthree pretty little boys the oldest not more than five years old.  The Spanish gentlemen were good looking & familliar.  Mrs. Carlisle said she had enquired a good deal every day about the case, Dr. Gardiner & his counsel, & asked how Mr. Perry looked whilst the case was going on.  I suppose Mr. Carlisle carried me home with him to show me.  I spoke in high terms of Madame Calderons Book, saw her portrait.  His youngest son is thirteen months old & talks, but cant walk.

	We have made no progress in the case today.  No letters from you, so I will bid you good night.  God bless you & the children, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
