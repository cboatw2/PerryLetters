Letter 750
8 December 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I am still very busy in court.  Have had good success with my cases.  Rece[ive]d some money.  Dont know when court will adjourn.  We shall not get through the docket.  General Easl[e]y dined with me the other day.  I send you a letter of Hexts.  He seems to take seriously your advice about Miss Sallie.

	    I expect you must be satisfied with your loneliness by this time.  I miss you very much, but we are getting on very well.  Lindy does well.  The cow is famous as a milker.  Easl[e]y said he would rather have her than the gray mare.  J S says he would have taken her at fifty dollars but it was Sunday & he could not buy her on that day.  She gives nearly two gallons at a milking.  Bill A declines taking Petros because I rented part of the land to Paris.  Paris will not move there & rent the whole place.  His father in law Bill Jones will cultivate a portion of it.  I am glad to get rid of free negroes as tenants.  Smith sold his cotton for $30.00 & wanted to avoid paying rent on a part of it which grew on land he cleared up.  I told him he must pay me one third & he said he would bring the money this week.

	Mr. Babcock paid me $86.00 yesterday leaving only $1300 due, which theBill for three months will about pay.

	Vickorys Brother has come from Alabama to take his mother home with him.  Everybody takes him for his Brother.  They are so much alike.  In haste your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry
