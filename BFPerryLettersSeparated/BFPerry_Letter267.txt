Letter 267
6 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now six oclock in the evening & I Have not had a moments leisure since I got up; but as Anna has not written to you as I expected she would do, I will drop you a line.

	It is a hard matter to get Anna & Willie to do anything here & I begin to think there is too much confusion & company for children so small as they are.  I am afraid they will get spoilt.  Willie Beattie & young Buist leave here in the morning & I am glad on Willies account though he will deeply regret it.

	We had a little discussion in the Legislature today on the law prohibiting the circulatory small bills.  I made a few remarks.  Tonight I am invited to a party at Hammerscolds the German orch  Col., Jno Preston delivers a speech in the college chapel at about seven oclock.  There is also a meeting of the Editors this evening.

	I will write to the Patriot after I return from the college.  Anna & the young ladies speak of going to the college.  They went down to the State House this morning.  I have written Henry T. Thompsons report for him & will offer it tomorrow.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & will keep my letter open till I start to the college.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & am glad the groceries have arrived.  They will give you enjoyment in opening them & arranging them in the store house.

	You need not fear about Anna & Willie enjoying themselves.  I am glad thew cars are running to Greenville.  	I suppose Mr. Allston has arrived before this time & delivered my letter.

	I will not close my letter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
