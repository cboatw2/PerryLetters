Letter 742
7 July 1868
New York

My dear Liz

	The girls have just gone to the theatre with Mr. H & Frank Cox.  I will write you a letter & go to bed.  Last night I went to the great Democratic club know as Manhattan.  They had a most sumptuous entertainment &as six hundred present.  I did not leave there till after twelve oclock, & did not sleep well on my return.  They had all sorts of fishes, game, meats & wine.  The rooms appeared to be filled with bottles.  These New York people dont know the value of money & do everything in a most expensive style.  Think of their spending $100,000 on the 4th of July in fireworks & crockery!

	I met a great many pleasant gentlemen from all parts of the American Republic & amongst them two from the town in which Mrs. Bullen formerly Miss Ligon lives.  They had a great deal to say about her & made a great many enquiries about the Bs & Mrs. Rutledge & Mrs. Walter.  They said Mrs. Bullen would ask them about the South Carolina delegates & they wished to make their acquaintance on that account.

	Today the girls have been shopping with Mrs. fern.  I have bought two watchfor Willie & Hext, a pen for my office, fivedozen han[d]kerchiefs, ? dozen socks & vest.  But everything is very high & I will not purchase any more clothes.  I have carried yourto have mended.

	The convention met today & have adopted a platform which insures a Democratic victory.  It is one of the best things I ever saw.  We ballotted six or seven times for President, but made no choice.  I got the South Carolina delegation to vote for Andrew Johnson & General Hancock.  [George H.] Pendleton was ahead every time.  But it is understood that New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey & Indiana will cast their votes in the morning for [Thomas A.] Hendricks.  If so the Southern States will fall in & all the West will follow.  My impression is that Hendricks & [John T.] Hoffman will be nominated.

	I saw Collin Ferguson today, who enquired if you were with me & when he found Fannie was, he insisted very much that we should go home with him & spend two or three weeks in New Haven.

	The girls have had [a] great many calling to see them.  In the morning they are going with young Livingston, , Donaldson & Cox to Niagara Falls & return Saturday.  They will go up the Hudson in a boat as far as Albany.  By their return I shall be through with the Convention & my business here.  I have not yet had time to see any Publisher or book binder.

	We are living here in great splendor at no expense.  Mr. Livingston is a most warm hearted hospitable gentleman & is very kind.  For one days board at Madame Fillettes I paid $27.50.  She is a South Carolinian & Mr. Livingston a yankee.  I rece[ive]d your letter last Sunday just after writing mine to you.  I commenced writing you again, but the girls came back from the Central Park & interrupted me.  I hope to be able to leave here next week & reach home in a week afterwards.

	I am anxious to know how Willie comes on this week with his Equity business.  Tell Hext he must read & study as I directed him.

	The weather has been melting & I am not disposed to move about.  We have had a little rain this evening & it is cooler.

	I must now conclude my letter & go to bed.  You will probably hear of the nomination before you receive my letter.

	I am my dear Liz, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
