Letter 673
1 December 1863
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just been down to get my letters but was disap[p]ointednone from you.  It is  now eight oclock in the night.  Hext is asleep.  He will go up in the morning with Duncan Brooks, Nat Butler & Joel Goodlett.  I have bought him a gun which makes him anxious to go home & shoot birds.  He seems so anxious to go that I have concluded it was best for him to return.  He would be lonesome here after Duncan leaves & Col. OHanlon may not come up for some time.  Janney says he would not find much to amuse him at the Cols.  I thought the gun was a good investment of Confederate money & it would give Hext so much pleasure.  Janney says if ever I wish to part with it he will buy it.  But it is a fine gun & will do for all the children as Hext grows too large for it.  It has two barrels & I really thought it worth twice what I gave for it.

	I was invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow & shall do so.  I saw Mrs. LeConte today & she invited me to take tea with her as soon as I could.  She said she would take charge of Fannie when she came down.  Miss Graham expressed  great anxiety to see you & enquired kindly after you.  I went up in the Gallery & sat some time with Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham.  Miss Lula has not been out.  Mrs. LeConte admired my hat & said it was exactly like one she had made for Dr. LeConte.

	We are doing nothing in the Legislature yet & not much to do.  I think I shall go home on Sunday & stay Monday, Sale day, & return Tuesday.  The Legislature will probably sit till the 15th Inst.

	I have seen nothing of your uncle yet nor heard anything from him!

	The news from Braggs army is rather gloomy.  Col. Beaufort Watts says it is time to begin to think of being subdued.  He said he wished Judge ONeall, Governor Hammond & myself to be sent to Washington to treat for terms.  I told him such a proposition would be treason.  He said he knew it & would not do to talk about or to mention.

	I see they have had another fight in Virginia & are expecting a great Battle there.  Col. Elford will probably come down Thursday.  Tell Fannie I will go & see Hallie C & then write her a letter.

	I was very much disap[p]ointed in not hearing from you tonight.  I heard nothing from Willie since General Butler.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
