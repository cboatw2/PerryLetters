Letter 333
11 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & one from Mr. Elford & also one from Anna.  I have been so much engaged here by the courts, law & Equity, by the college, state House, & writing letters that I have no time for anything.  I have kept up with Dr. Crofts letters & business.

	Tomorrow I go down to Governor Adams & will return Sunday or Monday.  Monday night I finish my college duties & go to Charleston.  I shall have two days to stay there & return home Saturday,

	Edward has just been to see me & seems satisfied.  He will stay till Christmas.  He has permission to come home & stay two weeks in August.  In the fall I will make further arrangements as to his continuance with Antwerp.

	Mr. Easl[e]y goes up in the morning & I will send my letters by him, perhaps & maybe some books. Last night I went to hear the boys speak in the college with Governor Means & Col. deTreville & staid till eleven oclock.  But I took the precaution to write you in the morning.  So you heard from me.

	I must write to Mr. Elford & to the Patriot & to Anna tonight & it is now nine oclock.  Easl[e]y has just been in my room & I send by him Lady Blessingtons Memoir.

	Give my love to the children.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
