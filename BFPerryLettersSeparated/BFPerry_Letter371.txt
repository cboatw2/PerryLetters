Letter 371
25 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Son [Frank]

	I will write you a few lines as you have been so good as to write me so often since I left home.

	I received your letter this evening & am happy to hear you are progressing so rapidly in your studies & lessons.  If you wish to, you can come down Thursday.  You can get ready, I suppose, in a few minutes.  Willie can also come down with you if he desires to do so.

	Tell your mother I have nothing of interest to write her.  We had a little speaking in the Legislature & I took a part today.  I sent up the box & keys by Mr. Wells.

	Tell Anna that Mr. Evans who gave her the thimble is married.  He enquired very kindly about herso did Col. Beadon.

	It is very warm tonight & I am sitting with my windows up & door open in a perfect perspiration.

	Tell your mother that Mrs. Brooks Governor Adams daughter Had a fine son last night to greet its grandfather in going out of office.  Col. Pickens has declined running for governor & Col. [Robert Francis Withers] Allston will not be elected.

	Why does not Anna, & Willie & Fanny write me.  I saw a student of the College tonight a protg of Yeadons, who says if Willie applies for Junior they will not examine him on Homer but the memorabilia of Xenephon.

	Tell Hext & Hayne that I think often of them & long to see them all.

	Col. Moses has invited me & some other gentlemen to go down to Sumter with him Saturday evening.

	Tomorrow night the Board of Trustees meet & I shall not be able to write to any of you.

	Give me love to your mother & Anna & Willie & Hext, Hayne & Arthur & believe me your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Mr. Frank Perry
