Letter 136
29 October 1849
Pickens

My dear Liz

	I thank you most sincerely for your long & interesting letter by Mr. Elford & also for the letters from other persons.

	I am sorry I cannot write you one as interesting in return, but I will make it up in conversation when we meet.

	Mr. Elford is now about starting & I have just left the C. House to write you a line only.

	It will probably be the last of the week before I return.  I have had a good share of business & have recd some money.

	Our client Young is to be tried tomorrow for counterfeiting.

       My business with Keith is likely to be profitable.

       Enclosed I send you ten dollars as you are out of change.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
