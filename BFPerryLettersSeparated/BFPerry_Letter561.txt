Letter 561
16 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have been very much engaged today in the House and have but ten minutes  to write before going back,  I voted today in a minority of one in opposition to Col. Memmingers Resolutions for a Southern Confederacy.  I also pounced on him again today in my speech.  I want confidence in my firmness & political integrity.  He sails before the wind.  Col. [William McCreight] Shannon came up & congratulated me on my boldness & independence.  My remarks about Memminger & [William Sidney] Mullins excited a great deal of merriment in & out of the House.  Their speeches were so different from their Resolutions that I told the House they had exchanged speeches or picked up by mistake anothers Resolutions.

	I shall return home Tuesday evening.  My Court Bill has passed the Senate.  The Spartanburgh Road is defeated in the Senate.

	The Poetry you sent although tolerable is notin the Book where there is so many pieces so much better.

	I sent you some books by Mr. Easl[e]y.

	I must now go back to the House.

	Kiss the children for me.  I want to see you all very much.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
