Letter 601
5 May 1861
Greenville

My dear Son

	The weather is so bad I have determined not to go down to Columbia.  You will give the questions to Reed or some other lawyer & request him to pro them for me.  I will write Judge ONeall.

	I have written Col. Hampton about you & your company.  He is now in Columbia.  My letter to him in Charleston was sent up to General Thompson.

	If you see Hampton you had better speak to him.

	We are all well & the weather is dreadful.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

W.H. Perry
