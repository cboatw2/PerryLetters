Letter 759
26 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Liz

	Enclosed I send you a draft for Thirty dollars as you requested in your letter last night.

	I was unwell day before yesterdayan attack of indigestion.  But feel quite well today.  Yesterday I went to Col. Irvines sale, but bought nothing.

	I have nothing from Willie.  The official count reducing Blythes majority to 17 votes!  But let me beg of you to quit thinking, talking & writing about the election.  It is all nonsense to worry about it, & worry your friends.  Dont speak of it in Charleston.

	The New York World announces my election in glowing terms & with extravagant praise of myself.  I have two congratulatory letters from the North & a Hotel (Willards) in Washington sends me an invitation to stay there.  In haste, your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
