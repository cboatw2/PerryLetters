Letter 741
5 July 1868
New York

My dear Liz

	The girls have gone to the  Catholic Church with Mrs. Livingston & I will write you a few lines during their absence.  The Episcopal churches are all closed during this hot weather.  The members are out of the city.  Fannie & Mattie wished to see & hear something of Rom.

	I wrote you from Columbia & Fannie has written since her arrival here.  The dust & heat were terrible from Columbia to this city.  We stopped in Richmond & spent a pleasant evening in riding over the city.  Moore the friend of our lost Frank called to see us & I was very much pleased with him.  He is now a widower.  His wife died a few months since.

	We staid two nights and one day in Washington & spent the time very pleasantly.  I called to see the President with Governor Aiken, Gov. Bonham & Col. Townes.  His friend Col. Cooper told me he wished to see me.  But there were so many persons waiting to see him that our stay had to be very brief.  We then called to see General Howard who saw us very graciously & we had with him a very interesting conversation.  He is a remarkably fine looking gentleman cordial & rosy in his manners.  He talked about the Presidential Election with great frankness & seemed very willing  to be nominated, & I should not be sorry to see him the nominee of the democratic party.  In the evening we went with Mr. Long of Aiken to see Chief Justice Chase & I was pleased with him too, but not sufficiently  to vote for him unless forced to do so by the convention,  Chase has more brains than all the other candidates, is a states rights man & a democrat.  Whilst he goes for universal suffrage & general amnesty he wishes it left to the states to regulate suffrage.   He says we will soon control the negro votes in South CarolinaBrains & property must control labor.  I had an hours conversation with Chase & was much gratified.

	Whilst passing the Ladies parlor in the Metropolitan in Washington Mrs. Simms recognized me & ran out & caughte me by the hand & said dont you know me.  I had to confess I did not!  When she told me her name I almost embraced her to make up for not recognizing her.    She has two lovely little daughters.  I went to see her the next morning to see her children.  Fannie & Mattie spent the day in running over Washington & seeing every thing.  No doubt Fannie has written you all about it.  Col. Childs, Mr. Hough & Mr. H were escorting them over the city.  I saw Miss Col. Tom T & her daughter, Mrs. Simms nieces &c.

  	I had the pleasure of making a good many acquaintances in Washington.  We reached here Thursday night & went to Madame F.  Mr. [John] Livingston had been there that evening enquiring for me & left a message.  In the morning I went to see him & he insisted on our coming to his House.  He has a noble mansion magnificently furnished, & is a most warm hearted, generous, intelligent gentleman.  We have five large& the whole house.  He has so far insisted on our taking our meals in the House & hiswish on abundancelemonade & ice water.  His family are all in the country except a son, sixteen years old, who plays beautifully on the Pi for the young ladies.

	At Madame Figlettes we met the South Carolina delegation & Mrs. Simonton.  General Hampton came after we left the House.  The Convention met yesterday, but did nothing but organize. I am to be one of the vice Presidents of the ConventionGeneral Hampton on the platform, Simpson on organization, [Martin Witherspoon] Gary on credentials, & Campbell Chairman of the delegation.  Aldrich, Gary, Simonton, Mullins, Furman, Farrow are also here.  Chesnut & Manning & Preston are not yet here.

	The girls went to the convention with Mrs. Livingston & staid until they got tired.  The weather is dreadful.  Last night they went to the fire works with the two Vann Wycks fornerly of PendletonMrs. Van Wyck is now living here.

	I have seen Shu & Donaldson but have not seen McRoy.  I also met Dr. F & his daughter.

	It is very doubtful who will be nominated for the Presidency.  Pengleton is ahead of all at present.  The nomination is likely to fall on someone else[W.S.] Hancock, Johnson, [Horatio] Seymour, [Salmon] Chase, [Thomas] Hendricks, though last not least.  There is a good deal of ill feeling between the friends of the rival candidates & they are as busy as bees in electioneering.  The South will be passive & take whoever is given us.  It is possible the nomination may be made Tuesday & the Convention adjourn Wednesday.  I have a great deal more to write but close with love to you & the children.  God bless you, your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
