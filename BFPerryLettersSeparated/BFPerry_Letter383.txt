Letter 383
11 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Fannie

	I promised to write you this evening but really I have not time.  Enclosed I send you a letter to the Patriot which will give you an account of the Governors Inauguration.  There were a great many young ladies present & some very pretty ones.  The Governors daughter is quite pretty & about as old as Anna.

	Tell your mother that I rece[ive]d her letter this morning, but as I expect to be at home Saturday night I will reserve what I have to write her till I return.  I look forward with great pleasure to seeing you all again.  It seems to have been an age since I left home.  I will stay with you Sunday & go to church & return Monday.  The Legislature sits now at night so I will get back to sit Monday.  Saturday nothing is done.

	I am glad to hear you & Hext are going to school & doing well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip with Mary Cleveland into the country.

	Next May I will carry all of you to Columbia as we can go down for nothing & return for nothing to attend the Rail Road convention.  That will be pleasant to take you & Anna & your mother & Hext & Hayne & Frank & stay two or three days.

	I saw Paul Hayne this evening.  He says he will be in Greenville in January.  He enquired particularly after Anna.

	Mr. Elford writes he will be here tomorrow.  Your affectionate Father, give my love to your mother, & Anna & the children.  How happy I shall be to see them all Saturday night & I will bring you oranges & candy & a silver knife.  B.F. Perry
