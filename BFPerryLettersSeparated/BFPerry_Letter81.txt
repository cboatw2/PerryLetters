Letter 81
Tuesday morning, [ca. 3 November 1847]
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have but one moment to write you by Mr. Elford as I have just understood that he is going this morning.

	Willie is behaving like a little man & is the admiration of all who see him.  He sits in court, goes to the tavern, plays with those around him & reads Hendleys Washington & amuses himself very well.  He says I must tell you & Anna, Frank, & Fanny that he wishes to see you.

	There is very little business in court & we shall probably get off Thursday morning.  I have been employed in several cases since I came here.

	In regard to politics I am doing well & have flattering news from all quarters.  We have a public meeting today on the Wilmot Proviso.

	Tell Jim to sow & plough in the rye.

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
