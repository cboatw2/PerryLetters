Letter 234
4 March 1853
Gadsbys Hotel

His Excellency President Pierce

	Most respectfully I ask permission to say a word in favor of my friend Francis Burt Esq of Pendleton South Carolina who is an applicant for office from your Excellency.

	I am myself a citizen of South Carolina, and a union democrat, who claims to have been one of the first to urge the propriety of the States voting for the Baltimore nomination.

	When South Carolina, with seeming unanimity, declared her purpose of resistance to the compromise & a fixed determination to dissolve the Union, I threw myself in the breach, and resisted the action of the state by the establishment of a union Paper in the town of Greenville.  My speech in the legislature of South Carolina in defence of the compromise & the Federal Union, and the establishment of the Southern Patriot was the beginning of an opposition which gradually grew & increased till the state was saved from a bloody revolution.

	For myself I ask no office or reward for the sacrifice of my popularity & influence in South Carolina in defence of the Union & the compromise.  The wildest term applied to me was that of traitor, but I knew my own heart & disregarded it, Although I ask nothing for myself, I do ask for my friend who was then politically opposed to me and whom I know to be honorable & capable & meritorious.  His appointment will confer a favor on me & be highly acceptable to the State of South Carolina in whose service he has spent many years of his life & held a high & responsible office, Treasurer of the State.

	I am with great respect yours &c, B.F. Perry
