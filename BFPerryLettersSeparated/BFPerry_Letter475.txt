Letter 475
11 April 1858
Greenville

M dear Son

	We did not receive a letter from you last week.  You ought to write regularly for we are uneasy my dear son when we do not hear from you.

	Anna is better & Dr. Earle thinks she will recover.  But she is still in bed & unable to sit up.  In two weeks Dr. Earle says she may ride out.

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to go & see you next week but it is uncertain whether I shall be able to get off in time to return to the court of appeals in May.

 	Minerva is very bad off with soar throat.  All the rest are well.

	Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Hext is learning very fast.  Hext & Hayne are very affectionate towards each other.  They are always together.  Fannie is going to school & growing very fast.  She will be a young lady in size very soon.  Arthur looks very well & grows finely.  He will not talk yet.

I hope, my dear son, that you are now studying hard & ambitious of keeping up with your class.  I have not rece[ive]d your Report for march yet.  I hope it will be better.

       Tom Jones & Tommy Arthur are going to school at Spartanburg & came home the other day in uniform with brass buttons all over their coats.

       Give my love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & remember me to Captain Blake when you see him.

       I wish to see you very much & will try to do so.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
