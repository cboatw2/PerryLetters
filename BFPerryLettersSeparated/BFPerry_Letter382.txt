Letter 382
10 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & thank you for it.  I was sorry your mother did not write me also.

	Tell Willie I bought him, today, & paid for it $14 a nice Mahogany set of drawers with a glass on top.  Bowers from whom I made the purchase is to send it down to College for him when he comes down.

	I have seen a good many persons here who enquired after you.  Mr. Evans did bring his bride with him.  Mr. Sparks & his bride were to have been here tonight.

	Jane Adams is not with her Father in Columbia nor none of his family.  He quits Columbia tomorrow & says he is most happy so to do.  Governor Allston is just as happy to begin his administration as Governor Adams is to end his.  I am invited to a champaign party tomorrow after the Inauguration to meet Mrs. Allston & was requested to bring with me any ladies I might have under my charge.  I wish your mother & you were here for the inauguration.

	The ladies seem to gather about the state House more now than they did last week.

	Waddy Williams has just come into my room to borrow $20 to pay his expences & get home.  He says he does not suit the man in whose employment he is staying, & I expect he tells the truth.  I told him I would let him have enough money to pay his expences home in the morning.

	I am writing in great haste & must conclude.  Tell Fannie I will write her a letter tomorrow & tell her all about the Inauguration of the Governor.

	Give my love to your mother & tell her Mr. Yeadon has written to his wife what she wrote me.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
