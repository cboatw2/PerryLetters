Letter 770
26 September 1876
Greenville

My dear Liz

	No northern mail yet.  I wrote you a long letter this morning and as my office is clear of company at present and I am at leisure I will write you again.

	There was a Radical meeting here last night, & Dr. Vance & Isaac Bryan made speeches against Tom Bryer &  Evins Radicals.  Speights was present also.  Bryer gave Judge Cook & Speights some hard threats.  He said the Democrats were always talking about the corrupt scoundrels in the Republican party.  We are trying to snuff them off as fast as we can.  We have lately got rid of one of the corruptist men in the Republican party, Judge Cook, & he has gone over to the Democrats!  I know Mr. Speights pretends to be a Democrat, but I have heard conversations between him & Judge Cook which showed that he was as much of a Republican as any of us.  This was pretty hard on Cook & Speights. In the Daily News Speights gives an account of the meeting, but says nothing about Bryers onslaught on him & His Honor Judge Cook.

	The office has been full again since I commenced writing.  Trappier, Hayne, Nance, Freeman, Pelham &c. have been in, talking politics & law.  Willie has just gone to attend to a case Freeman vs  Jennings.  He is trying to eject her from his house.  She wont pay rent & defies him.

	I received a very nice letter well written from John Perrys wife thanking me for my likeness & the pamphlet about dear Anna.  She says she will read it with great interest when she gets well, John has been sick but convalescing, & she is a great deal better than when I saw her.  She signs her name Burt Perry.  Burt is a singular christian name for a young lady.  I received a card addressed to my care from  Wylie, to Miss Emma Julia Blum.  He is coming to Greenville.  Also are into address a public meeting at Fork Shoals signed by.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
