Letter 602
5 May 1861
Columbia

Dear Papa

	As I promised to write to you today I will do so, though my pen is so bad that I can hardly write with it.  I reached here safely, but am sorry to say I had to pay for my passage down as my stock would not carry me.

	There is nothing new here that I have learned.  The Butler Guards leave here tomorrow afternoon.  The 4th Regiment will probably be stationed at Aiken very soon, & perhaps Williams Regiment also.  Av good many of the volunteers are sick.

	I hope you will come down on Tuesday in order to examine me.  I have not met with any applicants for Equity yet, though I have heard of two who are going to apply.

	I will have to pay five dollars for my license, if I get it.

	I have nothing to write you & so will close.  Your Son, W.H. Perry
