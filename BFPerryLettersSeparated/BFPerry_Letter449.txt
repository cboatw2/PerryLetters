Letter 449
10 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & was greatly distressed to hear of your feeble health.  You must suspend your studies till your health improves.  If you do not get better in the course of a week or two I will go for you & bring you home.

	I am anxious to hear what the doctor in Philadelphia says about your cough.  Write me all about what he says.  I should be glad if he would write me himself.

	I went home last Saturday & was actually on the road whilst you were writing to me.  I came back Tuesday & did not reach Columbia till near eleven oclock in the night.  We were delayed by the up train breaking down.

	They were all well at home.  But your mother has no doubt written to you all the news & I will not repeat it.

	Mrs. LeConte leave[s] here today for Georgia.  Mrs. LeConte read me portions of Lulas letter last night.  Give my love to Lula.

	The House has been crowded with young ladies.  But I was absent & have seen very little of them.  The Ball passed off very well says Mrs. LeConte.  The most pleasant & agreeable one they have had for years.

	The Governors daughter is not here.  She is not very pretty but a sweet looking girl.  His son is not remarkable for his appearance.  Mrs. Chesnut is handsome.  I saw Miss Eliza Irby (that was) & her fat husband.  Yesterday we had quite a display of Ladies in the gallery.

	I dined last evening with the Speaker Col. Simons & met Governor Manning.  I also met a gentleman from Virginia who married Miss Manning Sm who was a great beauty but I suppose you never heard of her.  She went to school at Greenville and was born in Spartanburgh.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
