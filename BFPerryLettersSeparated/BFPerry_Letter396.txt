Letter 396
10 June 1857
Columbia

Dear Mamma

	Papa told me to write to you tonight, as he is too busy, being obliged to meet the trustees tonight at half past 7.  I am in a hurry myself, so will make this letter very short. It is not necessary to write a long one, inasmuch as Pa and myself will both be at home Friday evening, that is day after tomorrow evening.

	Papa is going to take me to Harvard University when he goes on with Anna & Frank this summer.  You may accordingly expect us Friday evening, so send Wiley with the carriage, to the depot for us.
The trustees met this morning and heard the statement of McCay, and the rest of the Faculty, from them Pa says he does not think that McCay has lied.  Some of the Trustees, and Pa amongst the number, are in favor of disbanding the College, electing new Professors &c.

	I havent time to write more as I want to carry this letter up street tonight and mail it.

	Hoping to see you all soon, I am your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
