Letter 507
5 December 1858
Columbia SC

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you Friday morning & were pleased to hear you were rising in your class and studies.  We hope to see your next report much improved, and that next June you will have no difficulty in rising.  You must study hard & be a good boy.

	Anna is still in the same feeble condition, but she thinks she is better.  She eats & does not throw up her food as she did a week since.  She & your mother will remain here till Wednesday or Thursday & then go to Aiken or return to Greenville.

	We heard from the children yesterday.  They were all well & doing well.

	Your mother purchased some handkerchiefs for you & will have your shirts made.  I still hope to be able to go on, & see you the latter part of this month.  But it is somewhat doubtful.  Your mother has written to Captain Blake to let you visit Washington Christmas.  If I can I will be there about that time.

	Col. Chesnut has been elected Senator in the place of Judge Evans.  He is a friend of mine & if you go to Washington you must call & see him & General Hammond & Col. Orr & General Bonham.

	If you want money to go to Washington write me & I will send you a check for enough to defray your expenses.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
