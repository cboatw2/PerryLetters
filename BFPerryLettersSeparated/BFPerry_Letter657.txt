Letter 657
25 March 1863
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I send you by Willie $250.00 to pay for the corn.  If you come down with Willie leave the money with Barton & send Jackson word that the money is there.

	If you think the children will not run wild in the mountains, or get hurt, or not be taken care of, you had better come down in the Buggy with Willie & stay till he goes then I will go up  with you & stay awhile.  If you think best, you & the children can come down in the carriage & let John come & carry the horses back.  Alfred & Johnny can be employed  in clearing on the branch below Alfreds house.  I am willing to any arrangement you may make.

	If you do not come down with Willie I will go up as soon as Willie comes back & bring you down in the Buggy & then when Willie goes off carry you back & stay awhile & then all come down

	Fannie is very anxious for you to be at home again and I think it best you should be with her.

	I am doing some business every day.  Yesterday I drew a Bill in Equity for Thomas.  The day before I took a note for an old fee of $250.  But I am getting scarce of money.  I bought a sack of salt of Holdman yesterday for $31.25.

	General Thompson sent me a demijar full of the finest syrup I ever tasted and a parcel of sausages from Florida.  Barret will send me three bags of flour soon, one bag as a present.  McClanahan has promised yam potatoes so I dont want Bartons.

	If Willie comes home Friday or Saturday I will go up on Sunday unless you come with him.  I can stay there Monday and bring you down Tuesday & then you will have five or six days to staY with Willie before he goes off.  Then we can go back Monday afterwards & stay a week & all come down.  But do as you please about it.

	No news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
