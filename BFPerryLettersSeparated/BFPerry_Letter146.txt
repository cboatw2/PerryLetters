Letter 146
12 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your long letter & Annes & am very much obliged to you both.  It gives me great pleasure to hear from you. Willie & myself left theHouse at half after 3 this evening to go to the Post office.  The mail was not opened when we got there.

	I have not yet spoken on the Bank question but will in a day or two.  The committee of the two Houses meets tonight to nominate a President & directors.  Col. Gist who is on the committee told me that in all probability I would be nominated for President.  Mer. [Ker] Boyce came to me today & said the same.  I have never mentioned the subject to anyone & if I should be nominated my election would be very doubtful.  I have no idea Col. Elmore can be beaten.

	Mr. Choice came down yesterday & brought the three Clevelands.  As I was going down to the State House little Jerry spoke to William.  I did not know him.  He & Willie went about together.  They go to Charleston.

	I am afraid it will be out of my power to bring your bonnet.  Indeed I do not know how I shall get up with the birds.  The roads are dreadful & your bonnet would be exposed to the weather.  Moreover my money is coming to an end.  Your bonnet is very good & if you get a new one you had better get [it] in the summer.

        Chancellor Dunkin gave me $25.00 forin court the other day.  If you ascertain she wants anything in particular you can purchase for her & I will pay when I return.

       I have just been elected one of the Trustees of the College.  General Martin was beaten [by] one vote, & he dislikes it very much.  I got all but four.

	It was determined the other night in caucus to elect those [who] were not in the Legislature to Nashville & Judge Cheves, Robt. Barnwell, Elmore & Gov. Hammond were elected.

	My cases came up yesterday in court.  Four of them were tried.  Today they were trying the Edgefield cases.

	I am invited to dine with the Governor tomorrow again, & have accepted the invitation.

	The Legislature meets tonight & I must now go to the State House.

	Tell Frank I will bring him something.  Willie is sitting by me & talking all the time.

	You must excuse this short epistle & expect short ones from this out.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
