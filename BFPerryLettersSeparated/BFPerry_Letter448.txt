Letter 448
10 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have been engaged in court all day today.  It is now five oclock & the Legislature have a night session at six.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & the Bundle by Wells.

	It is expected that I will make a speech on the Bank question & perhaps I may tonight.

	The House is now full of ladies.  But I have not had time to make their acquaintance or even enquire who they are.  Mrs. Fair is here & Mr. Dr. Fair has returned.  Wallace Thompsons daughters are here.

	General Gadberry told me a good joke & a compliment paid me & Mrs. LeConte the other day.  Sitting together at the supper table this gentleman supposed we were husband & wife & remarked that we were the handsomest & finest looking couple he had ever seen in his life.  General Gadberry said he concurred & responded to the sentiment.  I told him if he had seen Mrs. Perry he would have thought we were still a finer looking couple.

	Mrs. LeConte went off today.  She remarked last night she had never seen me so much distressed as I was on hearing from Anna.  I could not sleep well & have been distressed all day.  I wrote to Anna this morning to quit her studies.  I hope the next letter may contain better news.  But I presume she had better return home.

	I hope your mother & Anne may like Center & take her.  It was a great bargain.  She is worth two or three hundred dollars.

	I dined with Col. Sem yesterday & spent a pleasant evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
