Letter 512
13 January 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	The fears expressed in my last letter to you have been realized, as you know by the letter of Mr. Gaillard.

	Poor Anna is dead & I have just returned with a broken heart from the funeral.  [Words obscured] was a beautiful one & I have just written an account of it for the Patriot and Mountaineer which you will see next week.

	She said she loved all of her brothers & Sister, but you she loved more than any other.  She begged that you would be a good boy & remember & love her memorythat you would prepare to meet her in Heaven.  I hope my dear son that this advice will not be thrown away on you.

	She said you must send the presents intended for her, to her mother & that her mother must look at them & remember her.

	The village generally have manifested the greatest interest in her death.  The stores were all closed today as the funeral procession passed.  The day was very rainy & bad but still there was a great turnout of the villagers for her funeral.

	She manifested a willingness to die & Revd. Mr. Gaillard said she died as a true Christian.

	I have no heart my dear Son to write you a long letter.  I hope you may receive this before Willie passes you.  Tell him that Anna sent her love to him & said he must also prepare to meet her in Heaven.

	We are all well, though in greatest affliction bowed to the Earth.

	Truly your affectionate Father.  My obituary notice of Anna you will see much to interest you & I will not repeat it.  B.F. Perry
