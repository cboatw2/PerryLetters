Letter 558
14 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you two ten dollar Bills to pay your expenses to Washington on Christmas.  You must tell Captain Blake about it.

	Why have you not written to me?  I have been waiting to receive a letter from you before I sent you the Money.  When you write me now, write to Greenville as I shall return there in a few days.

	We are very much excited here about the conduct of the northern people in reference to old Brown.  But I hope all will be right & the north may see their error.

	I was glad to hear from Col. Ashmore you were doing so well.  Your mother sent me your last letter which was very gratifying.  I hope my dear son you will study hard & rise still higher in your class.

	They are all well at home.  I am very busy and have not time to write you a long letter.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
