Letter 302
4 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just got through with my business & visitors & seated myself to write you a line.

	His has been college commencement.  I had to stay in the Legislature till five.  Then I went to Chancellor Dargan about Ts business.  On my return I found Duncan, Elford & Sullivan& McBee & Brockman all in my room.  They have just gone.

	Elford gave me your letter.  I shall save my board by going home which will be my passage.  If I can possibly leave I shall do so.  My law business comes up this week.

[Paragraph interlined, illegible]

	I have written a letter for the Patriot, giving an account of the College commencement.

	Willie & Frank are asleep & Willie is snoring finely.

	Mr. Petigrus address today was a reply to Tabers false idea last winter about educating the people.

	Anna can come down with me or stay & come afterwards.   Pinckney Mcbee returned this evening.

	It is now bitterly cold.  I saw Barnwell Rhett today who seemed kind & glad to see me.

	I have not time to write you as I would wish & must now close my letter.

	I am glad to hear in your letter that you are all well including sheep & deer & horses &c.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
