Letter 606
16 June 1861
Camp Hampton
Dear Papa

	Today is Sunday, and I will write you a few lines, which I will probably send up by Tom Adams who goes up in the morning, on a short visit.  We are getting on pretty well, as far as we have boxes from home.  Our horses are very much stunted in their feed, so much so that I thought of asking you to send down a bushel or two of corn, to help along with.  I wish you would see if you could send me down some corn.  I dont expect they will charge you anything on the Rail-Road, & so it would not cost much.  I look for you down on Tuesday, you and Hext.  I cant give you much accommodation.  Our tents are so hot during the middle of the day that it is impossible for us to stay in them.  I dont know when we will leave here for Virginia.  The impression is that we will leave here the latter part of this week.

	[page torn] Griffin who commands the Cavalry portion of the Legion is here now and says that the Cavalry will be sent on before the infantry.  If so we will leave here soon.  Another company of Cavalry is expected here soon.

	Tell Ma she can send down anything she wants to by Tom Adams who came down again on Wednesday.  Mr. Stairley, Col. Randal and several others have gone or are going up on furlough.  What do you think of my trying to get a furlough.

	In my letter a few days ago, I left out that Wiley was sick.  He is quite well now except a cold.  The health of the company is very good.

	There is nothing of interest to write about.  I will close.  Give my love to Ma, and all.  Your Son, W.H. Perry
