Letter 2
20 November 1842
Newberry CH
My dear Liz
	I have time only to write you a few lines whilst I am in the same room withWare & Town[e]s & chair.
	We had quite a pleasant journey down here but have had a most angry and stormy time since our arrival here.  The Rail Road Convention broke up in confusion.  The Greenville & Laurens stock holders withdrewtheir connection with the company.  The reason of this was that the road was located in Abbeville & Anderson instead of coming through Laurens.  The Greenville and Laurens subscribers are now released from the payment of their stock.  We have had much debate & some angry discussion none on my part thoughsome on the part of General [Waddy]Thompson & others.  We start in the morning to Columbia.   Col. Coleman, Poinsettand their families are at Harts & go down tomorrow or next day.
	I took tea with Col. [Simeon] Fair.  He lives in great style.  I was at Chancellor [Job] Johnstons who lives handsomely & he invited me to tea, but I could not accept.
	The towns people are outraged with Col. [James Lawrence] Orr for his course on the rail road.  I made two good speeches on the convention & was highly complimented for them.
	Edward has been standing by me & says give his respects to you & tell his mother howdy & all the rest of the servants.  He says that he is very much pleased with his journey, & has behaved himself well.
	Choice is considerably hurt by this runaway scrape.  We have been very gracious.
       In haste yours truly.  Tell Will I wish very much to have him with me, & I am sorry I did not bring him in the carriage.  Kiss the children. Tell Will to write me.  Your husband affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
