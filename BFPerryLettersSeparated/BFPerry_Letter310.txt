Letter 310
12 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now nine oclock, & I have just returned from the committee & still have to go & meet [George Alfred] Trenholm & Gourdin on the Blue Ridge rail road Bill.

	I have been all day in court arguing the academy cases & Yanceys cases.  I have no doubt I shall gain both.  Tomorrow I have two or three other cases.  My business in the Legislature is very much neglected.

	The Electoral Bill was postponed today whilst I was absent.

	I rece[ive]d your letter just before I went to meet the committee.  Willie & Frank will go home Thursdayyou may expect to see them.  I wish I could go with them.  About one third of the members went home last Saturday & returned Monday.  Judge Whitner did so. [William Dunlap] Simpson & [W.P.] Henderson returned home to Laurens.

	But it is impossible for me now to leave till the Legislature adjourns.

	I must now bid you good night as I have now to go & meet Trenholm as already stated.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
