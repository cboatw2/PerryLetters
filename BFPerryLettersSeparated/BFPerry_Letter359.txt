Letter 359
6 May 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I barely have time to acknowledge the receipt of your letter last night.

	I have a great deal of writing to do this morning before the Convention meets & I did not get to bed till twelve oclock last night.

	We had a glorious meeting last night & a noble speech from Col. Pickens, President of the Convention.  There were perhaps 120 delegates present.  We will adjourn tonight.  I shall try to be at home next Saturday.  My cases in court were disposed of yesterday.  Col. Brockman, Bolling, McKay, Jones came down.  Flora Jones came up from Barnwell last night & is at this Hotel, but I have not seen her.  Tell Anna all the other servants enquired after her.

	God bless you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
