Letter 722
12 December 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by mail.  No one went up this morning, as I would have sent you a bundle of papers, which you might have loaned to your friends.

	I received a kind telegram last night, from the President saying he was gratified at the reception of his message un S.C. that he would send me in a few days instructions as to my being retained as Provisional Governor & that Congress would move off all right in twoor three days.

	I have just communicatred this news to Governor Orr who is delighted.  He says he wishes very much that he had brought his daughter down with himthat she & Fannie would have staid at Col. Childs with Mrs. Herbemont & had a delightful time.  He is staying there.

	I have just see Mr. Janney.  Fannie sent for your letters to read.    The package came safe.

	As soon as I receive my instructions I will return home and give up the State to Gov. Orr.  Then I will go on to Washington.  Willie is quite well.  Fannie was invited to a party at Mrs. LeContes last night. But the rain prevented her going.  She is quite well.

	The Legislature has agreed to adjourn this day (Tuesday) week.  The Judges are to be elected tomorrow.  It is thought Dawkins, Moses, & Presley will be elected.

	In haste your affect[ionate] hudsband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
