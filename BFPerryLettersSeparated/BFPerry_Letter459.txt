Letter 459
2 January 1857 [1858]
Harvard College

Dear Papa

	I have just received your letter this morning, in which you say that you have sent the money to Col. Memminger.  He will send it in shape of a draft or check, I suppose, for he has already sent his sons their money.  I suppose I will get it in a few days.  I will have to get it all in gold when I start home and as the banks have resumed specie-payment, I presume there will be no difficulty in that.  I will start from here next Wednesday or Thursday two weeks.  I dont know exactly which day yet.  I can sympathize with you, and Ma about Anna.  I havent heard from her this week, but I hope that she is well enough to be by this time on her way home.  She said that she was to start on the 30th, which was last Wednesday I believe.

	I will call on Judge Evans, and Col. Orr, if I can find them in Washington.  The Memmingers are going to stop a very short time in Washington.  They will be gone before I get back from Annapolis.  I havent heard from Frank in some time.  He owes me a letter.  I mentioned in my last that the reason We didnt go to Mr. Winthrops was that it snowed so hard.    The weather is very cold at present, at least cold enough for skating.

	I received a letter from Ma yesterday and one on Tuesday.  I will twice move before going starting home.

	Christmas has come and gone, and so has New-years day.  We had holiday only on Christmas day.  Today is Saturday.  I generally write on Sunday, so I expect that you will get this letter a day sooner than usual.

	I hope that you have got better from your cold by this time.  I am much obliged to Fannie for the book-mark that she sent me.

	I will now close.  Give my love to Ma and all.  I hope soon to have the pleasure of being with you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry
