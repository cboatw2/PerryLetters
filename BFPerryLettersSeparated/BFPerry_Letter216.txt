Letter 216
Tuesday morning, January 1854
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines whilst Frank is dressing for Breakfast.  The Bell has rung & Frank was asleep.  On being waked up he expressed great mortification that I did not wake him sooner.  We had a terrible drive here on Sunday.  The roads were almost impassable.  We reached here by night by hard driving.

	The Will case was set down for trial today,  I came one day too soon.  But I employ it very well in looking into the case & examining the authorities.  I am very confident of success & we get a fee of $500 if successful before the ordinary & $300 if not.

	I shall not be at home before the last of the week perhaps Saturday.

	I have nothing new to write you.  My friend Keith has a son born last week.  He has two daughters before.

	If Reed is here to attend to the other side of the Will case & gets only a fee of $5.00.

	Frank has now dressed & we will go to breakfast.  Yours truly & affectionately,
B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
