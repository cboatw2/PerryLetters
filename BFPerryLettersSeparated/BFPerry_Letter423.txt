Letter 423
1 November 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	I recei[ve]d your letter of the 29th October Friday evening & was glad to hear you stood so well in tour class as to be placed in the second section.  This is well indeed for you, for all the boys must be older than you.  I hope you will study hard, behave well & graduate with high distinction.

	You must be very particular in your conduct & studies, & observe all the rules & regulations of the school.

	I am glad you were invited to Dr. Sharpes & went.  You must go & see captain Blake & his good Lady whenever they invite you.

	We will try & send you all our likenesses when we have an opportunity.  And you must have yours taken well & send to your mother & myself.

	You say that Anna writes you she is homesick & you do not see the propriety of sending girls off to school like boys.  Anna will be much better satisfied when her school opens again & she has to study hard.  She will then have no time to indulge in thinking of home.  It is of great service to girls to send them from home to go to school at Annas age.  It keeps them out of company & gives them a better opportunity of studying.  At home they become young ladies too soon & think more of company than they do of their studies.
,
	You say I must write you how all the horses are doing.  They are all fat & sleek & look remarkably well.  Wiley hauls wood with Bill & Tim & Monarch.  Tom Thumb is very tired of standing all day in the stable & would like very much for you to be here & ride him every evening.  When I go into the stable he begs me as well as he can to take him out.  Fannie sometimes rides him.  He is very fat & stout.  Monarch would be unmanageable if I did not make Wiley put him in the lead & haul wood with him occasionally.

	I am now engaged in the Courts.  Last week was Greenville Court & this week is Spartanburgh  Court.  Tomorrow is sales day & I shall not go to Spartanburgh till Tuesday.

	You may remember Simon Turner was in Jail for killing Reed.  He was tried last week.  I & Goodlett defended him.  His trial took three days & the verdict of the jury was.  He has been sentenced to twelve months imprisonment & fined one thousand dollars.  The Solicitor Reed & Henry Thurston made speeches against him.

	This is Sunday & I shall not go to church, as I have so many letters to write and so much business to do before starting to Spartanburgh.  You must write me every Sunday as you promise I will answer all your letters.

	We hear from Anna every other day, & from Willie once a week.  He is doing well & well satisfied.

	I have done a good business this court & am paying for my House which will cost me for the rooms put up twenty five hundred dollars.

	The times are hard & money scarce.  The Banks here are suspended & there will be a great deal of suing next court.  This will make a fine harvest for the lawyers.

	We are all well except colds which are general.  You must write me all about the Boys in school & how you like them, your studies &c.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
