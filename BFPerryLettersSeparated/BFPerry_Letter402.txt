Letter 402
28 August 1857
Philadelphia

My dear Son [William Hayne Perry]

	Yesterday Mr. Perdicaris met us in Trenton & came down to Burlington with us.  He told us you were pretty well. but that Col. [Christopher G.] Memmingers son was not able to be out of the Abbot lecture Monday evening.  He thought however he was improving.  I hope he is well by this time & that you are all getting on well.

	I have just seen Mrs. LeConte & she says she said a good word to Professor Pirce for you & has since written him to pay attention to you as the son of her intimate friend.  She says Pirce showed her my letter to him about you, when she was in Cambridge.  I wish you to go & see Professor Pirce &T make yourself known to him.  He will be kind to you, & it will be to your advantage in entering Harvard.

	We were all very much disappointed in Burlington & Bishop Davis school.  Your mother was so much shocked at the idea of Annas staying in a room with fourteen other girls that she determined to take her back to Greenville & leave her at some other school.  Today, after seeing Mrs. LeConte she is better reconciled, & I expect Anna will stay there.  Doctor LeConte & Mrs. LeConte will go there with us tomorrow & determine about the matter.  They wish their daughter to go to school there.  We saw their daughter this morning & were pleased with her.

	Anna received several letters from home at Burlington, one from Fannie, Annie, Mary Mauldin, , Tinny Carson & others.  They seem all well.

	I have heard nothing of Frank yet.  We go to Baltimore Monday & on to Annapolis.  We bought carpeting today $450.00 worth.

	You must write me & direct your letters to Greenville.  Be sure & enter Harvard College.  Study hard whilst in College & before you enter.  Keep out of all bad company & be correct in all things.  Above all things be honorable, & scorn everything mean & less honorable.

	I write you n great haste.  Give my love to Col. Memminger & his son.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. I gave Col. Memminger $400 to place in the bank for you.

William Hayne Perry
Cambridge
