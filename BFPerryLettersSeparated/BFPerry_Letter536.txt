Letter 536
11 June 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We did not hear from you last week.  I suppose you were occupied in your examination.  Your Report came & I was glad to see you had no demerits.  Your standing was not so high as I could wish.  But I hope you have passed.

	This is the last letter I shall write you before your return.  I suppose you received the draft for $25.00.

	 We are all well.  I have taken Wiley back.  Mrs. Nance gave me $300 to do so.  I have let him go to Newberry to hire out his time.  The horse Tim is slowly improving.  Zach Mauldin lost a child yesterday.  Doctor Bell is dying or dead.  Annas monument was shipped 4 June & will cost $500.  The Letters on her death will come out this week in a book of 100 pages.  They are all beautiful.  Fannie goes to her grave every evening & covers it with flowers.  Fannie is a sweet little girl & devoted to the memory of her dear departed Sister.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
