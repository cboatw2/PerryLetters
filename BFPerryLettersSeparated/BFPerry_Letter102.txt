Letter 102
Tuesday night, 25 April 1848
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I reached here this morning and was much gratified to receive your letter.  I hope Mary may soon be able to relieve you of your charge.

	I will now give a briefof my journey thus far.  Friday the day I left home, I met Major Wright & his bride & three young ladies from Pendleton going to General Wrights.  We stopped & had some conversation.  At Major Bollings I met Mr. [S.A.] Goodman, the editor of the Laurensville Herald.  I took dinner there, rode with Goodman some distance on the road to Laurens C.H.  Went to Esquire James Cunninghams & staid all night.  Found General Thos Jones there.  Cunningham told the people were disappointed in Col. Orrs appearance, that he would have done better not to have shown himself.
