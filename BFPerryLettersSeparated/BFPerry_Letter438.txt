Letter 438
28 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday & therefore a leisure day with me.  Dr. LeConte gave me an invitation to go with him & Mrs. LeConte to church, but I declined on the ground that I had to write to you, your mother, Willie & Frank.  I also have to write for the Patriot & letters to others.

	I rece[ive]d your letter the other day addressed to me in Columbia & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother.  You do not know how much satisfaction it gives me to hear you are pleased with your school, that you have entered a high class and are diligently pursuing your studies.  I knew you would be satisfied as soon as your school commenced & you had something else to think about than home sweet home & the dear friends at home.

	The only thing that mars my happiness now is your cough.  I hope it is better.  It must be owing to some exin your throat, or may be to some piece of fishbone lodged in it.  I am sure it cannot be any defect in your lungs.  By no means have your pallate cut.  Dr. Geddings says this is altogether barbarous &.  He says that allum pounded very fine & taken on your finger & placed on the palate is much better.  You can try this remedy & watch its effect.  You must write me about your cough in your next letter.

	I have not rece[ive]d any letters from Willie addressed to me in Columbia, but one forwarded from Greenville in which he says he has not heard from you for a long time.  You had better write him again.  I rece[ive]d a letter from Frank three days since.  Her is well & doing well.  So is Willie.

       There are no ladies in Columbia yet.  The commencement is one week later this year than usual.  Mrs. Chesnut & Miss Withers were here last week & went on the Charleston I expect & will return this week.  Col. Chesnut is a prominent candidate for United States Senator in place of Judge Butler.  We have had two ballotings & no election.  Governor Hammond is ahead & Col. Pickens next.  I am for Pickens & hope he may be elected.

       Last night at the supper table Col. Carn of Walterborough told Mrs. LeConte & myself that his wife made you acquaintance here some years ago & fell in love with you that you were such a charming sweet little girl.  He said too that Mrs. Carn admired me so much that it excited his jealousy a little.

       Your mother writes you so often & tells you so much of the Greenville news that I have nothing to tell.  I suppose she has told you of the marriage of Miss Bolling, and the death of young Lattimore a student in the Furman University.

       It is rumored here that Col. Wade Hampton Jr. is to be married to Miss McDuffie during the month of December.  His first wife was a sister of Col. Prestons & a most beautiful lady.  The colonel is young & handsome & rich, amiable & gentlemanly & is a good match for Miss McDuffie smart, pretty & rich.  I hope they may get married whilst I am here & invite me to the wedding or.

       I dined with Governor Allston the other day & spent a very pleasant evening.  Mrs. Allston & his daughter will be here next week.    His son is here who was an officer in the army & a graduate of West Point.  He is a clever young man.

       We have just had a meeting of the Board of Trustees & elected Judge Longstreet President of the College.  He was once President of the Mississippi University.  He is the author of Georgia Scenes& a man of great humour & considerable literary attainments.  Mrs. LeConte is very much pleased at his election.  The other Professors were all reelected except Pelham.
       Give my love to Miss Lula & believe me your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
