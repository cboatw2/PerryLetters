Letter 4
Thursday Evening, 1 December 1842
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was disappointed in writing to you yesterday as I intended doing.  I was all day waiting in Court for one of my cases to be taken up and it was not till this morning.  I have just finished the argument in that case & have left the court for the purpose of writing to you.  I had the good fortune to try one of my cases last Tuesday.  So I have now two disposed of & six more to argue besides two in the Legislature.  I shall be detained here eight or ten days yet.

	In consequence of my rooming with Mr. [Armistead] Burt I cannot write you as conveniently ass I Could if I were alone.  We have two sets of visitors to entertain in consequence of our being together.

	Your letters were recd this morning & Ispeak of the pleasure they gave me.  I read them both whilst with Sam Earle & had the pleasure of telling him that Mrs. Earle was well &c.  Poor old George looks very natural & is cooking for Dr. Roache.  I do not know what to say about your mother buying him.  She must determine the matter for herself.  You know my plan is not to purchase an old negro.  Your mother can determine for herself & write me.

	I have been tempted to purchase for Susan one of the sweetest little gold pencil cases you  The price was seven dollars but I got it for four & one half so I have paid $4.50 & will present the gold pencil case to her.  It is substantial  & will last longer & look prettier than a silver one.  It was so beautiful I could not resist the temptation of buying it & making it a present.  If you wish I will get you one like it.  It has a ringto a chain & is beautifully carried.

	I have seen a horse & think of buying it for Will.  The price is $14.00 & I cannot get it for less but the difficulty will be in getting it home.  I do not think of going to Augusta now, as I can arrange the business I have there, by sending the money by ben Yancey who is now here & is in Augusta every day when at home.  By the by Ben Yancey says he has the prettiest specimen of female beauty he ever saw.  I doubted that I had not a prettier in little Anna.  Yancey made a very good friend the other day on the Court of Appeals.

	I am the more & more pleased not being in the Legislature & would not takenot then, now, for several hundred dollars.  I have seen so much intriguiry & electioneering this session that I am utterly disgusted with politics.  Col. [William Campbell] Preston has resigned & Mr. Calhoun intends doing so.  The Legislature will have two Senators to elect.  Great exertions are making by the Rhetts to have Barnwell Rhett elected. The friends of Judge Huger will perhaps put him in nomination.  Governor [John Peter] Richardson, Judge [John Belton] ONeal[l], Col. McWillie are all spoken of.  [George] McDuffie will be the successor of Col. Preston.  I saw Col. Preston this morning.  He looks remarkably well &  has returned to the Bar.  Judge [Andrew Pickens] Butler came to see me the other night & enquired after all of you very kindly.  In giving the Judges my briefs I gave him one that you had endorsed last Fall.  He said he would keep it on account of the writing.  Albert Rhett came twice to see Burt & myself & enquired after all of you very kindly.

	Mr. Hayne tells me he has a box for your mother but has not yet sent it to me nor have I sent the box of Susans to him.  Mrs. Taylors brother is much better.  He has Mrs. Keith with him.  Her health is bad.  He has been elected & will return to Town.  He enquired after all of you, how many children &c.  He looks badly.  I went down to the State House this morning to meet the Bible convention but it did not meet.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother &c.  B.F. Perry

I am glad to hear that the children and Servants are all behaving well & am very sorry to hear of Annas bad health again.  [sentence interlined illegible].  I saw Col. Keith who came to my room electioneering.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
