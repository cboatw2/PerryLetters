Letter 452
15 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Enclosed I send you a short letter which I wish put in the next Patriot.

	I have just read your letter &take a few minutes to write you.  Enclosed I send you five dollars as directed.

	I have heard nothing from Anna.  I suppose she has gone to Philadelphia.  I hope she will be better.

	I am glad to hear Mahaffey is hauling corn.  I was afraid he had not sold it.

	We are very quiet here now & all the ladies have gone.  Did you see or hear anything of Governor Swain.

	I suppose your remark about Mrs. Thompson is a hint to me in not pressing you to come to Columbia with me.  Nothing would have given me more pleasure than to have had you here.  But you know you declined coming on account of Arthur.  Next Fall I will visit & bring you.

	General Thompson went up Monday.  He met Mrs. Thompson before she reached Florida.

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
