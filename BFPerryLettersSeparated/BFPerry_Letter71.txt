Letter 71
The weather is so bad this morning that I shall not return home today unless there is a change.  The rain has been pouring down in torrents for the last two days.

	I have got through with my business & am anxious to be at home on many accounts, but I have too much love for my wife & children to expose myself {on] such a day as this is.  Besides I have some regard for my own comfort & health.

	I was quite unwell when I wrote you last, but am pretty much recovered now.  A ride in the rain all day might make me sick again.

	I saw Richard Harrison who informed me you were all well, which I was glad to hear but you ought to have written to me.  I did not know him when he first spoke to me.  He came up behind me at the Bar & shook hands, and I was not going to say anything moresupposing it was some young man about the village.  When he told me he had seen you, I then noticed him & recognized him and was very glad to see him.  He is a clever young man.  As he was leaving the Bar I told him to give my respects to his Bride.  He said there was no other lady in Sumter., that I ought to send some compliments to, for she was greatlywith me and had a great deal to say about our meeting at Saratoga Springs.  It was Miss Nelson, a relation of the Bradleys.

	The poor fellow I defended the other day has been convicted of murder.  I did not make a speech for him, for I know it [was] not worthwhile.  Mr. Speers & Garlington spoke in his defence.  I examined the witnesses.  They are now trying his accomplice & will convict him of murder also.  The next case is a woman for killing her child! and she will be convicted too.

	I truly regret that I shall not be able to see you & the children tonight.  Kiss them for me & tell Frank to pray for Pa to comehome.  Tell Will to keep head and Anna to learn her book so as to say her lesson to me.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
