Letter 743
10 July 1868
New York

My dear Liz

	You have by this time heard of the nomination.  I think it a good one & the nominees will be elected.  Last night there was a rattification meeting here of ten thousand citizens.  General Hampton, Governor Vance & myself addressed them.  I had made a speech the night before by invitation of the Metropolitan Club.  Everything went off well.  This evening [Horatio] Seymour makes a speech & also General [Montgomery] Blair.

	I intended to write you a long letter, but the girls have just got back safe from Niagara & driven me out of my room.  Two letters from you to Fannie have been rece[ive]d in her absence.

	I went to see Appleton & left my writings.  He is to look over them & give me an answer.  I was invited by Brady to have my likeness taken.  He has taken three different sizes but I have not seen them am tomorrow.

	I have bought afor Perry Leaphart, & a shirtfor Hext today.  Miss Simmons & Mrs. B called yesterday whilst I was out & will call tomorrow again.

	The girls are delighted with their trip but tired.  Miss Pamela wrote me to come to Mt. Vernon.  I wish to leave here Tuesday next, & get home Monday following stopping in Philadelphia & Washington.

	I have not time to write you as Mr. Grady has called to git me to go & see Col. Campbell on business.    Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tomorrow the girls go to Greenwood cemetery.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
