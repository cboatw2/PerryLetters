Letter 352
19 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have only a few moments to write you my last letter from Columbia this Session.  Tomorrow night I shall have the joy & satisfaction of meeting you & the children once more.  I wish it was tonight.  As the time approaches the more anxious I am to be at home.  There is no place to me like home sweet home, & perhaps I have more to make my home sweet than others, which is the reason of my love of home.  But I am somewhat differently constituted from other husbands & fathers, & you too are different from most wives, & we have both taken pleasure in making each other happy.

	I returned last night just before midnight from the Legislature & left the House in Session.  President McCay came to me in the morning & said Mrs. McCay desired me to go & take tea with her that evening, but I could not.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks for my notice of the DL.  So I am in good repute with both them today.

	You wrote me some time ago for money when I had not a cent.  You forgot that I started with my little in hand & had to give Willie thirty dollars to pay his expenses to Charleston & Anna ten or fifteen whilst regretting that I had no money.  Mr. Spain came up & tapped me on the shoulder & said he was authorized by Mrs. Green of Sumter to pay me fifty dollars.  I thought to myself that it was always so, good fortune attends me & money comes when I get out.  I went down into the Governors Room & he paid me for Ware sixty three dollars which I shall keep for interest on Wares note.  Presently the Clerk of the House came & brought me a check for John Watson for one hundred & twenty five dollars & Watson owes me a little.

	I dined yesterday with Col. Wag[e]ner & had a pleasant time with his mess.

	I went up to Heises to buy some taps & he made me a present of a fine silver headed walking stick.  I bought some candy, three dollars, a whip with a whistle, crackers, a knife for Frank, a cap for Willie &c.&c.

	I must now stop as the agent is about leaving Miss Hayne for me & I will pay you back the kiss tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry
