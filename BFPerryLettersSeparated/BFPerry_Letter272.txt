Letter 272
12 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line only tonight.  We have been in session al day & did not reach my Electoral Bill.  I will speak tomorrow at one oclock certain.  We adjourn at night this evening and I now I have to meet the Board of Trustees in fifteen minutes.  Willie has gone to the circus.  Anna wished to go also.  I would not let her.

	You may have heard of some difficulty with [William R.] Taber.  It is all over.  My friends would not let me accept the challenge & it is all over.  General Thompson can tell you all about it.  But I will write you fully tomorrow if I have time.  But it is all over & settled & most happily for me.

	I am now compel[l]ed to quit.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
