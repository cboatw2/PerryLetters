Letter 539
9 October 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	 We have heard nothing from you since we left you in Washington.  You must write to us regularly once or twice a week.  Your mother & Willie both wrote you last week & I suppose told you all the news of Greenville & our safe arrival at home.

 	We are all well & found all going on well on our return home.  Alfred is lame.  He went after a cow the other day & sprained his ankle but otherwise well.

	There is a [word obscured] of a great many engagements between the young people here but how true I know not.  It is said Sue Hoke & Donaldson are to be married shortly.  Spartan Goodlett and Sally Crook are said to be engaged.  Sease Butler & & AustinGeorgia Townes & another AustinMary Early & Blocker of EdgefieldRobert Dav daughter & Harris a studentAnna Green & Davis of Beaufort are to be married shortly her mother told me yesterday.  Several other engagements which I do not remember at present.

	I saw Doctor Irvine yesterday.  Pinckney is very much dissatisfied & wishes to return home.  His father says he may come back in December at the end of his quarter.

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & will be absent all the week. Your mother & Fannie have been very busy for several days past in planting rose bushes and other flowers around the enclosure of dear Anna and they will make it a lovely spot as it should be.--the resting place of one so sweet & lovelysnatched from life early.

	You must tell the students from South Carolina that I am sorry I did not get to see them.  I should have been glad too to have seen Harper whose father I knew well in my boyhood.

	Hext is going to school.  Hayne & Arthur are playing about.  Willie is studying hard & does well in my office.  He helps me fill up Writs & other papers & I find him of great convenience to me.

	I hope my dear son that you will study hard & behave wellhave no demerits & take a high stand in your class.  If you could only feel & realize the interest your father & mother take in your success in life I am sure you would try to realize our fond hopes.

	  May God bless you &you & make you a consolation to your Parents & anto your profession is the prayer of your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
