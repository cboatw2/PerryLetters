Letter 678

Greenville

My dear Liz

	I will write you before breakfast Monday morning as I may not have time after breakfast.

	Hext reached here about four oclock just before a hard rain.  He looks like a wet dog & he will go up tomorrow.  Your mother says Susan is not going.  He can carry Alice & Annie.  Dont let the Barouche come down again until the corn is finished.  Tell Alfred he must clean out the whole of the corn if it takes him to September.  None of it must be given up to weeds & grass.

	Whilst working the horses they must be fed with corn.  When the Barouche comes down I will send up corn for bread.

	The people of the country are gloomy indeed.  I regard as gone.  Charleston will fall in a few days.  They are fighting there now.  The Batteries were attacked on Friday.  Two were silenced.  The news tonight..the fall of the City.  Lee has had to fall back into Maryland.  Hampton and nine other Generals are wounded & three more killed.  The slaughter is terrible but we have no particulars.  They foughtdays.  I will send you the papers which come tonight.

	I am very busy.  I find that I get $ as appraiser for every day since my appointment.  The pay continues as long as I am appraiser.  Next Wednesday I get $... a day as commission on Petigrus case for four or five weeks.  I shall work somethingday in my office.  The Court  of Equity is over & I did well in my business.  I am doing well amidst all of our troubles & bad things.

	No more papers can be purchased in theso you must be careful of the papers sent you.  I will send you money by Hext to buy& anything you.

	Tell Ward I can do nothing for his mother as I wrote him some weeks ago.  Tell Bill Fisher there is a man hereup all distilleries & if he does nothe will be caught.

	Scott is making the fence but has notto finish it.

	If I have time I will write you tonight.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry
