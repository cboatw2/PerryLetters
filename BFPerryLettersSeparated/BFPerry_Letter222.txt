Letter 222
22 February 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I recd two letters from you this morning & in one of them you mention the horrible circumstance about Col. [Thomas Edwin] Ware killing his father in law Adam Jones.  It has shocked me so that I am unfit for anything.  It is the most horrible & unexpected event, which could well have happened.  I thought Col Ware one of the coolest & most self possessed men I ever saw.  Col. Hoke sent me Col. Wares letter.  I am sorry I am not at home to comply with his request.  I hope however he will succeed in getting bail, & that he will also succeed in justifying himself before his country.

	Your letters seem to be filled up with offences & horrors.  I am sorry you permit these things to occupy so much of your thoughts.  If you were now situated as poor Mr. Burt is in poverty & a probability of your property being sold you might feel anxiety about yourself & the children.  But we are comfortable with a competency about us & in the enjoyment of health, & I doubt exceedingly if I could make any change that would not be disastrous in some way or other.  Let well enough alone.  I have a pretty certain income of $2,000, a good house to live in, servants enough, & a healthy climate with schools for our children.

	I received a note from President Fillmore last night requesting me to dine with him on Thursday next.  Neither General Thompson nor Mr. Burt are invited.  I shall go & have so written to him.

	Last night I attended the consultation of the council in the Gardiner case in the law office of Bradl[e]y & Carli[s]ledid not get off till twelve oclock in the night.  Then we all. Bradly, Carlile, Dr. Gardiner, General Thompson, Brady Jr & myself, went to an oyster House & took supper.  I did not get to my room till after one oclock.  We went on the whole case.  Thompson told me that Dr. Gardiner was very much taken with my appearance & was now anxious to have me as one of his counsel.  It is doubtful when the case will come on for trial.

	Mr. [Charles Magill] Conrad Secretary of War called to see General Thompson this morning & I had the pleasure of his acquaintance & conversation for some time.  Governor Aiken & Mr. Clingman called to see us this morning.  I have been down to the House this morning & made the acquaintance of a great many members.  They all knew me perfectly well.

	You can give the check to Mr. Elford & let him get the money & pay off Dr. Irwin as soon as he returns.  I have written to P. H that I cannot take less  I have not yet seen Mrs. Blake but will attend to your bag before I leave here.

	I have not much to write you today & Thompson & Burt are in my room talking & they confuse me.  Thompson recd a letter from home this morning.  You have written me four & his wife one to him.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
