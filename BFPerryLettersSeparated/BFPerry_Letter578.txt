Letter 578
16 April 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the Convention & it is 11 oclock in the night.  Col. Orr was elected President.  I made the motion to call the Convention to order & have Col. Wilson Chairman & Col. Buist Secretary.  We had some speaking & I joined in.  It is understood that I am to be one of the State delegates but I may be mistaken.

	I got my boots &c. & your letter by Duncan.  I submitted Resolutions this evening as to Platform &c.  I saw Col OHanlon who enquired after you & children.  Governor Adams is getting well!  I was truly sorry to hear of Baylis [Earles] death.  He is safe in heaven if anyone ever went there.  He was as good a man as I ever knew & tell Becky so.  I have seen a great many friends today.  Col. Johnson, Hampton, Wilson &c. &c.  Greenville is fully represented by.

	We meet in the morning at ten & will adjourn.  Col. Orr made a grand speech on taking the chair.

	I shall go to Charleston Wednesday with Duncan & others.

	Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
