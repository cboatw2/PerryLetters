Letter 165
Tuesday evening

       General Whitner beat Col. Dawkins twenty votes & is Judge.  Wardlaw beat DeSaussure & Haynsworth a great ways & is Chancellor.  Burt is ahead for Secretary of State.

       Middleton made a disunion speech today & so did Keith of Orangeburg.

       Col. Hampton invited me to dine with him tomorrow at five oclock.

       I see a great many persons here from the upper country.  Choice, Rowland, Jno. Jones, the three Townes, Col. McNeely.

       Tell Susan Hoke I have sent to Charleston for her music.

       I hope to hear from you tonight.  I wish you were here.  I would very willingly exchange Willie & Frank for you.  The next session this must be the case.  There are a great many wives here with their husbands.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry
