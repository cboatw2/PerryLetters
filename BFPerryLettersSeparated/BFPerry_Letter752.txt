Letter 752
22 December 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I do not wish a fence put up when Jack has been hauling rails.  Stop it.  I want a fence built along the horse lot fence so as to keep hogs in the horse lot & out of Hayne & Bens wheat.  Do nothing more till I come out.

	I send you two letters from Hext & his likeness.  Hayne went to the wedding last night at Col. Irvines & did not get back till two oclock.  He went in a wagon with John Marshal,  & other boys.  I am not willing for Ben to go to Trescotts.  The expense & weather preclude his going.  The thermometer this morning was 23.

	I paid Mrs. Smith $2.10 cts for socks & gloves &c.  I bought 7 lbs butter yesterday of a man named Smith & paid 10 ctshim.  Let Tom go on cutting wood this cold weather.  We shall need it for Christmas.  Willie will be at home tonight.  I dont like being alone at all.  We are getting on very well however.  It will be hard to get Eggs now & chickens also.

	I am glad George is gone & hope he has everything taken off.  Let Tom move into his house.  You must have a bed made for Jack here and one for Henry out there & filled with straw.  The weather is too cold for them to be without bedding.  Jack is in wrags & you ought to supply him with clothes at once.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry
