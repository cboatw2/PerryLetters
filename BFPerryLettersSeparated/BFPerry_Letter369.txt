Letter 369
24 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening written Sunday.  I was glad to hear from you.  But really your Bill astonishes me.  If the Bonnets & dresses were for summer or you and Anna were going to Columbia it would be all right.  But nobody will see either Bonnett or dress & next summer they will be thrown aside.  Willies chair was unnecessary at this time.  But you know what is done is over with me & I never receive to it like you.  I shall not have money enough to pay the Bill & pay Willies college expences.  I am now sorry I did not bring my money with me.  You can borrow a check from Mr. Cox for $130.00 and I will pay interest till I return.  But perhaps the better plan is for me to send you the keys & let you get $130 out of the Beaureau.  I will send the keys by Mr. Wells or would ina check payable to your aunt give her name to Cox & send him the money.  It will cost fifty cents.

	I have just written a long letter to the Patriot & have not time to write you anymore.  The correspondent of the Carolinian speaks in high terms of my speech.  All who have read it speak in high terms of it.

	I am glad Willie got back safe & that you are all well.

	I dont know what to say about Franks coming down.  If he comes he must come in his present clothesdont purchase any for him.  We have spent money enough for the present.  I think he had better stay & come down towards the close of the session.  But if he wishes let him come & stay till after commencement.

	In haste your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
