Letter 523
3 April 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Our Court adjourned last night & Judge Whitner has ordered an Extra court if two weeks for Greenville on the 19th of July.  This will prevent my going north this summer unless I go in May.  But it will be the means of seeing more of you when you come home.

	We rece[ive]d your letter as usual last week.  We all looking forward with great pleasure to your visit in June.

	Your mother has just rece[ive]d some rings, chains and breast pins made out of the hair of your dear sister & intends a pin for you.  She has likewise had several likenesses of poor Anna taken to give her friends.

	My dear son you must study to be religious & wise [&] never do anything wrong.

	Cox & Gower have got the Jail full of Incendiaries Oberly & wife, Parker, Smith, & Wisen have been arrested.  Parker confesses that Oberly gave him three ten dollar Bills to burn up the Steam mill!  How horribly bad some men are!

	We are all well.  I have to go to Spartanburgh court this week.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
