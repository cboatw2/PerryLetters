Letter 373
28 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College & it is almost twelve oclock in the night so I can only write you a line.

	We have elected young Robert Barnwell a Professor in the College in place of Dr. Lieber.  A Brother of Professor LeConte in place of Dr. Brumby.

	I go down with Col. Moses to Sumter Saturday evening.  General McGowan, Yeadon & others are also going.  We may not return till Monday morning.  Col. Ashmore says he has telegraphed the people of Sumter & there will be a crowd to see me & will have to make a speech.

	I have not time to write you further except that you letter was rece[ive]d this evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
