Letter 26
Tuesday night, [14 October 1845]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have sat down to thank you for your very acceptable letter this evening by Dr. Palmer.  It  contains a great deal of news & gave me great satisfaction.  When from home I am always anxious to know how you & the children are doing & nothing gives me more pleasure than such information.

	I had the pleasure as you requested in your letter of being polite to Mrs. Palmer.  I had her invited to sit with the Judge & lawyers.  She sat next to me at the table & we had considerable talk.  The Dr. seemed quite sociable also.  Mrs. Palmer told of yours & your mothers cake &c.  The company is all gone from the Mansion House.  I am in court & did not see the Middletons as they passed down on the stage.

	Judge [Edward] Frost came up in the stage, & lost between Newberry & this place his trunk with all of his clothes & $150.00 in cash.  The trunk dropped off the stage.  He sent back for it, but can hear nothing of it.  Someone has picked it up & appropriated it leaving the Judge without a clean shirt & nothing but a very shabby suit of clothes, on his back.  I lent him my razor & offered him a shirt, but he procured one from the store & has a shirt washed every day.  He says he will make Capt. Ward pay for his loss.  The straps of the leather boot containing his trunk were not buckled.  He is a very pleasant agreeable gentleman & a pretty good Judge.

	I recd a short letter from Miss Pamela this morning with a package of books from her Greenville subscribers and amongst them is Mrs. Poinsett.  You say Mrs. P is not a subscriber.  I have a book for her anyhow.  Pamela writes from Abbeville C.H., is still very feeble, sends her love to you  & the children, and requests you to copy from my C Journal all the corrections she made with a few into the copies sent her, Greenville, wishes.  The Indictment against me canfor whipping young Bowen is going on & will be tried next Court.

	I recd a letter today from Sam Earle on the subject of the Rail Road &c.  The people do not seem to take much interest in the matter here.  They are all absorbed in the Com[mittee] meetings &c.

	None of my cases here have been tried yet & I shall be here all the week.  General [Waddy] Thompson told me as we came down that Butler & Miss Jones were going to be married..  He said it was not what could be called an advantageous match, but it was one he could not object to.

	I have exchanged my gold chain for another one.  It broke, & I found all the links were& worn out.  I have a very beautiful one in exchange, something like yours & I gave $4 for boot.  I hope you have recd & taken care of my plows & straw cutter.  As President of the agricultural society I shall have the honor of introducing the first such soil plan in Greenville District & also the first plan for other description.  I bought them of Robe to use & show at the agricultural meetings.  F Robe has made a present of a valuable book on agricultural chemistry by Johnston.  [sentence interlined, illegible].

	Tell the servants to gather the peas & clear as much as possible before I get home.  Thank Will for his letter.  General Thompson saw himon Saturday & says he is a born  Democrat.  Tell Anna & Frank howdy & kiss them all.  Miss Crawfords expression is in character & next time let her invitation be delayed still longer.  The news from Col. Hoke is good.  I am grateful to you for your letter.  Good night near ten oclock.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
