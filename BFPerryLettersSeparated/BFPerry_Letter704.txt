Letter 704
22 September 1865
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I have not heard from you but once.  You might write oftener.  I have no time to write.  From early morn till late at night I am engaged.  I have not had time to pay a single visit.

	The Convention is going on slowly. I do not know when they will adjourn.  Willie made a little speech last night on the representation of the negro in the Legislature.  But the comp[romise was not adopted & he will now vote against the negro representation again as he has been doing with all of his colleagues except Bolling who voted with the lower country on this subject.

	The weather is now pleasant.  We have had very warm weather.  I have very pleasant rooms & a large parlor where I recei[ve] my company.

	Mr. Henry Heyward called with his application for a pardon & enquired after all of you as old friends.  You will see I have appointed my aidsW.L. Trenholm, General Stephen Elliott, Wade Hampton, Jr., Lieutenant Governor R[obert] F. McCaw of York & General Harrison of Anderson.

	I have appointed Trescott as agent to represent the State at Washington.

	I must now close & go to breakfast.  Willie made ten dollars in cash yesterday taking charge of an application for pardon.  The members get five dollars a day.  Board is four dollars.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
