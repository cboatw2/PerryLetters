Letter 88
1 December 1847
Columbia

My dear Son

	I have just been to the Post office & recei[ve]d your letter & also one from your mother.  I was very much pleased to hear from you all & learn that you were all well & doing well.

	It gives me great pleasure to receive a letter from you & you write so well too that it makes me feel proud of you.  I suppose however your mother helps you a little in dictating the letter.  But it is written remarkably well & if you go on improving fast you will soon write a better hand than I do.  I showed your letter to General Thompson & Mr. Duncan but did not let them read it.

	I wish my dear son that you were with me.  In travelling you are great company for me & I like to have you with me in my room & hear you ask questions.  I love you so much & am so proud of you that I should like always to have you with me.

	Colonel Summer enquires about you very often & says he is sorry he has no dog to send you.  The free dog he brought with him from the north he has given to Colonel Leitner of Spartanburgh.

	 I will bring you the presents you desire when I return.  Tell your mother I will bring hers also, & say to her that I was very glad to receive her letter.  I put one in the Post office for her this evening.  You ought to have recd your letter one mail sooner.  I sent Edward with it about daylight to the Post office, but I suppose the mail had been made up.

	Tell your mother that nothing has occur[r]ed today or I would have written to her again.  It is rumored that Judge Richardson is to be impeached.  They have given him till Saturday to resign, & if he does not resign by that time articles of impeachment will be proferred against him.  I am truly sorry for the old man.

	Next Monday is commencement in College when all the boys make speeches before the Legislature, Judges, Trustees, Ladies & people generally.  It would give me great pleasure to have you in College & sit & listen to your speech.  This pleasure I hope one day to enjoy.  You must make haste & prepare yourself & when you are in College you must study hard & take the first honor.  I believe Judge Frosts son takes the first honor this Winter.

	But my dear son the first object of my heart is that you should be a good boy & grow up an honorable and correct mannever do anything wrong or behave badly.  I must now close this letter & send it to the Post office by Edward.  Kiss Anna, Frank & Fanny for me.  Edward says I must tell you all howdy & say he likes Columbia very much.

	Kiss your mother for me & tell her I will write by the next mail if I have time.  I have made arrangements to  send off about 300 copies of my Report on the Mexican War.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
