Letter 430
22 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, which you must read before you read this.

	I have just come up from dinner where I saw Dr. & Mrs. LeConte.  They invited me to their table & I had a great deal of talk about Burlington, Anna & Tulula.  Mrs. LeConte says that her daughter & Anna are bosom friends & that Tulula writes her she loves Anna Perry, that she & Anna & a girl from Florida & one from Virginia are always together.  She says during Christmas holidays her sister is going to have Tulula, Anna & one or two others to spend a few days with her in Philadelphia & that she can ensure Anna a pleasant time.  It will be necessary to write Mrs. LeConte to give her permission.  She says Tulula writes her, she never saw a girl get so many letters as Anna Perry does, that she rece[ive]d twenty five in one week. Whilst she (Telula, poor girl) rece[ive]d only one.  It seems that the girls are delighted to receive letters.

	In relation to Annas cough Mrs. LeConte says Dr. Gantt told her it was not consumption but only an affectation of the throat.  Mrs. LeConte says however it is very bad & that Anna did not look so well as she did in Philadelphia.  I told her about Miss Brockmans cough.  Dr. LeConte said he knew a man who was affected in the same way with a cough for forty years.  There was a lodgement of ain the wind pipe & the flesh grew over it.  Finally it broke loose & he coughed it up.  Mr. Farrow who was sitting at the table said Mr. Bail[e]y had a similar cough three years & finally coughed up a bone or something & his cough ceased.  You had better write these things to Anna and let her tell Dr. Gantt.  But it seems nothing can be done.  Nature works out her own cure.  But the cough is not dangerous though troublesome.

	Mrs. LeConte is not so fat as she was & therefore looks better.  She & Dr. LeConte invited me to go to church with them this evening, but I said I had letters to write & could not go.

	I have nothing more to write you except I have a nice room in the new wing of the Hotel with two beds all to myself.  I have a good fire place & plenty of good dry wood & therefore quite comfortable.

	Hamlin Beattie came up to get my certificate of his moral character & course of study just before dinner.

	I will now write to Anna & Willie.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
