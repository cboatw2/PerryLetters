Letter 16
Sunday night, [24 November 1844]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight, as I shall not have an opportunity of doing so, tomorrow before the mail closes.  I sat down to write you a letter two hours since, but persons have been calling at my room ever since, and I now will have time only to write you a very hurried epistle.

	You have no doubt heard of the death of Mr.Hayne.  I was told of his paralysis b Col. Bee who came down with us in the stage from Greenville.  Mr. Henry L. Pinckney informed me tonight that he was dead.  He died yesterday evening.  Mr. Pinckney said it was fortunate that he died as his mind was entirely gone.  His is a sad calamity to his family & to your mother.  It will not become necessary for someone else to take charge of your mothers Bonds &c.  Col., Isaac Hayne was in Charleston in time to see his father die.  You no doubt heard all the particulars.

	Mr. Pinckney informed me that Miss Hayne was married but he said nothing further about the match.

	We had a very pleasant ride down here in the stage[Thomas Edwin] Ware, [Tandy] Walker, [Perry Emory] Duncan, Col. Bee, Mr. Young, Moore & Lester.  We ate up all of your cakes &c and your praises were highly sounded as a good wife in providing for us &c.  The stage broke down with us about ten miles from Columbia.  But we mended it with poles & came on.  In jumping out of the stage I hurt Col. [Barnard] Bee in the breasthe was in great pain for a while but is better.  The Col. apologized for not calling to see us &c.  I found him quite a pleasant gentleman.  We talked a great deal & about a great variety of things and amongst other things his relationship to you &c.

	I have got a fine room at Maybins & Ware, Duncan & Walker have another one all together.  The house is greatly improved & I am to keep the room as cozy as I wish it.

	It is thought that [William] Aiken will be Governor.

  	I have met a great many of my old friends.  They all seem glad that I am in the Senate.  Mr. [Simeon]Pope & Col. Fair have said that the gentlemen will consider me as in some manner their representative no matter in what district they reside.

	I hope to hear from you Wednesday night & hear you are all well.  I hope the children are well & that you have had no more scares [page torn] too easily frightened.  Kiss the children for me.  What about the [page torn] light procession?

	Mr. Samuel Earle has just been in my room.  He thinks the whole affair foolish.  His election I think pretty certain.

	I must now bid you good night.  God bless you.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
