Letter 341
4 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written Sunday & was glad to hear you were all well.

	This was commencement day & the girls have been very much pleased with the show.  Walker Adams & Willie went with them. To the College.  I had to go with the Trustees.  I think both Susan & Anna have enjoyed themselves very much.  We have [a] great crowd of ladies here.

	Tomorrow I will probably make a speech on the Judiciary Bill.

	 You ought to have a letter from me the night Anna left.

	I have not seen Col. OHanlon since I wrote you.  I expect it is better for Frank to stay at Home nor do I suppose [page faded]my power to return him before the session ends.

	Willie & Anna will go to Charleston Wednesday morning. Col. Dargan had a good deal of chat with Anna in the college.

	Tomorrow night I shall be at the college to elect a President & will not have time to write you so you need not expect a letter.

	After Anna & Willie have gone I will write you.

	I must now conclude.  Kiss Fanny & Hext & Hayne for me.  Tell Frank to be a good boy.

	Col. Irby has come back & I shall sleep with him, & Willie with Mr. McBee till Anna & Susan leave here.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Tell Mr. Elford to send the Patriot to Mr. Whal[e]y of Charleston [page faded]he subscribed on seeing it.  Dr. Mdid the same but I haveabout Whal[e]y.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
