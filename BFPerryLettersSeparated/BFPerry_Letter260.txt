Letter 260
My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter of Friday this morning and thank you kindly for it.  I am in such confusion here & so much to attend to, and so many of my friends to me that I have not time to write as I did in Washington.  I have just written two sheets for the Patriot.  I know you are willing for write for the Patriot although it may interfere with writing to you.

	Yesterday Anna William & myself dined with Judge Henry & his children.  It was a very pleasant party. The children looked well.  Today we dine with Col. Arthur P. Hayne.  Yeadon wishes me to dine with him before I leave.  Wednesday we dine with Mr. Robinson who carried me to his house & put his carriage at my service.  He has been very kind.  Mr. Spratt editor of the Standard has invited me to take tea at his house tomorrow evening.

	This morning when I went downstairs Col. Pickens told me it was announced in the Standard that I had called at that office & was staying at the Mills House if anyone wish[ed] to see me to go there & ask for the finest looking gentleman in the House & I would be seen.  You will see the compliment in this mornings Mondays Standard.  This mornings Courier also notices my arrival & compliments me.  Coil. Pickens & his daughters are here & will remain till next week.

	I have done all Annas shopping.  She has gone to see Mrs. W.Hayne this morning & your aunt Mary McCall.  Willie has gone to Sullivans Island with Pierce Williamson.  I am to go with Judge Henry to the College at twelve oclock.  Yesterday I saw Mr. Petigru at church & at Judge Henry.

	I have concluded to stay till after Wednesday & perhaps Thursday.  You will see me in Greenville Saturday night.  I went to church yesterday with Col. Arthur Hayne and saw Mrs. Hayne.

	I must now conclude.  I am glad you & the children are enjoying yourselves.  I wish you were with me.  It is more pleasant for us to visit town together.  There you will be in a different circle from your friends.  My friends and your relations are distinctive.  When we are together we see them both.  Next spring we will go down together.  I saw General Martin on Saturday & one of his little sons.

	God bless you & Hext & Fanny & Frank.  Willie & Anna behave remarkably well like a young gentleman & Lady.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
