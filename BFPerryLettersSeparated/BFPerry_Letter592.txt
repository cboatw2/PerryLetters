Letter 592
28 November 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d both your letters written yesterday.  I do not think there is any danger of smallpox.  I shall appear before the committee tonight on Barretts case & may return home tomorrow.  But I write for fear I shall not.

	I went down to the House today & all met me with great cordiality.  General McGowan says no man in the States stands higher in the estimation of all gentlemen than I do now.  Simpson told me that he had heard several say that if [I] was a secessionist I would be their candidate for governor.  Senator McCain [McKewn?] told me he heard five senators express the same idea   & that he was willing to vote for me anyhow.

	I saw General Martin & Col. Isaac Hayne.  They came up & spoke to me most cordially.

	I was invited by Col. Allen to dine with him today but declined.

       I have nothing more to write as I hope to get off in the morning.  But if I do not come you need not be uneasy about the smallpox.

       I sent up your packet from Cook by Willie.  Yeadon is gloomy & fears secession will do mischief.

       There is great division about Governorten or fifteen candidates.  I suggested Robert Barnwell & also that they should have a caucus & nominate him.  It took well & I believe they will do it.

       Col. OHanlon has just left me z& desired to be remembered to you and children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
