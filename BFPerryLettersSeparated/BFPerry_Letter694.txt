Letter 694
Tuesday nght, [1864]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have been engaged tonight with Lake & Gray in settling their accounts.  The Legislature is in session but I did not go down to the House.  Hext tells me that Dickson Irvine & his sister are here & going up in the morning.  I will send this letter by them.  Fannie Irvine is sick.  Hext is going in the morning to see H  & will go down  to Col. [James]  OHanlons at twelve oclock.  The Col. will have to come back Friday to court.  I shall go home Thursday if nothing happens to detain me in the Legislature.  Lake paid me $90.00 for fees & says under the late act of Congress there will be due me $800 more.  I suppose about as much.   Sitton, DeSaussure, Connor & Miles & myself have a consultation in the morning about our fees.  I have got Tuppers interest due your mother $157.50cts.  My pockets are full of money.  I hope to be with you Thursday night & therefore will close my letter.  Col. Ware returned this evening.  But brought no news from Greenville.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
