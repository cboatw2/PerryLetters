Letter 363
10 May 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to write you that I have got through with my cases in court & Dealers vsof the College & but for my promise to the Governor could return home this morning.

	Chancellor Wardlaw & Aldrich & Boylston go with mew to the Governors & will return Monday morning.  We shall no doubt have a pleasant trip.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last evening & should like very much to get the one which will arrive here this evening and which you say shall be a long one.  But I shall not have the pleasure of reading it till Monday morning.  You can write me by Mondays mail again.

	I wish to see you & the children very much & regret that I cannot go home this morning.

	Tell Willie that I got the Rifles & accoutrements yesterday & they will start on the Rail Road in boxes Monday morning directed to me.  They will reach Greenville Tuesday evening.

	I am with great love & affection, your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
