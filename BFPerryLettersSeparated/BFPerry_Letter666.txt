Letter 666
3 August 1863
Greenville
My dear Liz

	I kept Hext here today to have Bil shoad & haul wood.  Bill was very much fatigued too.

	I have just recd your letter by Moss.  I could not understand your letter by Hext about the colt.  But since have seen it & will take it.  But Moss says he has sold it to OShields.  Pace may decide who shall have the colt, me or OShields.  He is a pretty good horse, but the haze in the face..his looks very much.  I dont think I can sell Bill for anything.  He is worn out.  Let Hext bring Charley down with him.  I will not drive Bill or Monarch again.

	I will go up next Sunday if Hext & Hayne come down on Saturday.

	Judge [Andrew Gordon] Magrath did not come & we have no court.  I recd $260 from J Sitton for fees incases.  I am receiving a little every day from ten to $20.

	I send you Willies letters.  There is no news.  I saw Col. Butler yesterday.  He looks cheerful & is doing well.

	General Thompson says he spoke in high terms of Willie.  Says he was cool in battle & cares nothing for applaudes.   Said he behave[d] very gallantly in attacking a Regiment with eight men.  Col. Butler came in his carriage this morning to get The Home Guards men by.  I loaned it to him as your. He enquired about you very kindly.

	Mrs. Dr. Parker made me a visit Saturday about selling her lot in Charleston for $20,000 to [George A.] Trenholm.

	I will send you the newspeprs.  Charleston is not yet taken.  But will be I fear in the course of time.

	I may write you again by Hext.  I wish I could go up with him.  But tomorrow I have business with Captain G.  Your affec[tionate] Husband, B.F. Perry
