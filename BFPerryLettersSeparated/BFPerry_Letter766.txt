Letter 766
5 September 1876
Greenville

My dear Liz

	On reaching the village this morning I rece[ive]d your letter & postal cards also one from Fannie.  They were very welcome & I thank you for them.  I have but a moment to write you.  My office has been full all the morning--great preparations to receive Hampton & hear speeches Thursday.  Everything in confusion.  Tell Willie I have rece[ive]d a pack of letters this morning, which he will have to come home & answer.  I cannot.

	Taylor paid me $60.00 this morning on your note.  Good newsMiss Fuller writes me to send Perkins interest but he has not paid it.

	Hope to hear from you tomorrow about the Centennial Exposition.  My love to all.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
