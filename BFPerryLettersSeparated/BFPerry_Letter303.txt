Letter 303
5 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening, just as I was starting to meet a joint committee on the State House.  It is now near eleven oclock, & I have just returned.  Willie & Frank went outto hear Pickens speech tonight in the College.  I could not go.  I was anxious to hear him.

	Today I was employed all day in the court of appeals the case of Croft & Tobler.  Tomorrow I shall likewise be in court & perhaps all the week.  I am afraid I shall not be able to go up to Greenville next Saturday.  I cannot teel the result of Crofts case.

	I have nothing new to write you.  I am glad to hear you are well [several lines interlined, illegible].

	Willie & Frank are behaving very well.  Good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
