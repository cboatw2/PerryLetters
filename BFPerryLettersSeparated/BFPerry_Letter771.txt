Letter 771
28 September 1876
Greenville

My dear Son

	I suppose your mother & Fannie will have gone to New York before this letter reaches Philadelphia.  I therefore write you and you may write them.  I do not know their address in New York.

	I received a letter this morning from Mrs. Keith asking me to take charge of her lovely daughter & carry her with me to the Centennial when I go for your mother & then leave her at school in Virginia.  I have written to Mrs. Keith that I should not go for your mother; but that if she went, or her daughter went under the charge of someone else, you would take great pleasure in showing them the Exposition &c.

	I received yesterday a letter from Mrs. Lizzie R. Smith requesting me to write her a letter for publication in the New Haven Register explaining the Hamburg riots & the condition of South Carolina &c.  Mrs. Smith is the mother of the young ladies you saw at the Arsenal in Philadelphia.

	You must write me on the receipt of this what your mother & Fannie intend doinghow long they will stay in New York & when they will return homewhether they will stop in Philadelphia.

	Ben has employed a young man from Georgia named Barrett to assist him about the gin &c.  He is a very intelligent well educated fellow & appears to do well.  He said his father died some years since & left him some property & he has spent it.

	The prospect of electing Hampton is growing better every day.  A great many negroes will vote for him.  I have written an Editorial for Bailey in reply to the Philadelphia Press criticism of my Walhalla speech.  It is pretty severe.  My speech at Honea Path will be published in the Enterprise this week or the first of next.

	We are all well.  Henry complains of his head hurting him & wishes you to tell him what to do.  He received a blow on the head from a horse.  Your aff[ectionate] Father, B.F. Perry
