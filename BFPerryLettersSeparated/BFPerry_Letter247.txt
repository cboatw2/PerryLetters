Letter 247
17 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I am so much occupied night & day with Dr. Gardiner, his counsel & his case that I have no time to write you.  I am afraid too that his case will result badly.  The testimony yesterday was very strong against him.  We are all alarmed for the first time.  Gardiner seems less alarmed than his counsel General.  Thompson feels very much the weight of the testimony.

	I read a long letter from you yesterday informing me that Cox, Will & Jenkins will had been sustained.  This is good news.  I am glad my letters are in demand.  They are so here.

	I have had a dreadful cold & my hands have all pealed over again.  The cool fires are very bad.  The room is too much heated at night.

	I Am almost crazy to leave Washington & get back to you & the childrenmy home & my comforts.  It has been near five weeks since I left home.  There is no telling when the case will be ended.

	I am not sorry that I have taken the trip for I have really seen a great deal & become known to a great many & I hope it will be of service to me hereafter.  But I am now through with all that & wish to be at home again.

	You must request Col. Townes & Mr. Elford to attend to all my matters at Greenville or on the circuit.  I shall be at home before Greenville court if I have to quit here in the midst of my speech.

	I am sorry to hear that my old friend Col. Dunkin is sinking.  I hope he may live till I return home & see him once more.

	The Senate is still in session.  But I have been nowhere except to the court House.  Mr. May the principal counsel for the Testates has shown me great politeness & attention.  He is an able & most eloquent advocate.  Thompson tells me that there is great public expectation to hear me speak & that I have already produced a very decided impression on the Court & crowd.

	I rece[ive]d lst night a letter of encouragement from Col. B.F. Heard of Charlestonalso a letter from Dr. Gibbes of Columbia about my letters in the Patriot.

	Write to me every day & tell me all the news you have. Give my love to your mother & Susan & Anne & all our dear children.  Tell them I hope to see them improved very much when I return.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
