Letter 777
30 August 1882
Lexington, Ky.

Dear Father

	I reached here without any accident or delay on Monday afternoon.  The Fair is going on and I will remain until it is over.  After that I have not yet determined whether I will stay to the Paris Fair which comes on next week or not.  I received a telegram from Hext, saying he hoped I would return via Philadelphia.  I do not think it likely that I will do so.  I have got out of the notion of buying stock.  Mules and horses are higher here than they are at home.  I saw a pair of mules at the Fair which the owner had paid $650 for, and expected to sell at a profit.  They were rather too high for me.  I have not priced any saddle horses, but they say a stylish saddle horse is worth or will sell for $400.00 or $500.00.  If I can find any at fair prices I may buy a saddle horse and two or three mules.  Tolbert a Kentuckian who trades to South Carolina offers to ship any I may buy, with his.  I will write you towards the end of the week, and let you know my probable movements.  I am well and hearty, happy and wtented and hope you are the same.  Yours &c., W.H. Perry
