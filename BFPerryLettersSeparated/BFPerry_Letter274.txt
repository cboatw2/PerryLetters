Letter 274
14 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am writing to you before breakfast.  Mr. Duncan & Willie have dressed & gone down.  Anna still has my room with Miss Waistcot [Westcoat] a very nice young lady hardly grown & the daughter of a member [Jabez J.R. Westcoat] from Edisto Island.  There was no room for Anna & Miss Waistcoat was in a room with her father.  I shall remain in Duncans room till the end of the session.

	Just after sending my letters to the Post office last night, I rece[ive]d yours of Monday.  You must get money from the merchants or Mr. Hoke.  Mr. Grady will pay all of your Bills till I return.  I have paid a debt in Newberry of $78.00 & to Redwood of 180 which hasme of my funds.  You were entirely too quick in sending for our dollars Bills &c.

	Col. Preston has sent me a bundle of rose cuttings.  There is some mystery about it.  I thought it was intended for one of the other Perrys, & they have remained in my room till they are almost dead.  I sent them out this morning to have them buried & if alive when I go up I will take them.  They are all labelled.  After writing to you I went to the State House & did not get off till 10 oclock in the night.  We discussed & lost the Electoral Bill at that hour.  But it will come up again.

	Anna & Miss Waistcot are going to the Asylum this morning in company with several others.  Willie will go with them.  I have just been down to breakfast.  Anna tells me that Mrs. Taylor, Mrs. Isaac Hayne & Miss Hayne were in the gallery yesterday when I spoke on the Electoral Bill.  They bowed to her, but did not get in speaking distance.

	I am still receiving the congratulations of my friends for the bold & just stance I took  in refusing Tabers challenge.  I am glad you are pleased with the Allstons, & I am truly glad they are going to reside in Greenville.

	I must now quit & go down.  John Jones has just been in the room & says he is going up in the morning.

	I have rece[ive]d a long letter from Col. Orr & a communication from Judge Evans.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
