Letter 609
25 June 1861
Camp Hampton

Dear Papa

	I write you today merely to let you know that I arrived here safely yesterday.  The talk now is that we will certainly leave here this week.  Col. Johnson said there would not be a man here by Sunday.  The four companies will leave here tomorrow I expect, and we will leave here by Saturday next.

	There is nothing new to write you.  They had a little fuss in Camp during my absence about going to Church on Sunday in Columbia which the Captain wanted done.  A good many would not go, and did not go, and the captain had finally to apologise and back down.  The horses are doing tolerably well.   The feed is still scanty.  We are now formed into messes of ten.  I will write you again before leaving.  Your Son, W.H. Perry
