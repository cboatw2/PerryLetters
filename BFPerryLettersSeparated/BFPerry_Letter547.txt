Letter 547
2 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recei[ve]d your letter this evening & will write you a few lines enclosing Col. Ashmores letter which I know will gratify you.

	Today after writing you I went to the Court House with Mr. Petigru & concluded the argument in the case of Stokes & Sullivan.  Chancellor Wardlaw expressed himself in my favor & Chancellor Johnston expressed doubts.  Chancellor Dunkin said nothing.  Mr. Petigru made a pretty good speech, but nothing remarkable.  There is not so much in great men as their reputation gives them.

	When I got through the Court I went to the Legislature & introduced a set of resolutions which produced quite a sensation in the House.  They took the members so much by surprise that I was applauded.  My Resolutions are very strong & you will probably see them in the papers.    Copies of them were in great demand by the Editors & Reporters.

	I have paid Mr. Bryant $28.85cts your Bill & I suppose it right.  But how come it so much more than the Bill sent you.

	Mr. Stokes goes up in the morning & so does Price.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

P.S.  [James Parsons] Carroll is elected Chancellor.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
