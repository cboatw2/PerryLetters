Letter 99
Friday night, [1847]
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Col. Townes, who returns to Greenville in the morning.  I shall probably be at home Thursday evening.

 	In the way of my election I am doing as well as I could almost wish at the home of my opponent.  I am much stronger in Anderson than I had any idea of being.  From all parts of the district I have favourable news which I will tell you when I return.  In Pickens too I have the most flattering accounts.  Indeed I should not be surprised if I beat Orr in Pendleton election district.  Colonels Sloan & Taylor members of the Legislature, living near old Pendleton go for me & the Maxwells & Earles also.

	I took tea last night at Elias Earles, the brother in law of Mrs. Mays & spent a pleasant evening.    Today I made a speech on the Wilmot Proviso which took well & has been much complimented.

	I have recd of Vandiver eighty five dollars, my fee in Carsons case  I was employed by Cooley in a case yesterday but business is very scarce.

	It is now late in the night & I must go to bed.  Kiss the children for me.

	The Judge is pretty well.  The rail road engineers are here on their way to Greenville.

	Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  I have written & sent to Mr. Wells an obituary notice of Lt. Rodgers as Mrs. Butler requested.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
