Letter 122
Monday night, [1848]
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening, as I understand Mr. Elford will return in the morning.  And I shall pursue the same course you did in your first letter to me rece[iv]ed this evening, that is give you a journal of my activities & doings since writing you last week.

	I came to Pendleton Wednesday evening & stopped with Hubbard.  Several gentlemen called to see me, & amongst others William Hayne, who invited me to Mr. Sharpes.  Sharpe was not at home.  I went round the next morning & saw Francis & the children.  The two first or eldest are fine looking children.  The third is not so good looking.

	William Hayne called to consult me as a lawyer in regard to his situation.  I was two hours in conversation with him.  My impression is he is going to marry Miss Sharpe.  I judge so from his conversation & from what I heard.

	Francis sent your mother some beautiful presents & some for Susan & Anne & perhaps you.  They are in my trunk & I have not examined them particularly.

	Mrs. Hubbard & daughter enquired a great deal about you.  In the morning I went to Burts & saw Mrs. Burtspent an hour very pleasantly with him, & he rode back to the village with me.  I crossed the river at John Maxwells & stopped a few minutes.  He was there all alone with his overseer.  He drank some of my brandy & invited me to eat the meanest sort of a dinner or wait till he could have a better cooked.  I declined both.

	Thence I went to Browns store & there heard the most flattering news about my prospects.  Thence to Fair Play.  Reeder told me I would not loose more than fifteen votes at that Box.  Thence to Josiahs where I spent a sad time.  He is a mere skeleton & unable to leave home.  I went in sorrow & deep grief to the graves of my father & mother & so much affected was I that I shed tears all the morning.  Thence to Bachelors Retreat where I saw Verner & family and others & heard the most flattering news of my prospects.  I stopped at a great many houses on the road.  Came to Mrs. Duboses, who was extremely glad to see me.  I delivered your letter & went on to see her Brothers & thence to Fosters, where I staid all night.    My vote in that region is almost unanimous.  Fosters family were all well.  One of Josiahs children had the measles.

	Saturday morning I went to muster at West Union & saw a great many people, where it was said Orr would beat me.  But that is a great mistake.  Some of my friends seemed astonished at my great excellence in electioneering.  Today I have seen a great many persons & find everything going well in Pickens.  I shall be at a long way in that neighborhood where Orr thinks he will get all the votes from the fact that they all voted for General Garvin.  Burt told me that he passed through that neighborhood the other day & found there to his great surprise all for me.  It is an old union neighborhood.

	Mrs. Col. Calhoun & Miss Martha have been electioneering for me strongly.  Mrs. Calhoun told one of her tenants that he might continue another year provided he would vote for me.  Miss Martha says publicly that it will be a disgrace to the district if Orr does beat me.

	I have been employed in several cases in court.  I may not return till the last of the week.  I send both of your letters & thank you for your advice.

	Tell Will that Trace is well & the tenor of the country.  South says he will take good care of him.  It is late & I have been interrupted by a good many. yours truly, B.F. Perry
