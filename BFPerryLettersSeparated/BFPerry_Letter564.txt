Letter 564
25 December 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night & from what you say I am afraid you will not be allowed to visit Washington.

	Your letter to me in Columbia was rece[ive]d the morning after I wrote you.  Since my return home I have seen your Report, & I hope you will continue to rise in your class & go on improving.

	We are all well.  This is Christmas day & very dull and cold.

	You spoke of receiving a beautiful letter from Miss Pamela Cunningham your god mother.  You must write her in reply & give our love to her.  If the letter was to you individually, send it to us to read.

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from Col. Ashmore last week.  I also recei[ve]d a very long letter from Col. Pickens our Minister to Russia.  He says he feels apprehensions for the South since hearing about the Harpers Ferry invasion. I hope all will pass over & we shall have no disunion or civil war.

	Col. Memminger has been appointed a minister from South Carolina to Virginia to express our sympathy &c.  The Legislature adjourned Thursday, but I came off before several days.

	Hext goes up to General Thompsons tomorrow to spend Christmas.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
