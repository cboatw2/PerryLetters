Letter 557
13 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The Bell has just rung for supper, but I will write you a few lines in time for the morning mail.  I wrote you this morning before breakfast.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was surprised to hear you had not rece[ive]d the Books.  I saw Mr. Wells who told me he sent them to you!  How is it?  He goes up Wednesday& enquire about them.

	Dr. Fair invited me to dine with him tomorrow which invitation I have accepted.  Col. Allen invited me to dine with him this evening but I declined as I had promised Mrs. LeConte to take an oyster supper with her & her brother Joseph & his wife & others in her parlor.

	 Today we had an interesting discussion in the House on selling free negroes for crime.  I gave Col. Memminger a little.  He told me at dinner he had never seen me look so savage as I did.  Mrs. LeConte said I was greatly exited.  I did not think so.

	I argued the case of Dickey & Barrett today in the Court of appeals.  Tomorrow my other case will go on & then I shall be ready to go home if the Blue Ridge & separate court are not passed.  Both Bills are coming up again.

	I will now close & go to supper.  You tell all your friends there is no danger of abolitionists, or war or disunion.  I fear the people will make fools of themselves in Greenville.  Mr. McBees stock only entitle[s] his sons to go down to the Rail Road convention free.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
