Letter 530
8 May 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night and was sorry to hear you say that you sometimes wished to resign.  Dont think of such a thing again.  You have a most enviable position & do not give it up for the world.  Study hard & behave well & determine to be a distinguished Naval officer.

	You must never again sign any more papers, or enter into any combination with the students to restate the laws of your school.  Be obedient in all things.

	The tarring & feathering was a disgrace to all concerned.  If a student misbehaves let the teacher correct him.

	Enclosed I send you $20.00 which you wrote for in your last letter.  You did not say what you wanted it for.  I suppose to buy clothes.

	You must write me in your next letter when you will start home & how much money you will want to bring you home.

	We are all well.  Fannie & Annie are still in Charleston & will return with Mr. Arthur next Saturday.  They have been enjoying themselves very much in Charleston.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Willie last night.  He says Harvard is very dull & lonesome to him.

	My horse Tim has got well again & I shall send for him in a few days.  This is good news for as you say, he is a noble horse.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
