Letter 516
13 February 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your mother recei[ve]d a letter from you last night, & we are very anxious to receive your next letter.  We hope [to] learn that you will not again prove deficient in your standing.

	Uncle Robert Foster died Saturday morning last in his eightieth year.  I have just written an obituary notice which you will see in the next Patriot.

	We are all well.  Willie will return the first of March.  I will send you by him a parcel of Books which you must read & take care of & return to me.  Your mother will send you some clothing &c.  I will send you my likeness in a frame as you desired in your last letter.

	It may be that Willie will have to send your trunk down to Annapolis, without stopping to see you, as he will be in company with Memminger & not have time tis topo to se you.

	I hope my dear Son you will study hard & be a good boy.  Your sisters death has made a serious impression om all of us & I hope it will on you.  Prepare to meet her in Heaven as she requested.

	We have recei[ve]d a great many pretty letters from her friends which I am going to have printed in a pamphlet with her funeral Sermon & will send you one of them.

	Fannie goes every day to Annas grave & spreads flowers on it as she requested.  Her friends do so likewise.  She has been greatly mourned by the entire community.

	Willie recei[ve]d a beautiful letter from the Chaplain at Harvard on her death.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
