Letter 397
11 June 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to write you a line before breakfast.  Last night I was at the College till midnight.  We had a very full Board of Trustees & they are unanimous in the belief that President McCay has been slandered & wronged.  There is a decided disposition to make all the Professors resign.  Nothing yet has been done although we had two meetings yesterday.

	Willie will return with me.  I am done with sending my sons to this College.  The Students will all be dismissed this evening I expect by the Board of Trustees.  I shall send Willie to Harvard college.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning.  I enquired at the Post office & was told nothing for me.

	Old Mr. & Mrs. Pinckney are here & enquired about you & their daughter M.  Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly about you & expressed great admiration for you.  She repeated that of all the ladies she had met in Columbia you were her favorite.  She is very much excited about the College difficulties & takes a warm part for McCay.  She gave me a talk of two hours the night I arrived here in explanation & vindication of McCay.  I never saw a lady more excited.  She says that when she is a friend is in distress she then shares her friends strife.

	Mr. Arthur went to Abbeville with me.  My case was not reached.  I shall not go back to Abbeville if I can avoid it.  The Hotel is shocking.  I have never seen hotter weather.

	I have a great deal to write you but really not time to say more at present.  I told Willie to write you last evening.  I reached here Tuesday evening.

	Have the Barouche for me & Willie At the depot Friday evening.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
