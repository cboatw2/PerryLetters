Letter 206
Friday night, [10 December 1852]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter this morning, and will now add a few lines more.  Mr. Butler leaves in the morning & will carry my letters.

	After writing to you this morning, President Thornwell delivered a most eloquent address at the laying of the cornerstone of the new Chapel before both Houses.  I introduced a resolution to publish it.

	We have elected H[osea] J[efferson] Dean of Spartanburgh the clerk of the House in the place of  Col. [Thomas Worth] Glover.  I claim some credit for having elected him.  He got no votes but Greenville & Spartanburgh the first ballot.  He fell a long ways behind & we still voted for him.

 	Nothing has been done in the Legislature this day, but ballot for clerk.  The weather is very bad & raining very hard.  Mrs. Brooks & her daughter left yesterday & went thirteen miles & had to return.  They left this morning & the day has not been much better.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne this evening.  He told me that he saw Anna last Sunday & she was enjoying herself very much.  He went down on Saturday & returned Monday.

	Mr. Duncan has promised to carry me up in his carriage.  It will leave home Wednesday morning & stay at B.F. Mauldins or Ackers that night & the next morning get to the rail road by twelve oclock.  We expect to reach Donalds in Abbeville Thursday about that time & then come to Col. Wares that night.  You may expect us home Friday evening.  Anna can stay in Charleston & come up with Mrs. Elford.  This is my present arrangement.  This will prevent the necessity of sending Reuben & the carriage after me.  Instead of coming through Laurens we shall go up by Cokesbury in Abbeville to Donalds the head of the road.

	In connection with the rail road, let me tell you that Col. Brown the Engineer died having made use of $8,000 of the Rail Road money.  This accounts for the style in which he & his wife lived.  How few persons are perfectly honest!

	I must now conclude, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
