My dear Daughter

	This is Sunday morning, & the weather is so unlikely that we shall not go to church.  Willie & Frank have gone to the Presbyterian church.  Your mother read this morningis resting on the bed & has directed me to write you a letter.  I have nothing my dear daughter to write except that we have had a very pleasant time in Columbia.  There has been a great crowd of ladies here, but they have all gone.

	President McCay and his wife came to see us yesterday & invited us to take tea with them tomorrow evening.  Your mother however declines going.  Susan Hayne came to see your mother & took her to Col. Taylors.  Mrs. Taylor is in delicate healthdines with them Friday.

	Willie is looking very well & stands thirteen in a class of sixty five.  Considering he is the youngest boy in his class I think he has done well.  But he is not on& does nothimself in studying.

	Anna Ware & two of her companionshere Friday.  Col. Ware was here.  Anna looks well & seems pleased with her school.

	I am sorry to hear of the decision in your May day celebration.  You ought to have written to us.  I hope your oranges were rece[ive]d in time for supper.  Your mother will return home Wednesday evening & you must direct Wiley to be there with the Barouche to take her from the depot. I shall have to remain a day or two longer.

	The Society all seemed kind & enquired kindly about you.  Frank & Fannie & Hext & all enjoying themselves very much.  Arthur does well & has given very little trouble.

	Col. OHanlon came to see us & invited Hext to go & stay with him.  He seems as kind as ever.

	We had greeted a number of girls here from Greenville, Abbeville & Newberry.  Col. Fairs daughter is about as tall as her mother.

	Willie says he saw Augustus Townes Bride as she passed this wayand was pleased with her.

	Tell your aunt Susan that your mother rece[ive]d her letter & thanks her kindly for it.
