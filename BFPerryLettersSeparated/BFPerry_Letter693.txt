Letter 693
19 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just got the& the Inauguration.  Fannie & Maggie came with Mrs. Johnson & I reserved the seats of myself, Boyce & Price for them.  But Miss G,  Johnston & Fannie occupied the seats.  There never was such abefore.  The Ladies rushed in the House & occupied the whole House.  The gallery was full & the lobby.  It was all new to Fannie, & she seemed to enjoy it.  Mrs. LeConte took Col. Dawkins seat.  Lula did not come.

	I have just applied to the Governor to appoint Willie one of his aid[e]s.  This will take him out of the army & give him the title of colonel.  I hope the governor will appoint him.  I [would] rather have this appointment for Willie than that of Judge for myself.

	I have just received a most cordial letter from [William Gilnore] Simms.  He says that he will use his influence witrh the President to have me appointed in Magraths place.  He says Col. Orr has got a majority of the South Carolina delegation in Congress to sign my application.  Senator Hill of Georgia has been written to by Mr. Boyce to use his influence with the President.  Mr. Simms says his whole family send their love to you & all my familysay Simms has been at the point of death but is well again.

	I shall be at home Thursday night.  Send John with the little carriage to the depot.  I hope to hear from you tonight.  Col. Wares case comes up at 5 oclock.  So I must now close my letter.

	Fannie comes here in the morning & will go up to Dr. Crofts with me Thursday.    Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I dine with Mr. Johnson tomorrow in company with the Governor & other notables. B.F.P.
