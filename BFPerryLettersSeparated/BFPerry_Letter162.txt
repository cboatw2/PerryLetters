Letter 162
27 November 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Willie brought me your letter from the Bar room last night about eight oclock & said he is a letter from mother.  Frank immediately professed that I should read it aloud, so that he & Will might hear what you had written.  I did so & they listened with great interest.  They were both reading books which Mr. Duncan had purchased for them.  Frank does not make such rapid progress in his, as Willie has done.  I had to purchase another for Will, & told Frank I would do the same for him, when he had read his through.

	I am not writing to you by candle light in my night gown & cap & day is breaking.  Willie & Frank are still asleep.  I make my own fire every morning.  Jim furnishes wood over night.  There is no trouble in kindling a fire with lightwood.

	Yesterday I saw Col. OHanlon & he gave me an invitation to visit him in the country & says he will send for me & a few others some day during the Session.  He is as warm & as firm as ever.  I met Col. Hayne in the streets yesterday.  He seemed very kind & sociable & enquired after you & your mother, Susan 7 Anne.  Mr. [W.B.] Carli[s]le the editor of the Columbia Telegraph came to me yesterday & invited me to an entertainment to be given by the Press of Columbia to all the persons in any way connected with the Press in South Carolina.  Whilst sitting in Col. Fairs room after my return from the State House, Col. Manning came in & invited us to take a glass of brandy in his room.  There were a good many persons, & Major Cant[e]y remarked that I grew younger someone replied that I brought my sons down with me to let the people know that I was a married man.  Dr. Goodwin replied that they were worth showing.

	I must, however, tell you that I had just sizzed myself off, in the way of clothes at ashop & was dressed very genteellyso much so that Burt enquired where I had got those fine clothes.  In purchasing them, Frank enquired if I had money enough to pay for them all &of his own accord offered his quarter of a dollar to help pay if I was short of funds.  The little fellow pulled it out in the store & made the tender.  My clothes have cost me $58.00.  Frank cost oversack coat, pants, hat, boots & cravat.

	Col. [Christopher William] Dudley, senator from the Peedee country, came to my seat in the House of Representatives yesterday and said he wanted to put me in nomination for Chancellor that he differed with me in politics, but nevertheless preferred me to Wardlaw or DeSaussure.   Memminger is not a candidate.  I told him it was out of the question to suppose the legislature would elect me.  He thought differently, & said that although they differed with me in politics, they had great respect for me &c &c.  He left me & said he intended to feel about & see what the prospect was.

	The Governors Message was read yesterday.  It goes for secession.  As soon as it was read Col Memminger & said we were about commencing a revolution & a change of our Government & it was proper to appeal to God for assistance.  He proposed [a] day of fasting &c.  Col. Jno. Preston & J[acob] P[inckney] Reed made more speeches in favor of the resolution.  It occurred to me that South Carolina would need assistance from Heaven in a contest with the Federal government and I thought it was well enough for some of them to have prayers said for them.  Judge Cheves was present & looks very well.  The Georgia elections are all going in favor of the union & this fact is not relished at all in South Carolina.
	I do not know that I mentioned to you in my last letter that Mr. Fulk indulged in a great deal of abuse of Dr. Simmons & said he had behaved badly, & that no one would send to him again.  I am glad Pickerel is so correct in his notions.  Cox is a union man, but is disposed to be prudent.    So are thousands in our state.  Judge Cheves speech is the most extravagant disunion argument I ever read.  The Legislature has ordered thousands of copies to be printed for distribution.  I met him today.  He did not recognize me at first.  When I mentioned my name, he said I had grown much stouter.  I said I had not had the pleasure of seeing him for several years.  He replied that it has been twelve years.  I saw you the last time, at Greenville, on my way to the Virginia Springs.    He then enquired after you & said you were the relation of his dear friend General Hayne who would any day have died for him.

	Col. Dudley had written a long communication announcing my name for the Chancery Bench.  He showed it to me this morning & I objected to its publication.  I know full well that I could not be elected, & did not wish to have the public attention directed to me sinceassociated with depot.

	The Board of Trustees met last night & elected Col. Preston President of the College.  He looks pretty well & he is much improved in health.  I voted for [Fitzhugh] McMaster as Librarian & not Rivers.  McMaster was elected.  Rivers got only 3 votes.  Judge Butler is  He asked my motive for bringing the boys.  I said I brought Willie for my companion & Frank for Willies.  He said it was a great improvement to them and mentioned a son of General McQueens who was a companion for his father always having travelled with him.  I saw Mr. Petigru last night.  I bought the spoons for $5.00very nice ones.

	The Georgia elections have cast a damper on the Legislature.  I told Col. OHanlon how you had rece[ive]d his letter.  Wenext Landry with him.    My love to all.  Tell your mother Mr. Ford enquired after her & claims kin.  He is a candidate for assessor.   B.F. Perry
