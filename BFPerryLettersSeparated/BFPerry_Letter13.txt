Letter 13
[15 October 1844]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d several statements today which satisfy me that I have been elected by a handsome majority.  I hope your fears are now put to rest.

	I shall be at home Friday morning.  And I propose to give our wine party Saturday night.  Can you make the necessary preparations?  Send & get two or three large hams & two large turkeys & some fowls & have some bread baked in preparation.  You may also have pound cakes prepared &c.  The supper may be set in the Piazzathe wine in the dining room.  You will have to borrow wine glasses, tumblers & bottles.  If you can make all these arrangements do so.

	I wish every voter in the village invited.  This can be done perhaps after I return.  The invitations may be extended informally through friends.  Saturday will be the day of the agricultural Fair & I can invite persons from the country.  You must propose to entertain at least one hundred persons.

	If you see people you can request Col. Hoke, Major Jones, Mr. Lister, Mr. Wells and any others to invite the village as they may send them wordinvite every voter in the village and others from the country.  Sam Earle, Elias Earle, Waddle, Poinsett, Dr. Butler &c, Brooks, Williams &c.

	We can make quite a display of cake & wine on the tables in the dining room and have the cold meat & bread & coffee out in the piazza.

	But my dear wife if you think it will give you too much trouble I will have the wine alone & nothing else.

	I think the party had better be on Saturday evening.

	I am truly sorry that Col. Town[e]s is not elected.

	In the district Simpson will beat 500 votes. Col. Fair is elected.

	Yours trulygood night & kiss the children, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
