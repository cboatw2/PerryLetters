Letter 729
18 February 1866
Washington

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning enclosing Fannies & H.  I began to think I should not hear from you.  I gave me great pleasure to receive a line from you.

	I shall try & leave here Tuesday morning & reach home Thursday or Friday.  I went to see the President yesterday but there was such a crowd I had very little conversation.  He said he would try & see me before I left.  I met Mrs. Senator Clay of Alabama at the White House and spent an hour with her whilst waiting to see the President.  Her husband is confined a prisoner at Fortreess Monroe.  She is one of the most intellectual women I ever met, a noble lady & devoted wife.  She seemed pleased when I introduced myself to her & told me all her history & troubles & trials.  We took seats in one corner of the room & had quite a tete a tete for an hour.  She is with all very fine looking.  The President gave her a package & she smiled as if her whole soul was radiant with joy.  I hope it was the release of her noble husband.

	I went with Trescott one evening last week to call on Mr. [Lafayette] Foster President of the Senate & spent a delightful evening with him & his wife.  He is from Connecticut & we talked of New Haven and all your friernds there.  Mrs. Foster is a smart good looking yankee lady & very pleasant but very different from a Southern lady.

	I went to see Sallie Martin & her aunt Mrs. Bostick & was pleased with them.  Sallie says she is homesick & was so glad to see me.

	This Hotel is magnificent & the fare most superior.  But the ladies all ugly.  Elford has written an article for the Columbia Phoenix in which Mrs. King & myself figure at the Presidents Service.

	My article in the Intelligencer is greatly praised & admired.  My Photograph is a failure.  I may try again tomorrow.

	I think I mentioned my interviews with General Butler, Wilson, Randall Hunt, Governor Sharkey, Parsons & M in my last letter.

	The President thinks we will git our seats soon.  He is going to veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill & this will be a bombshell in the ranks of the Republicans.

	Hodges called to see me this morning, & Geddes and Trescott & Young.  Elford will not be able to return with me.  I have got all the pardons under way & he will wait & bring them.

	I bought a new wig making.  The Frenchman is working on it today (Sunday).  He said if he did not go to Heaven it would be my fault.

        I have only been to the Capitol once.  The crowd of negroes, & the speeches are disgusting.

       I have purchased a parcel of garden seeds.  I am glad you have commenced with your garden & getting on well.

       The weather has been extremely cold but I dont feel it at all in the Hotel.  It is now raining.  The Tennessee & Arkansas members of Congress are to be admitted this week.    Genl Lee is here but I have not seen him.  Your affec[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
