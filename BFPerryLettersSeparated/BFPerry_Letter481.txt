Letter 481
2 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I Have just taken dinner & smoked a cigar, & will now write you a letter.

	I did no go to church this morning, but spent the day very pleasantly in conversation with Mr. Woodward, formerly a member of Congress, General Thompson, Col. Summer, Col. Owens & Col. W.C. Preston & Judge Longstreet for a short time.  I may not have spent the day piously as if I had gone to church, but certainly more agreeably.

	I saw Mr. Janney & his daughter last night & they and all the, & my friends made a great [many] inquiries about Annas health.  Tell her she ought to feel kind[ly] toward everybody when all manifest so much interest in her.  Mr. Janney promised to send out to get some strawberries for her  today.  If he succeeds, I will send them up in the morning by the conductor Mr. Isaacs.  Mr. Janney offered some preserved peaches, & I see oranges & bananas & will send some in the morning.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are both in Baltimore.  I suppose they will be at home before I leave here.  General Thompson & Miss Jones came down with me.  We met on the cars Mr. B on his way to the Governors.  We had a pleasant time & reached here half after two oclock.

	Young Buist came to see me this morning & said he had learnt wisdom by experience.  He had nothing to do in the rebellion.  Young Moore and Knotts & Whitner are here applying for admission to the Bar.

	In conversation this morning Woodward & Summer said I looked & my appearance & face & person reminded them of Col. Benton, and Woodward then added that he did not wish to flatter me, but that Col. Benton was the finest& most imposing man in his appearance he had ever met.  I relate their compliments for your gratification, knowing how much you value such thinks.

	I was leased with Judge Longstreet.  But he is extremely ugly.  He said he was always, when a boy, said to be the ugliest fellow in the world, and General Thompson replied he had held his own remarkably well.  He & Thompson were old acquaintances.

	As we came down we met the longest train I ever saw on the Greenville Road going up filled with theholders & their wives & daughters.  There are no ladies here now except one or two.

	Col Pickens was disappointed in sailing for Europe and has returned home, but will go back to New York shortly.  Governor Allston will be here in the morning.  General Quitman Keitt & Bonham tomorrow evening.  Col. Watts enquired kindly after you & Anna.  The Judges did not come down yesterday & I suppose we shall have no court tomorrow.  If I had known this I might have staid at home till Monday morning.

	I hope you & the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.  I hope Anna is still improving & that Arthur & Hext are well.  The weather is very hot today.

	I will write to Willie & Frank this evening.  I will send you the Greyson Letters a pretty book which I purchased yesterday full of humor & wisdom.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
