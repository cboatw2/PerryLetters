Letter 573
4 March 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your letter telling us about your demerits gave us great mortification.  That you should be so regardless of the rules of the academy is very surprising.  Your demerits were owing to your idleness & carelessness.  Why do you have visitors, when you know it is against the rules?  Your idleness is the cause of your low standing in your class.  How much better would it be to study hard & stand as you say Walker & Bacot will.  Have you no friends, no ambition, no love of distinction?  You ought to try & stand at the head of your class.  You can behave well, that is certain, if you will try.

	I hope my dear son you will make up the next month for your deficiency during the past.  Let your next Report be a good one.  Remember the interest we all feel in you.  Remember how all of your acquaintances here enquire after you.  Remember how much interest Col. Orr & Col. Ashmore have taken in you.  You were improving & dont fall back again.

	Willie returned last Monday & succeeded in getting the negroes he went after.  He is pleased with his trip.

	I start on the circuit next week & will be constantly employed till summer.

	We are all well.  There was the cry of fire last night.  A shop of Lynn Watsons was burnt.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
