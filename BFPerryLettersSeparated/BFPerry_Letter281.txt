Letter 281
12 April 1854
Charleston

My dear Liz

	I have just come up from the dinner table and it is dark.  I have to take supper with Mr. Brown, & then go to the Ball.  We has a very pleasant evening.  I have written a long letter to the Patriot.  Col. Isaac Hayne, Col. Orr, Dr. Dickson & many others were to dine with us.  They all came.

	I have just recc[ive]d your letters & was glad to hear from you.  In passing down street this morning Mr. Yeadon purchased the prettiest sugar dish I ever saw for a present to you.  Yesterday I was trying to get a large gold pen & Col. Allan of Barnwell presented me with his, which is the finest I ever saw, & has his name engraved on it.  I have noticed it very handsomely in the Patriot.

	I sawPinckney last night.  He told me that Mrs. P had written you about the  Mr. William Elliott his uncle told me that he saw me in the convention & enquired who I was  in so complimentary a manner that he would not repeat it.

	It is not at all probable that I shall take my part in the proceedings of the convention.  It is thought best to let the gentlemen from the other states speak.  The whole affair is a humbug.  We had speeches today from Dawson of Georgia, Pike of, Maury of the navy & General Cowles.

	I will settle Dr. Geddings Bill.  Dr. Dickson enquired after you.  I will tell Yeadon as to your message about naming the child.

	After writing the above I went to Brown to supper & then to the Ball.  The Ball was a magnificent affair but not a great many ladies present.  I staid till supper & then left.  It was not very pleasant to me but I spent my time in talking with the gentlemen & saw Miss Polly Thompson there but did not speak except to bow to her as she passed along.

	I must now stop & go to breakfast.  How is the little Boy.  I wish to see him very much.  I hope you & the children are all well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
