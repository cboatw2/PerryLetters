Letter 485
6 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have done well today.  The Court of Errors sat & the case of Tate & McCallister was argued.  After dinner I went to the college & the Board dispatched all their business.

	Memminger & Petigru came up last night.  As I came from the college this evening Tom Long came up & spoke to me very cordially.  He & Hawthorn & their wives are here.  I bowed to them at the supper table as they passed by me & I promisedto call up & see them.

	I did not go down to the college tonight to hear the boys speak as I am very sleepy & will go to bed.  There are no bow at this time in Columbia.  I hope you have rece[ive]d the strawberries &jelly & apples.

	I am glad to hear that Col. Ware has paid some money.  This will help.  I wish McCullough had paid that would have helped more.

	I have worked hard today all day & dined with Governor Allston, & now I am really tired & will go to bed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
