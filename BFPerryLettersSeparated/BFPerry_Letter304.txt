Letter 304
6 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have today had to attend the Judiciary committee, the court, the Legislature, again the committee, & last a caucus, from which I have just returned near twelve oclock in the night.  You must therefore expect nothing but a line.

	Yesterday I argued the Croft case.  Today I have been in the Greenville academy case.

	I saw Col. OHanlon & he will carry Willie & Frank down to say castle tomorrow & they will stay two or three days with him.  They will not return Saturday.

	I dine with Col. John Preston tomorrow & have the invitation being sent yesterday I suppose there will be a large & magnificent party.

	I was glad to receive your letter this evening.  Easl[e]y came down also this evening.

	I saw General martin this morning who said Mrs. Martin had rece[ive]d a long & very interesting  letter from you on the death of poor Luther McBee.

	I saw Col. Hayne also today & spoke to him for the second time since I have been here.

	There was a great parade here this evening & Frank was very much pleased.

	I must now bid you good night by assuring you that you are mistaken in supposing that your love for me is greater than mine for you.  Seldom has a husband loved his wife as I have.  But these things will not do to write about.  When we meet we will talk about them.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
