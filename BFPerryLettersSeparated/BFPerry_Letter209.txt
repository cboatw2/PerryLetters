Letter 209
13 December 1852
Columbia

My dear daughter

	I was glad to hear from you last evening & to hear that you & all of your friends in Charleston were well.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mama yesterday & they were all well.  She wrote a great deal about you & said she was affected to tears, on reading your aunt Elizas letter giving an account of you.

	It will not be in my power to go to Charleston before I return home.  I suppose the Legislature will adjourn Wednesday, though we may sit till Friday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford will take charge of you and bring you home.  If you want any more money write to me & I will send it to you, or Mr. Elford will let you have it.

	Mr. Trimmier & his family passed through here the other day.  I did not see any of the ladies as they went to another Hotel.  Mr, Janneys House was full.

	The Governor is inaugurated today & there will be a large concourse of ladies & gentlemen to hear his speech.  I wish you were here to witness the ceremonies & see the crowd.

	I have not got the key of the carpet bag.  I left it at home.

	You must remember me to all your friends in Charleston & say to them that I should be very glad to see them.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
Charleston
