Letter 768
19 September 1876
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I received two letters from you this morning written before the letter I rece[ive]d from you yesterday.  I have written you almost every day since you left, & some times twice a day, & I am surprised to hear you say, you had only rece[ive]d four letters from me!

	I may go to Honea Path tomorrow to attend their great meeting, but it is uncertain.  I have written a speech for the occasion.  I hope you received my speech delivered at Walhalla.  Your centennial letter has not yet been published.  I will send you a copy when it is.

	You need be under no apprehension about any disturbance in South Carolina.  The Democratic party are gaining strength every day.  Judge Cook has come over.  Corbin will not vote for all the Radical ticket.  Earle says he will vote for Conner for attorney General & for General [Johnson] Hagood as Comptroller General.  He feels hurt at negro [Robert Brown] Elliott beating him.  The negroes in the lower country have fallen out with Chamberlain & say they will vote for Hampton.  I begin to think Hampton will be elected and I am certain of Tildens election.

	You need not worry about Ben selling brick.  I wish he could.  He is going on burning another kiln & is making an engagement with Williams for 200,000 next summer.  He has brick on the brain.  The stable will not be built till next year.  As to our House we must consider well the expense before we begin.  I am not in a condition to advance any money.  Willie has none & I cant.  Think you have much at your command.

	Miss Fuller has written twice about Perkins money but he has not paid the interest.  Barnwell Rhett is dead.  Died in Louisiana at his son in laws.  Ramon Pearson died here Saturday last.  The yellow fever is raging in Savannah.  Thirty deaths a day.  Dont go to New York or let Fannie or Mr. Beattie go.  The yellow fever is there & scared Donaldson off.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry
