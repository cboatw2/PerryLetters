Letter 508
20 December 1858
Greenville SC

My dear Son

	I enclose twenty dollars to pay your expenses to Washington if you can get permission to go on to see Col. Orr & General Hammond.  If you do not go you must take care of the money & buy with it any clothing you may need.

	We returned home last night with Anna.  She stood the trip better than we expected & seems pretty well today.  She rested well last night.  We are all well except Alfred.  The children are all as hearty as little pigs.  Poor old Charles is dead.  He had been sick such a long time at Mr. Deans.  Mrs. Thomas Roberts died last week.

	I wish to see you very much, but I am not afraid I shall not be able to go on to Annapolis this winter.

	I am glad you are getting higher in your studies, but sorry to see so many demerits the last month.  Try & behave well & study hard.

	I am writing in a great hurry.  I saw your uncle Col. Arthur P. Hayne in Columbia.  He enquired about you & spoke in high terms of you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
