Letter 231
3 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d no letters from you yesterday, but I hope to get one this morning.

	Yesterday in looking into a jewellers shop I saw the most beautiful tea set I ever laid my eyes on.  It was the prettiest pattern & just opened.  Tea pot, coffee pot, sugar dish, cream pot &bowlSilver.  I enquired the price & was told forty dollars only so I thought it would be a handsome present to bting you & purchased it.  It is in factware & outwardly silver.  No human being can tell it from silver.  The ware is nowsilver entirely.  I am sure you will be pleased with the set.  I think such a purchase a very judicious one for all time to come.

	There was nothing doing yesterday & I have nothing to write about & in fact have no leisure to write, as someone is always in my room.

	I think it probable I shall leave here for home by the way of Baltimore Sunday morning.  This will enable me to get home Wednesday or Thursday.  The trial of Gardiner will not take place for some time
& I cannot stay for it & in fact have not been employed in it regularly.  I have heard nothing more of Thompsons Indian case.  He has kept me here waiting about that.  But after all a tolerable practice at home is far better than any practice abroad.

	The Inauguration will take place tomorrow & I shall see the crowd, but do not expect to see anything else.  President Pierce has gone to Baltimore to meet Mrs. Pierce & will not return before this evening.

	I am delighted at the idea of returning home & meeting once more my dear wife & children.  I have seen a great deal by coming here & [am] amply compensated for my trip.  In great haste, yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
