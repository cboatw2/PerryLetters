Letter 492
5 June 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter wishing some money to purchase curiosities with when you get to Cadiz.  Enclosed I send you a draft for Fifty dollars which you can get the money for at the Bank or of some merchant in Annapolis.  Take care that your money is not stolen from you.

	I am glad to hear you are safe.  But dont be too certain & relax in your studies.  Study hard all the time.  You dont know my dear Son how much pleasure it gives me to hear of your success in your studies.  You ought to study hard for the gratification of your Father & Mother.

	You must write me when you expect to start on your voiage & the places you expect to visit.

	We are all well except Anna & she is improving very fast.

	Your mother will write you all the news in her next letter.

	In climbing the masts you must be very careful or you may fall & break your neck.

	What a pleasant trip you will have to Cadiz & have much to talk about when you return!

	Willie enters the senior class in August next.  He is getting on very well.

	John does very well as a hustler & coachman.  His horses look better than when Wiley was here.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
