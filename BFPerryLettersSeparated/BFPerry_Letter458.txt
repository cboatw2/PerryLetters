Letter 458
27 December [18]57
Harvard College

Dear Anna

	I received your last letter in due time.  I was rather surprised to see that you were in Philadelphia though Ma had told me that you were, perhaps going there.  But I was still more surprised, and sorry to learn that you were so unwell as to have to go home.  Though you have been telling me about your cough, I had no idea that it was as bad a one as it is.

	I will be glad to see you at home a good deal more so than at Burlington.  Of course I will ride with you.

	I am not certain whether you will get this letter, for today is the 27th and you are going to leave Philadelphia on the 31st.   I wouldnt like to write a long letter to be sent to the dead-letter office.

	You will like Dr. John LeConte I expect, for he is a very clever man.  It is well that you have so good an opportunity to go home, for no doubt Pa would be busy.  I will reach home sooner as I wont have to go by Burlington.  I hope that when I get home I will find you perfectly well.

	It is only about three weeks now before the time for me to start home.  You may believe that I am glad of it.

	As I dont know whether you will get this letter, I had better bring it to a close.

	Remember me to the girls & young ladies I should have said, when you get home.  Your affectionate brother, Willie
