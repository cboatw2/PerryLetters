My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines by Butler Thompson who starts this morning.  He told me that his mother said he must come back BY Thursday.  I suppose from that you will be invited to the wedding.  If so I hope you will go.  I trust that Frank is better and that neither of the other children has taken the scarlet fever.  If you can write me by Thursdays mail though I do not know whether I shall hardly be detained here so long.

	We have very little business in court & as soon as I can get through I [page torn] to Pendleton & perhaps [page torn; final line on the sheet] my mothers at place.  You must write me to Pickens by someone who is going.

	I have been talking to Cureton a negro trader about purchasing my negroes.  He intimated that he would give me my prices at Greenville Court $500 for Mario--$550 for Janus--$600 for Mor.  But MorI do not care to sellnor do I like to sell Mario to a trader to be carried off.

	Your mother sent for me to stop as I passed on Sunday.  She has a notion of building a little house for Anne.  I told her it would cost $500 and then she would find it uselessthat Anne would not stay in it & accept  She asked me what she should do, & I told her to do as she had been doing all along.  I find they are disposed to worry themselves [page torn; final line on the sheet] But I was a kind as I could be [sheet stained] believe I gave them some [sheet stained]

	My dear Liz our happiness in this life is very much in our own hands.  If we strive in the right way to be happy, we will be.  We must exercise Christian philosophy & bear up with the illslook to the comforts we have & not pine after those we cannot get.  My rule through life has been to make the most of my situation & look on the bright side of the picturenever work myself over that which cannot be altered or has passed bydo my duty to the best of my ability & care little as to consequences.  And I flatter myself that I have been blessed through lifeblessed with prosperity, blessed with the comforts of life, & the good opinion of my acquaintancesblessed with a good wife & pretty children to whom I look for all my future happiness & to promote whose happiness I live & am happy.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
