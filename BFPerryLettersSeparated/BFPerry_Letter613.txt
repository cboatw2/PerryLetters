Letter 613
14 July 1861
Ashland, Va.

Dear Papa

	I write to [you] a few days since, and sit down now to write you at the request of Dr. Ferguson.  He wants you to bring on with you, when you come, a negro boy for him.  Write to me to let me know if you will do it.  I dont know whether the Rail-Roads will charge anything for transporting the boy or not.  He wants him brought at any rate.  Blythe wants a boy brought on for his mess, not his own but one belonging to Dr. Harrison.  He said he would let me know certainly whether he wants him and then I will write you again.  When do you expect to come on.  Court, I sup[p]ose begins in Greenville tomorrow, and will last 2 or 3 weeks I suppose.  So you will not be able to come on before the end of 3 weeks at least.

	A report reached here this evening that there had been a fight in Western Va. between one thousand of Wises Command & 8 thousand federals in which the Virginians were surrounded and all of them either killed or taken prisoners.  This report is believed to be reliable.  I suppose you will have heard of this engagement before this letter reaches you.  We are getting on pretty well here.  Wiley has got well.  All the men in the company are well, except Westmoreland who is sick in the Hospital but will be out in a day or two.

	I like this camp better than the Camp at Richmond.  The Bugle is sounding now for Roll Call so I must close.  Your Son, William H. Perry

P.S. I forgot to mention in my last that we were furnished with one horse-pistol apiece before we left Richmond.
