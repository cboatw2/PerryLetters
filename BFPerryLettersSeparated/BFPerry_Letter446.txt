Letter 446
3 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & I have become alarmed about your cough.  Mrs. LeConte will write this evening to her sister Miss Graham to go over to Burlington & take you & Lula home with her to get some eminent Physician in Philadelphia. Who make[s] the throat & the lungs his exclusive study  to examine your throat & see what is the matter with you.  Mrs. LeConte says her sister will go after you on Friday & let you return Monday.  Saturday Major LeConte will send for a Physician to see you & have a full & perfect examination of the cause of your cough.  I shall then be better satisfied.  So you & Lula may prepare for a pleasant excursion to Philadelphia.

	I will write a letter & enclose it for the Bishop to let you go.  He must not refuse.  I sent your letter to your mother last night & I know it will distress her very much.

	They are all well at home & doing well.  I am going home day after tomorrow & return Monday.  I shall therefore not be at the commencement in College.  Already a good many ladies have come down to attend the commencement--Mrs. Herndon, Mrs. Garlington, Mrs. Chesnut, Miss Withers & others.

	I have just been arguing a case in court all day & have not been in the Legislature at al today.  They are discussing the Bank question.  I shall take no part in the debate.

	White of Abbeville took first, Rivers second and Keith of Pickens third honor.  But Keith felt that injustice had been done him & refused to accept the third honor.  He was suspended.  I saw young Buist who is teaching school in Barnwell.  He has grown a good deal.

	I heard from Frank last night & he is well.  He Gave his likeness to Alice Green & is going to have another taken to send his mother.

	I will now conclude my dear daughter & write a letter to the Bishop.  Give my love to Lula LeConte.  Tell her that her Father delivered a beautiful, able & most learned & scientific Inaugural last Tuesday night in the House of Representatives before a brilliant audience which drew further admiration from all who were present.  Her uncle will deliver his Inaugural next Tuesday night.

	I am happy my dear daughter to know you are satisfied & I hope your cough will soon be better.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
