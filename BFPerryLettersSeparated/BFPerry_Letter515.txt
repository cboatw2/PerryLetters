Letter 515
6 February 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night & were very sorry to learn you were falling behind in your class.

	Do my son study hard & keep from being dismissed.  You ought to love your Parents & study for their sake.

	We are already broken hearted by the death of Anna, & if you come home in disgrace it will crush us to the Earth.

	Enclosed I send you the ten dollars you wish.  Do not spend it foolishly.  Your mother says she would like to have good likeness of you.  The one you sent is not.

	We are all well.  Willie is with us.  He will return about the first of March.  I will send by him for you to read the Life of Commodore Decatur, the beau ideal of a naval hero.

	Mr. Watsons stables were burnt last night by some incendiary and Coxs steammill ten days ago.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
