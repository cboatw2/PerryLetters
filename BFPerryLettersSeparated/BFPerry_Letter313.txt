Letter 313
15 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now five oclock & I have just eaten my dinner & have till seven to go back to the State House, where I shall have to stay till eleven oclock in the night.

	I wrote you a letter this morning in the State House, but as I did not write you last night, I will write again.  I am waiting for the post office to be opened, so that I may get your letter & then I will reply to it.  I hope to hear that Willie & Frank reached home safely & found you all well.  I hope also to receive a Patriot & read over again my letters, or rather look at them for I have not time to read them.

	The discussion in the House on the Blue Ridge Rail road is going on.  Col. Memminger will conclude the debate this evening, & I have no doubt the Bill will pass.

	I spent a good deal of today with your uncle.  He came & sat with me sometime in the Legislatureenquired where Willie was & what he did.

	I have just been down & got your letter & read it.  I am glad to hear you were all well.

	You may now regard it settled that I will come home before going to Charleston.  Anna therefore need not come down.  It would be unpleasant to go from home after the adjournment of the Legislature when all the other members were hastening home.

	I must now close my letter & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
