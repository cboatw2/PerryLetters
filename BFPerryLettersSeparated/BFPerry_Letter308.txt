Letter 308
10 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a long letter last night & enclosed some editorials for the Patriot with an article of Judge ONealls.

	I have very little to write now in addition to what I wrote then.  I did not go to church today as I heard such a fine sermon yesterday, and also I had to do a great deal of writing in reference to my cases in court.

       The Case of the Greenville Academies has been referred to the Court of Errors & must be reargued on Tuesday next.  I have understood the chancellors are divided, Wardlaw & Dargan for me & Johnston & Duncan against.  The law Judges are now called in to settle the matter.

	Willie & Frank have not yet returned from Col. OHanlons.  I suppose they will tomorrow morning.  If so they may return to Greenville Tuesday or they may stay to the Inauguration of the Governor.  He is to be elected tomorrow at ? past twelve.  I suppose General Adams will be elected.

       Col. Jno S. Preston was confirmed today in the Episcopal church by Bishop Davis.  Col. Wade Hampton Jr. was also confirmed and a large number of others as I was informed.

       I am sorry you did not write me a longer letter than the one I rece[ive]d last night.  But were [glad] to hear from you is something, & I should be very glad to receive just as short a letter this evening which is Sunday, a day we have no mail from Greenville

	Col Fair & wife [&] Col. Herndon & wife are here.  Mistress F has a son about Haynes age which she brought into the room to show me today.  It is very much like her but does not look so well as Hayne.

	I have been from home so long that I almost forget how Hayne looks.  God bless the little fellow.  How I should like to see him tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
