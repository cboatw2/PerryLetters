Letter 374
1 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & as I have not time to write you & send my letter to the Patriot for you to read & send immediately up to Elford.

	I should feel disgraced to be nominated for lieutenant governor & would be so regarded by my friends.

	I read your letter to Mr. Yeadon.  He says he will take your offer & feels much complimented.

	Willie has written you a letter tonight.  Tomorrow he is examined.

        Col. Perrin has given me the Bonds but the coupon due was left off.

	 I am glad to hear of Arthurs tooth.  I wish you were here & next winter you must come.

	Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B,F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
