Letter 275
15 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

 	After writing you last evening, Mr. Allston called to see me & expressed himself very much pleased with Greenville.  He told me he was at your House with some company the evening before.  He was very much pleased with our portraits & said yours was very superior.  He said he was an amateur painter himself and that he had never seen any portrait more accurate or more beautifully painted.  He preferred the eyes looking from you & said the effect was much better.  He said he had made friends in Greenville & was going to build there.  He was delighted with Mr. Bacon as a teacher & spoke in high terms of his sons playing.  He thought Mr. Arthur very much like governor Manning.

	I rece[ive]d two letters from you last night & in one of them you speak of another letter you had written Tuesday which I did not receive.  I am glad your party went off pleasantly.  Poor Wheaton seems a good fellow, very kind & friendly, but vain & foolish.  He is engaged to Miss Boggs as he told me & showed her likeness in a ring.

	Yesterday we were all day in the Legislature till ten oclock in the night.  After writing to you, I went down & made a speech on the Judiciary Bill.  It was thoroughly discussed & lost.  There was some sharp sparring between Campbell & Owens & Thompson & very amusing.

	I am now writing to you before breakfast &whilst waiting for Anna & Miss Waistcot to dress & go to breakfast the others are eating.  They are to come to my room when ready.  I may not be able to write you this evening.  We are all hard pressed now for time.  The Legislature will not be able to do much.

	I am now anxious to see you & the little children dear little Hext especially, & Fanny & Frank.  Miss Hext says she was akin to your father.  She is now staying at Mr. Guignards.

	My course in reference to Taber has given me considerable pleasure.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
