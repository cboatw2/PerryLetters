Letter 575
25 March 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

       I went to Pickens court last Sunday & got Willie to write you.

       Your Report came some days since & I was sorry to see that you had rece[ive]d so many demerits during the past month.  You know all the rules & regulations of the School & ought to try & observe them all.  Do my son behave well & study hard.  I wish to see an improvement in your standing every month.  Let your standing be higher & higher till you get to the head of your class.  It gives your mother & myself so much pleasure to learn you are doing well and so much pain to hear the reverse.

	I have heard that Tom Jones has rece[ive]d an appointment at Annapolis.  He is not a steady boy & I am afraid he may lead you estray.  Be on your guard when he enters your school.  Be kind to him & assist in keeping him right.    But do not let him have any influence over your conduct for evil.

	I saw Col. Elliott Keith at Pickens court who has been living in Georgia & he told me that he saw Hooper last Summer, & asked about you.  He speaks well of Hooper & his Father.  In your letters write about all your acquaintances & friends.

	Our court commences tomorrow.  We shall be very busy.  I go to the State Convention in two weeks.  Col. Orr is spoken of for President in this state & elsewhere.

	We are all well.  Lindy had two babies whilst I was at Pickens court & is doing well.  The twins are fine looking, boy & girl.  So my servants are increasing rapidly.

	Hext is at General Thompsons.  He went up on the Pony by himself.

	Nothing more but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Pinckney Irvine & W S called to see us yesterday & asked about you.
