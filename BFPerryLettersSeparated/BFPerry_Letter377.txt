Letter 377
4 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I enclose you a long letter which you must accept as one to yourself as you did not write me today.  Annas letter to Willie was rece[ive]d.  Willie will return Friday or Saturday.  He passed his examination very well & is pleased at his admission.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees& it is now near eleven oclock.  I have never been so busy before of a session, because I have been more in company & dining out.  I have really enjoyed myself very much.  But I am very anxious to see you & the children.  But for my engagement to dine out on Saturday, I would go home & return Monday.

	Tell Anna I bought her knife today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
