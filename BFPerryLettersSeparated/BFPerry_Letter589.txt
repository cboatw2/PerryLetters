Letter 589
6 May 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	We all returned home last night & are all well.  I wrote you from Charleston.  Afterwards the Convention broke up without doing anything & will meet in Baltimore the 18th June.  I may possibly attend their meeting, & if so will call & see you.  If you do not go to sea this summer you can come home with me.

	I am distressed about your cough & you must write me how it is.  It was in that way that dear Ann was first taken.

	You must write me how much money you want & what you want it for & I will send it to you.

	I have been absent three weeks & am now tired & fatigued.  Your Report came & seems about as usual.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
