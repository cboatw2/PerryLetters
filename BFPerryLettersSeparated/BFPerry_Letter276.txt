Letter 276
16 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have nothing of interest to write you, since writing you last night at twelve oclock.  Luther McBee has just been in my room & says he returns in the morning.   Mauldin came down this evening  & is going to Pedee for his wife.  Dr. Austin & his daughter came down yesterday & go back tomorrow.  It seems to me I see more of Greenville here than I should at home.

	Anna & Willie are doing well & enjoying themselves very much.  Willie took a deep interest last night in the torch light procession & the crowd.

	This morning a committee of citizens waited on me & invited me to address the citizens of Columbia in the Town Hall tomorrow night at eight oclock.  I have consented to do so.  I am becoming a wonderfully popular man in Columbia.  In Charleston I learn Taber was also burnt in effigy last night.  A militia company which he commanded there have requested his resignation.  Poor fellow seems to have no rest for the sole of his foot.

	The affair has produced quite a stir in Columbia and all over the state.  General Adams came to me & said he hoped I would not consent to run for governorthat he thought he would beat Wallace but he did not know so well about myself.  He said he was informed his constituents had nominated me for governor.

	We have not had much discussion today in the Legislature.  We meet again at six.  It is now five & I must conclude my letter.  I must think of my address tomorrow night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
