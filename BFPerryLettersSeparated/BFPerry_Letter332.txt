Letter 332

Columbia

My dear Liz

	I could not write you last night, as I had to attend the sitting of the Board of Trustees.  I was engaged all the evening & did not receive your letters till I was just starting to the college.  I finished the case of Dr. Bivings & Leitner yesterday & went to Dr. Blanding.  He has fastened the plate & tooth which gave me so much trouble very well & I can now talk, speak & eat without apprehension of the plate falling out.  In the evening I was with Professor McKay [McCay], Dr. Goodwyn & Col. Beadon  examinisg the plans of the new State House.

	Dr. Theodore Croft will write me to death, but I have promptly attended to all his business & have so written him. I was glad to receive Annas letter.  I am fixed here now till next Tuesday & hope to go down for her next Wednesday stay Thursday & be at home Saturday.  I am on the committee to examine students Tuesday.  My Equity hearing is over.  The law business comes up today, but the opposite lawyers are not here.  Last night I was appointed chairman of the committee to which is referred the whole business of the College.  Governor Means & Col. [Franklin J.] Moses are with me.  I shall have the Report to write & submit next Monday night.  Saturday I do down to Governor Adams with Chancellor Wardlaw & others.

	I hope to hear from Anna tonight.  I have just had a call from Col. Fr who is as warm hearted as ever & sends a great many compliments to you.  I must now conclude & go to Court.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
