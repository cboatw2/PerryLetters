Letter 590
14 May 1860
Washington

Dear Papa

	I am now here with Frank, who is about as I first found him at Annapolis.  He is weak, but I trust will stand the trip very well.  I will leave here Wednesday and stay that night in Richmond, the next night in Raleigh, the next in Columbia, and then home, which we will reach according to this bySaturday evening.  We were delayed in Annapolis Saturday & Sunday byrain. But I hope we will now have good weather the rest of the way.

	I dont like to say much about Franks health for fear that I may either raise your hopes too high, or make you unnecessarily uneasy.

	I think you will find him better than you expected, though greatly changed from what he was when you last saw him.

	I saw Col. Ashmore this morning, who said he had just written to you.  Dont expect Frank home before Saturday.  Your aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry

I have got such a pen that I can hardly write.

Benjamin Perry
