Letter 53
7 August 1846
Boston

My dear Liz

	Enclosed [not present] I send you a letter for Col. Townes.  I shall leave in the morning for New London & do not know when I shall have time to write you again.

	I have purchased for you a most magnificent Bracelet $11.50 & two gold pins $3.00.  I have had made for you the prettiest thing in the shape of a French cap your eyes ever beheld $5.00.  How I shall carry it without washing is the difficulty.  I have purchased a beautiful set of coral for Susans first born $4.50.  I have purchased a suit for Will & Frank of cloth at $17.00.  They are very handsomely made.  My funds are getting low & I must now stop.  I will make your mother a present of Mas[s]il[l]ons sermons which I now have & dont care for.  My trunk is full & I can get nothing in it.  You see I have grattified your every wish.  I felt it doubly my duty to Susan as I had been off enjoying my travels & spending money whilst you were at home.  I wish you had been with me & yet I know you would not have found it pleasant.

	I must now pack up and be ready to start soon in the morning.

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
