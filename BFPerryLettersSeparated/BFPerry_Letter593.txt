Letter 593
28 November 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear that Hext was better & Mary had a son.

	I shall try & be at home Saturday evening.  I went before the House committee last night.  But Hodges is going to lead for the Road & I must wait till his papers come.

	I had quite a cordial meeting last night with Mr. Petigru.  He enquired for me as soon as he arrived.  John Cunningham was lavish of his praise of me last in the presence of several gentlemen.  Said he would rather have me as ally in difficulty than any man in the State.  Said he always had the highest regard for my wisdom firmness &honor.  that he had been brought up at my feet & admired & respected me.

	Mr. Petigru concurs with me entirely.  I saw Governor Allston & Mr. Barnwell.  They seemed very cordial & I have written an article nominating Barnwell for Governor.

	I have not been to the House today & have not seen many persons.  I met Governor Adams who was very kind & not so firery as he was.  He looks old.  His daughters were afraid to come to Columbia on account of smallpox but I believe it is all a mistake.  There is no smallpox here.  Dr. Goodwin says a man who has seen a great deal of says it is a mistake.

	I bought two or three Books & have been sending them today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
