Letter 197
1 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from seeing Anna start to Charleston.  She went off in good spirits with Mrs. Trimmier & Tolleson of Spartanburgh & their families.  She was greatly pleased with Columbia & said she was willing to stay here longer.  Yesterday Judge Butler & myself started with her to see Mrs. Martin & fell in company with Mr. Robert Barnwell, Col. Preston & Col. Hampton & whilst delayed in our walk, we met General Martin & his wife, and they took possession of Anna.  She staid with them till night.  Mrs. Martin told me that Mrs. Hayne was expecting her to stay all the winter in Charleston.  She will have two weeks to stay before I start home.  I gave her $28.50cts & told her if she wanted more money to write me.  I would have given her more, but had nothing but four hundred dollar bills left.  Gladden has not paid me nor Col. Brockman.

	Yesterday evening whilst in the drawing room, a servant told me that there was a gentleman down below in a carriage who wished to see me.  I went down & found Governor [David Lowry] Swain of North Carolina, now President of the North Carolina University, & an old school mate of mine.  He said he had come by Columbia on purpose to see me & was about being turned off for the want of a room.  I told him to get out & Iboth my room & bed with him.  He did stop & we spent the evening very pleasantly.  I introduced him to Judges Butler, Wardlaw & Withers, Col. Manning & others.  Professor Brumby was an old acquaintance & I sent for him.  Towards eleven oclock Mr.  got a bed & room for him, & we did not sleep together.  We had not seen each other for thirty years.  He said he remembered mywell, but that I was much fuller & stouter.  He left this morning.  I introduced Anna to him.  He enquired after my family & told about his.  Professor Brumby begged that Anna might go & stay with his little daughters.

	We had several ballotings for U.S. Senator yesterday.  Judge Evans is ahead & will be elected today.  He said he had nothing to do with it, and that I had the entire control of his name to run him or withdraw him when I pleased.  This is what his son told Dr. Zimmerman.  Pickens, Chesnut, McGrath, & Preston were all run.  The secessionists still speak of running me for governor.  We are doing very little in the Legislature.  Today we shall have some discussion on the Electoral Bill.  I may make a speech.

       I recd your letter last night & am thankful that you write me every day.  I hope to hear tonight that you have recd all of my letters.  You had perhaps better purchase some hogs to kill.  Consult Mr. Hoke about it.    Though it is rather warm just now, I will send the money if needed.

       Give my love to all the children.  Write me about them.  I have no time to write & must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
