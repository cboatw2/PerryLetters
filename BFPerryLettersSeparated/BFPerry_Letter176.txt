Letter 176
Friday morning, [7(?) June 1851]
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	Mr. Spencer is just starting & I have time only to write you a line.

	Willie & myself are quite well, though I was very sick the night I reached here.  The pills & the fatigue of coming have exhausted me completely.

	I hope to be at home Sunday.  Nothing done yet in court.  I have written a long article for the Tri-Weekly on Saturday.  Willie is now asleep.  I have eaten breakfast.

	I hope you & the dear little Baby are well & a great many persons here enquired after him.  Never was an infant more famous at his birth in the ordinary circles of life.

	I must stop & will write you again by Saturdays mail.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
