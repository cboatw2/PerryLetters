Letter 69
3 March 1847
Spartanburgh

My dear Liz

	Mr. Thompson was here this morning & I write you a line merely to inform you that I shall be at home tomorrow.

	I had only three small cases here & two of them have been disposed of.  The other will not be tried, but requires my presence today.  Col. [James H.] Irby is here, came last night & I wish to close our trade with his note.  He informs me that Maria is satisfied, & from what he tells me of the management of his negroes I have no doubt he is a good master.  He is anxious to gethome again.

	We have quite a number of Lawyers here in attendance on court.  Col. Dawkins, Irby, Waites, Thompson, Young &c.  They are all complaining of hard times in their profession.  Henry tells me that both he & Dean who are in copartnership will not make $1000 this year between them.  He seemed greatly surprised when I told him that I had already received $900 this year.

  	I am very much pleased with Judge Withers.  In my opinion he is the ablest man on the Bench.  He is quite pleasant & agreeable on the bench.  There were some doubts about his temper.

	Kiss the children for me & tell Willey he must continue.  There is to be a great Fair here tonight & if any little thing suits I will buy it for a present for the children or you.  Thompson is leaving.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
