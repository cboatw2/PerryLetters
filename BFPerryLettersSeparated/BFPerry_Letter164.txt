Letter 164
2 December 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I went down to Col. OHanlons with Mr. Duncan & carried with us Willie & Frank on Sunday last.
We had a pleasant excursion in spite of the rain.  The Col. Sent his carriage, two or three horses, four or five mules & negroes to meet us at the Rail Road depot & escort us to his house about four miles distant.  The carriage broke down & we all mounted horses & mules & road on.  Willie & Frank were delighted.  We met a most hearty & cordial welcome, a good breakfast, a fine dinner, plenty of wine & brandy & whiskey punch.  The Col. showed us letters from Gen. Jackson &c & we talked on the days of nullification.

       Today I went to the college commencement with Willie & Frank who sat on the platform whilst the boys were speaking.  I sat by Rob[ert] Barnwell our Senator in Congress, & he told me he had news on my political pieces.  He is opposed to separate state action, but is a disunionist & seemed to regret I was not one also.  The speeches of young Barnwell son of the Preacher, & Richardson grandson of Judge Richardson were very finesome of the rest not very good.  Rions, I thought a poor one, although he took first honor.  There was quite a display of Ladies although the day was so bad.  They do not seem to care for the weather, so they can see & be seen.  Col. Preston made a war speech to the graduates.

       There is no doubt a fixed & settled purpose to dissolve the union as soon as practicable.  This is agreed upon by all the politicians.    But some of them are afraid of being whipped into submission.  Col. Preston is sailing with the current & Dr. Lieber says is [the] very way tohis present position.

       Dr, Lieber came to my room this evening & we spent an hour in delightful conversation.  He said he should call again.  Professor Williams met me today in the college, & said he had heard of my visit to Dr. Lieber, and that he should call on me as it was pleasant to meet with sympathy.  I never saw a man or woman more encouraged than Dr. Lieber and his Lady were by my conversation.  He said again tonight I do not know how it is these men are all so civil to you.  I told him I made them so.  I was civil to them & cordial in my manners.

       Mr. William Easl[e]y has offered to take Frank back to Greenville in his Buggy.  I may send him.  But Willie is not disposed to part with him.  Col. OHanlon wished very much to keep them both for several days.  Mr. McBee is going up with Easl[e]y.  Willie & Frank have been twice to Alex Taylors & taken dinner with them.

       Tomorrow the election for Judge comes on.  I think Wardlaw & Whitner will be elected.  Burt will be elected Secretary of State.  Young will be elected Solicitor.  Reed opposes him.  Jones cannot get a start, & I believe he has found it out, most effectually.  I am sure he would not get the votes.  Duncan has found out that he will not do, to depend on, in a political struggle, & so said to me.

       The great debate commences tomorrow on the Southern question.  It will continue for a week or ten days.  My impression is that a convention will be called & what then I know not.  They are beginning to despair of Georgia & a Southern congress doing anything.  The Augusta Chronicle Sentinel is now sent to me in Columbia.  The State of Georgia has gone for the Union by thirty thousand votes.

       The weather is now very warm & wet.  When it clears off it will probably turn coldif so have the hogs killed.
