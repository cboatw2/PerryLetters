Letter 324
9 March 1855
Greenville

My dear Sir [John Pettit]

	I received your letter the other day, and am glad to hear that Mrs. Pettit received regularly the Southern Patriot.  I was very much gratified in my return from the Legislature of the State last winter to learn that you had ordered the Patriot to be sent to her.

	I am publishing this week your very able & most acceptable speech on the Slavery question.  Your views too on the right of the States meet my hearty approval & although I am as you express yourself to be a States rights man.

	I was in hopes to have seen you & Mrs. Pettit in South Carolina this spring.  It would give as great pleasure to meet you & greet you in Greenville.  I forwarded to Mrs. Pettit last winter, a copy of a Poem of some merit, by Col. Grayson entitled The Slave & the hireling.  I hope she received it.  The author was for many years a member of Congress & is one of the faithful Union men in South Carolina amidst all the faithless secessionists.

	Mrs. Perry unites with me in our respects to Mrs. Pettit & yourself & I am truly yours &c., B.F. Perry

Mr. John Pettit
