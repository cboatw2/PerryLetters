Letter 568
14 January 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I have barely time to write you a few lines.

	We are all well & I am engaged in defending a mail Robber.  He was a young many of good character & property.  But unfortunately being Post Master he stole stamps out of the mail at his office.  He is trying to give Bail & I am busy about it.  His name is Mr. Mahon & lives eight miles below the Court House.

	All last week I was engaged in taking testimony in Barrett &  case.

	I have not recei[ve]d your Report yet.  Your letter was rece[ive]d Friday evening.  I hope you will still improve in your standing.

	The weather is now warm & has been wet.  Today is fair.

	I must conclude as I have written in a great hurry to keep you from being disappointed in hearing at the regular time.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
