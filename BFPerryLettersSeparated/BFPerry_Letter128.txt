Letter 128
Thursday morning, [1848]
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I shall not be able to return today, as I wrote you by Mr. Elford.

	The murder case in which I was engaged was tried Tuesday evening, & resulted in a verdict of manslaughter.  There were some Georgia lawyers here & amongst them a son of Judge Underwood who told me that he had waited to hear my speech & he had not been disappointedthat it was the only speech that he had heard during our court although General Thompson & General Whitner had spoken.  Mr. Underwood was also a Whig.

	Mr. Allen another lawyer from Georgia told me in the presence of Judge Frost that Judge Dougherty of Georgia although a Taylor man, regretted deeply my defeat when he heard of the result of the election.  I became acquainted with Judge Dougherty some years since at Greenville.  He is a man of great talent & high character & a noble fellow as he said of me.

	General Thompson has been talking a good deal about my offering for the Presidency of the Bank.  He requested Coil. Townes to speak of it in Columbia.  Elliott Keith has proposed me as a candidate for the Senate of the U. Statessays that some of the members of the Legislature here had promised to support me.  But this is all idle and I tell it to you for the want of something better to write.  My friends are all disposed for me to run again at the next election.

	 I recd Fifty seven dollars in cash yesterday my costs in the case of Reed vs Keith.  I filed a bill in Equity last night which will be worth fifty dollars.  General Thompson says that the chancellor has decreed in our favour in the case of Evans & Boston.  If so we shall get a handsome fee.

	I saw Mr. Lee yesterday, also Foster & three of his sons.  They are all well.  Josiah is very low & speaks of coming to [Greenville] with aunt Foster.  In haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
