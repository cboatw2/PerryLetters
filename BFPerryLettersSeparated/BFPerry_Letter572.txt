Letter 572
26 February 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I write you my usual letter today, but I have nothing special to communicate.

	We are all well & your grandmother, family & aunt Susans are well.  Willie has not yet returned from the.  We look for him tomorrow, unless he went to New Orleans.

	Your letter to your mother was rece[ive]d Friday evening, & [we] were glad to hear you are doing so well in your studies.  Persevere& make yourself a more useful [servant] to your country & dear to your family.

	Col. Ashmore has written me twice lately.  In his last letter he says he had written to you giving you good advice.  I hope you will appreciate it & profit by it.

	Your mother has taken charge of the garden & is making great improvements in it.  She has made dear Annas grave a lovely spot indeed.  It is visited by hundreds to see its beauty.  But I do not like to allude to sad .  My eyes run over with tears & my heart seems fit to break whenever I think of your poor departed sister.  My life will be embittered as long as I live by the thought of her loss to our family.

       My dear Son be a good boy & study hard & be a consolation to your Parents.  Make up as far as in your power for the loss they have sustained in your sister.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
