Letter 41
10 July 1846
Washington

My dear Liz

	The weather is so dreadfully hot that I can hardly muster courage enough to write you.  It has been one week since I left home really it seems to me like an age.  I have travelled so far, & seen so much that it seems to me impossible that I have done all this in one week.  I hope you & the children are  all well & that I shall receive a letter shortly saying so.  I left you unwell & when I think of it I am almost ashamed of my conduct.  But you were willing & persuaded me to come.

	I have just written a letter to Col. Townes giving a full account of what I have seen & noticed.  To that letter I refer you & you must consider it part & parcel of this.

	I had the pleasure of going to the Presidents yesterday evening & was charmed with Mrs. Polk.  There was an immense crowd in the grounds around the Building.  The President is not soin his manner as his wife.  I soon was introduced to another fine lady Mrs. Crittenden of Kentucky.  Yesterday evening I spent at Archers in company with the Russian minister, Barrow, Senator from Louisiana, Crittenden of Kentucky, General Thompson, Pendleton of Virginia.  I called to see Commander Morris, General Towson, Major Cooper & Col. Benton.  Commander Morris returned my visit this morning.    Holmes, Woodrow, Simpson & Black all called to see me this morning & left their cards.  Mr. Crittenden also did me the honor to call & leave his card.  I dined with Simpson today.  General Towson seemed very glad to hear from Mrs. Butler & requested me to call & see Mrs. Towson.  Major Cooper seemed delighted to hear from Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett.  Col. Benton was not at home.  I saw Mrs. Benton & her three daughters, one of them married to Co. Fremont of the army.  When I gave Mrs. Fremont the letter from Poinsett, she said she was entitled to one half the letters her father received from him.  They seemed quite a pleasant & agreeable familynot pretty, but not uglyhealthy & rosy cheeked.  General Thompson went with me and he has been very kind to me.  I feel under many obligations to him for his politeness.  It has been of great service to me.

	I was delighted with Barrow of Louisiana.  He is a noble looking man & I think a noble hearted fellow with handsome talents.  I have yet seen very few pretty women.  They do not strike me at all.  Mr. Calhoun came up to me today & seemed very kind.  I have not seen McDuffie.  Yanceys mother is here & has fallen out with Cunninghams family & Ben.  She must be crazy.  So Burt thinks.  Mrs. Calhoun & Mrs. Burt left here this morning for the Virginia Springs.

	Commodore Shubrick is in command of the navy yard at this place.  I went to visit the yard & did not carry your mothers letter with me nor did I see him.    I will send it to him.

	Barnwell Rhett.

	I have just got my clo[page torn] coat, pantaloons, & 3 vests at $45.50.  They fit very well & if I had my shirts, I should look quite genteel.

	I shall not leave for the north before next Saturday.

	You must write me in Boston, all how you are coming on, & the children, & the farm &chow Willie  What they say &c.  What sort of a present they wish &c.  Barrow told me the other night he wished to have 25 sonsthat he would rather have a distinguished son than be distinguished himself.   I told him I expected Mrs. Barrow would object to the number which made him smile.  He is a noble gentleman.  Good night.  Your husband &c, B.F. Perry
