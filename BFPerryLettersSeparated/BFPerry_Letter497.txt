Letter 497
18 September 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night which filled the household with joy at your safe return to the U[nited] States after a long absence on the wide ocean.

	You must [write] a full account of your voiage & tell us all you saw &c.

	Your mother wrote you at Cherburgh, but I suppose you did not receive her letter.  I was in hopes you would be at that Port whilst Queen Victoria & the European Louis Napoleon were there.

	We are all pretty well.  Anna is a great deal better.  Fannie has grown very much.  Hext & Hayne are going to Miss Powells school.  Arthur is beginning to talk.  Your mother enjoys good health.  I am quite well.    The servants are all well except Becka & Charles who are complaining.  The Horses are all fat & sleek.  We have two little deer in the yard again & they are great pets.

	All your acquaintances enquire about you & are anxious to see you.  Willie was with us four or five weeks this summer.  We heard from him last night.  He is now in the Senior class & is doing well.

	I hope dear Frank you will now turn over a new leaf & study hard, study all the timegit your lessons so that you will not miss one word.

	I am almost sorry that Bradford has been restored for Col Orr tells me his Report was that he would not study himself or let others study.  He said this accounted for your bad standing in your class.  You must not let idle boys interfere with your studies.

	Col. Orr told one of the visitors of the naval Academy to notice his little pet Frank Perry & report how he stood in his class.  He felt mortified when the Visitor returned to Washington & reported you deficient in your studies.

	I would not have you reported deficient again for any consideration.  I intend to visit you this Fall or Winter certainly & shall expect to find you much improved, grown & studying hard and behaving well.

	Your mother will write you all the news.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
