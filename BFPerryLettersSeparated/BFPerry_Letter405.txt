Letter 405
18 September 1857
Columbia

My dear Son

	This letter will be handed you by Master Waller R. Lane.  He goes to Annapolis to enter the Naval School with you.  I have never had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Lane, but our mutual friend Mr. Suber has requested me to give him a letter of Introduction.  I hope you will both be good friends as you come from the same state.   You must take Mr. Lane & introduce him to such of the officers as you know.

	I am now just about returning home from the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the South Carolina College.  Your affectionate Father &c., B.F. Perry
