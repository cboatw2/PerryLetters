My dear Liz

	I am here & very anxious to hear from you & know how Edward & the fever are coming on.  I saw Col. Ware this evening who says he left Greenville after dinner Tuesday evening & heard Dyer speak of having some of the boys sick.

	Mr. Reed is quite sick with billous fever.  I saw him this evening.  His wife was confined two days since & is dangerously ill.  Norris the one who took tea with us is sick at Bensons with typhoid fever, says Mr. Harrison.

	I spent last night at Mr. Hammonds & found Mrs. Hammond a very important witness.  I have examined Mrs. Reed & Mr. John E. Norris.  In the morning I start to old Pendleton by the way of  Garrisons & will reach there tomorrow night.

	Frank does very well & is great company for me.  Yesterday we fell in company with Bruce & old Mrs. Green & took dinner with them on the road to Anderson.  They were coming here.

	Tell Reuben & Charles when not better employed they may grub out the place we spoke of building a house at over on the Farm and which we commenced clearing last winter.

	I hope to hear from you at old Pendleton Friday morning.  Take care of yourself & the children & the Servants.  Make them keep everything clean in the kitchen & rooms.  The sickness in Charleston is alarming.  It is now very warm weather & should it continue the sickness will increase.

	Good night.  Frank has just gone to bed to sleep.  How happy I should be to peep in & see you & the children.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
