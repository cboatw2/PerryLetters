Letter 331
3 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Daughter

	I received a letter last night from your mother stating that she had just heard from you, & that you were about settling out for Charleston to the hospitable abode of Dr. Cain.

	I left Greenville Saturday & shall probably get through my business here this week.  You must therefore prepare to return next week.  At present, however, my movements are uncertain, but I hope to get through with my cases this week.  You must write me immediately & let me know when you will be ready to return home.  We shall all be glad to see you in Greenville once more.  I suppose your mother has informed you that we think of sending you to the Limestone Springs this summer.

	Governor Adams is going to give a party at his residence Friday & I suppose I shall be there.  Col. Jones went down for Flora last Sunday & I suppose with return here tomorrow.  A great many of your acquaintances during the session of the Legislature have enquired about you.

	Your mother writes you so often that she leaves nothing for me to say in my letters to you.  Be sure to write me immediately on the receipt of this.

	Give my love to all your friends & relatives.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
Charleston
