Letter 454
17 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter and have but a moment to write you in reply.   The House meets at six & it is now within fifteen minutes of that time.

	I rece[ive]d this evening the Patriot & Enterprise.  This morning I was engaged in court & disposed of all my cases but two which were continued till May.

	I wrote Frank a letter today in the House.  I have also written to Mr. Perdicaris.

	I am sorry Wiley is behaving so badly.  He will do better when I return.  I am glad you saw Mrs. Stokes & Mrs. Gilreath.   I am sorry you did not see Governor Swain, & he did not see you & the children & my Library.  He is truly & sincerely my friend & admirer.

	I think it probable now that I shall be at home Monday night, & a happy return it will be for me.  I anxiously wish to be once more with my wife & children.

	The committee reported today, my nomination as one of the trustees of the college.  The election takes place tomorrow.  I care nothing about the position since I have sent my son to another college.  Col. Carn,[John A.] Inglis & Legare have been nominated in the place of Preston, Hampton & Gillespie who refused to serve any longer.

	The Legislature have done nothing of interest today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
