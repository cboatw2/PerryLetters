Letter 290
10 May 1864
Columbia

My dear Willie

	I rece[ive]d your letter and one from Frank the other day.

	I shall go to Charleston in the morning & return next Monday with your Mother.

	We may get home Tuesday or Wednesday.  I am very anxious to see you all again.

	I write in great haste.  President Fillmore is here.  But the best news I have to tell you is a present of $500  from Col. William Williams as an additional fee for my services in the Scurry case.  Such
a present is worth havingcame in time to pay for the carriage.

	Give my love to Anna Frank & Hext.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Mr. Willie Perry
