Letter 368
23 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just reached here safe & got my supper.

	Franks letter was handed me on my arrival.  I rece[ive]d but one letter from you in Charleston.  Your aunt McCall sent me a little box which is in my trunk & which I will send up by the first opportunity.

	I had a pleasant time in Charleston & could hardly break loose from my friends there.  Mr. Petigruvery much on my staying today & dining with him & Col. Alston & Lady.  I dined yesterday with Col. Alston & Mr. Petigru & Mrs. Alston at their private table at the Mills House.  Judge McGrath insisted on my taking supper with him yesterday.  Mr. Johnson brother of Judge Johnson also invited me to dine with himalso Mr. Yeadon.

	My speech has attracted much attention & has drawn forth a compliment from the Mercury which I will send you.  It has been published in the Courier & Evening News.  The Institute will publish it in pamphlet form in a week or ten days.

	There was an immense concourse of persons today on the Charleston cars.  I had a pleasant seat with Col. Harleston Read, Col. Simmons the Speaker & Col. Boylston.  There were six cars full.

	I see General Thompson here on his way to New York.  I have not seen Mrs. Thompson.  He had no news from Greenville.  I see none of the Greenville delegation here.  They will come down tomorrow I suppose.

	The weather was very warm in Charleston & I could not wear my Raylin.  I had therefore to buy me a frock coat to speak in which cost me $22.  I paid noBill at the Mills House.

	Mrs. Wilson came down the day I rece[ive]d your letter but I saw nothing of her.  I was a good deal with the Colonel.

	This Hotel is very full & I have my old room.  Dr. Fair & Lady are opposite to me and he made an appeal to my gallantry as I went down two young ladies to have the room for three days at the commencement Ball.  That their coming to the Ball depended on their getting a room opposite Mrs. Fairs.  I told him if I could stay anywhere else they might occupy my room three or four days.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  I saw Mr. Robert Duncan in Charleston.   Barnwell Duncan came to see me.  I left McKay & wife & Donaldson in Charleston.  They will be up this week some time.

	I am very much fatigued & will write you tomorrow or the next day.

	I paid Kle &65.00.  He has the finest fresh butter I ever saw & says he can supply us at thirty two cents a pound.  I think one pound of his butter will [go] further than Mrs. Brockmans & is much sweater butter.

	Good night.  I must write a line to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
