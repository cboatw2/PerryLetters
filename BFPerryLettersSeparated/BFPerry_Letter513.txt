Letter 513
24 January 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter last week, but you had not then heard of the death of your dear sister.

	Yesterday Mr. Arthur preached her funeral & made a fine sermon on death.  He spoke of Anna in beautiful terms.

	Your mother is copying the Sermon & perhaps we may have it printed.

	Mr. Gaillard wrote a beautiful letter and Mr. Richard Freeman a sweet poem on Annas death which you will see in the Patriot of last week.

	I have received one of the best letters I ever read from Col. Memminger on Annas death.

	We are all in great affliction & almost broken hearted.  I hope her death may make us all Christians.  You must try & be religious & good prepare to meet Anna in heaven as she requested.

	We are expecting Willie home tonight.  I did not write you yesterday in consequence of Annas funeral.

	We all wish to see you very much & I wish you could have come home with Willie.  But you must study hard & be punctual in your lessons.  Do not fall behind again in your class.

	We are all as well as could be expected.  Hext & Hayne are going to school.  Arthur is growing finely & is very pretty & smart.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
