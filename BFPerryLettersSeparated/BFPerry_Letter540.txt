Letter 540
23 October 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter last night and we were very glad to hear from you.  Two weeks had elapsed since your previous letter.

	You say you have received only four demerits.  You ought to try & receive none.  You know all the rules of the Academy & obey them.  Then you will get no demerits.

	I am glad that Harper said what he did to you.  Your grandfather and his grandfather lived more than thirty years, within a half mile of each other & were great friends.  His father addressed your aunt Mrs. Hunt.  I always liked him very much but he was a grown young man whilst I was a boy.

	I returned from Pickens court last week but did not see any of Fosters family.  Hawthorn & Long are doing pretty well.  Next week is court here & I shall be very busy.

	The Revd. Mr. Buist waslast summer and he was the one who enquired after you.  He is Doctor of Divinity.

	I brought from Anderson Court a beautiful English Terrier for Arthur & he is delighted with the dog.  He sleeps with him.

	We are all well & the children are going to school.

	Do you receive the Patriot regularly.  Let me know.

	Dr. Irvine says Pinckney will return about Christmas & wish to call & see you as he comes back.  Col. Ashmore tells me that he will go & see you before Congress meets.

	Spartan Goodlett is to be married shortly to Miss Lyles of Fairfield a daughter of William Lyles.  I had heard that he was courting Sally Crook.  But he is positively engaged to Miss Lyles.

	Donaldson & Miss Sue Hoke are to be married 15th of November.

	Write us once a week & study hard.  Let me have a good report from you in November.  Col. Orr enquires about you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
