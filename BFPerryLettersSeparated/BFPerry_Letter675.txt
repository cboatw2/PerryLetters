Letter 675
4 December 1863
Columbia
.My dear Liz

	I have just written a long letter to Fanniue & although it is late in the night I will write you one.  Col. Elford goes up in the morning.  He has just heard that his agent in Georgia has sold his last purchasse of a plantation for a profit of $20,000 & is uneasy about it.  I told him he was foolish to think of receiving $40,000 at this time in Confederate Bills & he should reinvest it immediately.  The money is depreciating every day.

	I will go up Sunday morning & stay till Tuesday.  I have drawn your uncle Josephs money $3,000 received your mothers from Taylor & now have a check for $710 for my pay as a Commissioner up today.  I do not know what to do with the money.  Dont like to keep Confederate Bills & dont invest it.

			I wrote Fannie last night about dining with Col. Hayne.  His wife looks old enough for his Mother!  It  looks so unnatural to see so youthful looking a man tied to a woman looking so old.  There ought to be fifteen years difference between a man & his wife.  There is something horrible to see a young man with an old & ugly wife.  Mrs. Hayne is smart & lively.  I spent a very pleasant evening with him, his wife,  daughter, son, Cols. Orr, Dawkins, Garlington,  & Dr. Croft.  Col. Hayne asked me to call & see them again.  Whilst at table Col. Dawkins knocked a dish over & spilt  the contents in my lap.  Mrs. Hayne offered to take all the grease out [word obscured] I would send my best to her.  But I was not hurt much.

	Col. Taylor told me he heard from his son frequently who is a prisoner near Canada on Johnsons Island.  He is well treated.  Your uncle Arthur is sick & confined to his bed.  Mrs. Hayne said there seems to be a prostration of the system.  I will go out & see him if I can tomorrow.  Col. Isaac Hayne brought his little grandson to showfine looking & very smart.  Miss inner is quite pretty & his sons are good looking.
	I have just received a letter from Lake saying he will send corn in a day or two.  That he will be down here to see me Tuesday morning.
       The position Willie occupies is highly respectable & much easier & safer than to be in command.  He will still retain his position in the company, & it is only temporary.
	The news today is a little better.  Meade has retired before Lee and Grant has retreated before Bragg.  The yankees were terribly whipped at Chattanooga.  The Herald says they lost 40,000 men killed & wounded & missing!  Three companies of Col. McCulloughs Regiment were captured it is saidCaptain Perkins, Capt. Mo & Capt. Ben Goodlettsnone of the Regiment killed it is said,
	I want to see you all very much & only wish I could stay when I return.  Tell Hext I miss him very much & am glad  he got safe home.
	Nothing doing in trhe Legislature of any consequence or likely to be done.I must now bid you good night & go to bed.  I think I have done well to write two long letters when I expect to see you next day after you get my letters.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
