Letter 186
29 April 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your letter and am only able to write a few lines in reply.  I have just finished a long letter to Elford about the convention & other matters & it is now late in the night.  General Thompson has just left our room.  Mr. Center is in another room.

	The Convention has done nothing yet. Tomorrow we will have a general discussion.  When we met this morning it was the most crowded house I ever saw.  There was great anxiety to hear the Report of the Committee of Twenty one.  After Judge Cheves had read the report, I presented my report  embodying the sentiments of myself, and it was well recei[ve]d.  The Convention then adjourned.   I saw General Thompson & Miss Jones at the State House and walked home with them.  Miss Jones seemed disposed to be pleasant & talk.  After dinner I walked out with Willie & my colleagues to threw Asylum &c.  Taylor & Willie his son came to see us this morning and left their cards.  My old friends Dr. Landrum & Co. OHanlon also came.

	I am glad your household are all well.  I shall be glad to see you and the children and especially Hext stepping about.

	Col. Brockman has just informed me that Miss Harriet Walker is in the house opposite & married to a young man by the name Flemings and well married.

	I must now conclude my letter as I have nothing more to say.  Willie has gone to bed & the others are talking in the room.  I have not had time to see about my likeness.  Judge ONeall will be here on Saturday next.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry
