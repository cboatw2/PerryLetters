Letter 87
30 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter yesterday & have not heard from you since.  But I am in the humor of writing again, & what is more I have time to write you this evening, & may not have tomorrow.

	The business of the Senate is growing full of interest.  Yesterday I made my first speech & succeeded in defeating a claim of my friend John Bradly of Sumter for a negro killed whilst working on the road.  I thought the claim unjust.  Therefore went against it although it was the claim of a friend.

	Last night the Board of Trustees met again, & we had quite an interesting meeting & considerable speaking.  I took a part for the first time on the Board.

	Today we had quite an interesting discussion on the Electoral Bill.  The rear of the Senate chamber was filled with Ladies, & in front of me on the other side were several members of Congress on their way to Washington.  Black opened the debate & I followed.  It was not a set speech, but I did very well.  Miss Yates, as she came by me, whispered that she was delighted to have an opportunity of hearing me speak.  I had not spoken to her.

	I drew up a long Report on the Mexican War which I first read in the Committee on Federal Relations and they addressed it in full.  I then read it to the Senate in the presence of Judge Butler & other members of Congress, some from Georgia.  I afterwards went to speak to the Judge. & he asked me for a copy of it.  General Harralson of Georgia & Shannon of the Military Commission in Congress, said he was delighted with my report, that he approved every sentiment & was gratified to find such sentiments to be popular in South Carolina.

	There is a very strong war feeling in the State & in the Legislature especially.  Colonel [Franklin J.] Moses moved to have five hundred extra copies of my speech printed for distribution amongst the people.  Colonel [G.W.] Dargan moved that it be made the order of the day for Friday next.  I drew it up hastily & had no idea that it would produce the sensation it did in the Senate.

	They are going to move against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson in the House with a view of making him resign.  I feel sorry for the poor old man.  It is very likely he will resign this week.  Allen of Barnwell is the member who is going to move on the subject.

	    I find that I commenced my letter on a half sheet of paper & shall have to continue it on another half sheet.  Since writing Col. [Thomas E.] Ware came in & has delayed me.  Our member of Congress Richard F. Simpson is here, & spoke to me today to form a copartnership in law at Anderson C.H. with a Son of Dr. Broyles who has just been admitted to the Bar, & who is a clever & talented young man.  I told him I would do so with great pleasure.    He is a nephew of his wife.

	I saw Mr. {Joel Roberts] Poinsett today & he will remain here for some time.  Several of the members of the Legislature have made enquiries after you & the children,  They seemed to have been struck with my family & observed that they could but admire us as we were walking about with the children.    Dr. Waldo made this remark this evening.

	I have made arrangements with Dr. [Edward] Sill of the Columbia Telegraph to send off two or three hundred copies of my Report.

	I must now conclude.  I will write you again tomorrow if anything of interest occurs.  Edward is a great help to me.  Tell Wille to write me.  Edwin P. Jones is making application for admission in Equity.  I was put on the committee to examine the students in law but could not serve.  Jones came to me today to write his Petition & give him a certificate of moral character which I did with great pleasure.

	Kiss the children for me & believe me truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
