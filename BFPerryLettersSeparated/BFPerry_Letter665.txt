Letter 665
[July 1863] Tuesday morning
[Greenville]

My dear Liz

	I think Bill is to leave for Fannie & Hext to go upday.  They went to a Partie atlast night and are tired thoroughly.

	The news last night was very important & I send you a slip of the Guardian.  No Columbia Papers come.  I saw Hawthorn this morning who told me the news in Columbia was that Lee had whipped the yankees in a great battle at Gettysburgh.  We shall hear tonight the particulars.

	I spent Sunday at General Thompsons with Col. Ware & Bolling.  Col. Martin came up & we met Saturday night and again yesterday & will today & continue till Friday.  Martin says the Commissioners allpay at $8 for every day from our first meeting.

	Court is tomorrow.  I hope to be able to go up next Sunday or Saturday.  We have aof our company.  We had a public meeting yesterday.

	The horses look pretty well.  I hope the corn will be hoed out in time to make some hay.  They were a long time cutting wheat.  But the rain delayed I suppose.

	I shall be very lonely when Fannie goes.  I miss you very much & am like a fish out of water.

	I have nothing to write & Fannie & Hext can tell you all the news.  I dont know which will get there first.  John or Hext.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
