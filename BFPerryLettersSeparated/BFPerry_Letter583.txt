Letter 583
21 April 1860
Charleston

My dear Liz

	After writing you my second letter yesterday, Mr. Butler came to me & we went to see your uncle Arthur.  The House seemed uninhabited. The outerwe aroused his little grandson.  Then cam a servant & finally Col. Hayne who rece[ive]d us very kindly & talked over his battles in which he & Gen. Butler had fought.  The old gentleman is looking remarkably well.  Butler is a fine gentleman.

	In the evening Dr. Porcher came to pay me a visit & wished I should bring with me some friend & he wished a northern man.  I suggested Col. Hagood of Connecticut who is a noble fellow.  But the Col. declined as he had engaged rooms at this Hotel for which he was paying twenty five dollars a day.  He said he wished to be comfortable & it was a matter of very little consequence when he died & whether his heirs had four or five hundred dollars more or less of his Estate!  Col. Hagood is a yankey.  But how have wealthy Southern men taken the same view of the matter.

	In the evening I went to the Theatre to see your cousin T Hayne.  She is very pretty & fine looking.  But when I saw aactor making love to her & kissing her hand I could but feel scorn & contempt for her husband.  I staid only one hour & returned to the Hotel.  Dr. Porcher says she has three children & that such a life for a woman having children is dreadfully hard.

	The Hotel is now a perfect hog pen & I am delighted to quit it as I will do in a few hours.

	Today I have met a great many all pleasantlyGouverneur Kemble, b, Rhett, Col. Preston, &c.  I have not yet seen [William L.] Yancey.  John Cunningham told me last night that he would have me at his House next week to meet Yancey.  I saw Judge [Alexander Beaufort] Meek of Alabama, who is a very fine looking gentleman two inches taller than myself!  Mr. Witherspoon one of the South Carolina delegates said today he had proposed to make me & Preston chairman & Vice President for South Carolina as specimens of South Carolina gentlemen.

	There is no telling what the Convention will do as to the nomination.

	I must now close & go to dinner.  Your affect[tionate] husband, B.F. Perry
