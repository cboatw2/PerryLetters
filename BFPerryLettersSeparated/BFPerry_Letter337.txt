Letter 337
29 November 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening as I was going to meet my committee.  I am surprised you let Hext go to Pendleton; but I am glad he behaved well.

	I asked me to say at which house Miss Susan Hoke shall stay.  I think it probable she would enjoy herself more with the young ladies she goes down with at the American.  I will go there & see her & take care of her.  But we [have] very pleasant company at this Hotel.  You ask me to name the Ladies.  They are changing constantly.  Mrs. D. L. Fair is here & tells me that she will take care of Anna.  There is a Miss Sedgwick a cousin of the authoress here, who sings & plays finely.  Mr. Wheaton whom you saw at Pendleton is here with two daughters who sing & play charmingly.  There is a Bride Mrs. Bail[e]y formerly Miss Bozeman of Charleston.  Dr. Winsmith of Spartanburgh has a daughter & a Miss Mills with him.  Mrs. Col. Herndon came today.  There are a good many others I do not know.  Do not send Frank till I see Col. OHanlon again.  Then if he insists on it he may come down.  But I dislike the expence.

	  I have just been in the drawing room & heard some very fine music.  Mr. Birdsall came to my room & invited me to go down & hear the Miss Weatons sing & play.  Tell Anna I have bought her a very beautiful writing desk ofwith flowers all over it.  It is a beautiful thing.  Price $15.00.

	I must now close my letter.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry
