Letter 480
2 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Son

	I came down here yesterday evening to attend the Court of Appeals & may have to remain here eight or ten days.

	General Thompson came down with me to deliver a Lecture on Mexico.  He asked a good deal about you and how you were getting on at the Naval Academy.

	I saw George Wells here yesterday.  He is very much pleased with the Citadel and is doing wellwas dressed up in his uniform.  Perry was with him who used to go to school at Greenville.  I have not seen Dyer yet or Westmoreland who are both from Greenville.

 	Edward Buist called to see me this morning.  He did not join in the late rebellion and says he has learnt wisdom by experience.  The college is doing very well now.  I saw the President Judge Longstreet this morning.  The Board of Trustees meet on Wednesday.

	If I have time I may come on & see you before I return to Greenville.  I hope you will study hard & get no demerits this month.  We did not receive a letter from you the day before I left home.  But I suppose it was rece[ive]d Saturday.

	They were all getting better at home.  Anna is thought to be out of danger.  Arthur & Hext had had something like scarlet fever & were getting well.

	I have nothing further to write you & must close by subscribing myself your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
