Letter 505
21 November 1858
Columbia

My dear Son

	Your Mother, Anna & myself arrived here yesterday.  Anna stood the fatigues of the journey pretty well, & seems better.  As soon as I get through with my appeal cases in court I will go on with them to Aiken, & return.  The Legislature & the Court of Appeals both meet tomorrow.  I have never seen so many candidates before the Legislature.  They annoy me very much.

	We left the children with your Aunt Susan & I hope they will do well.  We received a letter from you the night before leaving home & were glad to hear you were well & doing well.  If you only knew the anxiety your mother & I felt about you & your success in the naval school I am sure you would study hard & behave well on account of the love you have for us.  It is a matter of the greatest importance to you in after life to pursue your studies now with zeal & energy.

	Edward Buist has taken the first honor in the South Carolina College.  This he did by hard study & industry & good behavior.  His talents are inferior to several in the Class.

	You must write to me in Columbia for the next four weeks.  I shall go on & see you the latter part of December.  I am very anxious to see you again.  It semes a great while since I saw you.  How much pleasure we shall all have in your returning to Greenville next June.  Your affectionate Father, B,F, Perry
