Letter 533
29 May 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d a letter from you last Friday & are glad to hear you will be at home by the 25th of June.  There is a great celebration of the Masons here on the 24th, & a Ball that night.

	  We are all well & I have no news to write except a most hor[r]ible case of poisoning took place at Newberry last week.  Mr. Stewart & his whole family were poisoned by their cook, & it is thought they may all die!  Mr. Stewart lives in Greenville in the Summer at S former place near Poinsetts old place.

	I am glad to hear you say you will not need any more money Willie is wanting all I can well spare.  His expenses have been very heavy.  It is a great saving to have a son educated by the Government, as you will be.  I hope you will think of this & remain at the naval school.

	In great haste, your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
