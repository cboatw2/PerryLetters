Letter 696
Monday night, [1864]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Col. OHanlon has just left my room.  He came up today without having received my letter.  He is on the Jury of the Federal Court & will be here all the week.  Thursday the Court will not sit, being fast day, & the Col. will go down home & take Hext wtith him.  He will have to return Friday & leave hext there.  He may be on the Jury two weeks.  I believe he has someone of his House.  He spoke of Hext hunting with the boys in his absence.  I will enquire further about it.

	I shall come home Thursday.  That day is fastr day & the Legislature will not sit.  They adjourn Thursday week.  But I shall not come back.  The business will be pretty well through  by Fast day.
