Letter 506
28 November 1858
Columbia

My dear Son

	We did not receive any letter from you last week.  You must direct your letters to Columbia S.C.

	Your Mother & Anna are still with me & I do not know whether they will go to Aiken or not.  Anna is very feeble but cheerful though reduced to a skeleton.  We called in Drs Fair & Tresvant.  They give us very little hope of her recovery.  This causes us great distress.  And you must be a good Boy & give us consolation in our distress.

	I rece[ive]d a letter last week from the Revd Edmund Dawse of Sherborn Massachusetts in reply to one I write the Post Master of Sherborn enquiring about my Fathers family there.  He gave me the history of the Perry family from 1679 almost two hundred years ago.  He says his grandmother & my Father were brother & sister.  He had my grand Fathers family Bible before him in which all the births & deaths were recorded.  My grand Father Moses Perry was twice married & dad sixteen children.  This letter has given me great pleasure.

	George Wells has taken the first honor in his Class again, but is in very feeble health.  Dyers son is doing well & stands high in his Class.  I hope you will be stimulated by their example & keep up the reputation of Greenville.

	I have not heard from Willie since I came to Columbia.

	We had two ballottings yesterday for U[nited] States Senator, & the contest seems to be between Governor Adams & Col. Memminger.  But Rhett, Chesnut, McQueen & Manning are running.

	The College Boys are doing well & are all quiet.

	If I can leave here I will go on to see you and if I cannot go I will write to Col. Orr to invite you to Washington Christmas.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
