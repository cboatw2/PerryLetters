Letter 736
4 November 1866
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I received your long letter written on Sunday, yesterday evening & was glad to hear from you at so much length.

	I have nothing special to write you.  I hope Sh purchased the mule & am sorry to hear Wagener is lame.  I am quite well pleased also to learn Cobb has brought the pork  & will bring more & that you are supplied with flour by our good friend Green.

	Mr.  Arthur is to be tried 3d January at Greenville & the trial is to be public.  Mr. McCready wished to engage me as judicial adviser of the Court.  But I declined to have anything to do with the trial.  He wants a younger lawyer to assist & I recommended Captain Earle.  McCready told me last night that Col. Trescott came down with Boyce & McBee yesterday & they told him that the Masons had instigated the charges against Arthur & there was no trust in them.

	I saw Col. Alston Hayne last night.  He is going to move to California.  He says his Brother is pursuing his Profession there & urges him to come.  He told me Arthurs wife went off with a gambler & is now married to himleft her three children bad woman.  How blood will show itself.  I always heard that she was illegitimateborn before her mother married .  But one could hardly expect virtue in an actress & her associations are enough to de her if she has virtue.  Alston seemed very despondent, had lost almost all of his property.  He left for Charleston this morning with two of the H daughters.

	The election of U[nited] States Senator will take place in a few minutes & I suppose [James B.] Campbell will be elected.  He has bargained & bought up enough votes  to elect him.  [Henry Pinckney] Hammett  & [Alexander] McBee and perhaps the whole Greenville delegation except Willie  & maybe [George Franklin] Townes will probably vote for Campbell to get his & his friends votes  for the Greenville Rail Road Bill.  Campbells friends have bargained with Reid, Easl[e]y and [word obscured] about the Secretary election &of them.  I am utterly disgusted with the want of principle.

	Willie recd a letter from Fannie last night saying that she would do to Florida next week by water.  I do not like Fannies separating herself from Mrs. Glover & going [text missing]

	I see Governor Swains letter to me, published in the new York Times.  My letter was crowded out this morning by the Presidents Message.  The President stands firm & insists the South should be represented.  His message is a noble document.

	I have made an arrangement to have a little keg of fresh oysters sent up every Saturday costing $1.25.  They will be about as cheap as any kind of meat & I am so fond of them.

	I hope to get home Friday or Saturday.  I have just returned from the Court of Appeals & the Charleston cases will take all day today.  General [James] Simmons [Simons]  called to see me last night & talk politicsvery well.

	I will now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabethg Perry
