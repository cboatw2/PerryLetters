Letter 537
10 July 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Enclosed I send you a check for $350.00 which I hope will pay off & bring you home.  My expenses this year have been very heavy, & I am glad yours will hot hereafter be so much.

	 We shall be glad to have you & Frank at home once more together.  He is very much improved, but still indolent & wanting in energy.

	I was truly glad to hear of your distinction in your class, but sorry to learn you were not going to speak.

	I had a notice of your distinction inserted in the Patriot & it has been copied with the Carolinian so you return home distinguished & known to the State.

	We are all well or tolerably well.  Clara & Sandys youngest child has been quite sick.  I am somewhat troubled with the summer complaint.

	Why have you not written to us?  Not a word since you left on your tour!

	You will get home just in time for the Commencement at Furman University.

	Thehave just come in & I must close.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

W.H. Perry
