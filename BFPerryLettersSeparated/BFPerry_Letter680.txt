Letter 680
1 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have a few minutes of leisure & will write you a line or two.  Last night I had to meet the Board of Trustees & on my return I stopped in at Dr. LeContes, but Fannie & Hext had gone to bed.  I saw all the rest of the family.  Today they were all in the State House with Fannie & Miss Holbeck.  The House adjourned about two oclock & I met them in the lobby & walked with the ladies into the Senate chamber where we staid some time.  Fannie went off with Miss Holbeck & says she is going to a dance tonight with Miss Holl near her Fathers house.  Fannie seems to enjoy herself very much.  I introduced her to sundry of my friends today & amongst othersGillmore Simms & Col. Pope.  She had already made the acquaintance of Col. Dawkins and Yeadon & others.  Hext is enjoying himself so much that I scarcely get sight of him.

	The war news is pretty exciting.  There has been a battle at Grahamville & the result unknown.  Yesterday we heard of fighting in Georgiawas successful.  The Governor gets telegrams every day from Bragg, Chesnut & General Jones which are read to the House, but are not allowed to go imto the Papers.  It would seem that Sherman avoided Augusta & Macon.  The cadets were ordered from Hamburgh to thehead of Grahamville & may possibly have been in the battle yesterday.  But they could hardly have got there in time.  I have heard nothing from Willie & suppose he is at Wilmington.  Many persons thnik that Sherman is going to Richmondthat he will take water at Port Royal & try & get there before our troops can get back.

	Tell Anne I have sold her twenty dollar gold piece for $650.00 & herfor $750.  She will now have $1400 for the next year.  The interest of Col. Wares & Tuffers Bonds will more than make up for the capital.  In truth Confederate Bonds are of very little value.

	I have not heard from you except by your letter to Fannie.  Do write me.  I was glad to hear you were to send for factory corn & that the Bacon weighed so well.  Your affec[tionate] Hus[band], B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. Wares case comes up tomorrow before a committee ofvthe Senate & I, and C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan  & Col. T.B. Cou are counsels in the case.
