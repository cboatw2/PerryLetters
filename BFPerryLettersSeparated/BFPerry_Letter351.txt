Letter 351
[18] December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The Legislature did not adjourn last night till after midnight.  I did not get to bed till after one.  It is now almost eight oclock in the morning & Mr. Wells will leave in a few moments.  I have just dressed & have time only to say that I am well & will be at home Thursday.  We did a great deal yesterday & I was speaking for five hours last night with short intervals on the state Capitol.  I did not sleep well but feel quite well this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & also one from General Thompson at Wilmington in great agony about his child who was extremely ill.  He requested me to forward the letter to Batten which I did.

	I have not time to write you any further.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
