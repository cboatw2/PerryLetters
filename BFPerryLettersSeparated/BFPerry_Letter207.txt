Letter 207
11 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Your letter of Thursday was not rece[ive]d till this morning.  Last night we were sitting in the House of Rep[resentatives] till midnight fighting over the Bank of the State.   I made a speech of some length & it was very highly complimented.  I think it was about one of my best speeches.  The House was greatly crowded & they listened with much attention.  Col., [Benjamin Faneuil] Hunt & myself had several passages ofin debate.  He was very rude & wrong in his statements & my victory over him was complete.  The speaker had to reprove him & this morning he called me up to his chair & said that his remarks were intended for Hunt & not for me as he stated to the House.  He further said that if the Speaker ever reproved Major Perry for a want of courtesy or dignity in the House or in debate he would go very far out of his way.

	I do not know whether I mentioned last night that Dean of Spartanburgh was elected Clerk of the House. I wrote you two letters by Mr. Beatty [Beattie] last night which I suppose you will get Sunday morning.  I am now writing in the House & interrupted every moment by business or Members coming to my seat to consult me & transact business.

	As you like to hear what is said about me I will tell you what several members have said, who are now serving for the first term.  Dr. [Allard Belin] Flagg told Brockman that he was never more surprised in a man in his lifethat I was just the opposite in everything that he had heard about me.  McKay of Georgetown said he expected to see a fierce warbut that he had found me civil, courteous & dignified & was greatly pleased with me.

	I recd a letter last night from Anna.  She says she will stay & come up with Elford & his wife.  She writes me that she is enjoying herself very much & wishes me to come down & see her before I return home.  But this I shall not be able to do.

	I am glad to hear you are all well.  I think Easl[e]ys wife will have trouble enough unless he is more amiable to her than the rest of mankind.  I am glad to hear that Willie & Frank are employed in such athletic exercise as cutting wood.  I wish them to have good constitutions & would be unwilling to see them spend one year on a farm, working and studying alternately.

	I hope our servants will now do well & am glad you continue pleased with Becky.

	I am very anxious to meet you all again & will leave here most joyously next Thursday.  Imy wife & children better than fame or honors or country or anything else on this earth & had & had rather be with them.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
