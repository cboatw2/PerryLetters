Letter 529
1 May 1859
Charleston Hotel

My dear Son

	This is the day I usually write you & will not omit to send you a few lines.  I came most unexpectedly to Charleston, with Fannie & Annie McBee from Columbia.   They are going to remain with their aunts a couple of weeks & I return home this evening.    They are now gone to church & will come & take dinner with me at the Hotel & then go down to Mrs. Haynes.  I have staid to write to you & Willie.  I have heard nothing from you since I left home. But I suppose your mother.

	We have a great many persons from Greenville in Charleston at this timeCapt. Choice & wife, B Cleveland & family, Robert McKay,  & family, Mrs. Beattie, Hamlin & wife, Willie Beattie & others.

	Your friends have all enquired after you & your must study hard & do well.  Fannie is grown very much & is one of the finest little girls I ever sawso intelligent, so affectionate & so pretty.  She is the admiration of all who see her.

	We wish to see you very much & are looking forward to June with a great deal of anxiety.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
