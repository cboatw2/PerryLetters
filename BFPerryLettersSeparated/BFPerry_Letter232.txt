Letter 232
3 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d this morning after writing to you a letter from you dated25th of Feb[ruary] in which you stated that you had just rece[ive]cd two letters from me and were delighted with them.  I was glad to hear that you had at last rece[ive]d some of my letters.  I have written to you every day since I have been in Washington.  I wrote to you the night I arrived here, six full pages & did not go to bed tired as I was till twelve oclock.  I am grattified too that my letters are read by you with interest.  If they only give you the same pleasure to read that they do me to write I have nothing to complain of.  I love youlove to write to you.  You are my sweetheart, my wife, & the mother of my children & when absent from you my love for you & the children is called into action.  It is then just as strong in my heart when at home as it is when abroad.  But it is inactive or when I dont feel the strength of it till separated from you.  In our intercourse through life you may have found me self willed & seemingly harsh, but this very conduct has been the consequence of my love.  I am more disposed that my children should behave [more]  properly than my servants & hence I reproach them perhaps [more] often than I do my servants.  I do nothing in revenge & therefore do not correct my servants as often as I ought perhaps.

	But I have got to moralizing & will quit it with this expression that I love with an ardent sincerity justice & right in all things.  I am a good [husband] from principle & nature as well as from affection & love.  You too are a good wife from the [same] feeling & principle.

	General Thompson is constant in going to the spiritual; rappers & calling up the spirit of his daughter, wife, father & mother.  Mrs. Thompson in Greenville does not know that he has been in Washington with his first wife.  He told me confidentially the other day that he asked the spirit of his first wife if she was willing for him to marry & she said yes.  He asked if she loved his second wife & she said yes.  If she preferred his marrying her to anyone else & she gave the same reply.  I told General Thompson last night that he was permitting this thing to take too strong a hold of his mind & that it was a fallacy a humbuggery & he ought to throw it off.  That these spirits had told him all sorts of lies & he ought not to believe anything they said.  They told him his cloak, which he lost in Charleston was found & he would get [it], which is untrue.  They told him that Mrs. Jones his wifes mother died in 1825.  But they have told him so many pleasant things that he wishes to believe them.

	He came to our room the other night & told me that he called up the spirit of his mother & she made a bell ring & move all over the floorthat he requested his mothers spirit to touch him & she did so all down the thigh & leg.  He told her to put one of the bells on his arm & he told her to take it off & the bell got off.  I give you this as a specimen of his wonderful sayings & delusions.  I laughed at him & told him I would have him put in the lunatic asylum as we passed through Columbia.

	I have now written you two letters today & will stop & go to dinner.  I am afraid I write you & Elford so much that you will not read my letters & he will not be able to publish them.

	Give my love to your mother & sisters and tell them all that it would now be my greatest pleasure to meet them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
