Letter 598
His Excellency Governor Pickens
My dear Sir

	I take the liberty of enclosing to you the letter of Dexter W. Wells.  He was a young man of good character & killed a man by the name of Head[d]en for seducing his sister.  He was convicted of murder & pardoned by Governor Aiken on the condition of leaving the State & never returning.  He is now in Kentucky and wishes to return and enlist under the Palmetto banner.  I have no doubt he will make a gallant soldier.  He is a young man of sober & good moral character.  If you will pardon him on the condition he enlists in your army, you will receive the services of a gallant fellow.

	He shot Head[d]en in broad daylight in the presence of witnesses & went immediately & gave himself up to the sheriff.

	I am with great respect, yours truly, B.F. Perry
