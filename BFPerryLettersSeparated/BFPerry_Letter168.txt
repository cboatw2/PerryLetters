Letter 168
10 December 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The business of the session is now pressing so hard that I shall not have time to write you as often & as long as I have done.

	The debate on the Federal question is still going on.  Col. Memminger spoke all day today, & I tried to get the floor to reply but it was given to Col. [Elias Chumpton] Leitner.  He was generally expected too, & so understood that I should speak next.  I will probably speak tomorrow or the next day.  Col. Memminger alluded to me in his speech, & said when action comes, I shall then see my friend from Greenville in our midst as I now see him.  I have prepared myself for a pretty good effort.

	[James Washington] Harrison of Anderson came to me today & said he thought when the Legislature met I was alone but now he believed a majority of the House were with me.  I told him I began to feel as now always should in a majority [be] quite magnanimous.  It is true a majority of the House are with me in action, but very hot in words.  Such is Col. Memmingers position.  Col. [James] Chesnut made a very able speech yesterday, & took my ground of a Southern congress.  Col. [Erwin Patton] Jones made quite a failureabout fifteen minutessaid nothing but a few set phrases & I really felt for him but his vanity kept him from feeling for himself.

	The Legislature have agreed in the House to adjourn on Friday week 20th Inst.  So you must send Breechees to Fulks Friday evening.  I will meet him there Saturday morning 21st.  He will leave home Thursday morning & stay at Laurens C.H.  I begin to feel anxious to get homewould be very willing to make my speech & go tomorrow.  The gallery was crowded with Ladies today & Mr.Mauldin pointed out one, whom he said favored you very much.  I did not think so nor do I know who she is.

	I hope to receive a letter from you in one hour.  The children are around me.  They stay with me altogether.  They come into the State House & stand by my side.  Some times the doorkeeper sends them up in the gallery.  But Frank whenever he sees him go off will slip in a boost of his dexterity.

	They have had one ballot for SolicitorReed 63Young 51[Benjamin Yancey] Martin of Abbeville 45.  I think Young will be elected.  The Governors election will take place Thursday.  I think Pickens will be elected.

	I have just got the spoons beautifully engraved.  I have also bought a good many cheap, rare & valuable Booksalso a revolver pistola bottle of colognea hair brush & three beautiful plaster of paris figurinesa cheap pen & pencil for you- a ball & a whip & knife for Franka ball & several books for Willie.

	I went to church on Sunday & heard some beautiful music.  Miss Sally Elmore sings beautifully & I heard her voice above all the rest.  She is a second Jinny Lind.  My friend Dr. Thompson of Union thinks so.  He is the medical student I met in Philadelphia.

	I hope you & household are all well.  I assure you I am very anxious to see you & Fanny & Anna.  Tell Anna she must write again.  I hope too your mother & family are well & that Mr. McBee arrived safely at home.  I wrote a long letter to Mr. Carson the other day.  I would write as I promised to Mr. Croft but suppose he had gone below.

	I must now conclude & believe me dear Liz your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I recd a letter from Elford saying he had recd two hundred dollars from General Thompson.  He was in Baltimore & going on to New York.  I have also recd a most encouraging letter from General Thompson.  He says Elford is in fine spirits.  But strange again the General does not mention his marriage.  B.F.P.
