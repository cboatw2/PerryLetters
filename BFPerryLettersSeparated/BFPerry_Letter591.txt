Letter 591
27 November 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter and.  I was glad to hear you were all well & that Hext is better.

	Willie has got his commission as a Lawyer & has gone to purchase a shotgun.  He speaks of going home in the morning.  He stood a very good examination.  Twenty four admitted & none rejected.

	Edmund Rhett said Willie & Albert Rhetts son who was admitted ought to become acquainted.

	I have been engaged all day & seen very few persons.  Last evening I had a very long talk with Governor Means & Mrs. LeConte.  The Governor complimented me very much & so did General McGowan this morning.  The latter says my ceasing my opposition to the State is spoken of in high terms by all.

	We are a good deal alarmed here by the smallpox.  But I presume there is no danger at present.

	Mrs. LeConte said that Willie was to stayladies, that she had not been able to see him.  Lula looked better at night & seemed complimented by my saying she had grown.  Old Major LeConte is dead & Miss Graham is here in bad health & very sad.  I have not seen her.

       I have nothing more to write & am very busy drawing up Barnetts paper.

       Kiss the children for me.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
