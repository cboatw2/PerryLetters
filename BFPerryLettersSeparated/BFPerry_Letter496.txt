Letter 496
My dear Son

	We received your letter Friday evening, & were glad to hear you arrived safely at Cambridge.  Your mother has requested me to write you today, which is Sunday & say that she will write you again next week.

	I am sorry Edward Stokes did not enter college but am glad he is to remain, & tell him he is pursuing the proper course.  Let him prepare himself for one of the classes & then enter college.

	We heard of you in New York through Mary Mauldins letter.  Elford returned last Thursday, but I have not seen him.  Mary Mauldin came to see Anna yesterday morning but she & her mother hadout.

	General Thompson enquired about you last week & asked me if you were not promising.  I told him I was afraid you were wanting in ambition.  He told me to say to you that you owed it as a sacred duty to your father, who had done so much for you, to be ambitious, have energy & distinguish yourself in life.  I said likewise that I must appeal to your sense of duty to me & your mother to be studious, energetic & prudent.  I hope my dear son you will consider his good advice & follow it.

	It was my great misfortune not to receive a finished education & I have felt it through life.  You will have such an education & be indebted to the hard labors of your father for it.  You must therefore improve it.  General Thompson said no young man in the State would have a better opportunity of doing well than yourselfThat you would fall heir to my professional business & clients & that you must have energy & perseverance & industry to retain them.

	The General also said to me that it was a waste of time novels & the trashy literature of the timesThat it was injurious to the mind, & gave you a distaste to solid substantial learning.

	You must try to improve yourself in every letter that you write & in every piece of composition you make.  You must learn to speak in your societies & debating clubs.  Study well your subject & tell it as you can.  Anyone who can talk may learn to make speeches.

	I hope to receive soon your standing in your class & college.  Send it to me as soon as you can.

	I have no news to write you.  We are all as usual.  Anna about the same.  Hext has had sores on his feet which has prevented his going to school for a week past.  Fannie had the other night a similiar attack to the one you had here, but is now well.  The little girls had a fair in which she took great interest and they made upwards of one hundred dollars for the Sunday school.

	My circuit will soon commence & I am very busy in my office.  William Jacobs negroes have all been indicted for stealing, breaking open his sons house & I am defending them before Donaldson & five freeholders.  The trial will take several days.  The old mans sons are all turning out badly & worrying him to death.  He has worked hard all his life for his children & made a fortune for them.  His sons are all drunkards & worthless.  What a misfortune?  Two of them have married strumpetsone shot himself & committed suicideanother ran off & has never been heard ofa fourth is worthless & harassing his father.

	My dear son let me conclude by instructing you to be good, keep out of bad company, have energy & determine to make yourself a name in the world.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
