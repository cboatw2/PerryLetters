Letter 600
10 March 1861
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I received your letter last night & Fanny also rece[ive]d a letter from you.  We were all glad to hear you had arrived & were well & well pleased with your visit.  You must have had a bad ride from the Rail Road for the roads are really very bad at this season of the year.  We are all well & as quiet as a mouse & very lonely.  All wish you & the children back again.  The servants enquired if any letters had come from mistress, & ever Laura enquired when you were coming back, & expressed a wish for your return.  Alice Roberts staid all night with Fannie Friday night.  Last night no one was here.  Willie & myself have been pretty busy issuing writes.  In the morning I go to Anderson Court& shall expect to meet you at Belton Wednesday evening.

	Nothing has occur[r]ed.  Bill is well again.  John is spading the garden & Mary has been cleaning the walks.  The weather is fine. & the seeds are coming up beautifully.    We had a rain Friday night.

	Fannie seems very well pleased with her teacher& is going to school regularly.  Her cold is almost gone.  I have not seen any of your mothers family since you left nor Susans.

	Captain Adams is to be married Thursday evening to Miss Holloway & Willie is one of his groomsmen.

	No war news yet.  Fort Moultrie fired a gun accidentally at Fort Sumter & Captain Anderson threw out his canon to return the fire when an apology was sent him

	I suppose you & Mrs. Cunningham do not talk politics much.  As you cannot.  Tell her she will live to see the folly of disunion.  I have always admired Mrs. Cunningham very much.  I think she is one of the finest ladies I ever met and I likewise have a very high opinion of Miss Pamela & would be delighted to see them once more.  I hope they will come to Greenville next summer.  Rosemont must look very pretty.  But it is almost like Glencoe, out of the world.

	Judge Magrath wrote me the other day apologizing for not having answered my letter & says Governor Pickens will pardon McMahon.

	Mrs. Levy & Mrs. Barnett came to my office last week & we had quite a quarrel.  They are most audacious women.  Tell Ben I want to see him very muchalso Hext & Hayne.  I miss you all very much. If I was a widower I should have to get married again.  I cannot do without a wife although she scolds me & teases me.  All pleasures have their evils.  But you cannot imagine how quiet we all are.  Servants quiet & doing well.  But they are like me.  They want you at home again to scold & fret & to keep life up & the children to cry & make a fuss.  Life needs society.

	I have written you a long letter, but I am afraid you will not see it before leaving Mrs. Cunninghams.

	Kiss the children for me & give my love to Mrs. Cunningham & Miss Pamela & tell them to come to Greenville.  Your affectionate husband, B.T. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Rosemont
