Letter 7
Sunday morning, [11 December 1842]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am surprised that in none of your letters you have mentioned the death of my Father.  It is possible that you have not heard of it?  Mr. Duncan informed me that Mr. Foster had just returned from Tugaloo & brought the intelligence.  It was a great shock to me, and although he was very old, yet it grieves me much to think I had not seen him before his death.    When I last saw him in the summer little did I think it was to be a final parting between us in this world.  You know that it was our intention to have visited them last Fall.  How sorry I am that we did not do so.  It would have been a great consolation to me now if we had done so and had shown him our two little children, one of whom he never saw.  My father possessed many sterling virtues which I would not have had him to exchange for all the hollow heartedness & proof of wealth & fame.  He possessed a keen heart & a stern unbending integrity of character which would do honor to any one.  There never lived a more honest or a more just man.  I am sure he never did an intentional injury to any one & I believe he did all the good to his fellow men which lay in his power.  I am sure that there is nothing in his long life to exclude him from happiness in another world.

	I am anxious to be at home once more & see you & the dear little children.  I shall finish the last of my business on Monday in the Legislature.  I have already disposed of my business in Court.  And if God spares me I will leave here on Tuesday morning.  You may expect me at home on Thursday evening unless the weather should be as bad as to prevent my travelling.  It is now raining and I am afraid it may not slow up before Tuesday.

	Tomorrow morning I shall hear all about my cases & I will write again.
