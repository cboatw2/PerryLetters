Letter 91
6 December 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College commencement & will write you a second letter for this mail.  I do this because I have a leisure & may not have time to write you by the next mail.  The business of the Session is now pressing on us & Judge Richardsons impeachment comes up tomorrow.  The Senate have agreed to adjourn on Tuesday 14th but I have no idea the House will agree to it, or that we shall adjourn that soon.

	Col. Dargan has just been elected Chancellor by a large vote over Wardlaw & DeSaussure.  Col. Memminger withdrew.

	My Report on the Mexican War has just passed the Senate with only one dissenting vote.  It has been sent to the House & will come up there tomorrow.

	Governor Richardson came to me today, to talk about the Judge & his impeachment.  He says he will defend himself & then resign.  I am truly sorry for the old man.  The Governor asked me my opinion & I gave it promptly that he ought to resign.

	I recd your letter last evening & thank you for your punctuality & kindness in keeping me advised of the news of your household.  It is indeed a great pleasure to hear from you & the children very much.  When absent I love you all more than I do when at home or rather at home I do not realize or feel the extent of my love.  It remains dormant in some measure & is called forth by absence.  I should indeed like to take a peep into my Home this evening & see you & the children.

	I enquired of Col. Isaac Hayne the other day if he had heard from his wife lately & he said she had not written to him  since he had been here.  He then said by way of excuse for her that she did not expect [him] to stay long when he came.  This reflected on him, if he had not written to her since his arrival in Columbia.

	The college commencement was very fine today.  I never saw such a crowd in the Chapel before.  There was an immense crowd of ladies from all parts of the State.  On Saturday they sent a message by means of the magnetic telegraph to Clarks Hotel from Charleston, that a company had just got in the cars for Columbia which would want sixteen rooms.  When they arrived the chambers were all provided for them.

	Mr. [Richard] Yeadon paid me a visit last night, & will remain here till next week.  I saw Mr. Barnwell the minister in the Senate chamber on Saturday, & I got him a seat by my side & we had a great deal of talk.  He was very pleasant & facetious whilst the debate was going on as to the Electoral Bill.

	Col. Preston made a very fine speech today in College.  All the students did well.  Tell Willie I one day hope to hear him make a speech in college & take the first honor of his class.  Judge Frosts son took the first honor today.  He does not seem to be very smart & has a little squirt in his eyes.  A young man from Camden whose name was Villepigue made the best speech on the character of Benedict Arnold.  Whitemarsh B. Seabrook had a son who took an honor & made a good speech.  The latter sat next to me on the platform as one of the trustees & I enquired of him if the young man was a relation, whilst he was speaking.  He replied that he was his son.  He is good looking & better looking than Archey.

	I must now conclude & go to my dinner.  I am really asked to write you such scrawls as I do.  But it is [the] reason I write you so much & so fast.

	My love to the children & mother & family.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F.  Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
