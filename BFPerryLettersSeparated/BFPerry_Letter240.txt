Letter 240
8 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	Last night I rece[ive]d two letters from youone dated 22d February & the other 2d March.  How one of them could have been so long getting here I cannot imagine.  In the one of 22d Feb. you mention having rece[ive]d Judge Evans letter.  The Judge told me that he had written me a letter before leaving home, and I thought [it] strange you had not mentioned it.

	  General Thompson has not heard from home for two weeks & he was affected to tears last night when he brought me up your two letters & had none for himself.  He thinks some of his family are sick & made me run over your letters to see if you mentioned anything about them.  He says he knows Mrs. Thompson has written to him.
	I am very much obliged to you for writing so often & our attention to each other when absent will show our friends how much we think of each other.  Col. Colcock met me the other morning & asked if I had not written to you the conversation of General McQueen Woodward Orr & himself about writing to their wives.  I told him yes.  He said he thought so.

	I hope today to receive a Patriot containing my letters.  It must be full of them.

	I will tell you when I return all about the spiritual rappers.  They are very remarkable indeed.  Governor Corwin came to our room last night & told what had been done in his own family.  His son returned from college & laughed at his father for believing anything about it.  Whereupon the governor & his daughter & some young ladies and his son sat around a little table, put their hands on the table and their fingers pointed in the direction he wished the table to turn & it began to move & as his would wish or direct the table would turn aboutno one touching it.  Then he asked for a spirit & the table would spellhe repeating the alphabet & the table stopping at the right letter till the whole word was spelled!  This is true.

	I hope the case of Dr. Gardiner will be taken up today & that it may be finished this week.  I am most impatient to get home.  General Thompson consulted the spiritual rappers yesterday in the presence of Gov. Tallma[d]ge & Col. Colcock as to the trial & my speech.  The spirit told him that the trial would not take place till tomorrow & that I would make a great speech & excel all the other lawyers engaged on the case.  I hope the spirits tell the truth in this instance.  It is probable we will have to return about our Indian business.

	I must now close my letter.  The books from Livingston will no doubt go safely to Columbia.  I have already got the two volumes for $8.00 very handsomely bound.  I have bought six more shirts, six pairs of drawers & a new hat and six silk pocket handkerchiefs & three pairs of socks.  I wrote to you about your tea set.  It is the prettiest you ever saw.  I have bought a new trunk for us to travel with next summer.  Your loving husband, BV.F. Perry
