Letter 437
28 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you the other day & was so much pleased with it that I sent it to your mother with one I had recei[ve]d from Anna.

	I am delighted to hear you continue pleased with your school & have recei]ve]d no more demerits.  I hope you will be particular in that respect.  Also you must study hard & learn your lessons well & take a high stand in your class.  Your last report was pretty good, but I hope the next will be better.

	You must tell Bradford that I thank him for the paper sent me & when I return home I will notice it.  In my absence your mother wrote a paragraph acknowledging the receipt of it.  This is her first editorial.

		We have elected Judge Longstreet of Georgia President of the South Carolina College.  He has been President of the Mississippi University.  The College is doing very well now.  There are 170 students.  Mr. [Charles] Venable of Virginia has been elected to the chair of Mathematics.

	Your mother concluded it was not worthwhile to send you a box of books & bed quilts, as you could purchase blankets and books for what the box would cost by Adams Express.  If you study hard after mustering with your musket & drawing theyou will not have much time to read miscellaneous books.  But when Willie comes on we may send you something.

	I shall certainly go & see you next summer before you start on your cruise, & perhaps your mother & some of the children may go with me.

	As you receive the Patriot, you will see in my published letters all the news of the Legislature & Columbia.

	I shall be glad to see your likeness.  Willie says he had his taken the other day in Boston for ten cents, & that if you were there you might supply all your pretty girls who asked you for it, without breaking you.  Have you given your likeness to any of them yet?

	I am glad your mother sent you Fannies & I think the students in saying it is much prettier than you.  Fannie is one of the prettiest little girls I ever saw &is very smart.  She is improving very fast.

	I saw General Martin the other day & his son Willie who has grown very much, and he is a fine looking boy.

	You must write to me as often as you can & remember to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller.  You must also present my respects to Captain Blake when you call to see him.  Give my love to your roommate & friend Bradford.

	This is Sunday & I have been all the morning writing letters.  It is the only leisure day I have.   Between the Courts & the Legislature & the College I am worked hard & kept very busy.  I write to your mother every day & also to the Patriot every day.

	I read a letter from your mother last night.  They are all well.  I wrote to Anna last week & have just written a letter to her today.  She is very much pleased with Lula LeConte who is at school with her & who is the daughter of Professor LeConte of the South Carolina College.  I told her to tell Lula that I would give her choice of you or Willie.  But as she is about your age I expect she will prefer Willie to waiting for you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
