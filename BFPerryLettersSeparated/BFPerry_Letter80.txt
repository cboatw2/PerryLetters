Letter 80
3 November 1847
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines tonight as Colonel Townes will return in the morning.

	We had quite a spirited meeting here today, & I made a pretty good speech which has taken well.  My prospects are as good as I could expect & I rather think that I will beat Colonel Orr at almost every Box in the district.  From Pumpkin Town Esquire Sutherlin writes me I will get two thirds of the Box.  & others tell me that I will get three to one at Fair Play.  W. Lee says I will not loose a vote on Corneross.  At Bachelors Retreat I will beat  The news from other places is very similar.

I saw Lee & gave him the bundles for Mrs. Dunlap.  He gave me one for Anne.  I saw Foster & his son Clark.  Josiah was not here.  His health is bad.  The rest of my relations are all well.  Josiah has a fine crop.

	In consequence of the absence of General Tompson I have been employed in several of Keiths cases.  I do not now expect to get off from here before Friday morning.  William seems very well satisfied & is now sitting up reading Headeys Lives beside me & it is near nine oclock.

	Colonel Townes left home this morning at four oclock he tells me & returns in the morninga pretty flying visit.

	I have nothing more in the way of news to write you.

	Kiss the children for me.  Will had a present of chesnuts today from a countryman & will carry them home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
