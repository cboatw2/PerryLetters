Letter 712
1 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday & I suppose you rece[ive]d mine last night announcing what was to you very good news.  The election of myself to the U. States Senate by such a large majority 109 votes was indeed most grattifying.  The Parish members did not vote for me & thru away their votes on Governor Manning to damage him in the next election with my friends.  Gov. Manning heard of it the over night & sent me word that he did not & would not oppose me.  Still when the election came on the Greenville delegation did not vote for him in consequence.  But as soon as they understood the trick of Col. Campbells friends they went for Manning.  This morning Campbell & Trescot have withdrawn & will run Col. Dawkins.  But I think Manning will beat him.  If I hear the result in time I will write a postscript to this letter.

	You ought now my dear wife to be happy after the honor bestowed on me.  I am Senator for six years & the other Senator will only be for two years.  There was so much intriguing by all, that it is remarkable that I ran so well.  But some have shown very little grattitude in voting against me.  Col. [Charles Henry] Simonton  whom I had released from Prison & who called to see me in the Convention to express his grattitude voted against me.  So did Buist, Frank Porcher, Col. Davant & Townsend.  The latter I had done much for in trying to get back his lands.  But there is very little grattitude in public life.  Some of the Parish members voted for me, Dozier & Shaw &c.

	I have rece[ive]d several telegrams from President Johnson, but nothing about Governor Pickens pardon.  Mrs. Pickens is still here & has a dozen beaux around her.  But influence could not elect her husband.  She has great fascination of Manning & so pretty that I thought she would work wonders in electioneering.

	I will now conclude and write a P. Script if possible.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I am grattified to inform you that Gov. Manning has been elected my associate in the Senate over Col. Dawkins.  The vote was 95 to 50.  I did not think it right to manuver as they did against Manning.  I am very kind towards Dawkins.
	Ch[ancellor] Dunkin is Chief Justice.  I shall run home some day soon to see you.  B.F.P.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
