Letter 391
6 April 1857
Greenville

 My dear Son

	Your letter was rece[ive]d Saturday evening & enclosed I send you twenty dollars more which you must take care to keep & spend judiciously.  Your expences in college are amounting to a good deal more than I expected.

	In return for these expences I hope you will endeavour to improve your time & opportunities to the very best advantage.  Strive by hard study and good conduct to reward your Parents for all their care, troubles & expence in your education.

	Guard against the first step in vice & immorality.  The second step is easier than the first & so on to ruin.  The same too in regard to your studies.  I hope you will distinguish yourself in your class.  You must have studied a good deal in the course you are now going over.  This ought to make it easy for you to keep ahead of your fellows.

	Sam McClanahan is the person who told me that he saw you in Columbia.  The name of the young lady is Mary McLain of Spartanburgh.  The suit was brought by me against John Baldwin of this district.

	Why is it that I have rece[ive]d no report from the Faculty as to your progress in college.  More than there months have elapsed since you entered college?  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. You say you have a bad cold.  Be careful to wear your winter clothing throughout the spring.  There is more danger from colds, at this season of the year than any other, & more danger of catching them.  Never change your dress too soon in the spring.  Remember this through life.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry

Mr. William Hayne Perry
