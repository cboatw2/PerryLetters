My dear Liz

	I shall be detained here till Saturday night, & will not be able to visit my brothers plantation on my route to Pickens court.

	General Whitner was taken sick yesterday, & I have been employed in all of his cases.  We have been all day trying a will & not yet through.  There are four or five other cases to try.  I hope I shall make somethingby this court.

	I will be at home as soon as I can make my escape from Pickens.

	You must write me on Sunday by Mr. Elford, Townes or Choice and let me hear all your newshow you are doing &c.  How Reuben comes on with the corn &c.

	I was at a musical concert last night at Mrs. Daniels Academy & heard all of her scholars perform.  Saw & spoke to Mrs. Daniels, Miss Payne & Mrs. Mays & Miss Marion.  They all enquired after you.

	It is now eleven oclock & I have just prepared a speech for tomorrow in a will case.  I must now go to bed.  Good night, your truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
