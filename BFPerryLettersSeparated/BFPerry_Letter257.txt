Letter 257
26 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before going into court, as I will not have time to write afterwards in time for the mail.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Tuesday and General Thompson rece[ive]d one from Mrs. Thompson.  He has complained to her & she now writes oftener.

	I am sorry to hear Becky is unwell & hope she may not get worse.  I am glad you mention in your last letter all about the children.  Here are the letter I read with most interest.  You must not worry me so much about office, fee, & seeing the President.  Be assured I will do in thewhat my best judgement dictates.  The President is annoyed to death at present & I have no doubt hates the sight of a man.  Thousands are calling every day & can only say howdy & good day.  There is not a moment to talk with him.  You speak & pass on.  In the Gardiner case I will do the best I can.  In regard to office there is none that I would have.  Have nothing for the pictureto my dear wife butondo no good & only fret & worry me.  And I have enough to fret & work about in this case & in my absence from home & anxiety to return home.  Your letters should soothe me & comfort me.  Kindness & love is what I want from you & the children not so much of advice and scolding &  Look on the bright side of our picture.  It is a beautiful onehealth &--a fair standing in the worldand hope in our childrengood & pure heartsand with these we ought to be happy.

	Yesterday a black & dirty fellow came in the Hotel to sell pork.  General Thompson said to me that fellow is happier than any man he leaves behind him in Washington.  I replied yes the President not excepted.  There is constant & unpleasant vexation in office & honors.  If you could only see the miserable looking faces here among the office seekers you would feel thankful that I was not amongst them.

	I still have a bad cold & constant blowing of my nose, which annoys me very much.  I am prepared to make a good speech in this case but in allwill have to close for Greenville court before the case is argued.

	I must now quit & go into court.  There is some sharp sparing in court every day between May & Bradl[e]y & Carlisle.  I tell them we are more cautious in South Carolina.

	God bless you & the children.  Give my love to all of them & to your mothers & sisters. Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
