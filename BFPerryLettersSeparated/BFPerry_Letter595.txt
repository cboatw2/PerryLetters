Letter 595
11 December 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

I have just rece[ive]d your letters & thanks you kindly for them.

	I have been all day in court & will get through my cases on Thursday.  Elford will go up Thursday.  He is in my room staying.

	I read a paper from Col. Tom Janes containing strong union Resolutions & speech of his.

	Toomes & Gantt write me about your trees & say there are no others.

	Judge Oswald says he wrote me last week & put the letter in the Post office.  He was surprised I did not receive it.

	I have nothing to write except what you will see in the papers.  The election for Governor was to have been today.  Pickens, Johnson, Rhett & T are running.  It is likely Pickens will be elected.

	I attended to Mr. Ys business last night.  But Fuller is here on the same business & I dont know which will get the road.  They are bidding against each other .  They are bidding $1800 per on.

	I am sorry Paul was not arrested Saturday.  I hope Willie can assist him in preparing the papers.  I will attend to the case down here.

	I am glad to hear ben is well & all the rest of you.  You need not be afraid of [words obscured] caught [words obscured].  He is too smart for that.

	I have nothing more to write.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
