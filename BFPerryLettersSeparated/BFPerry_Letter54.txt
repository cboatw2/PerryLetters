Letter 54
12 August 1846
Richmond

My dear Liz

	I am happy to be this far on my return home to you & the children and am very much tempted to go on by Charleston.  Judge Butler & many others are going that way.  But I do not consider it entirely safe and if I returned through Columbia I should have to stay there at the Court of Appeals.

	The morning I left Boston I recd your last letter & on my return to New York I found two more only.  The two first you wrote me are last in some way.  I was delighted to receive all your letters & read them on in the cars as I came on.

	When you see Mrs. Butler tell her I was most pleased with Mrs. Rodgers and her family.  If Miss Rodgers wardrobe had been completed she would have come on with me.  Her mother says she is insane on the subject of her visit to South Carolina.  She will remain twelve months with Mrs. Butler & will come on in September.  She is about the size & age of Behethlen Butler & seems quite a pleasant girl.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Rodgers, who must have been a very handsome woman when young.  He sons seem clever.  One is in the navy & the other in the army & gone to Mexico in September.  There was a little chap about thirteen or fourteen who was standing with a string of crabs in his hand looking at me.  His brother called him & said to him you have let that gentleman [page torn, word illegible] you with your crabs & he is a relation of ours.  Well said the little fellow I saw him when he got out of the Boat & I saw then he was one of our kin.

	I have just had a visit from James mother & brother.  She is quite a good looking woman about the colour of James and seems sweet & sensible.  James must take his bad qualities from his father, who ran away to a free state as his mother tells me.  She gave me a letter, a brush & 25 cts to give James.  The Brother of James looks lazy too & is the son of a white man as he is nearly white.

	I did not see General Thompson on my return to Washington.  He will leave there in four or five days with Governor Butler by the way of the Virginia Springs.

	Miss Rodgers informed me that Miss Thompson & Mr. Jones were engaged & Miss Crayton & Mr. Rowland,  I told her this was news to me.

	Governor Butler looks to be in very bad health, a mere wreck of himself.  His difficulty with Mason is unsettled and I did not learn the particulars.

	I must now conclude as I must pack up & get breakfast in time for the cars.  I hope to be at home in the course of ten days, or perhaps sooner & do not know the stage rout[e] &c. & cannot speak with certainty.

	Kiss the children for me & remember me to mother & family & all friends.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
