Letter 726
Wednesday evening,  [ca. Dec. 1865]
[Columbia]

My dear Lizie

	The river has been so high that the stage could not cross for two days past.  It is now about starting & Capt. McJunkin says he was take a letter & bundle of papers.

	We are all well but the rains have prevented our going out.  I was to have gone with Fannie today to the Legislature.

	Yesterday there was a sharp dispute between Col. Campbell & Warley & today Warley challenged Campbell.

	I am waiting to hear from Washington & will return home as soon as I have.

	Nothing new.  The legislature adjourns on the 19th.

	Give my love to the children.  I hope to hear from you in the morning.

	In haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
