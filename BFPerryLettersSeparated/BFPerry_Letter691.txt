Letter 691
15 December 1864
House of Rep[resentatives, Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I received your letter last night in which you state that my leytter of the 8th by Thurston was not received till Thursday morning.  This is strange.  I wrote you a long letter Sunday which you ought to have received Monday night & yet you had not received it Tuesday morning.  I am afraid my letters are delayed a whole day in Columbia in consequence of not being sent to the Post office in time to be mailed the night sent.  I shall drop this in the Box here & hope it will [be] sent in time to be mailed & you will receive it Friday evening.

	I shall endeavour to go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin I would not return at all.  I am honestly tired of Columbia &, & wish to be with my wife & children.  I wrote you fully last night, & have very little to add this morning.  By staying till the end of the Session I shall be able to get the money for Norton & others for loss of slaves on the coast & out of the money I shall receive large fees.  Last night after writing to you, Sam Jones nephew of Col. [James] OHanlon came to see me & got me to write an obituqary notice of his incle, which I have done & which you will see in the Caroolinian tomorrow.  He showed me a copy of OHanlons Will.  It was written just before he died so Hext is not mentioned in it or anythiung given to him.  I think this very mean on the part of OHanlon after telling me & Hext that he had given him a negro boy..  He gave all of his property to his nephews & nieces except a negro to his Executor Dr. Ray.  It is wrong to expect anything from anyone.  And Ihappy to know that I have made.  I am& have supported & educated my children so far with credit.  I am now doing well & making something & hope that I may have[word obscured] for my family.  I could not be placed in any position where I would do better.  I am happy in being always with my wife & children, & working for their support.

	I have just seen Fannie.  She & Ellen Janney & Ho came down to the State House to see me.  She came to my room about ten minutes after I left there.  She wanted to arrange about the day she leaves here & goes to Dr. Crofts.  She said that she was going to write you, but finding that I was writing to you she said to tell you  she would not.  Fannie is quite well & looking well.  She saw Mrs. Pickens at the Hotel this morning who said she was going round to see her.  I took breakfast with Mrs. Pickens & the Governor & had a great deal of chat with them & Miss Manning.

	The Governor will be inaugurated tomorrow.  Fannie said she would not come to the State House today buy will come tomorrow.  Ellen Janney & Mr. Janney insist very much on Fannie staying there some time before she goes up.

	The weather is warm & pleasant buy cloudy & will rain tomorrow.  I will now close bymyself as ever your affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. You may expect me Saturday night & send a horse & saddle to the depot for me or the little carriage. B.F.P.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
