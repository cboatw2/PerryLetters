Letter 571
19 February 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your letter to Willie was received last week & I also rece[ive]d your Report.

	It seems you have fallen back a little in Mathematics & Seamanship.  These are two of the most important branches of study & you must try & recover by the next Report.  I have confidence in your studying hard now.

	Willie wrote you last Sunday & I did not.  In the morning Willie starts to Memphis Tennessee & perhaps to New Orleans before he returns.  He goes with James Benson to recover three negro men who were carried off by Elias Roberts belonging to my client Miss Clary Benson.  Miss Benson pays their expenses & gives them each fifty dollars for their services.   They will be gone about two weeks only.

	Poor Newton Loveland died last week of dissipation & consumption.

	We are all well.  Hext is up at General Thompsons, but returns in the morning to school.  Hext is a great favorite with the General & Preston.

	I recei[ve]d a letter from Col. Ashmore last week.  He said he had recei[ve]d a letter from you & would write you soon.

	Mr. Mahon is to be tried here in the federal Court in Augusta.  It was a mistake about his being tried in Charleston.

	I have nothing particular to write you except to encourage you to persevere in your studies & rise in your class.  It is a great comfort to me & your mother to know you are doing well.

	I said we were all well.  Clara has been sick, but is better.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
