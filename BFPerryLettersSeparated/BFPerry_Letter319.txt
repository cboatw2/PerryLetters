Letter 319
20 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter & have but a few moments to write you before going down to the House where I shall be till midnight

	I have had a bad cold & a sore throat which I think I caught Sunday whilst sitting in my dressing gown waiting for my trunk to be opened.  These night sessions have increased my indisposition & I would notdiet but for very pressing matters.

	I shall rejoice to be at home once more & only wish I was nowwith you & the children before the fire & could go to bed at nine instead of sitting up till midnight.

	We had quite a snow here last night for a few moments.

	I saw Mr. Wells just now.  He says Mr. Elford came down with him.

	I saw Captain Cunningham here yesterday.  John seems disposed to be civil and kind but was very shy at first.  I think there must be something forbidding and austere in my appearance when I do not like a person.  It is seldom anyone takes liberties with me.

	I rece[ive]d a message from Miss Brenan last night that I must go & see her.  She goes to New York Friday.  I shall not go.  I have not time.

	I saw Governor Adams today & told him to say to Mrs. Adams & his daughter that I regretted extremely not being able to go and see them.  I told him you had been criticizing his Inaugural & said it seemed he opposed everything I had advocated.

	He told me that I was under solemn promise to go & see him next May & every May & that he should prepare for that.

	I saw Col. OHanlon today who enquired about you & Willie & Frank.

	I must now conclude in great haste & as you like to see my Editorials I send you the enclosed.

	This is my last letter to you before retiring.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
