Letter 380
8 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now past twelve oclock in the night & I have just returned from Mr. Yeadons supper to the Press.

	Burt & Aldrich dined with me today & I could not write you.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.  Several letters came to me tonight &  one to Willie from Willie Beattie which I enclose.

	I have spent the day rather in a disway & have not time now to write you.

	I will do better tomorrow.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
