Letter 338
29 November 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have but a few moments to write you.   Last night I was at the meeting of the Board of Trustees till very late.

	I rece[ive]d your short letter last night just before I started to the College & was glad to hear you were all well.  I shall be glad to see Anna & Willie Saturday morning.

	I dined with Governor Adams Tuesday & they were very kind in their enquiries about you & the children.  I went from there to Dr. Labordes & staid till twelve oclock.  We has quite a literary meeting an account of which I have written for the Patriot.  Tonight I am invited to Mr. G.M. Thorp,but cannot go.

	I saw Mr. Blake yesterday who said he came up as far as Kingsville with Miss [Suzanne Mandeville] Sparks who spoke in terms of great admiration & affection for you & me & sent her best respects to me.  Her father who was with her said if anything was to happen to Mrs. Perry his daughter would try & take her place.  Mr. Blake said he was not willing that Mrs. Perry should yet take her place among the angels in Heaven.  Miss Sparkes will not be in Columbia.  I saw Col. Keitt last night.  He was in Charleston with Miss Sparks.  I saw Col. Wilson with him & it may be true that they will yet get married.

	I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin.  Their families are all well.

	Last night at the Board of Trustees I made a speech & a warm one in favor of Dr. Lieber as President.  Mr. Barnwell spoke in favor of Professor McCay.  Mr. Petigru spoke in favor of Dr. Lieber, the
election taking place Wednesday.  It is very doubtful who will be elected.

	I hope Wily & Charles will go on clearing.  I should suppose two or three weeks was long enough for Minerva to stay at Pendleton.  I am glad Stroud sent the corn.

	I must now conclude.as Mr. Bossett is about starting.  Old Mr. McBee is here also.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
