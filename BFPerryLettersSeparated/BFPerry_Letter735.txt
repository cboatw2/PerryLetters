Letter 735
10 October 1866
Greenville

Dear Madam [Mrs. Eliza R. Laurens]

	I recei[ve]d your letter last night with your circulars respecting your school.  The other circular about the Raffle I did not receive.

	The people of Greenville are so poor & hard pressed for money, that I am not able to give you any encouragement as to the Raffle.  And I may say the same in regard to your school.  No one, not living here, has any idea of the utter destitution of our people.

	It would give me great pleasure to aid you in both your school & raffle if it were in my power to do so.

	I am with great respect & esteem.  Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry
