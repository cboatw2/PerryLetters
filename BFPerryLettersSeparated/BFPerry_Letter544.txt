Letter 544
29 November 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived here safely as our friend Stacey prayed that I might do.  My room was retained for me, & I took into it my old friend H[enry] C[linton] Young who was without a room.  There was a great crowd on the cars & no less than five.

	I went to the court this morning & saw twenty-six students admitted Rice amongst them.  I then went with Chancellor to his room to get a decree for the sale Mayor Smiths land.  He spoke to me of the letter he had written you.  I told him it was very gratifying to you.  He said, a parent might think it was a back breaking affair to loose a child & it was bad enough for he had experienced it, but it was nothing to loosing a wife.  No human misery & affliction was like that which he too had drunk to the dregs.  He then spoke of his first wife, & I thought strange of it as he married another wife soon after the death of his first.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte enquired kindly & affectionately after you & all the children.  Mrs. LeConte is not so stout as she was.  Lula will graduate next July & return home in the fall.  Dr. LeConte has a niece with him who reminded me of Lula.

	There was nothing done of interest in the Legislature yesterday or today.  I presented Mrs. Rowlands petition, Dr. Crooks petition about sheep & dogs, and Peter Caubles about his son Willia[ms].

	McKay, Thomas & Jeter are here electioneering very hard.  I think McKay will be elected.

	Mr. McBee has just arrived & brings the news of Joab Mauldins death.  I met Dr. Goodwyn going up to see him at the instance of Mrs. Mauldin, but turned back on receiving a message that Mauldin would be dead before he could reach Greenville.  He told me that there were one hundred & fifty Methodist Preachers on the cars going up Monday & they had been furnished with a paper where they were to stay.

	  The Governors message is pretty fierce & firery.  Col. [Beaufort Taylor] Watts enquired after you.  Col. Hayne also.  Young DeTreville who once was at our house came up & spoke to me yesterday.  He is very much improved.  I have onlyto  Rhett at a distance & have not yet spoken to him.

	I hope you are getting on very well with our Methodist friends, the children & the servants.

	The Governor has one of Dr. Fairs houses & Col. Allen has another.  But Janney has a greater crowd than I ever saw here.  Yeadon has gone to Roaches old House.  I am sorry for that.  Pope is here & is as lively as ever.  Memminger came today & Judge Frost.  I sit at Dr. LeContes table with Pope & others by invitation of Mrs. LeConte.  She sits at the head of the table & assigned me a seat on her left & the Dr. on her right.  Pope said to her she was the presiding Empress of our table.

	I have bought a new hat & waistcoat.  The weather is very warm & I cannot wear my overcoat.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  God bless you & the children.  Give my respects to Stacey & Ship[]p].  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
