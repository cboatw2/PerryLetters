Letter 277
19 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line.  It will be the last too that I shall be able to send you before I have the pleasure of greeting you myself in proper person.

	Nothing has occurred today worth writing.  I made a few remarks on the Lunatic Asylum and defeated the proposition to remove it.

	I see Mr. Taber declines publishing his address in a note which appeared last night in the Charleston Mercury.  He tries to evade the matter.  I am sorry for the poor fellow & if I had known the extent of the mischief that I was doing him I should have spared him.  But his address was on outrageous popular feelings.

	I have written out my address & shall publish it in the next Patriot after my return home.

	It is now after four oclock & I have just been with Anna to purchase an Album for one dollar.  She seemed very anxious to have one. I have never seen anyone crying herself so much as Anna has.  If she were larger I would not have her here as there is too much association with gentlemen for a young lady.  Anna is very smart & lively & makes herself interesting to everyone.  I think she has more mind than any girl of her age I ever saw.  Willie does better & behaves more like a man since his associates William B & B have gone.  He now associates with men & listens to the scholars in the Legislature.

	Tomorrow we adjourn.  I am very anxious to see you & the children.  I hope to hear from you when the mail is opened.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Graanville.
