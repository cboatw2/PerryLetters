My dea Liz

	Harrison came yesterday with your letters, all of which I read twice & was delighted to hear from you.  I am very anxious to see you all & really it is a great deprevation to be separated from you.  As soon as the weather is good I will go up & stay two or three days with you.  But you muast come down as soon as possible.

	Fannie went down with Mrs. Barnett Cleveland yesterday just before your letters came & will probably stay till tomorrow.  Annie went also.  Fannie is verey anxious for you to come home.  She wished the other day that I should go & bring you down.

	The household is getting on pretty well.  I have not seen Anne for two weeks.  Your mother carries to her meals.  Edward is getting better,  He had a rising in his throat which is so prevalent.Harry is spading up the garden.  Charlotte has hauledmanure one or two days.

	I will send you the thread or spun yarn by Moss.  The cost of no. 9 was $3.50 & the cost of no. 10 was $4.00  a bunch.  There are 16 Bunches, 10 of no. 10 & 6 of no. 9.  Sister brought your cotton bats, ten pounds more thatn you sent for.

	I have got 306 pounds of Bacon of Sam McClanahan at 60 cts per lb.  I bought 61  pounds of buttrer of a Buncombe waggon at 65 cts a pound.  It is very fine butter, but a little rancid or strong.  But it is cheaper than lard.  I had to pay 75 cts for lard & bought five dollars worth.  We are now eating turnip salad & hog jowls.  I still have beef.  Mr. Moore bought 100 bushels of corn for me in Abbeville at $2.00 per bushel.  It will be here next week.

	If you can get corn at $2.00 [per] bushel, engage 100 bushels.  Corn is now selling here at $2.85 & 2.50 per bushel.  Engage the corn at once.  If you can buy M Carrolls Bacon at 50 or 60 cts get it.

	The yankees commenced their movements towards Savannah the other day & bombarded Fort McCallister two days & quit.  They did no harm.  [Earl] Van Dorn gained a great victiry over the yankees in Tennessee. Killed & wounded 1000 , took 3000 prisoners &c.  His loss being heavy.

	I have heard nothing from Willie saince Ed Stokes came.  They are now recruiting & following theirin the valley of Virginia.  Dr.  Williams came back the other day,.  He has an appointment in the Hospital at Atlanta Georgia

	I have got some more garden seeds which I will  bring up.

	I have had no business lately oif any consequence.  Your aunt Sarah made her will the other day & wrote it herself.  I dont know its contents.  I made $700 by my sale of S.C. Bills.

	Tell Frank Fisher to stay at home till sent for.

       I hope Hext, Hayne & Ben are saying their lessons every day.
