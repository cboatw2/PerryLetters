Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I shall be at home tomorrow evening.  There is very little business in court, & I shall have disposed of mine before tomorrow evening.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from McKay this morning & also saw Goodlett & Jones.  They all report favorably as to my election.  But that Brockmans doubtful.   Stork too that Campbell may [be] elected, & report Barrett way behind.  In haste yours &c., B.F. Perry
