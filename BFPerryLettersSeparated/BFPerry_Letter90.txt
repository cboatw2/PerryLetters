Letter 90
Sunday, 4 December 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

I received your letter by Fridays mail, & hope to get one from you this evening.  You commenced your last letter by saying you had nothing to write & yet I think it was the most interesting one I had recd from you this Session.  You spoke of your children & yourself, your household. Servants, &c.  I am exceedingly anxious to be one of your household again.  Indeed, my dear wife, I do not think I can bear a winter in Washington from you & the children.  I begin to have great misgivings about the course I have pointed out for myself.

	I have made a few purchases for you & the children in  ..ioner with your request & instructions.  For you I have bought the beads, also a strand for Susan.  Tell Willie I have bought him a pretty little knife with two blades.  For Anna I have bought a glass doll, and a sheep with a little girl on it, which is very pretty.  For Frank, a knife with a green handle & also a set of marbles.  I have also bought a large quantity of candy of all kinds & shapes, four pounds.  I will purchase a basket for Anne, if I can find oneif not something else.  I wrote you in my last letter about the broach.  For Fanny I have purchased a rattle, whistle & ivory ring all in one, which may be separated into three pieces.

	Yesterday we had the Electoral Bill under discussion & will conclude the debate on Tuesday.  Col. [Franklin J.] Moses made a very able speech in favor of my Bill.  He, all the week kept postponing his speech & at last I found out the cause.  His wife was expected & came Friday night & was in the Senate chamber yesterday waiting to hear him.  She is a tall fine looking woman & is said to be quite intelligent & accomplished.  You may remember how ugly the Colonel is.  Mr. Carrol & Miss Charlotte Smith were in the Senate chamber yesterday & I spoke to them.

	Last night I went to hear Mr. [George] Gliddon in company with General Thompson & others.  I had the pleasure of falling in company there with Col. Preston & Dr. Henry.  There were a good many persons present at the lecture & some ladies.  I was much pleased with the lecture & would tell you a great deal about it if I had time.  I saw a variety of Egyptian curiosities, four or five thousand years old, a mummys coffin, arm, hand, head, scull &c. &c., clothes, shoes, sandals, writing, &c. &c. The likeness of Cleopatra & her son Caesoria.  In looking at Cleopatra I was reminded of Annes face & skin, expression &c.

	Yesterday I dined with the Governor.  There was a large party, Poinsett, the Judge, Chancellors, Governor [Edward Bishop] Dudley of North Carolina, Governor [John P.] Richardson, Dr. Mr. Petrus who married Miss Harper.  He is a very large & old man, was a widower, & the cousin of Mrs. Harper, had been a member of Congress, did not offer to be anything very great.  Governor Dudley is very large & rather good looking.  General Thompson & General Whitner & Major Henry were also at the dinner.

	  I have been interrupted two or three times since I commenced writing by persons coming into my room.  Colonel Hodges is here from Greenville & he has been to see me.  General Thompson started for home today, by the way of Edgefield.  Tomorrow is commencement in College.  Someone sent me through the Post office a Ball ticket for Commencement Ball.  The ticket has the name of Lipscombe on it & perhaps he sent it.  I suppose he is a student in college, & perhaps a manager.  We had quite [a] contest in the election of two Trustees of the College on Friday night.  Mr. Poinsett was run but got beat by [Robert Wilson] Gibbes & [Francis Hugh] Wardlaw.

	The name you could not make out was Gilmore Simms, the novelist &c. [pagetorn] had just put him in nomination for Lt. Governor last year.  They became rather intimate.  I write you in such haste that I am not surprised you cannot read my letters.

	The Resolutions against Judge [John Smyth] Richardson were introduced yesterday & will be considered on Tuesday next.  The old Judge seems to have brushed up since his impeachment.  He looks five years younger.

	I will now conclude my letter, & go to the Post office to get one from you.  I have been writing out a speech today on the Electoral Bill.  Tell Willie he must write me again.  Tell Anna I am glad to hear she is reading so well.  Tell Frank I think of him dream of me every night.  I expect Fanny will be so much grown I shall hardly know her.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S.  Col. Dargan will beat Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger for Chancellor.  We have had three ballotings & no election but Dargan is 21 votes ahead.  General [Joseph N.] Whitner is not running.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
