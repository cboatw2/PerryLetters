My dear Liz

	It is now half after ten oclock in the night & I have just finished my pleadings in threecases of slander which are to be tried here this week.

	I write you a line to inform you that I may not be at home till the latter part of the week.  I have been employed today in the management of an important case & we are to argue it tomorrowYoung & myself on one side and Irby & Sullivan on the other.  My fee will be $100.

	I have been employed in four other cases of great importance.  Three of them will probably be tried this court & the fourth next court.  I have also another case here in which I was employed last court & a case of some importance.  It will likewise be tried this week.

	You perceive I am doing well from home.  My practice here is valuable to me.

	I am very anxious to hear from you & the children.  But suppose I hope you are all better.  If the children become worse you must write to me & I will return immediately.

	Judge Wardlaw is presiding & I find him pleasant & agreeable.  I have not seen or heard from Mr. Cunningham.

	As soon as I can possibly leave here I will but that is very uncertain.

	I have nothing worth writing & it is so late I must conclude.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
