Letter 717
Thursday, 30 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Your letter of Monday has just been received.  I am glad you are so well pleased with your new Servant.  I hope you will continue pleased & that Laura may find a home elsewhere.  Let Lindys husband take Emma  if he wishes her  He may be able to do a betterby her than Lindy can.  I wish he would take Lindy also. But I suppose he has another wife.

	The Inauguration of Governor Orr took place yesterday  & I send you our speeches.  Fannie was present.  Young Wade Hampton my aid came to me & asked if my daughter was with me & that he would call & see her last night before he left for Louisiana today.  I told Fannie.

	There was a great crowd at the Inauguration.  The President says the South Carolina members had better wait till Congress organized.  His son in law Judge Patterson told Trescott he was very anxious to see me & for me to come on, that he thought the Senate would admit me.

	I am undecided yet about going on or coming home.  Shall hear again soon from the President.  Saw Willie this morning.  He says the members were more pleased with my speech than Gov. Orrs.

	It may be that Orr & myself will go to Charleston tomorrow to see General Grant.

	Write me whenever you can.  I sent by Steen $50 to your mother from Tupper & would have written but have not time.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
