Letter 316
Sunday morning.  I find myself in quite a predicament this morning.  In order to be secure against robbers last night, I put my clothes in my trunk & shut it down.  It never occurred to me that the key of the trunk was in my pantaloons pockets.  So I am in my shirt & drawers & nothing to put on but my dressing gown.  The boy waiting on me has been all over the house for keys but none will unlock my trunk.  The mechanics are all away from their shops and here I am not knowing what to do.  The breakfast bell has rung & I have written a long Editorial waiting my lick but all in vain.

	Since writing the above I have had all the keys in the house sent me, but none fit.  It is now eleven oclock & I have now put on an old pair of pantaloons & gone down & got my breakfast.

	The agony is over & a blacksmith has come & broke the lock of my trunk.  I am now dressed & ready for dinner.  Col. R.F.W. Al[l]ston understanding I could not leave my room sent me a book to read.  Col. Drayton told me he would have offered a pair of his pantaloons, but he did not like to have his britches split.  Whilst I was dressing at eleven or twelve Col. Carroll came to pay me a visit & talk about a matter in the Legislature.  I have been disappointed in going to church & will now conclude my letter as I have not any more to write & shall not hear from you tonight.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
