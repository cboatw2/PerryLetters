Letter 5
Monday, 5th December 1842
Columbia

 My dear Liz

	Your letter was handed me last night & Mr. Earle came up to know what was the news from home & to my surprise had not heard from his better half since he had left Greenville.  I was much pleased to hear you were all doing pretty well.  I begin to feel anxious to see you & the children.  How I should like to take them in my arms & hear their prattle.  I will endeavour to be at home the first of next week.

	I have just returned from the college commencement to write you.  I saw there a great display of beauty & fashion but did not stay long to admire it, not more than three minutes.

	This morning I start with your letter in myto shop.  I found all the articles you desired & have made the purchase.  Tell Will I have bought him a most beautiful pony with a saddle & bridle long tale and main, high headprice $16.00.  Co. [Henry Gaines] Johnsons waggon will be down here next week and will carry the horse up for nothing.  It is really a beautiful hobby horse & Will can ride on it most gloriously.

	Mr. Hayne sent me two bundles for your mother, & I gave him the boxes which I brought downor rather I sent it to Mrs. Taylor.  I have not yet seen Taylor or any of his family.

       I hope youthe gold pencil & letter sent you by Col. Town[e]s.  I would write to you oftener than I do but really I have no chance.  Our room is constantly filled with company & I am now writing whilst Burt and Col. [Frederick William] Davie & Reed are talking about all sorts of things, & I have to join the conversation every now & then.

	There is great excitement in regard to the election of United States Senator.  Judge [Daniel Elliott] Huger & Barnwell Rhett & Col. Davie are candidates.

	I saw Mr. Pendleton this morning.  He gave the magnolia & a beautiful print of Charleston.  You will however see the Print as it will come with the magnolia.

       I am very much complimented by all who see me on account of my good looks.  I am told that I have improved astonishingly in personal appearance.  They all say that I have flattened & look younger &c.  Laurens district will be added to Greenville & Pendleton as a congressional district & we young that I must be the candidate, but fortune will not permit me.

       I have gained one of my cases in court & one in the Legislaturethe road case in court, Spriggs & Bartons case is in the Legislature but they have not yet decided on it.

       I have read a letter from Mr. W. Gilmore Simms.  He says that it is well that he was tempered down to a Benedict before he met with Ann or he should have lost hisand says he will be very happy if his (prescription) of cold water can be of service to her.

       I must conclude my dear wife as I am writing without thinking.  There is so much talk going on.  Miss the children, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
