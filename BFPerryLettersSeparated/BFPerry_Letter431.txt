Letter 431
22 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I arrived here last night about twelve oclock.  The Engine on the Greenville Road ran off twenty miles about Columbia & we had to remain there in a swamp from two till ten oclock in the night, without anything to eat or drink, not even water.  There was a crowd of members & Methodist preachers aboard of the cars, & some of them had their wives & daughters with them.  But no one was injured.  We had to send to Columbia for a train to carry us down.  The passengers bore their misfortune with great patience.  Some of the girls went to sleep and none murmured.  When the freight trainup behind there was a general shout & yell under the belief that they would be run over.  But the Engineer stopped in time.

	After getting supper I went to bed at one oclock and slept soundly till eight in the morning.  I feel perfectly well, and left all well at home.

	Just before leaving home I rece[ive]d your letter and was much pleased with it.  I am glad you have entered so high a class & are doing so well in your studies.  In regard to Latin I expect you had better not commence it, as you will have no time to make any progress in it, & pursue your other studies.  Do just as you please in regard to all of your studies so you have the sanction of your teachers.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte at dinner & had much interesting talk with her & the doctor about you & Tulula & Burlington.  She had just heard from her daughter, who said she & Anna Perry were bosom friends.  There was also one from Florida & Virginia who were much [pleased] with you & Tulula.

       Mr. LeConte says your cough is very bad & annoys you very much.  Mr. Reed told me as we came down that Col. Brockmans daughter had a dreadful cough which continued for weeks & finally she coughed up a piece of charcoal which she had swallowed in cleaning her teeth.  Her cough then ceased.  The doctor thought she had consumption or bronchitis.  She was thrown into a fever ^ had to go to bed.  Dr. LeConte says he knew an instance of a man who had a cough for forty years & finally threw up a fish bone which had lodged in his throat.  Mr. Farrow who was present told me Mr. Bail[e]y at Laurens was affected with a cough for three years owing to something in his windpipe.  He finally coughed it up & was relieved.  You had better tell Dr. Gantt these things.  Mayby you have swallowed a fishbone or piece of charcoal or something else which is lodged in your throat or windpipe.  Tell Dr. Gantt to write us about your cough.

       You must write me as often as you can, & I will do the same whilst I am in Columbia & tell you all about the balls & parties, the girls & gentlemen.  But I am afraid your letters take up too much of your time.  Now [that] your school has commenced you will not have the same time to write.  Mrs. LeConte says Tulula regrets very much that she does not receive as many letters as Anna Perry doesthat you rece[ive]d onetwenty five.

       You must write me your next letter about your cough & tell me whether it is better or not & how it affects youwhen you first had it remember all about it.  I hope it has left you.  If it is owing to an ulcer in your throat it will get better soon.  The ulcer may be made by a fishbone or something of that kind.

       I am writing in great haste as I go down to see Dr. & Mrs. LeConte immediately.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
