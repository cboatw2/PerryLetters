Letter 451
14 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening enclosing Willies & Franks.  It is now nearly twelve oclock in the night & I have not time to write you.  Enclosed you will find my letter to the Patriot giving you all the news I have.

	Governor Swain goes up to Greenville tomorrow & I asked him to call & see you & my library whilst in Greenville.  He said he would do so, if he remained a day in Greenville.  He is on his way to Asheville.  He says he remembers seeing you & your mother & sisters.

	I hope Lindy & all the servants are behaving better.  I have not heard anything more from Anna. Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

       Col. Hayne gave me a bundle for you from Charleston today which I will send by Wells.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
