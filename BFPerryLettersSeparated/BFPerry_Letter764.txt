Letter 764
13 November 1872
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received a letter from you last week which gratified me very much.  I am so anxious about you & it gives me great pleasure to hear you are improving.  I also saw this morning a letter you wrote Fannie which likewise spoke of your improvement.  I had just written you a short letter enclosing a draft for $100.00 before receiving yours & your mother wrote you the day I received your letter.  I did not therefore write you.  I hope you rece[ive]d the draft.  Annie sent the letter you wrote to Mr. Glover to Fannie & I saw it this morning.

	Your mother went with me this morning to the village & we came back to dinner, as the day is very bad raining & cold.

	Willie went to Columbia Tuesday to attend the Fair & see about contesting the election.  He went from there to Walhalla court & will be back the last of this week.  McDaniel, Southern, Shumate, Wells &c. all went down to the Fair & returned Saturday.

	Fannie came to see me at my office this morning.  She & Perry are quite well.  Mine & your mothers likenesses have been sent to Fannie to keep.  Your mother was afraid the House might be burnt & said she cared more for the portraits than all the rest of the furniture.

	Ben is making himself very useful in attending to the farm & superintending the stock.  He & Jack were sowing & ploughing in wheat yesterday & this morning in the sweet potatoe patch.  The rain has stopped them.  Ben has had corn ground to feed the hogs with.  He has eleven in the pen fattening.  They are fattening very fast.  The cows & calves are looking wellalso the sheep.  The horses have not yet taken the disease which has broken out in Columbia & Charleston.

	I am going to clear the pine woods where Henry planted corn last year.  It will improve the appearance of the place very much & give us fire wood this winter.

	Willies Virginia pointer is doing well & is a beautiful puppy.  Bull & Alta &are all well.

	Hext wrote us that he was elected for two months resident Physician in the hospital & hoped to be continued.

	Ben McDaniel is to be married tomorrow night & Vardry waits on him.  He marries Will Coxs daughter.  Lida McKay is soon to marry Williams and Alex McBee was invited to be groomsman.

	Your mother asked Willie about being engaged & he assured her there was nothing of it.  I am sure there is not.

	Take care of yourself & take your medicines & consult some doctor about your treatment.  Put yourself under his direction.  I hope to hear of your improvement & see you return in the spring a well man.

	You get the Enterprise & have seen my address to the voters of the Congressional District.  It has excited a good deal [of] criticism all over the state.  I see the Aiken Radical paper has been very severe.  I know [Henry] Sparnick.  He turned radical to get office like all the other scallawags.   Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
