Letter 414
2 October 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from the Secretary of the Navy ordering you to go on to Washington and to be reexamined by a Board of Physicians there.

	If you have not already gone on to Washington you will do so immediately & report yourself to the Secretary of the Navy.  I hope now you will be admitted.

	It may be that after the Secretary rece[ive]d Col. Orrs letter he wrote to you to go on to Washington.  I did not tell him where you were & consequently he wrote to me directing me to send you to Washington.  Col. Orr wrote him where you were.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Mr. Cobb Secretary of the Treasury also tonight informing [me] that he had been to see the Secretary of the Navy & had got a favorable decision.

	When the Secretary receives Col. Orrs letter & General Thompsons, Judge Evans & Col. Pickens he will certainly be favorable so far as lies in his power.  When he wrote me he had rece[ive]d none of them.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & was truly glad to hear from you & to hear you were well.

	I hope now my dear son that you will enter the naval school.  Your mother is delighted at the idea of your reexamination.  She was greatly distressed before.

	When I hear from you again I hope to hear good news.  You must use as much of the check as you wish which I sent you & the remainder keep for future use.  We will go on & see you next summer.

	You must tender my sincere thanks to Mr. Miller, but for his letter I should not have know what to do.

	We rece[ive]d a letter from Anna & one from Willie yesterday & tonight.  They are both well.  Anna is distressed at your rejection & Willie will be when he hears it.

	We are all well except Arthur.  He is better.  In haste yours &c., B.F. Perry
