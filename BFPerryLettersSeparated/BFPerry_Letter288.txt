Letter 288
5 May 1854
Columbia

My dear Anna

	Since writing you a line on your mothers letter this morning, I have rece[ive]d a most beautiful, valuable & useful present for you from Mr. E the district attorney of the United States who you saw in Columbia last winter.  I was in Captain Heiseys toy shop looking at a gold thimble, in a magnificent tortoise shell case, & said I Had a notion of purchasing it for you.  Immediately Mr. E asked permission  to send it to you as a present.  He said he was much pleased with you last winter & hoped you would accept it in remembrance of him.  It is a very superior article, & a most beautiful & useful present for a young lady.  If I have an opportunity I will send it up to you.

	I have just got through with my Equity business in Court & will go down to General Adams in the morning & from there to Governor Mannings & return Monday morning.  I will then write you as to my movements.

	I hope Willie & Frank & Hext are doing well & behaving well.  You ought to behave like a lady at all times & I hope you do, & will show your skill in keeping house.

	I have just seen Col. Pickens & his daughters whom you saw in Charleston.  They & Col. Pickens enquired after you & Willie.

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
