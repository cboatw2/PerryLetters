Letter 390
20 February 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your mother has just sent me word that I must write to you this evening.  I thought Anna was going to write you.

	Your letter last Monday has already been answered by Frank or your mother.  I have nothing in the way of news to communicate.

	Poinsett Wells tells me he sees you very often.  I hope you do not neglect your studies, or frequent the Public Houses.  Keep away from them as idle places.

	I am truly sorry to learn that the students are misbehaving in any way.  They ought to consider it a point of honor to conform to all the rules & regulations of the College.  Be careful never to violate any College rule, & I warn you to keep aloof from all idle & bad associates.  As sure as you come in contact with them you are corrupted.

	Your ought to read History when you have leisure from your regular studies.  Now is the time to improve yourself & acquire information.

You speak of wishing to return to Greenville in April.  The expence is considerable & the time you will loose important.  Are the Professors willing to grant leave of absence to you?  For you must not think of coming without their permission granted.

	When I was of your age, how much would I have given to have had your present opportunities of acquiring information.  I remember at Asheville when I was sixteen years old. I studied twelve or fifteen hours every day.

	I desire you to take exercise, but always be in your room at night.  Never leave it after dark.  The mantle of the night is the defence of the wicked for then they escape detection.

	We are all well.  Your Robert Foster died the other day, a drunkards death.  How mortifying to his old Father!

	You must write me often.  I liked your letter on Monday very much.  It was sensible &, Yours &c., B.F. Perry

Mr. William Hayne Perry
S.C. College
