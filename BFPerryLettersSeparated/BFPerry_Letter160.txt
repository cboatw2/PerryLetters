Letter 160
28 June 1850
Laurens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have but a scrap of paper to write on nor have I anything to write of interest.  I shall certainly be at home Sunday evening & perhaps tomorrow evening.  We shall not reach Dr. Andersons case at all & if we get through with  & Simpson today I can leave tomorrow.  The court will adjourn Saturday evening.  Chancellor Johnston[e] did not send for Mrs. Johnston[e] as he spoke of doing.

	Col. Irby does not wish to purchase any more negroes.  He has said nothing about paying his note or interest.  Capt. Cunningham & family are all at the North.  Burt expects to return shortly.  You will see in the Laurens Paper a sharp controversy between General Thompson & the Editor.

	I hope you & your household are doing well.  Your Pianno paid for must sound sweeter.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
