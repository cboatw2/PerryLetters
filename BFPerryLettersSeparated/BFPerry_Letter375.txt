Letter 375
2 December 1856
Congaree House

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have a great deal to write you if I had time.  But tomorrow I have the House at one oclock to make a speech on the Judiciary Bill & have to prepare for as yet I have scarcely thought of the question since last winter.  There will no doubt be a large audience to hear me.  The ladies are all here & will go.

	Willie is at the College undergoing his examination.  I have not seen him since breakfast.  It is now dark.  There are forty applicants.

	Norton has just come into the room& told me he & Jeter were admitted to the Bar.  Four out of twenty one were rejected.

	Write the day & year Frank was born, & I will send it on to Col. Orr.

	I have just heard as a great secret that Col. Pickens is to go into the Buchanan Cabinet.  I am delighted at this, as he is my friend in policies & feeling.  I saw him yesterday.  I am invited to President McCays tomorrow evening and to dine with Senator [Moses Cohen] Mordecai on Saturday.  The Jews seem to have taken a fancy to me.

	Col. Fairs little daughter is here & he enquired after Anna.  Governor Adams proposed the other night that we should send our daughter to Charleston next winter to the same school.  He is cordial & you do him great injustice.

	Col. Isaac Hayne walked home with me today & invited me to take a glass of brandy in his room.  He was more sociable & friendly.

       Norton seems very gratified & proposes making me a present of some book.

       I shall not have time to write to the Patriot tonight I am afraid.

       I have just seen Willie.  He has been examined in fact & his examination will close tomorrow.  He thinks it doubtful whether he can enter the Junior class.

       The Bonds your mother will get will have interest from July.  Col. Perrin said nothing about the prior interest & I did not see proper to mention it.

       I must now close.  I hope you are all well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
