Letter 14

My dear Liz

 I am much disappointed in not getting off this evening for home.  Indeed I am afraid I shall not be able to leave before Saturday morning if then.  There is an important [case] which detains me.  I hope to try it tomorrow.  It is one in which I have been employed to assist Mr. Young.

	How comes on our wine party?  If you have not commenced it I shall be glad.  If you have made preparation for it you must go on.  How all the people invited.  Get Lester, Hoke, Jones, Townes, Wells & others to extend the invitation.  Let all the country people be invited, who are in the village on Saturday, at the agricultural meeting.

	I will give another party Tuesday night of court week.

	You must get three or four dozen bottles & fill them with wine, Sherry,  Maderia, & Sicily Modecia.  You are a great manager & can do all these things without me.  But still I would like to be at home to help you.

	Why did you not write to me?  I read a letter from Hoke & Lester giving me a fell return of the election.  My majority was very gratifying.  But exactly as I had calculated.  You must now admit that I have a good judgement in elections.  I hope you will never worry me again on that subject.

	I am very anxious to get home & meet you & the children.  It appears a long time since I left home.  And an important event has happened.	I read a letter for you from Miss Pamela Cunningham & a note to me, with a box containing a cap.  I will send you the letter by mail.

	Good night my dear Liz.  Kiss the children.   Yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
