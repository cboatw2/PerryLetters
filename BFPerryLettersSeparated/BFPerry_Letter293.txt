Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have been detained here much longer than I expected.  This however is the better for me as my business is much greater than I supposed it would be.  Perhaps I may be at home tomorrow & maybe not till Friday or Saturday.  Mr. Elford & E are going to leave today & I am now writing to you before breakfast.

	Harriet Perry has sent you some money to pay for a cloak or something of the kind fashionable.  Can you get such an article in Greenville or will you have to send to Charleston for it.  If you have to send toyou had better do so at once as she will need the cloak soon.

	I have seen my brother & Warren.  I have rece[ive]d $245 for the wheat which was sold.better crop than usual on my own account.  I have also rece[ive]d some little money.

	Steeles pony was not a pretty one & I did not purchase.  I was assured[page torn] would not be pleased[page torn]it.  I had rather have[page torn] one at Anderson, or we may get some other one.

	Judge Glover is here holding court & sems very pleasant & does pretty well.  I have been employed in a good deal of business here.

	I hope you and the children are well & getting on well.  I am afraid Braeh did not do well on the carriage & that you are not able to take your accustomed rides.  Your affectionate husband, B, F. Perry

P.S.  Reed tells me that Miss Johnson has rejected Town[e]s.  I am not surprised that any decent woman would do that.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
