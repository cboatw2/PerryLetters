Letter 117
Monday night after writing you a letter I went with General Adams, Col. Dawkins & Mr. Middleton to the Ball, having been invited as trustees.  There was as usual a large number of ladies & gentlemen.  They waltzed & danced.  We took champagne and looked on for an hour, & then went to Col. Alstons room where we sat till one oclock eating & talking &c.  I saw Miss McDuffie at the Ball & Col. Taylors daughters, Miss Brooks &c.  I enquired of Col. Taylor who that was with a rose in her head & he replied, she is my daughter & it will give me great pleasure to introduce you to her.  I laughed at the mistake & apologized.

	When I shall get through with the court is very uncertain.  Today the students were examined.  My name was on the committee, but I could not serve.  Tomorrow the Court of Errors will sit.  The case of Dr. Anderson is not yet tried.  I have to send a letter from him.  The printing of the Brief cost $32.00.

	I voted for Thompson Earle to carry the votes to Washington but Black was elected & has gone.

	General Thompson is still here.  Col. Townes is quite well.   Earle is not sick, but drooping.  Col. Elias Earle told me today he was a candidate for Comptroller General,  He is an abominable fool.  Mr. Speers & Major Jones are here yet & will return tomorrow.

        I have made no purchases since I wrote you except a pair of small candlesticks $3.00.  The forks are as good as silver & no one can tell the difference.  They will last a great while.  The German silver is too common & too well known to be genteel.  The silver spoons were needed, so were the knives & forks.  I may look for a dinner set, but will purchase nothing unless very cheap.

       Col. Dawkins told me that Union district felt almost as much interest in my election as in General Wallaces.  Mr. Church, a representative from that district told me he said that he would muchI should be elected than to be elected himself.

	Tell Willie I have looked at a glass slate for him & I have seen a great many pretty things for Anna & Frank.

	How happy I should be now to peep in & see you & the children.  I do not think I will ever offer again for Congress.  It is all right.  I will not try & make something to educate the children with.

	I have now written you a long letter in return for yours & am sorry I cannot pay you with a kiss.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
