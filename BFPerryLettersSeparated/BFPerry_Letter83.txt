Letter 83
24 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Willie

	I have just received your pretty letter, & am delighted with it.    Col. Townes could hardly believe it possible that you had written it.  I hope you will write me another one soon.  It will give me great pleasure to hear from you & see your letters and the writing of them will improve you very much.

	I look to you my dear little son to sustain & improve on what little of reputation I may have for talent & usefulness.  Your opportunities will perhaps be better than your Papas & therefore you must endeavour to be a smarter & greater man than I am.  I think you have a great deal of talent, & if you will only study & be good you will one day make a great man.  But first of all learn to be a good boy.  Never tell an untruth or do a dishonorable thingnever quarrel or fightalways be kind to your little play fellowslove your little sisters & brothers, be good to the servants & everybody & then everybody will love you.

	The next time I come to Columbia I will bring you with me & perhaps I may carry you to Washington withy me should I be elected to congress.

	Since I commenced writing you this letter I have had to stop & go to the College to attend a meeting of the Board of Trustees.  I have just returned through the rain &, & it is now near eleven oclock in the night.

	I hope to see you in College in the course of seven or eight years.

	Tell you mother I wish to see you all very much & that I have recd her letter tonight & thank her for it.

	Tell Anna & Frank they must be good children.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Mr. W.H.M. Perry
