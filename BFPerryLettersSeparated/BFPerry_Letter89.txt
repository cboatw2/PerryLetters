Letter 89
2 December 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I must write you tonight for I am sure I will not have time to do so in the morning or tomorrow evening.

	We have a great deal to do tomorrow.  I shall be engaged in court in the morning attending to a case for Mr. Choice.  The Electoral Bill is discussed in the Senate at one oclock.  The Trustees meet at night & there is an exhibition in the college.

	I went this morning to get my razor mended & found General Martin looking at some beautiful broaches for Ladies, & he proposed that each of us should purchase one & send to our wives.  We did so.  The price is only $1.50 cts & they are really beautiful & a new fashion made out of wire beautifully wrought, large, & intended for common usebut fine enough for any occasion.

	I have been engaged in court today & heard John Cunningham make a speech.  He speaks well.

	In passing up street I saw one of the finest looking men my eyes ever beheld.  He had a foreign aspect & genius stamped in his face.  I could not keep my eyes off him.  Dr. Gibbes stopped me, & said let me introduce you to Mr. Gliddon of whom you have doubtless heard.  I said to him that I had had the pleasure of reading a most interesting book written by him.  He bowed gracefully & thanked me for the compliment.  He was excessively polite & strikingly handsome, about my age, & heightperhaps not quite so tall.  He is going to lecture on Egypt.

	There was an effort to give Chancellor Harpers heirs [a] years salary today, but it failed by two votes.

	The magnetic telegraph is now in operation between this & Charleston.  	Col. Perry enquired how his sister was & in ten moments the news came back that she was better.  Various messages have been sent to Charleston.  If you wish any word sent to any of your friends I can do so & get an answer for a few cents.  They have messengers at the office to send all over town.

	We have very wet weather & walking is most disagreeable.

	I have made a report on the Mexican War & sent copies of it all over the congressional district.  I made arrangements with Dr. Sill to send them from the Printing office.

	Tell the children that I was going into Heises today to buy some toys for them & saw some ladies & passed on.  I will get the candy & knife & marbles & doll & rattle &c &c.

	In regard to my books you know that I have a weakness in that way.  But I have derived so much happiness from them that I cant resist the temptation.  My wife, my children & my books are my sole sources of happiness.  With them I can be happy independent of the world & regardless whether elected or beaten for Congress.

	Poor Judge Richardson is to be impeached Saturday.

	Kiss the children for me.  I recd a long letter from Spears on the R Road.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
