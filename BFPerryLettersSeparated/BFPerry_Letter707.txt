Letter 707
25 October 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived here Tuesday morning with General Easley very much fatigued.  Mr. Janney brought me a half bushel of letters which I opened & read till ten oclock except when interrupted by visitors.  General Hampton called to see & consult with me.  He is much troubled, & sincerely afraid he is elected Governor.  The election is still in great doubt.  I told him if elected he must serve.  Col. Orr is not here.  Mr. Trenholm called to see me this morning & to express his thanks for getting him released.  Governor Bonham & General Butler got me to telegraph the President for their pardons.  General Kershaw & Col. Townes have just called to inform me that the Senate had elected Col. Moses President & General Martin Clerk & were ready to receive my message.  The House have elected Col. Aldrich Speaker & Col. Sloan Clerk & are now voting for other officers.

	Col. Trescot asked me if I had taken a House in Washington!  He said there was no doubt of my election.  I have not yet heard any opposition.  I will send you the New York news in which there is a compliment to me as the U.S. Senator &c.

	After opening about Fifty letters yesterday evening & giving up all hope of receiving my check, it so happened the last letter opened contained it.  It would have been the first if I had known it.  But they deducted $30 for income tax & sent only $720.

	Today I have been very busy in writing letters and approving pardons all day except when visitors were present.  The Dr. LeContes came & paid me a long friendly visit.  Mrs. LeConte & Lula are quite well.  Mr.  gave me a bundle from Miis Buist which I will send by the first opportunity.  Mr. Janney expressed great thanks for our kindness to his daughter & son.  He goes to New York on Monday.

	Willie got here this morning & will have the same rooms.  Hammet[t], Goodwin & Price & Townes came down with him.  Col. Townes lost his new hat on the carsblown off his head.

	I rece[ive]d a visit this morning from the Brother of Governor [Francis R.] Lubbock of Texas.  He brought me a beautiful letter from the Governors wife which I will send you asking me to intercede with the President for her husband, who is in prison & paying me a very high compliment.   I have written a long letter to the President.

	Col. Isaac Hayne is gradually sinking.  His son is running for reading Clerk of the Senate.  My message will be read by Willie in both Houses tomorrow.  General Easley pronounces it the best Governors message he ever read.

	Campbell, Boyce, Pickens & Trescot & perhaps Manning & Bonham are running for Senate.

	I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
