Letter 769
22 September 1876
Greenville

My dear Liz

	 No letters from any of you this morning.  I am writing in my office & constantly interrupted.  Miss Powell came in & I paid her five dollars for you.  She said the account might stand till you returned & saw it.  A democratic mulatto from Tennessee came in to be employed as a stump speaker.  I sent him to Col. Haskell chairman in Columbia.  Capt. Hawthorn came in to talk about the negro meeting last night at Terry Edwards.  Willie & Ben and ten or fifteen white men attended the meeting & Hawthorn made a speech.  They got three to join Democratic club.  Whitner came in to talk about my praising Judge Cooks speech at Honea Path.  Nance came to show me his fine stallion.  Col. Spann to talk about his stealing Willies double barrel shotgun.  I told him I knew he took it, he was seen with it & to bring it back.  He denied of course.  Col. Croft called to know if there was any news about the negroes below Aiken.  Nothing further.

	Tomorrow I attend a meeting at Reedy River Church to form a society pledging ourselves not to employ anyone who votes the Radical ticket.  I send you one copy of my Walhalla speech today & tomorrow will send you a number of them just got in the Weekly Enterprise.  If you send one to Governor Tilden, you had better cut it out & enclose it in a letter.  Newspapers are never noticed.  I have just given my Honea Path speech to Bailey, which is entirely different from the Walhalla speech & I think equally good.  I have been invited to deliver a Lecture before the Reform Labor Society at Laurens next March!  I wrote you a long letter yesterday.  Why does not Fannie write me some times & Perry too.  I cannot get a copy of your published letter.  When it comes out in the weekly Enterprise I will send it to you.  We are all well.  Tell Hext I received his note.  Yellow fever in Charleston!  Dreadful in Savannah, 35 deaths every day!  Your affec[tionate] hus[band], B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
