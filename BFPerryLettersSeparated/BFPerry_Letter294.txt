Letter 294
26 November 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am writing to you before breakfast, & will not close my letter till evening.  You have frequently requested to note what time in the day I write you.

	We had a pleasant trip down here & fell in with a great many members & other friends on the way.  Judge Wardlaw partook of mybeef & raisin.  We had no dinner on the road except our lunch.  There were quite a number of ladies in the cars & amongst them a daughter of Elias D. Earles on her way to Sumter.

	Brockman, Duncan, McBee & Mooney are with me in the Congaree House.  I have a fine room, but the others are not so well provided.  The House appears to be well kept & very neat.  Some improvements have been made.  Mr. T is here as a boarder & as cordial as ever.  He enquired why Anna did not come down.  Said she could room with his daughter.

	There are a great many candidates, a house full of them, and amongst others, tell Willie his fellow student DeLorme is a candidate for doorkeeper.  He came up to me and wished to voteme in the canvass.  It is probable I shall vote for him.

	I saw Henry Cauble at the depot, & he called round to see me last night.  He looks well & seems very much improved in his manners & appearance & intelligence.  He is well pleased with the school but says only forty have been able to stand the discipline out of ninety who entered.  Dr.  Austins son was dismissed for having too many black marks opposite his name.

	Dr. [C.G.] Metts of Union, a member of the Legislature, took me out last night to consult about my running for Speaker & expressed an earnest wish to elect me.  But I told him my politics would prevent that.  He told me it would make no ions with him.  Col. Simmons will be elected probably without opposition.  Cunningham is here very active & busy.  Col. [Louis Trezevant] Wigfall & his wife are here.

	I have not yet made the enquiry about Wilie & Frank but will do so & have no doubt by keeping them in my room where board with be moderate.  They may come down next Saturday if they will promise to be good boys, & keep their seats in the cars without moving about or attempting to pass from one car to the other.

	I have just returned from church & will finish my letter.  I went to the Episcopal church & heard Mr. Sams of Beaufort.  I saw Col. Taylor & General Martin, all of whom I spoke to.  They enquired after you & family.  I think Mrs. Taylor was at church but I did not get to speak to her.  After church Col. Aldrich, Col. Drayton & myself went to call on Governor Manning who is keeping house.  Mrs. Manning will be here on Tuesday.  The Governor enquired after you.  We took a glass of brandy with him & spent fifteen or twenty minutes very pleasantly.

	I came off & forgot to put up in starting from home my dressing gown.  Send it down to me by Mr. Wells who will come down Tuesday.  Bundle it up & direct to me in as small a canvass as possible.

	I hope you and the children are all getting on well.  I shall expect to hear from you Monday evening.

	If I have time tomorrow I will write you again, but that is doubtful.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
