Letter 47
20 July 1846
New York

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Albany in company with Col. Fair & Mr. Nance.  We will go thence to Niagara Falls, & through Lake Ontario, down the St. Lawrence to Montreal & Quebec, which we expect to perform in six or seven days.  We shall then return through Lake Champlain & Lake George to the Hudson & Saratoga Springs.  There Col. Fair will leave us & return home.  I shall call to see Mr. Van Buren & stop at West Point.  Then go to New Haven, New Port & Boston & return by the way of the Niagara Springs, to Greenville about the middle of August.  Mr. Nance will return with me.  He is a very worthy & clever gentleman & I am much pleased with him as a travelling companion.

	I have been in New York only two days & would leave with regret for the beautiful Hudson had I rece[ive]d a letter from you whilst here, as I hoped & expected to do.  I feel sure you have written, & the letter has been misplaced in some way, which provokes me.  You do not know how dear a letter from home is to one in a strange city.  My heart sank within me when the Bar Keeper informed that there was nothing for me in the Post office.  I made him send again & again.  The same answer was returned.  I console myself with the hope that you & our dear little children are all well.  I do not think that I shall ever wish to leave home again to travel.  I am not sorry however that I am making this tour.  It wasto me never to have been to the north.  But I shall be satisfied when I return to my home & to my wife & children.

	I wrote you from Philadelphia which letter I suppose you have rece[ive]d.  We had a pleasant trip to New York passing through a beautiful country, the heart of New Jersey in a high state of, adorned with many pretty little villages & townsPrinceton, Newark, Burlington, Jersey City, Elizabeth Town, Amboy &c.  We stopped at the Astor House & find it a most magnificent Hotel well kept.  I rather think the best table I was ever at.  But the company is inferiormerchants & merchants clerks & travelling yonkes & manufacturers--very much like the company I found at the Charleston Hotel.  At table we have soup which is one coursethen fishthen all sorts of meats & vegetables, oyster pies &c.  Then all sorts of pastry, strawberry pies, puddings &c &c.  Then the clothes are removed & we have pine apples & all sorts of fruits, & lastly ice cream.  If I can get one I will send you a Bill of Fare.  The servants are all white & very attentive.  I now see so few negroes that when I meet one it seems to me I have found an acquaintance, & feel glad to see him.  I feel as if he was my countryman & fellow creature, & not the white man.  Today we wished a carriage to drive to the Croton water works & I selected a black driver instead of the many white ones standing by.  I think cuffee was made for a servant & he does pretty well in his post.  In every room of this Hotel there is a bible placed on the table.

	I called to see Hastie today.  He was out.  I left Nichols letter & my card.     The weather is quite cold but today has been very pleasant.  I have rode throughsaw the museum & there met two mammouths [word obscured]seemed ten years old weighing five hundred pounds.  They look like fat hogs.  As I return & shall endeavour  to see more of this great democratic &city.  The streets are crowded from morning till twelve oclock at night so much so that it is difficult to walk them.  I went to Trinity church Sunday evening, but the& aisles were all full.  I stood up amidst the crowd till the organ stopped.It is the largest & richest church in America I expect.

	You must write me to Boston as soon as you receive this letter.  I shall be constantly travelling now for a week & you may not hear from me in that time.    Accept my love for you & the children and remember me to your mother & family.  I must now back up.  Your husband, B.F. Perry
