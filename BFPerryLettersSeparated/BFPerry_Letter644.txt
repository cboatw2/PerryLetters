Letter 644
4 December 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just written & put into the Post offce for you a long letter.  Since doing so I have rece[ive]d Fannies letter of Sunday & saw Mr. Crittenden who goes up in the morning.

	Tell Fannie I will write when I have leisure.  I have just writtenabout Martin Edwards& other matters.

	As to Governor it is all uncertain.  Gov. Manning is spoken of & Pickens friends are very anxious to elect Col. Orr so that he may take his place in the Senate.  My name is spoken of but I am not disposed to run.  If the election of Chancellor comes on I stand a good chance of being elected & will run for that office.

	My friends are very kind to me and I [am] pleased with my position.

	We shall adjourn before Christmas,  I may not be able to write you for a day or two.    I want to see you all very much & had rather be at home than anywhere else.

	I saw Capt. Hawthorn again tonight. He goes on to Virginia in the morning.  He is under arrest & has to have his trial for disobedience of orders when he gets back.

	Your uncle Arthur came in the House today & sat with me some time.

	In haste your affectionate husband.  If you see General Thompson say to him I will write him soon.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
