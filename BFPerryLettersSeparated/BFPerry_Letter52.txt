Letter 52
6 August 1846
Boston

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday to dinner and received two letters from you.  I cannot tell you how happy these letters made [me].  It had been so long since I had heard from you, , & I had travelled so many thousand miles, that it really seemed to me that I was lost & forgotten.  I was opposed to & that some of you might not be well.  If I had consulted my feelings I should have started home from New Haven without visiting Boston.  But I am now better satisfied, & will remain here a day or two.  Your first letter was advertised & I did not receive it till I applied for advertised letters.

	  I immediately on receiving your first letter I made a memoranda of the articles you wish me to purchase & which I will get as long as my money holds out.  I purchased last evening a beautiful shawl such as you described white with lilac stripes for $3.50.  The price was $4.00.  It is a beautiful thing & far prettier than anything of the kind sold in Greenville.  Your dresses in Canada were about $9.00 a piece.  The dresses for you & the children were $35.00.  My cloth clothes dress coat & pantaloons & travelling sack were $52.00.  My clothes in Washington & shirts in New York $60--Carriage hire has been a large item.  I paid one day in New Haven$3.25cts for the hire of a carriage to ride over the city & to visit with Governor Edwards.  They charge $1.00 an hour!  I mention these things to show you the state of my finances & if I should to buy you a musical box & something else, you must know it is not because I would willingly deny the least request you can make.  It has been my great pleasure since our married life commenced to love you & make you happy in everything and the only pain I have ever experienced has been on account of myknowing that I was not able to live as I desired & you deserved to live.  But I think our condition has greatly improved since our marriagethat we are much better off than we were then.

	I have now $140 in my pocket which I hope will be enough to carry me home & get all you desire.  If I could return directly by the way of Charleston it would save time & money but on account of sickness I had better return through Virginia.

	Col. Fair & Mr. Nance have gone home.  They did not pass through New Haven & I saw nothing more of them.  I found on my arrival at the Tremont House a letter from Col. Fair explaining why he did not meet me as he promised.  Just as I was getting into the cars at New Haven I met Mr. Latta of South Carolina going to Boston & will make the same stay that I do & return to New York with me.  He is an old gentleman of great wealth & has a son & two daughters at school in New Haven.  He was on board the vessel with your father & mother when he died, desires to be remembered to your mother about whom he made many enquiries.  I find him a pleasant old gentleman being from South Carolina we have attached ourselves to each other.

	The weather is extremely hot & last night I was so much fatigued that I had a dreadful headache.  I was afraid I was going to have a bilious attack & hunted for Dr. Crooks pills, but they are lost.  This morning I feel much better.  But the weather is so hot there is no moving about.

	Tell Mrs. Butler I will certainly see her sister.  But I shall not be able to visit New Port.  I will return through New London to New York, there stay a day & go home as fast as I can.  I should like to call & see your uncle McCall, but am afraid I shall not be able to do so.

	Tell Susan that the coral beads must be a present from me & not you.  I claim the honour of making the young stranger the present.

        Tell Will, Anna & Frank that their commands shall all be obliged & they must be good children, mindful what you say & not [be] cross [with] each other.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry
