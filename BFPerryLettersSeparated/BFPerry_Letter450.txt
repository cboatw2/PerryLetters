Letter 450
13 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I made a speech on Friday which seemed to exhaust all my strength & made me feeble indeed.  I am now well again.  I spoke an hour & a quarter on the Bank question & General McGowan tells me everyone says it was a great speech & one which made many converts against the Banks.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Dr. Gannts [Gantt] which made me moreabout Anna.  I have nothing to write you except what I have written to the Patriot.  I enclose you two sheets which you must take as a letter.

	I see Mrs. Brooks here on her way to Greenville.  She has been to see her daughter below.

	General Thompson & wife are here on their way to Greenville.  Charles Hammond is here on his return from Dr. Allens marriage.  Easl[e]y, Gantt & Jones went up Saturday.

	I cannot say when we will adjourn.  I am overrun with business in court & the Legislature.

	You need not trouble yourself about Willie & Lula.  Thomas said {word obscured] joke.  Nor need you think anything about what Lula says.  The girls are mischief making between her & Anna.  Tattlers are abominable.

	I do not like to talk about Perdicaris to Col. Memminger.  They are very great friends.  No doubt the sickness of his son, only child, has absorbed all their thoughts & you must excuse them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
