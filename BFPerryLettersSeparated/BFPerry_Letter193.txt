Letter 193
27 November 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am again writing to you before day.  I received your letters of Wednesday & Thursday last night after my return from the Board of Trustees.  I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  The mails are now so irregular that there is no certainty of hearing from each other.  For several days past the mails did not reach by the boot thethe end of the Rail Road.  Yesterday the cars ran off & the passengers came back.

	Anna is behaving remarkably well & is as fine a little [girl] as ever.  She stays with Janneys little daughter & amuses herself by going into the drawing room & listening to the Piano, helping about the house where Mrs. Janney is and riding out notwithstanding the bad weather.  It has been raining excessively since we have been here.  I have not even thought of Annas going to Charleston.  I wish her to stay a day or two after the weather breaks off & se the Town, state House, Mrs. Taylor &c.  She comes up to see me every morning after breakfast & then again after I return from the State House.  I have not seen here since receiving your two last letters.  I read to her your first letter & it affected her to tears.  She seems to have a good heart & an affectionate disposition.  I will not begin to enquire about sending her to Town [Charleston].

	Col. Isaac Hayne was elected attorney general yesterday by three votes.  I voted for him & so did [Perry Emory] Duncan, [William Pinckney] McBee & [Nathaniel] Morgan.  Brockman voted for neither.  Hayne spoke to Burt about my vote & Burt told him that I was a magnanimous fellow & would no doubt vote for him.  The contest excited great feeling I think. [Richard] DeTreville behaved badly in the canvas.  He offered to Duncan if he would vote for him to give him two votes for Jones.  Duncan informed him that he took no interest in Jones election.  I am afraid Jones will be elected by his usual duplicity & polarizing.

	Nothing of consequence has yet been done in the Legislature.  The election of U, States Senator takes place on Monday.  I think Judge Evans will be elected if he consents to run.  I am to see him this morning on that subject.  General Adams spoke to me yesterday about the governors election.  He seemed very cordial.    In fact all of my old friends & acquaintances have met me most cordially & paid me great respect.  Governor Means last night came up & walked back with me from the college.  My broken arm has excited a good deal of sympathy.  Col. Watts told me he expected I was like General Shields, who carried his arms in a sling & as a lady said in Columbia to excite sympathy.  I replied that my wound was very different from General Shields.  It originated in my awkwardness & Shields in patriotism & glory.

	I made a very judicious purchase of law books yesterday for Spartan D. Goodlett, who sent me $50.00 for that purpose.  I have bought nothing for myself except a new hat which I had made after measuring my head.

	You had better send for the corn which has& have her fed well at home, or she will get so poor that she will give no milk.  Make Reuben attend to the horses & cows well.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry
