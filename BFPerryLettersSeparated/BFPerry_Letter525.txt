Letter 525
17 April 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received your letter last night and regret to learn the difficulty in your school.  I hope my dear Son you had nothing to do with the difficulty & will always keep out of such scrapes.  We are very anxious to hear the result of the investigation.  It was a shocking outrage.

	We are all well.  Hext went with me to Laurens court & was unwell on his return but has recovered.  I was unfortunate at Laurens court & left my horse Tim sick there & do not expect he will ever get well again.

	In relation to your clothes, you had better purchase a handsome uniform to wear when you go out , & wear your jacket uniform  in the cars & about the house.  You need no citizens clothes at all.  If you want any money to buy clothes I will send you some.  But dress all the time like a Midshipman.  In that way officers always travel.

	I write you in such haste.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
