Letter 57
3 November 1846
Pickens

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line by Col. Townes, thanking you for your letter by Mr. Elford.  I was indeed glad to hear you were all well & doing well.

	I do not know when I shall returnperhaps not before the last of the week.  I was disappointed in going to Josiahs as it rained all day Saturday, & I was detained at old Pendleton.  I have not yet seen Josiah or Foster.  They will be here today.

	In the evening of Saturday Mr. Sharpe called to see me & thanked me for the pincushion & invited me to his house.  But I did not go.  The weather was bad & the invitation rather a cold one & I thought should have been given in the morning instead of the eveninghaving been there all day.  Sharpe was dressed up & looked quite spruce & seemed quite pertimportant in his own estimationhad a good deal to say about his farm &c.

	I came to the place Sunday morning & escaped the rain but have a bad cold.  I find very little business here.  General Thompson says if he practices law he will go to Charleston.

	In great haste you must remember me to the children & kiss them.  Your husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
