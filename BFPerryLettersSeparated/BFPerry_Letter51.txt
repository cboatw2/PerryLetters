Letter 51
4 August 1846
New Haven

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this lovely Town yesterday evening in time to take a walk around the College Buildings, the State House & churches.  This morning I procured a large open Barouche, & I drove all through the streets & around the suburbs.  Oh my dear wife how happy I should have been to have had you seated by my side pointing out the streets & Houses as you saw & recognized them.  The house in which you mother livedthe church which you attendedthe school where you went with books & slate every morning like a sweet little girl of ten or twelvesometimes trudging through the snow & meeting the cold winds.  I need not say to you that New Haven is dear to me from these associations, & if it were an ugly place, still I should love it, as the town in which my dear wife was educated & spent some of her most pleasant days.  But it is the prettiest town I have yet seen.  I was told by a young Englishman, with whom I travelled in Canada, that New Haven was the prettiest town in America.  I now heartily agree with him.  But it is twice as large as when your mother resided here.  And yet every house is built in the finest style & with great taste.

	After I had rode over the Town, I drove to Col. Moslys to deliver your mothers letter.  He was not at home, & would not return for several days.  So I shall not have the pleasure of seeing your old friend.  I left the letter and my card & drove to Governor Edwards.  He was at home & as soon as he broke open your mothers letter came into the room.  I found him very pleasant and agreeable.  He made a great many enquiries about your mother & her family.  After a short call she desired him to introduce me to Professor Silliman & President Day & show me your sisters grave.  He stopped at Mrs. Ingersolls to enquire the spot.  We went into the cemetery & readily found the place beside the grave of a Daughter of Mrs. Shubricks, & shaded by a small tree planted some years since.  I need not say to you that I shed many tears over the grave of [my] wifes sister as I looked over it.  My weakness was seen & noticed by Mr. Edwards.

	We found Professor Silliman at home & I was much pleased with him, his conversation & his appearance.  He is really a fine looking gentleman & much younger than I expected to see him.  He begged to be remembered to your mother & to yousaid he remembered all of you with great interest & thanked me for calling to see him & regretted my stay was so short.  We found President Day engaged with the Board of Trustees.  He came to the door of the college & expressed great pleasure at seeing the son in law of Mrs. McCallenquired most affectionately after you & your mother & invited me to take tea with him this evening at half past six.  He said Mrs. Day would be glad to see me & enquire about Mrs. McCall.  Mr. Edwards asked me to walk round this evening & see his daughter, the only member of his family living with him.  But I am afraid I shall not be able to do so.  We rode by the brick House in which your mother lived near the college.  I looked at it with great interest & pictured to myself three little girls, blooming with health, beauty & loveliness & playing & running over the House, & that one of them was now my wifethe mother of three sweet, lovely children!  What a change a few years make in the condition of a little girl!

	I cannot get from here to New London except by riding twelve hours in the stage.  I will return to Springfield & from there to Boston.  I will pass through New London or New Port on my return to New York.  Say to Mrs. Butler I came here on purpose to go by Mrs. Rodgers to Boston but am disappointed.  I hope however to have the pleasure of seeing some of her relations on my return.

	I hope to hear from you in Boston & also on my return to New York.  I must close [and] shall not write you again for several days.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family & remember me to all my friends.  Yours truly, B.F. Perry
