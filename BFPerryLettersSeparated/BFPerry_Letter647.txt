Letter 647
7 December 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just taken dinner & as I expect to send letters by Col. Goodlett I wil write you again.

	I forgot to mention in my letter this morning I have made arrangements with Mr. Boyce to get as much sheeting & drills as I might wish of the Graniteville Factory at very low rates.  I think I will take several hundred yards.  The drills will do for pantaloons &for the negroes & the sheeting for shirts &c.  The price I think is about 33 cents per yard.  This is cheaper than buying the spun yarn & having it woven.  You need not therefore trouble yourself about getting any more spun yarn.

	I saw Col. Connor just now.  He is still on crutches & mending slowly.  He says he heard from B, the adjutant of Hamptons cavalry only four days since.  They were then at Culpepper C[ourt] House & no expectation of moving down to Fredericksburg.  I will write to Willie this evening.  Col. Connor enquired about him.  He says he has noticed that those who were loudest for secession have done less than those who opposed the movement.

	You do not say anything about how you are living.  Have you still a supply of beef? or do you live on pork?  Did the hog killed spoil or have you eaten the meat.  Have you got corn & fodder for the horses.  Have you heard anything from Glencoe since John went back?

	Sunday is a very lonesome day in Columbia & I shall not spend another Sunday here if I can get off.  I will try to return home next Saturday.  I think I can do so without any loss of important business.

	I will now go & hunt up Col. Goodlett.  I suppose he is at his son in laws Capt. Patrick.

	This is a beautiful fair & cold day.

	Your affectionate husband.  Give my love to the children.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
