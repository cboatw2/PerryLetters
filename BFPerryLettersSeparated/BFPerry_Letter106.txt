Letter 106
19 June 1848
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as I promised, though I have nothing of interest to tell you.

	The morning I left home, I got lost, was caught in the hardest rain I ever saw fall, driving over the worst road I ever travelled in a buggy.  I met Mr. Jacobs who told me Col. Orr could not get more than one hundred thirty votes in Greenville.  He said he did [not] know a man who would vote against me.   He laughed at the idea of my loosing three hundred votes in Greenville district.  He is a man of good sense & great candour but does not know as much about the election as I do.

	In Anderson I stopped at old Mr. Douthits a Methodist clergyman.  He seemed glad to see me & said he knew me, my character & politics about as well as I did myself, & he had known me as long as I had known myself.  His son told me I would divide equally the votes in that neighborhood.  But I sha do better than that.  In fact all along the road on Saturday I found very little opposition.  I went to my old client Joseph Rodgers & saw three of his brothers.  They insisted on my staying all night but everything looked uncomfortable & I determined to go to Dr. Andersons.  He is a whig & an old union man, lives in considerable style, has a fine wife, & two very pleasant daughters.  They were all glad to see me, & I spent a very pleasant evening.  The Dr. told me there was no division in his neighborhood, & there is an election ground at his house called orrsville.  He said he did not know that I would loose a vote.  He lives within ten miles of Anderson C. House.  I saw a good many voters at his house.  Mrs. Anderson told me Dr. Butler was taken sick at their house & remained there some time when electioneering & that Mrs. Butler came over to see him.  She said Mrs. Butler was a remarkable woman.  She told me a great deal about Col. Bees visit at the same time.

	 Sunday morning I came to Irbys.  He told me I was gaining.  I stopped for dinner at Frank Hammonds & fared sumptuously though I believe he is an Orr man. He is the stepson of my friend Jenkins Hammond.

	I met here Sunday evening Miles Norton & Elliott Keith and as usual Norton was crooking & Keith looking only at the bright side of the picture.  Keith told me that the Burnl[e]y appropriation was doing me a great deal of service.

	I saw today Mattison from Craytonville.  He says I will get thirty votes there out of eighty, the box at which Orr was born.  Sherrod told me that the Rev. Mr. Chalmers a seceder had come out for me.  In fact the news everythere seems to be that I am gaining ground.  Col. Orr has come out for Taylor under the hope of carrying the Whigs.  But he will not succeed & find all of the Democrats are opposed to [page torn] some of them go for [Lewis] Cass.  My position is one of neutrality, or opposition to both & with mew are most of the Democrats, Burt, Maxwell, Benson &c.

	I shall go up tomorrow to Pendleton & thence to Pickens.  You must write me by Coil. Townes & send my papers & letters. Tell Jim to hurry with the plowing.  I hope you & [the] children & household are getting on well.  I am in fine spirits about the election & have heard from Laurens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
