Letter 185
27 April 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recd & read your letter to Willie.  He seemed a little affected by it.  He has gone again to the Theatre tonight with Mr. Duncan.  He & Robert were very much pleased last night.  I should have gone too, but my feet are so much hurt by the pavements. That I cannot wear my boots this evening.  I am now all alone which is a sore thing.

	The Convention got on slowly.  Today the committee of twenty one was appointed, & I am on it with all the Judges, chancellors, Senators & ex Governors of the Convention.  We meet in the morning to decide what is to be done.  How long the convention will sit, & what they will do no one can tell.

	I shall not leave here before the last of next weekcertainly not before Thursday.  I am glad you are getting on so well with your household, and that you feel so much relieved from the annoyances given you by Minerva.

	Willie is behaving well & says he will write you tomorrow & that he will write to Anna also.  I have spent my time most pleasantly & agreeably.  Judge Hayne boards at Maybins & we have had a great deal of chat.  I have laughed a great deal at the secessionists & cooperationists.  Col. Stork told me this evening that he heard a bet made last night between two members of the Convention & a dozen bottles of wine that I would be elected to the United States Senate in less than ten years.

	Someone sent me through the mail last night a dogrel poem in four cantos, abusing in very scurrilous terms, Hamilton, Petigru, Preston, Thompson, Memminger, Butler, Isaac Hayne, Orr, Pres[s]ly &c &c myself & the Southern Patriot.  It has excited some interest & curiosity.

	General Martin said jesting that he would [like] Willie to go & see his wife & Mrs. Taylor, but I have heard nothing more of it.  I think your kin are not very affectionate.  I was APPOINTED BY Judge Wardlaw one of the committee to examine the certificates of members.  This brought me in contact with them.  Most of them spoke to me & shook hands with me as they came up to the clerks desk, but I could not catch the eye of Perroneau Finley & we did not speak.  I have not met him since.

	I had a visit yesterday from Dr. Lieber & Professor Williams & Mr. Thornwell this morning.  Mr.  came to pay his respects this evening and gave meAddressabout the Mountain Men.  I recd a fine letter last night from [William Alexander] Roseborough [Rosborough].

	I must now conclude with my love to you & the children.  I am delighted to hear that Hext can stand alone.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

P.S. Col. William A. Williams arrived here last night & invited Irby, Col. Watts, and myself to dine with him tomorrow.  I hope he will also pay our fees.  He came down to challenge Scurry, but Irby, Watts & myself have decided against it, & he expresses himself to be governed by our opinion.

	Judge Huger says that Mrs. Poinsett & Mrs. Pringle are not reconciled & that Mrs. Poinsett refuses to live with her.  The Judge says Mrs. Pringle is a woman of temper.  Mrs. Poinsett has gone to Stateburgh to spend the summer.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
