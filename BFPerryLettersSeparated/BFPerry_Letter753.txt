Letter 753
2 October 1872
Spartanburg C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have just finished my speech & eaten my dinner & will now write you a few lines.  Everything passed off well.  There was a crowded House & a good many ladies.  I spoke an hour & a half.  Wallace sat & listened very attentively, but did not offer a reply.  Nor do I think the crowd would have listened to him if he had attempted to speak.  I have only seen three or four persons who spoke of my speech & they were greatly pleased.  My friends here tell me that the negroes are taking no interest in the election & will not go out to vote as they did in the last election.  I now begin to think that I may beat Wallace.  But it will be a close race.  I am not at all anxious about it & in fact had rather stay at home than go to Washington.  I do not regret my campaign for it has been quite pleasant.

	A lady has just sent Mr. Duncan a candidate for the Senate to ask me to meet her at five oclock, as she wishes to consult me as a lawyer.  She was the daughter of John Bomar & is now a widow.  Her name I have forgotten.  So I may get a law case by being here.

	Tell Ben to have the watermelon patch sowed in wheat after working it up.  If the rye has not come up I would like to have it sowed over again if he can get seed rye.

	I hope Hayne is doing well this dry weather.  Write me at Chester to the care of Col. Hamilton.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
