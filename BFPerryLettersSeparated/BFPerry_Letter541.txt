Letter 541
27 October 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your letter to Willie was rece[ive]d last night & enclosed I send you five dollars which you wrote for.

	I am very busy in court & have not time to write a long letter.  We have just got through with the trial of Oneale for setting fire to Cox & Gowers carriage shop.  He was convicted, but will be imprisoned & not hung as he ought to be.  Willie took the testimony for us in court & did it very well.  So he is becoming useful to me in my practice already.  He is studying very well and will make himself a lawyer by next Fall.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
