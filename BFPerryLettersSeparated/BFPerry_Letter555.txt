Letter 555
12 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The clock has just struck seven, & I will write you a few lines before breakfast, as I take dinner today with Col. Orr at the Assembly House & will have no opportunity of writing you in the evening.  At ten oclock l I go to the court of appeals to hear decisions read.  At two my Bill for a separate court of appeals comes up & I shall have to speak on it.  My cases in the lower court of appeals will be taken up tomorrow I hope.

	Last night after I had gone to bed  & after ten oclock someone knocked at my door & I asked who was there.  No reply was given & without getting out of bed I unlocked the door.  A gentleman came in, shook me most cordially by the hand whilst I was still in bed & asked if I did not know him.  There was a glimmering light in the room & his voice [&] manner & laugh reminded me very much of Captain Cunningham.  But I remembered he was dead & did not think it likely the old gentleman had taken the trouble to pay me a friendly visit from the spirit world at that unreasonable hour.  The question was proposed to me again, dont you recognize my voice.  I had to confess I did not know him as my spectacles were off & the room dimly lighted by a few coals from the hearth.  But still I thought of no one but Captain Cunningham.  The size too suited very well.  Had the Captain been in this world I should have promptly said Captain Cunningham.  He replied you say, Ben.  I then got up & lighted a candle & he sat & talk[ed] with [me] an hour.  He was just on his return from South America & had stopped in Columbia to see his daughter who is at the Barhamville Academy.  His wife & family returned last Summer to Alabama & his eldest daughter was then placed here at school.  He is stout & fat & looks old.  He enquired of you, & how many children I had.  He has three only & has lost one.  He had returned by way of Paris & London & is now a union man.  He says it will never do to break up the union & that slavery will be gone if we do.  England will leave against us & crush us.  Heretofore he has been a disunionist.  He said it seemed strange to think I had a son reading law & he a daughter grown.  She is as large as you are he says & will remain two years at school yet.

	Mrs. LeConte asked me last night if I knew the gentleman in Greenville who married Mary Hardin of SavannahIsrail Charles.  She says he is terribly taken in & has got a devil.  The brother of her last husband, Hardin, married Doctor LeContes sister.  It was his daughter that was here with Mrs. LeConte last week.  She says the father of Mrs. Charles was a perfect devil.  She was in love with Hardin her second husband & he made her marry a preacher.  For a short time the Preacher sued for a divorce.  She then married Hardin but had a son by her first husband who killed his stepfather & was to be tried for murder.   One week before he died in Greenville.  Mrs. LeConte enquired if he did die, for she thought the report was not true.  I told her that a young man who passed as her son really died in Greenville.  She says Mrs. Charles is highly connected in Georgia.

	I wrote letters yesterday to Col. Ashmore, General Thompson & the Patriot.  I thought I would wait a day or two [to] receive a letter from Frank before writing him.

	I hope to hear from you this evening & that you are all are getting on well since the Methodists have left you.

	I must now close my letter & go to breakfast.  Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
