Letter 603
10 June 1861
Greenville

My dear Son

	I returned yesterday from Spartanburgh court by way of Glencoe.

	I saw Mr. Le, Friday evening at Spartanburgh who told me you all arrived safely in Columbia.  He went down with you & returned to Spartanburgh the next day.  He said you were all doing well.

	On my return home yesterday, I rece[ive]d your letter which would indicate you were not doing so well in the way of food for horse & man.  I hope however this will soon be remedied.  You must allow for Hamptons indisposition & the confusion of assembling troops.

	Your mother sent by Col. Randal a large box of provisions which I hope you will receive in due time.

	Larkin says he will have your bowie knife done this evening & I will send it down to the care of Janney.  The bridle bits he sent down by Col. Randal.

	Col. Hoke tells me that the Butler Guards write they do not expect any fighting for the present in Virginia unless the Southern troops attack Alexandria.  Lincolns army will not attack them.  They are well& doing well.

	You must write me very often & let me know when it is likely you will leave Columbia.  I will try & go down before you leave.

	The Village is desolatenot a loafer or idler to be seen in the streets.  The village every day looks like Sunday.  There is no business doing of any kind.

	Write me when you are in your Mess? How your horses are doing &c.

	I do not think Willie Beattie will hurry down from the accounts recei[ve]d.

	The House at Glencoe looks very well & all things there are going on very well.  Crops are promising.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
