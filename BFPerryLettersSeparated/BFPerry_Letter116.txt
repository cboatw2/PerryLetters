Letter 116
Monday night 1848 [ca. November]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter which is the longest I have ever had the pleasure of receiving from you.  You have indeed scolded me good [several lines interlined, illegible]

	I am sorry to see you manifest so much want of decision in the purchase of Reuben.  There is a great deal of uneasiness avoided in this life by doing a thing at once & having done with it.  Never brood over it & think it may not turn out well.  There is to me a pleasure in casting off my mind what is over & cannot be remedied.

	I have no doubt Reuben has his faults & may be in some respects worse than Jim & in others better.  As to getting a servant who will do as he ought to, I never calculate on it.  I am not faultless myself & shall not worry myself in trying to do it.  I am not faultless myself, & I cannot expect to find more perfection in a poor, ignorant, degraded cast of creatures..

	Today I have been very busy in electing a President & preparing the papers.  Yesterday I was all day in the Court of Appeals hearing opinions.  The day before I was all day in the College.  Last evening Major Henry & myself went to see his daughter at Mr. Hooks school.  Mrs. H made a great many enquiries about you & the children & Dr. Crittendens family.  She really seemed glad to see me.
