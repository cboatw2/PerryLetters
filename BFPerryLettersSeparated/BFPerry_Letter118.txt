Letter 118
Monday night, 1848 [ca. November, December]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	We are still in the midst of Dr. Andersons case.  I concluded my argument today.  General ThompsonYoung followed.  Sullivan finishes [to]morrow.  This will end my business [h]ere, & I shall certainly be at home [F]riday night.  How happy too I [s]hall be to meet once more you {&] the children.  And how glad I am to be able to leave before the Legislature adjourns.

	The election for Governor takes place tomorrow & Col. [John L.] Manning will no doubt be elected.  Col. Irby iswith him for Lieutenant Governor.  I have understood today that a great many of the members of the Legislature will vote for me for President of the Bank in opposition to Col. [Franklin Harper] Elmore.  The election will not come on for a two or three days.  The Bank question is now being discussed in both houses.  Col. [Christopher G.] Memminger made a very able speech against the Bank.  Major Henry replied to him, but it was a feeble effort.

	I read your short letter on Sunday evening, but did not see Mr. Smith.  I hope to hear from you again before I leave.  I looked for carbon sales, but can find none of the paper size.  I will look again tomorrow.  Not yet in the book store the In regard to subscribing [to] the Ladies Book &c., there is no ag here for the work.  When I re[turn] home I will write on for.

	I have added fomore beautiful toys for my collection.  They are quite a pretty collection, &amuse you & the children Ver[y] much.

	I went to church on Sund[ay]  to the Episcopal & heard Mr. Shand.  [Shand] is a poor preacher.  The church [is] a beautiful one.

	In regard to my cases in Court, I thought I had written you the result.  I have succeeded in Col. Duncanscase, also in the case of Walker & Bradford & in the case of Moon in part.  In Pickens I think I have gained the case of Mvs. State & have lost the case of Gordon & Gordon.  In Laurens I have gained the case of Maddon; lost that of Mr. Filson, also Hunter & Garrett.  Dr. Anderson not yet decided.

	The weather is as warm as Summer.  I have bought no books.  In great haste my dear wife, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
