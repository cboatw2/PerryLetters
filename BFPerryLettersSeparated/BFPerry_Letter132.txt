Letter 132
[18 June] 1849
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before going to bed & I hope you will write me by Col. Townes Wednesday morning.

	I suppose our groceries & bedding have arrived from Hamburgh & that you are perhaps tonight engaged in unpacking.  I wish I was with you to help you & enjoy the pleasure of a first look at the different articles not forgetting the little matters purchased for you by your Aunt.

	I hope too that Col. Dunhams wagons with the paint have arrived & that Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell will commence the House.

	I had a very hot day on Sunday & severe headache Baylis Crayton & Wagstaff travelled in company with me.  We dined at the spring & there met a man & woman eating their dinneralso the man called me by name & Crayton seemed to know him well.  I offered him my bottle & then proposed making some toddy for his wife as I supposed.  I gave her [page torn] rush & was very polite.  When they started, Crayton told me the woman was Mrs. Patterson of noted fame about Greenville.  You maty imagine my surprise.

	There is very little business in court.  I have found it pleasant meeting Chancellor Dargan.  We served four years together in the Senate.

	It was reported the other day in Anderson that Mrs. Sharp was dead.  But Dr. Sloane told me he saw her riding out on Saturday.  She is so ill that she cannot lie down to sleep, but has to sleep sitting up in her chair.

	I had a dreadful headache today, & shall take pills tonight.  I did intend going by Pendleton, but shall not be able to do so.

	I saw Mr. Keith here & told him he must collect some money for me at court.

	There is a fine crop growing on Josiahs farm.  I go there in the morning.

	I saw Mrs. Mays carriage in the village this morning with a trunk behind.

	General Whitner is walking on crutches.  He was badly crippled in the ankle by a fall from his horse.

	I shall be at home on Friday.  Tell Reuben to keep ploughing & let Mary help hoe the corn.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
