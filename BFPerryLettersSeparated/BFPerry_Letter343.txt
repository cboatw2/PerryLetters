Letter 343
5 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Miss Susan Hoke has just gone to the American Hotel to spend the night & go up in the morning with the Greenville ladies there.  Anna left this morning for Charleston & I am now restored to my own room again at eleven oclock in the night.  This I am extremely glad of as Col. Irby is a bad bed fellow, snores & grits his teeth most horribly.  I have slept scarcely at all the last two nights as his bed fellow,  What his wife does, poor woman,  I know not!  He has to wet his head before going to bed & then put a wet towel under his pillow to put around his head in the night to keep it from burning up.  But he is a good fellow & I like him in all respects except as a bed fellow.  Sue Hoke has enjoyed herself very much & expresses a wish to come back next session.  Her frank manners & livelyhave gained her a good many friends & admirers.  She would not dance & this was a drawback on her amusements.  They are dancing here every night.

	My speech on the Judiciary has been very much complimented.  Whaley & Pope came to my seat & thanked me for it.  [John Etienne] Tobin told Governor Adams that it was the only argument on my side of the question & yet[Mem]minger spoke on that side.

	Col. & Mrs. Preston have sent me a note inviting me there tomorrow evening at 8 1/2 oclock in the evening.  They are to have a magnificent party I suppose.

	Today I made several short speeches on the State House.

	Tomorrow the electoral law comes up & I shall have to say something.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Franks.  But I have not seen Col. OHanlon.  I must now conclude.  Douglass & Donaldson are both admitted to the Bar.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
