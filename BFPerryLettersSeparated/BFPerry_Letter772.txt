Letter 772
3 October 1877
Greenville

My dear Sir [His Excellency Governor Hampton]

	I shall not be able again to meet the Board of Trustees.  I am still opposed to the election of Professors.  It would be cheaper for the State to send all the young men who will enter the University for twelve months to come to Princeton or Harvard & defray all their expenses.  Forty thousand dollars would educate eighty students for one year.  The Charleston College, the Wofford College, the Furman University, the Due West College will answer for the present.

	But in case you do elect Professors I enclose you a letter from Governor Jenkins as to the quallifications of Mr. [Harry] Hammond which you will lay before the Board.

	With great respect, I am truly yours &c., B.F. Perry
