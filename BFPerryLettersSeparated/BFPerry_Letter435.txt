Letter 435
26 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & thank you for it.  I have to go down to meet the Board of Trustees in a few minutes & shall probably not return before midnight.  I is now six oclock & I have just had dinner & read my paper & lettersone from your uncle Arthur about the Senatorial election.  He will serve if elected but is no candidate.   I see my last letter to the Patriot was crowded out.  It will do very well for next week.

	I argued the case of Hoke & McCallister today in court.  The argument will be finished on Monday.  We had one ballot for U, States Senator.  Hammond rece[ive]d 61Pickens 40Chesnut 23Preston 18Rhett 6 & Chancellor Dargan 1.  The run of Hammond is extraordinary.  But he cannot be elected.  The contest will be between Pickens & Chesnut & perhaps Chesnut may be elected.

	I saw General Martin this evening & Willie Martin who is a stout good looking boy.  The General said he would send me Susans bundle.  I will send it to you.

	I have nothing to write you.  I enclosed a long letter to you this morning for the Patriot & will write you one tomorrow.

	In regard to the abuse of me in South Carolina it has never come from the gentlemen of the state.  I do not believe there is at this time a distinguished man in the state who does not more cordially respect & esteem me.  Such is their deportment towards me.  I shall leave a reputation for my children which they may be proud of & which shall not injure theirat all.  My reputation will grow brighter after my decease.  It is my purpose to make a publication of my writings with a view of doing justice to my memory hereafter.

	I have not heard from Anna, Frank or Willie since I wrote you.

	I rece[ive]d a letter today from Col. W.C. Preston on the subject of the college & communicating important information & argument for me when the question comes up.

	I send you enclosed a very imperfect & brief sketch of the debate on that subject the other day.

	I wish to see you all very much & next Saturday I shall return home if possible as Monday evening will be commencement.  I must now close.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
