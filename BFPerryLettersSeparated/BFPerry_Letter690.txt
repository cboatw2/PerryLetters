Letter 690
14 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	We have just elected Judge Magrath Governor, & it is doubtful whewn the Legislature will adjourn.  I have just recd a letter from Col. Martin & we have agreed to have a meeting here on Monday evening next.  If I can get off I will go home Saturday & return Monday.  But for meeting Col. Martin & the case of Col. Ware I would not come back at all.  The Senate have refused to go into the election of Judges.  I am not sorry, for if the election had taken place I should have run for Chancellor.  If elected it would have reduced us to starvation.

	I have just seen a piece of good luck which has befallen me & will enable me to pay my board bill.  Old Mr. Norton enployed me to get the pay for his negro who died on the coast.  The old man would make a bargain with me to give me one third of what I recovered.  I see the auditor has allowed him Three thousand dollars.  So I shall get one thousand dollars.  There are two other simillar cases in which I shall get them two or three hundred dollars.  I expect fine hundred of Col. Ware.  This will enable me to pay my debts although I may not get my fees from the Confederate government.

	I saw Fannie in the Gallery today with maggie but only got toto them.  She was looking very well.I hope Hext arrived safely & that you are all well.

	I have further& I think you may expect me at home Saturday night & I will return Monday.  I have written Col. Elford to come down on Monday to meet the Commissioners.

	I have just succeeded in getting DavisHodges off his contract about the Saluda turnpike.  If the Senate passes the Resolution of the House it will be a great [word obscured] matter to Hodges.

	I must now close my letter before I receive yours tonight as I hope to do.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
