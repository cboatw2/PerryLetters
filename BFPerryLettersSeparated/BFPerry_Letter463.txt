Letter 463
24 January 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & were glad you were well & expecting to see Willie.  I suppose he is with you today & will go to Washington tomorrow, Monday.

	We are sorry to learn that you have already got six demerits for this month.  You can avoid getting demerits if you will try.  And you should always be on your guard against doing anything that will bring them.  I hope you will now resolve to avoid all for the future. & study hard.  You cannot succeed unless you resolve to study hard & be a good boy.

	Edward B wrote me a letter the other day to get Col. Orr to obtain for him an appointment at West Point.  I have written to Col. Orr for him.

	Anna is about the same & looks badly.  She rode on horseback once last week & will ride again when the weather is good.

	All the rest of the family are well.  Hext is going to school & Hayne is going with him, but not to study.  Arthur looks very well & is a fine little fellow.  Fanny is growing very tall.  Your grandmother & family are all well.  Susans children are going to school.

	It is said Col. Orr will not be a candidate again for Congress.  Col. [John Durant] Ashmore of Anderson is here electioneering for his place.  Col. Farrow of Spartanburgh & Col. Jones are also candidates.  I expect Col. Dawkins will not be a candidate.

	Give my respects to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & tell your chum Mr. Bradford that he must see that you study your lessons well.

	We look forward to your letters with great interest & would be glad to see you with Willie & have you all at home once more.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
