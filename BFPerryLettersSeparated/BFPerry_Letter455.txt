Letter 455
20 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Sir [John LeConte, Washington, DC]

	Your kind letter has just been rece[iv]ed.  It will be a great favor to me, if you will take charge of my daughter and bring her to Columbia.

	I have just rece[ive]d a letter from Miss Graham in relation to Anna, & shall leave here in the morning for Greenville.  If I find that I can reach Philadelphia sooner than you will leave there I may go on for Anna.  But if I do not I have written to Miss Graham to send her by you.

	In taking charge of my poor child & bringing her to Columbia you will place me under great obligations to you.  Let me know in Greenville the day you will reach Columbia, & I will meet you here.

	The news of my daughters health will be very distressing to her mother, but I hope a southern climate & free exercise in the open air will restore her.

	I wish you, my dear sir, the success in your lectures, which they merit.

	With the greatest respect I am truly & sincerely yours &c., B.F. Perry

Dr. John LeConte
Washington, DC
