Letter 482
3 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & have but a few minutes, to write you a reply.

	I have bought two dozen oranges & a dozen bananas to send by Wells in the morning.  Janney is to get me the strawberries this evening.

	There is a great crowd here now.  They have come to see & hear General Quitman tomorrow.  Robinson & his wife from Fairfield are here.

	I shall be detained longer in court than I expected.  Nothing was done today in my cases.  I hope to try one tomorrow.

	I was glad to hear Anna was getting better, that Hext was well & Arthur better.

	I will get the caps as you requested.  I have bought for myself a frock coat $18, pants $6.00, hat $5 & gloves &$2.00.  The coat is a very nice one indeed & fits well.

	I am sorry for poor Dr. Stone & will attend to his business.  I am glad to hear he has sent a prospect ahead of him.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte are expected to return Friday evening with Miss Graham & Tulula.

	General Thompson delivers his lecture this evening & I suppose I shall have to go & hear him.

	Col. Preston called with his carriage yesterday evening to take Miss Jones & General Thompson to ride & wished me to go with him, but I declined.  Maybe Col. Preston & Miss Jones may make a match.  The old man looks pretty well.

	Col. John Preston has gone to Europe & old Mrs. Hampton went with him to remain several years, & she is over eighty years old.

	I think you have scolded Frank enough.  Write him encouraging letters.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Martin which I have to answer this evening.

	In the next room there seems to be any number of children squalling & they annoy me.  I changed my room yesterday on account of the sun.  But the children are worse than the sun.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
