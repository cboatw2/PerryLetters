Letter 626
11 September 1860 [1861]
Camp Griffin, Va.

Dear Papa

	I wrote a letter home a day or two since by Mr. West but as an opportunity offers to send another letter by hand I avail myself of it.  Jim Moore is going home tomorrow on account of his wifes sickness, and will carry this letter.  He will stay several weeks, and Ma can send those two blankets she spoke of, by him.  I am in need of a hat if you can find a broad rimmed black felt Hatsize 7 ?.  You had better get it for me.

	I went to the junction yesterday and succeeded in finding my tent, and I expect to have it brought down today or tomorrow.  I had sent by several persons to get it, but none of them succeeded.  The Tent came there on Monday, but it was not unloaded until yesterday over a week after its arrival.  I had the misfortune yesterday at the Junction to loose or have my pistol stolen.  I think it was stolen.  I went by myself and had to hitch my horse, and while I was gone someone took one of my pistols from  out of my Holsters.

	We have been expecting to be paid off for some time, and I think we will be paid off in a day or two.

	Bill Thompson forgot to put in his letter to [his] mother that he wants her to send him a hat size 7 ? & a pair of gloves.  I wish Ma to send word to her about this.

	I have nothing to write about, and merely write this because Moore is going home and you may expect one.  I hope you are safe home by this time though I have not yet heard of your arrival.  Your Affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

P.S. I got the paper signed by Fuller that you left, and sent it this morning by Mr. West.
