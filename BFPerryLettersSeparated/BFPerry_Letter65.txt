Letter 65
9 December 1846
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight & shall be prepared to meet you at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening. I do not suppose there will be any danger of the children catching scarlet fever.  It will give me great pleasure to meet you all again.  It seems a long time since I saw you.  And I have been in a hurry ever since, not time to do any thing.

	I made a speech of one hour length today in the Senate on the Rail Road, which drew a great crowd & was well received.  Tomorrow I speak on the Electoral question which is made the special order at one oclock.  Today I have been in court a good deal.  I wish you were here, to be present when I speak.

	The election of Law Judge will take place tomorrow.  Col. Dawkins, Whitner, & Withers are candidates.  Who will be elected I know not.  General Caldwell was elected Chancellor.

	I have just returned from the Board of Trustees.  We have elected two ProfessorsPelham & Williamson [Mathew Williams].

	I must prepare for my speech in the morning & therefore must conclude,

	Col. Townes is unwellheard from Greenville.  They are all well there.  Col. Hoke wrote me that my negroes were doing pretty well.  Jim & Minerva had a fuss & he came very near sending both of them to jail.  I rec[eived  a letter from McBee about the rail road.

	I shall expect to see you with great anxiety on Saturday evening.  You must not disap[p]oint metake care of the children.

	Give my love to your Aunts & thank your Aunt Mrs. Turnbull in my name for her hospitality & kindness to you & the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
