Letter 605
13 June 1861
Greenville

My dear Son

	 This is humiliation & fast day.  Your mother & the children have all gone to church.  The servants are out.  The stores all shut & the streets desolate.  Nothing doing & nothing to be done.  I will therefore write you a letter.

	I sent you by Willie Butler this morning your bundle& bowie knife.   Your mother wrote you last night.  We recd your letter yesterday evening which gives a better account of your fare & livingexcept your mother & aunts are horrified at the idea of your sleeping in your pantaloons & boots!  In your letter you stated someone was sick but left out the name.  I fear it is Wiley

	I understand Jim Moore came up last evening sick.  I will go over & see him this evening & hear all the news from your Camp.  IMr. Moseley last evening who told me he spent a night at your camp
 & saw you all, but could give no particular information in regard to you.  He says you are all doing well & have plenty for horse & man.

	I will try & go down & see you next week, perhaps Tuesday.  General Easley speaks of going with me.

	Some of the disbanded Volunteers speak of being hissed & insulted as they came up yesterday.  Dickey told me their families were much better off without them than with them.  So they better have staid.

	In your letters let us know how your horse & Wiley come on & all the news of the camp.  W.M. Thomas told me that on Sunday there was some difficulty between Cline & Smith & you as sergeant & officer of the day was called on to settle it.  Like a prudent officer you called in your Captain.  But Cline was not satisfied in his decision.

	I had quite an incident to happen to me last night.  Whilst reading the papers a large black bug got into my right ear, & I could not get it out.  It was horrible & very painful.  I sent for Dr. Croft & he filled my ear piece full of water & out came theinsect!  I never had anything to happen which frightened me more or gave me greater pain.

	There was a meeting of the various members of the different committees to raise funds in favor of the Volunteers yesterday  & they reported most favorably.  Large sums have been subscribed.  They will make you all rich I expect.  I hope however your money will be judiciously spent.

	In regard to the war we have all sorts of rumors.  But I have been deceived so often that I now believe nothing I see in the newspapers, until it is confirmed by a weeks repetition..

	Nine was in my office the other day and said he was going down to join you.  Turner one of the disbanded Volunteers told me he intended doing so.

	I hope your officers are now all with you & that {Wade] Hampton is well.

	I will send you a Patriot with my speech to the Davis Guards.

	We are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

P.S. Your grandmother has sold her house to Buist for $4,000.00.

W.H. Perry
