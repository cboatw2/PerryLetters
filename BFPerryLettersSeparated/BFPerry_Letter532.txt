Letter 532
22 May 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d two letters from you last week, one of which we ought to have recei[ve]d the week before.

	We are all well & are anxious to see you.  Write us in your next letter when you will be at home.

	Fannie & Annie came home last Monday & are very much pleased with their trip to Columbia & Charleston.

	We recei[ve]d a letter from Willie last night.  Willie Beattie had paid him a visit.  I requested Willie Beattie to go & see you as he returned.  He said he would try & do so.

	I am glad to hear you say you will sign no more papers.  Keep aloof from all combinations & obey the rules.  Study hard & behave yourself.  Do not let any of the boys lead you astray.

	I go to Edgefield Tuesday & will return Friday.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
