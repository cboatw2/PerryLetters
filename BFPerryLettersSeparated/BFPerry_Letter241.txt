Letter 241
9 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	Last evening Dr. Gardiner came to me room & said that my speech had produced quite a sensation.  He expressed himself pleased with it and I might say was in ecstacies at it.  He seems encouraged by it & I think we all are in good spirits.  After writing to you yesterday I went out to see about my shirts& the merchant who is a very gentlemanly man said that he was pleased to see that I was employed in the Gardiner case, that he was one of the Jury &have the pleasurer of hearing me  speak &c.  He had been in the Court House at some stage of the proceedings.  Thompson says that the case is so much talked of & written about that it will give me a national reputation at once.  I hope good will come out of my trip to Washington.

	I am afraid that you will stop writing to me under the impression that I am on my way home.  But this is not likely to be the case for some time to come.  Mr. Burt leaves here this morning.  I wish I could go with him most sincerely.  Col. Orr leaves tomorrow.  Colcock goes today or tomorrow.  Judge Butler & Judge Evans have to remain for some time as Senators.  Tom Butler is here as large as life.  Tom Thompson was to see us last night.  I met Tom Thurston in the streets yesterday evening.  I went to the Appollo Hall last evening.to see Mrs. Blake but she was giving lessons in dancing.  I sent up my card & wrote a note that I would call again.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  General Thompson saw general Pierce last night and is very much pleased with him.  The Indians came to see us last night.  Thompson thinks we can make the treaty at once.  This would be great luck.

	God bless you and the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
