Letter 105
10 May 1848
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just read your letter of last Monday & was glad to hear from you & the children.  Mr. Keith of Pickens & Mr. Henderson of Laurens both went with me to the Post office & enquired for letters but rece[ive]d none.  We seem to be more regular in our correspondence than any other husband & wife from the upper country.

	Today Col. Fair was taken sick & had to get me to argue his cases in the court of Appeals.  In this I had good luck, & gained two out of threeone more to argue.  But I shall return to Laurens tomorrow to attend the Battalion muster & come back on Sunday evening or Monday morning.

	I have no news to write you.  My cases in the court of appeals will not come up before tomorrow week.  I may not be at home before Sunday weekperhaps not then.

	I have been looking at some beautiful dresses for you & Anna & will purchase some of them.  I saw some of the most magnificent window paintings or curtains & arranged to purchase a couple of them for $10rods & tassels &coil paintings.  I saw some at Cunninghams, though by no means so pretty.

	Mr., Crawford gave me a package this evening to carry [to] Col. Kern, containing a gold watch & many valuable trinkets for the bride.  I think Miss Earle is going to do well, & you may say so, & that the Col. Is an intimate friend of mine.  He is about forty fivegood lookingvery rich.  It is thought that my friend William Mills is to marry the other Miss Earle.  He is about the same agerich & clevergood looking.  I think Mrs. Earles daughters have done well.

	My election is very much talked of here.  Everyone is enquiring about it & all wishing me success and saying we now want talent in Congress.  I have no apprehensions about my election.  It was just so when I ran for the Senate.  My friends were alarmed but I was not.  The rumor everywhere was that I would be beaten.  It is always so.  My enemies first speak out & make a noisemy friends say nothing.  But in due time they speak out also.  Everyone says I am gaining rapidly but that is not [page torn] the case as is supposed.  It is only my friends speaking out.

	I have been writing letters since I have been here & will continue to do so.  I must now conclude for that purpose.  I have carried your shoes to have made up.

	Tell the children I will bring them all a present & they must be good.  I am glad you have heard from Miss Rodgers.  They have sent for a bracelet like hers & I will get it next week on my return to Columbia.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
