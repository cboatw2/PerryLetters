Hext sent Willies coat, & two pairs of pants, waist coat &shirts, which were rece[ive]d today.

	Willie returned from Pickens yesterday.    Nothing done in court.  Judge Orr will be here tonight.

	Jack can leave the big carriage & carry out tomorrow a load ofin the wagon.

	Harrison in the jail, saw a woman & boy going out of my stable lot with lumber & boards before day this morning.

	Willie rece[ive]d $76.00 for me at Pickens.

	It is proposed to adjourn court in the morning in consequence of Vickorys death.  If so I may drive out & see you.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry
