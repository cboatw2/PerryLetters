Letter 239
8 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I have rece[ive]d a letter from you today in reply to the one I wrote you of dining with the President.  General Thompson brought it up to the Court House for me from the Hotel, & I was glad, in the conclusion of it you said Mrs. Thompson was well.  He was very anxious & had no letters from home.

	I made a speech this morning in the Gardiner case on a continuance of it, which was well recei[ve]d.  Mr. Bradly & Mr. Carlisle both spoke of my effort in the highest terms to General Thompson.  I saw the effect of my speech on the Judge, Jury & crowd.  They seem to say with their eyes & faces this is admissible, better than we are accustomed to hear.  I carried the point & the case will be taken up tomorrow or Friday at furthest.  The counsel for the United States the district attorney & Mr. May turned pale & their faces looked cadaverous as I was pouring forth some of my burst of feeling & passion.  I am satisfied I have made a good beginning & I hope I shall make a good ending.

	I have nothing more to write you as my time is taken up with this case.  If I succeed well in it, Thompson says I will be employed in the Equity suit.  He has just written to his wife that I had made a speech & acquitted myself admirably as he knew I would, & that she must call & tell you so.

	It is uncertain when the case will be disposed of.  I am now in it & must remain.  But I shall be at home in a week or two I hope.  Write me every day & tell me all the news.  Your letters are my greatest comfort during my absence.  I am glad you read with so much interest my letters in the Patriot.  I have a dreadful cold.  The weather is now wild.

	I will write for the Patriot occasionally but not as often as I have done.  I hope all things are going on well at home.  Go & see Mrs. Thompson & write about her to me so that I may read your letters to the General.

	God bless you & the children.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
