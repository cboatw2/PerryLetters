Letter 314
15 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear from you.  It is now near eleven oclock & I have been very much engaged all day.  This morning I went into court & then to the Legislature & sat till four oclock & thence to dine with Dr. Furman.  Then I went back to the Legislature & have just returned from the House fatigued & tired.  We adjourn on Saturday & I will return Sunday night.  There is to be an extra train to carry us up on Sunday.

	I spent a very pleasant evening with Dr. Furman & in going there I met Miss Brenan in the street & shook hands with her & had some little chat.  She enquired kindly after you & mother.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
