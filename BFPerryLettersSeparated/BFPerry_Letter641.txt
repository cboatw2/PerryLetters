Letter 641
29 November 1862, Saturday

My dear Liz

	I received a letter from Fannie this evening & one yesterday.  I will write her tomorrow.  I thought you had gone to Glencoe & therefore did not write you as often as I would have done.  I will be more regular hereafter.  But my time is very much engaged here.

	Yesterday evening I took tea with  & Mrs. LeConte & spent one hour or two with her & Lula & Miss Graham very pleasantly.  Yeadon went with me.  The Dr. is absent.  The ladies are very.  I left them at eight oclock & went to attend my committee where I was detained till late in the night.  On my return to my room I found Wallace Thompson who sat to a very late hour.

	On yesterday I got thefor a speech today at one oclock.  The galleries were crowded & the House full & was listened to with great attention.  I think I made one of my best speeches.  Your uncle Arthur was present & Col. Campbell was to reply to me but he so fully agreed with me that he declined speaking.  You will probably see some brief sketch of my speech in Sundays Carolinian.  Col. Dawkins & Dr. Croft followed me.

	In the Courier of yesterday you will see a compliment paid me in connection with the office of Governor.

	This evening I dined with Governor Pickens & a large company.  Porter Pres[ident] of the Senate, , , Dawkins, Whaley, , Garlington, , Campbell of Charleston &c., &c.  The dinner was magnificent.  Seldom have I sat down to see it or one anywhere.  Hiswas splendid & is throughout.  After dinner we met in the drawing room.  Mrs. Pickens enquired kindly after you & spoke inof our library.  She was dressed in homespun & it was very pretty.  She & her stepdaughter played & sang for us.  She is very pleasant.  Miss Pickens is not pretty & Miss Cunningham is homely.  I could not help thinking how much prettier Fannie is than either of them.

	Tomorrow I drive out with your uncle Arthur & go home with him from church.  Tell your mother Mrs. Pickens asked of herCol. Ball.

	In my speech today I spoke kindly of the convention & council.  As I left the House Col. Isaac Hayne pulled his hat off & gave me a most gracious salutation as if he was grateful for my remarks.

	Judge Magrath came to my room & took a glass of whiskey with me after my speech.  I think my speech was highly appreciated by all who heard it and yet I had very little time to prepare.

	I am glad you did not go to Glencoe.  I am pleased to hear Hext is hauling wood.  I hope he will make a great deal of money for himself.  He ought to have all he receives.

	It is very late & I must go to bed.  Mr. Boyce is a noble gentleman.  I amof Judiciary the first or highest committee of the House.  I am glad I was not elected Speaker.  If elected I would face no opportunity of speaking.  fact is on the floor.  Croft is very kind so are all the members.

	Goodnight my dear wife.  Give my love to all the household. After I return from your uncles I will write Fannie.  B.F. Perry

P.S. Governor Pickens will have spent $50,000 whilst Governor!  What think you of my being Governor.  Consider such expenditues.  It would utterly grieve me.  One of his Bills in Charleston was $8,000! At the Hotel!
