Letter 579
17 April 1860
Columbia

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Willies.  Dr. Porcher is very kind.  I expect to leave in the morning for Charleston * will stay with him.

	I was unanimously elected a delegate to the Convention by Union, Spartanburgh, Anderson, Pickens & Greenville.  Reed my colleague got the vote only of the four last named districts.

       By some inferior management Col. Preston & myself were defeated for the State at large by Boyleston & McGowan.  However we are both elected by two Congressional districts which does as well.  There is no difference in the convention.

       I have just returned from looking over & around the new State House with Gen. Jones & am very tired.

	The Convention got on very harmoniously & I hope we shall do in the same way in Charleston.

	Write me in Charleston.  Love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
