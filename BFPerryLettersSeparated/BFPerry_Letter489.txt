Letter 489
10 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Sunday & was distressed to hear of your accident in riding out.  It is really fortunate that you & Anna were not seriously injured.  I cannot imagine how such a thing should occur.

	I was grieved too that you had not rece[ive]d my letters.  I have been very sick, but am pretty well now.  But I am afraid to remain here much longer lest the disease returns.

	I will endeavour to send you something by Wells in the morning.  I hope you get my letter enclosing ten dollars.

	I hope to get through with my cases tomorrow.  I have gained the great case in the court of Errors.

	I sent Willie a check for one hundred dollars this evening.

	Nothing was done in Court today in consequence of the death of Judge Evans.

	I suppose your uncle Arthur will be appointed by the Governor but the appointment will give great disappointment.

	I must now stop write letters in answer to those you sent me.

       I have bought three hats for Hayne, Hext & Luther.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

       Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
       Greenville
