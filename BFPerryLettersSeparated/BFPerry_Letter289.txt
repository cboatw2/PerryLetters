Letter 289
9 May 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter in which you state that I may come down Thursday & you will come up with mesend you more money.  This unsettles me again in my arrangements.  I had determined on returning to Greenville & staying there for some time.  I will now be governed entirely by my own convenience in my movements.  When I can get away from here I will go to Charleston & stay two or three days & we will return to Columbia,

	I do not know when my business will be reached.  Mr. Fillmore is expected tomorrow or the next day.  I wish to see him.  Tomorrow I examine the Students.  Today I get my pensioner discharged	 on the ground that the young woman was unworthy of credit in her statements so I have made that much inof my cases in the court of appeals since my stay in Columbia.

	Easl[e]y & McDaniel both inform me that several of my Equity clients at Greenville are wishing to see me.  It is important that I should return home as soon as possible & stay there.  I am neglecting the business in which our bread & the bread of our children depend.  I am sure you cannot wish that.  And there is no fun in running up & dow  the rail road this hot weather.

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are to take this letter.  I will write to you again as to my movements & business.

	McDaniel told me that Hoke said Hext was complaining & not very well.  But Willie & Frank say nothing about it in their letters written Sunday.  Mr. & Mrs. Elford say nothing about it.  I suppose it is one of Hokes pieces of news.

	I must now conclude by subscribing myself your affectionate husbandthe more affectionate because I restrain you from doing wrong.  If I loved you less I might let you have more your own way.
Yours &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Charleston
