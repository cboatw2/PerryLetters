Letter 708
27 October 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am overwhelmed with business & have but a few minutes to write you.  I sent in my message in first was read by Willie & is printed in the Columbia Paper.  The reporters have sent copies to Charleston & elsewhere.  This morning I have sent another message transmitting aCode of Laws prepared by Judge Wardlaw and Mr. Burt.  The message yesterday is highly approved.  I hear of no opposition to my election.  But great electioneering for Trescott & Campbell for the other Senatorship.

	I have nothing worth writing.  Your letter by  was rece[ive]d this morning & the letters by Porcher were rece[ive]d yesterday.  Willie went to see Miss Horlbeck yesterday but I shall not be able to see her.  I have been nowhere hardly out of the Hotel.  Letters & visitors are coming to me all day & I have to do all my writing as Willie is in the Legislature.  He seems to be doing well & I think enjoys himself here.  I am glad he is here in the way of.

	Miss Buist sent on the other packet & a letter for you which I will enclose.  The package I will send up by the first opportunity.

	General Hampton called to see me again yesterday & said he should consult & advise with me very often.  He is elected I suppose.  I told him he must accept the office of Governor.  He approved the Presidents policy & will do all that I could wish.

	Give my love to Fannie & all the Children & believe me as ever your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
