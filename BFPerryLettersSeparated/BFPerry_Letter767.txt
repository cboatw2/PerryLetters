Letter 767

Greenville

My dear Liz

	I returned home from Walhalla last night half past eleven.  We had a grand meeting fifteen hundred persons present & three hundred mounted on horses.  General Hampton, Col. Simpson, myself, General McGowan, Col. Aiken, Col. Cothran & Col. Wallace all addressed the meeting in the order of their names as stated.  General Hampton told me that he insisted to the committee of arrangements that I should address the meeting first & they replied that would never do as a great many persons would leave after hearing me.  The General said this was a very high compliment to me but a very poor one to the rest of the speakers.  They all say I made a good speech.

	We all left after dinner at five oclock & took the Airline road at Seneca city.  Hampton & company stopped at Easleys station to go to Pickens this morning.  I came home.

	At Central Station a company of young men met us dressed in red flannel shirts to represent the bloody shirt of Morton & demanded speeches from all of usa few words were given.

	On reaching the depot Mrs. G was waiting to receive her beloved husband who had been to Montgomery.  She wished to know of me all about the Bellemont House & whether you & Fannie were staying there.  She goes on in a day or two to Philadelphia.

	I found all well at home.  Snyder had been dismissed & a negro had taken his place which I am pleased at.  I had ordered Henry to meet me this evening at the depot.  Ed Rowland sent me home & charged two dollars.  I have seen no letters or papers but will get them this morning.  I hope to hear from you & Fanny.  I saw a great many of my old friends & acquaintances at Walhalla & they all seemed glad to meet me very much & complimented me very much all very youthful appearance.  One old man said it was remarkable I had no gray hairs!  Love to all.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry
