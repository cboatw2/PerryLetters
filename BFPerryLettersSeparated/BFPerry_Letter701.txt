My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line.  We arrtived here safely, but very much fatigued.  I am very sleepy & am going to bed.  Hundreds have been to see me & bother me all  day.  My message is presented & will be read by Willie tomorrow at 12 oclock to the Convention.

	Col. Aldrich introduced firery resolutions which were put down & refused to be printedhad only five votes.  I have telegraphed the President this evening.

	Your letters have all been distributed.  I saw Dr. LeConte & young Horlbeck.

	I send you a paper containing Janneys nomination for U.S. Senate.

	I feel quite well except want of sleep.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
