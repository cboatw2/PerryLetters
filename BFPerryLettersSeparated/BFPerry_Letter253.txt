Letter 253
23 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a letter from you this morning in which you stated that Mr. Elford had returned from Laurens Court & had been to see you.  I thank you with Mr. Elford that I have lost nothing by my trip to Washington although I should make nothing by it.  I have seen a good deal of the world of men by my visit, and I shall return to Greenville better satisfied to remove there with you & the children.  It does one great good to go abroad occasionally & it makes him love his home more.  We want a change too occasionally.  Variety is the spice of life.  Sameness is tiresome &c.

	The Gardiner case goes on most slowly & seems to be endless.  We commenced the examination of a witness yesterday & will not finish with him till twelve oclock tomorrow!  I am afraid if you do go & see Mrs. Thompson till you have good news to carry about the Gardiner case, your visit will be postponed a long time.  I am thoroughly convinced of the whole matter being a fraud & my strong  apprehension is that he will be convicted.  This however you may keep to yourself.

	I hope you will go & see Mrs. Thompson as often as you can.  I think how all I can learn from you & the servant [is] that she does not like the spiritual rappers.  It is a pretty good idea that I have visiting the General to leave the spirits in Washington & not carry them home with him.  Remember that one of these spirits he has been talking so much with is that of his first wife.  It would be dreadful indeed to a second to have the spirit of the first in the house with her & talking to her husband!  I thought these spiritual rappings &would excite Mrs. Thompsons--a wife is not willing to have a divided allegiance in the heart of her husband.

	I do not suppose I have lost much by my absence from Greenville.  Tell Mr. Elford to sign my name to the draft of a thousand dollars & get the money for it.  Let him write my name like I sign it & send off the draft & pay Dr. T

	I hope Becky is not very sick, & that her sickness may be such as you suppose.

	I think when we meet again, we shall have been absent so long from each other that [we] will have to be married over again & I will present you with the tea set & the goblets as a bridal gift.

	If I can find time I will procure a cheap & beautiful ring with my likeness in it for you.  I will have your likeness taken on a locket for myself or on a broach.

	I must now quit & go into consultation with Bradl[e]y and Carlisle.  It is now seven oclock & we went at that hour to examine Col. Abbot & Captain Slocum.

	God bless you & the children & preserve you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
