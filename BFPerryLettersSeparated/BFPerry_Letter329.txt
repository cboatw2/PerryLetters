Letter 329
7 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter & was glad to hear from home.    I was afraid Willie had met with some accident.

	Edward has been unwell, but is now perfectly well.    He had a cold.  He looks rather thin.  Sunday he did not seem willing to stay with Mr. Antwerp.  But early this morning he came to tell me that if he had to stay in Columbia he would prefer remaining where he was.  I went up & saw Mr. Antwerp this morning.  He praises Edward a good deal for his intelligence & good behavior.  He says he is much better than any of his servants.  He says however, that he did not know much about such work as he is doing.  He proposes to give me one hundred dollars for the clothe, pay his taxes & doctors Bills.  He says his clothing costs $50.00, as he clothes his tailor boysthat Edward will be worth fifty dollars more at the end of the year by the instruction &c.  I gave him no overseer. He says in payment Edward may have two weeks to come home & eight or ten days at Christmas.

	We had no court of Equity today.  Young, Herndon, Dawkins, Boylston, Thompson, Aldrich & a great many other lawyers are here.

	I have bought two white waistcoats for &6.00, one pair of pantaloonsone pair of boots $8.00Lady [Marguerite] Blessingtons memoirs & the Queens of Scotland.

	I have just been to see Professor McCay about the State House.

	Give my love to all of the children & believe me yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry
