My dear Liz

	I have about ten minutes before breakfast to write you.  Mr. Elford & myself are in a room together.  There were about four hundred passengers yesterday on the Greenville Rail Road.  Five cars full.  The largestever on the road and the taverns are crowded.  The stockholders paid nothing.  Hence some came from Greenville who only own two shares forty dollars.  We had a dusty ride down here.  I thought I should never get clean again.  But after washing I went out & bought me some clothestwo coats, two pants, four vests, a& pair of gloves for $28.00nice clothes too.

	I met Col Ware & Mr. Duncan returning home yesterday.  They have purchased 1800 acres of land in Georgia at $12 per acre.  Mr. Furmans intended bride was on the road.  She is tall & pale & rather pleasant looking.

	The Rail Road convention meets this morning & will get through tomorrow.

	The committee & convention is much talked of.

	I hope to hear from you tonight.  Mrs. Col. Fair came down with the Col. & enquired after you.

	I hope you & the children are well [and] getting on well.  I must now go to Breakfast.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Old Mr. McBee & myself rode down together & I ate dinner with him.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
