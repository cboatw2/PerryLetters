Letter 689
13 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you a letter this morningwhich you will receive by mail.  But since that time Hext has concludedcto go home with Col. Wares son Willie.  He can tell you all the news.  Fannie & Maggie paid me a visit this evening at my room & sat awhile.  She is now at Hol.  They came in the State House whilst we were voting for Governor.  We had three ballots & Judge Magrath ran ahead.  I dropped Preston on the third ballot & voted for the Judge.  It will probably be a close race between him & Garlington but I think Magrath will be elected.

	We have just heard that [Gen. William J.] Hardee defeated Sherman at Savannah with great loss, & that Sherman is in want of provisions & ammunition &c.  This information seems pretty correct although you may not see it in the newspaper.

	I have just been with Governor Pickens & Mrs. Pickens & spent a pleasant evening with them.  Inow go down & get the mail & hope to hear from you.  It is now doubtful whether I can return Friday & may be detained here till nexzt weekWares case will not be disposed of before next week & I cannot leave before it is finished.

	I have recd no letter from you tonight & am sorry I did not hear from home.  It alwaysgives me satisfaction to hear & I am uneasy if I do not.

	The enclosed letter from Willie was recd tonight.  I send it to you to read.  I am sorry he could not get a furlough to come to Columbia.

	There are several bundles here.  But hext cannot carry themone largeone for Lee & Beattie.

	Hext is out somewhere with Willie Ware & if is near nine oclock.  I am glad he is going home.  If he staid at the Hotel he would have too many temptations.  Make him study his Books at home.  I want to go home very much & see my wife & llittlew children.  Good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
