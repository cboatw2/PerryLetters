Letter 462
24 January [18]58
Annapolis

Dear Mama

	I am not at Mrs. Greens in the great city of Annapolis.  I arrived here last night.  I started from Cambridge last Wednesday evening and ought to have got here Thursday evening, but when I got to New-York I found that I could only get my trunks checked to Washington or Baltimore.  So I concluded to stay all night in Baltimore, and came on here yesterday morning by the 10 oclock train.  But when I got to the depot with my trunks, I found that the train didnt connect with thew Annapolis train, and that I would have to wait for the 5 oclock train.  So I just checked my trunks on to Washington, and came down here without any baggage.

	I went to see Frank last night after I got here.  He looked better than I ever saw him, and seems very well pleased with the School.  He took dinner with me today, and I will go to see him again after supper.  Tomorrow evening he will come to see me and go to Church with me.  I will leave here day after tomorrow morning (Monday) for Washington.  I am sorry and ashamed to say I forgot and left those letters of introduction, that Pa gave me, in my room at Cambridge.  I will call on Col. Orr at any rate.  I shall in all probability leave Washington Tuesday evening, and get home Thursday night

	No train leaves this place tomorrow, so this letter will not start before I do.

	I hope you are all well and that I shall soon see you all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
