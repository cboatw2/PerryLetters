Letter 175
3 June 1851
Spartanburgh C.H.

My dear Liz

	I am detained here by a very important case between Mr. Bobo & Col. Maybin of Columbia.  It will probably be tried tomorrow & if so I shall be at home Wednesday.

	I hope you will be able to keep up till my return, but I am afraid not.  You know my anxiety about the matter.  It is true I could be of no service, but it would be something to you to see and have a husbands sympathy and love in your suffering.  My return will be pleasant anywaypleasant to find you still about, & still more to find you with a sweet babe by your side.

	God bless you & preserve you & help you in your trying situation.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
