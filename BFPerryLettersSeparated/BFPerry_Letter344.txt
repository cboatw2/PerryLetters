Letter 344
7 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Son [Frank]

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night & I think you write very well.  I hope you will write to me often.  It will improve you.  I am glad to hear you are still saying your lessons to your mother.  Tell your mother that I have just rece[ive]d her letter written after your grandmother had dined with you.

	I suppose Susan Hoke has been over to see your mother & told her all about Columbia.  I have not seen Col. OHanlon since I wrote the first time.  Willie will return tomorrow & perhaps go home Monday or Tuesday.

	I am sorry bee turns out a such egg day, but the egg shells ought to be in the nest if Burt sucked them.

	Tell Fanny I hope she ids getting & saying her lessons also.  Tell Hext he ought to begin to learn his letters and tell Hayne he must begin to talk when I return home.

	Say to your mother that Mrs. Martin is not in Columbia.  Anna did not see Mrs. Taylor or any of the family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Master Frank Perry
