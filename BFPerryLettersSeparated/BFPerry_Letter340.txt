Letter 340
2 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just had dinner & Anna has gone with the Miss Adams to the Presbyterian church.  This morning Sue Hoke & Anna, Willie Gill Watson & myself went to the Episcopal church.  Last night we went to hear General Casey deliver a temperance lecture in the State House.  Afterwards we had dancing & singing till eleven oclock.  There is quite a crowd of ladies here.  Sue & Anna seem yp enjoy themselves very much.  They went to see the girls at the American Hotel after returning from church & paid a pleasant visit.  I gave up my room to them & have taken possession of Col. Irbys room with Willie.  The Col. has gone home & will not return till Tuesday.  In my room there are two beds.  When Irby returns I will have another bed put in the room & stay with him.  But roomwas in more demand.  A very large concourse of ladies came down Saturday & are now at this Hotel.

	I was glad to meet Anna & Sue & Willie at the Rail Road depot Saturday evening.  Willie has bought him acap.  I am sorry you did not receive my letter Friday night.  There is great carelessness at the Bar in sending off letters.  Wells came up to take my letter & I told him I had mailed it.  I will send this by Wells.

	I saw Armistead Burt yesterday.  He is at this House.  He came up & took a seat at the table by Anna & told her he saw her when she was a baby that he was one of my oldest friends, but that he was not quite as old as I was.  Anna denied this promptly & said I looked much younger.  He is three years my senior.  He said I did not change at all.  I told him you looked.  I told him you looked about seventeen.  He said it was strong proof that I had made you a good husband.  That case & distress wore out & broke down a wife faster than anything else.  He seems very kind & I have great regard for him.

	I must now close my letter as Mrs. Duncan has come with Mrs. B & I must stop & speak to  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
