Letter 643
3 December 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have stolen off from the House whilst speeches are being made on the Executive council  to write you a letter & get an early dinner.  We dine at four oclock.  The common dinner is two oclock.

	Col. Chesnut requested me yesterday to write out my speech for publication.  He said he was not here when I made it.  But he had heard it was the speech of the debate.  Yesterday evening I commenced writing & continued till eleven oclock in the night.  This morning I commenced again at five oclock &breakfast.  I wrote twenty pages of foolscap & gave the manuscript to Yeadon to publish in the Courier.  In consequence of my continuing so long in my writing I do not feel so well today.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & Fannies last night & was glad to hear from you.  But you are foolish about my not being elected Speaker.  And do my dear wife never mention to me again about any office.  I would not have foregone the pleasure of making my speech for the Speakers chair.    But do not allude to the subject again.

	Col. OHanlon paid me a visit yesterday evening & was very complimentary.  He enquired after all of you & Hext especially.  But he did not say anything about coming down.  Gilmore Simms spent Sunday evening with me & almost talked me to death.  He said his wife had just presented him with another child.  He has had fifteen children & has lost nine!  His beard is as white as snow & yet he is about my age!

	Your uncle Arthur comes into the House every day & spends some trime with me.  He complimented my speech the other day very highly.

	I can get rice here at six dollars a hundred.  But Mr. Boyce is going to write to Charleston for me.  He thinks he can get it cheaper.  He bought sugar here at.

	I rece[ive]d Willies letter enclosed in Fannies last night & was glad to hear from him.  You wrote nothing about Hayne.  Is he still at General Thompsons.

	I sawCrittenden today just from.  He says there will be no fighting at& John Cunningham is here &as ever.  Pamela sent an oldto Yeadon  the other day which he presented to the House.

	I will soon go & look at a silver cup for you & finish my letter when I return.

	I have returned from looking at silver cups & will not think of giving such prices.  I was perfectly amazedfor a cup the price of which he told me was $15 formerly he now asked $70.00 & would take nothing less.    He said he was not disposed to sell.  That he would rather have the silver cup than the confederate money.  You may give up all idea of making a present of a silver cup.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The weather has been very cold & I have been able to wear my overcoat in comfort.  It is now turning warm.

	Give my love to all the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
