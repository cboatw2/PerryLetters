Letter 652
23 February 1863
Greenville

My dear Liz

	This has been a busy day and I have only a few moments to write.

	I was surprised to see Alfred, & yet I was glad to hear from you.  I thouight a great deal about you & how Hext got home.  To hear from you all  that you are well is enough to excuse Alfred in my feelings.

	I made twenty dllars today by advice & drawing papers.

	I will not go to Charleston.  In fact I cannot spare the trime.

	You must get all the Irish potatoes you can.  I wish to plant a field of them.

	I spoke to Ward about the Bacon.  I wish five hundred pounds of Bacon & one hundred of Lard or one hundred & fifty.

	The corn you have ought to do us.  I fear we acnnot haul it from Gosnel[l]s.

	I am glad Fisher is going to make the fence.  Let him commence next to Carruths.

	I hope McClure will go on with his clearing.  I dont mind the Smoke House except the hauling.

	I would have sent you more seeds but it is too soon yet to sow them.

	I cant get sage nor tomatoes but will do so hereafter I hope.

	I have no news to write.  If I had time to study I could write you a long letter but I have no time.

	I will try & come up soon & see how you come on.

	I planted potatoes Saturday & tomorrow will plant a variety of seeds.  I bought onion buttons today.  I have plenty of cabbage seed.

	I have just got the mail, no news.  Isaac Hayne writes me to sell his negro for him on sale day.

	We all wish you at home very much & I think you may come back with me when I go up in good weather.

	Your mother, Susan & Fannie have all written to you & left me nothing to say.

	Do let the men go on with their oats & clearing & take care of the corn. It ought to do us.  If I could haul from Gosnel[l]sI would take his corn at $1.50 but I do not think that can be done.

	There is great talk of Bacon rolled with the coast salt spoiing & I shall see Zach Wood tomorrow,

	McClanahan has provided some bacon.

	I have bought fifty bushels of corn from Newberry.

	Take care of yourself & children my dear wife.  Your affec[tionate] husband. B.F. Perry

In haste

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
