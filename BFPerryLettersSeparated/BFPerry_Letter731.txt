Letter 731
18 August 1866
Philadelphia

My dear Liz

	I have just got through with the Convention.  It was the greatest assembly of men ever convened on this continent.  Everything was harmonious & complete success.  I made a speech to 1500 persons which was well rece[ive]d & I have sent it to you.

	The South Carolina delegation are going to dine with the Mayor of Philadelphia this evening.  Tomorrow we go on to Mr. Fishers who married Miss Middleton & spend the night with him.  Heowns a magnificent country seat.

	We will leave here Monday morning & reach home Friday.  Tell Mrs. Butler I saw Woodward & his little daughter, a sweet little girl.

	I have just been to have my likeness taken.

	Tell our friends that everything goes well & success is certain.  I rece[ive]d your letter & Willies.  I have heard nothing from Mr. Barnwell yet about your purchases.

	Judge Wardlaw was robbed of $500 whilst getting into the cars here & Col. Campbell lost a fine diamond breast pin in the same way.

	I have lost nothing & am quite well.  I have enjoyed myself well.  It has been a joyous frolic & I have a great deal to tell you.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
