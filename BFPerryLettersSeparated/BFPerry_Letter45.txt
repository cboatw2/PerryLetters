Letter 45
15 July 1846
Washington

My dear Liz

	I received your second letter last night.  I sent two or three times before I could get it.  Once or twice the Bar keeper told me there were n letters.  I knew you had written me and I leave here today.  I was unwilling to start without hearing from you.  General Thompson rece[ive]d letters from Mrs. Thompson & Butler who sent word that all of my family were well.  But I persevered until the letter came & I was much gratified to hear you were all well.  I shall now leave the city without regrethoping to hear from you in New York & Boston.

	I have not much to write in addition to my last.  I dined at Col. Tottens Monday and was delighted with him & his family.  He is a very intelligent & warm hearted gentleman.  His wife is a most agreeable lady but not handsome.  His daughter is a sweet young lady.  They all came up & shook hands with me & treated me as one of the family.  He has two sons not grown.  I believe he has one or two sons, a daughter married whom I did not see.  They all seem greatly attached to Mr. Poinsett.

	Yesterday evening I went to the Presidents in company with Burt, Simpson, Judge Butler, Fair.  I told Mrs. Polk that I had written Mrs. Perry some admirable sketches of the White House & its inmates and I assured her that the feeling of South Carolina was quite loyal that evening.  Judge Butler who was standing with me said I should use the word allegiance.  Mrs. Polk replied the other was the feeling when applied to a lady.  We talked to her some time until a crowd came up & pushed us off.  She is a most charming woman & seems so happy at being Mrs. President.  I do not think I ever saw a happier woman in my life.  She has a little spice of vanity in her character & her heart is filled to overflowing with the idea of being the wife of the President, & she seems to look upon him of being worthy of all the honor & admiration.  I could but think how she would differ in opinion with those who called Mr. Polk a third rate man during the presidential canvas.  In their opinion he is first of the greatest.  I will have a great deal to tell you about persons in Washington, but cannot write all.

	I have written a letter to the Mountaineer & in it mention my visit to Adams & the debate in the Senate.  You will see this letter and I will not repeat what is in it.

	Judge Butler stays here a short time & returns to So Carolina.  Governor [Pierce Mason] Butler has not yet arrived.  Dr. May who was over at Greenville with Powell McCray called to see me yesterday.  I also went by myself to see Crittenden of Kentucky & Archer Senator from Virginia.  I found them both very kind & pleasant.  Yesterday I dined with Mr. Burt at Calhoun & McDuffies in company with those gentlemen, Judge Butler, Simpson, Fair & Tucker of Virginia.  We had quite a pleasant party.

	Col. Fair & myself will start today for Baltimore.  You will not hear from me for some days.  I have not written yet to anyone but you & Col. Townes.  I must write to some others when I get time.

	My dear wife you must take good care of yourself & children.  Give my love to your mother & family & write me all the news, write to Boston.  My present notion is to go to New York, Saratoga, Niagara, down the river to Montreal & back to Boston.  Mr. Adams directed me to take this rout[e] & gave me all the particulars.  In great haste, yours truly, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
