Letter 394
7 May 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College Exhibition & it is now half past ten oclock (you like to know the hour & time I am writing to you).  I have lighted a segar & will write you a few lines whilst I smoke it.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear that you arrived safely at home.  I was anxious about you.  I am glad to hear that you found all well except Minerva & Marys baby & that they are better.  I hope poor Minerva may be restored to her mind.  It is a sad thing to be without reason.    I hope too Marys baby is better.  Nurse it & take care of it & let Minerva have every attention that she may require.  My feelings are alwayson the side of pitty & suffering.  If I were endowed with omnipotent power, I would make every human being happy in this life & relieve anywant of mankind.

	The speaking in College was tolerable.  Willie came to see me this morning & introduced his chum [Fredertick Gustavus] Behre to me.  I invited them to take tea with me tomorrow evening.  Behre is genteel modest looking young man.  He blushes like a woman.  I saw his face suff with blushes as he came up to be introduced.  I told him you were anxious to see him & he blushed again.  I have taken a fancy to him.

	Mr. Barnwell came up to me on the rostrum this evening & expressed his regret at not seeing you.

	I delivered your compliments to Mrs. LeConte at the supper table & she said she was charmed with you.  She said she had seldom seen a lady in whom she felt so much interest.  I told her that you reciprocated her feelings.  She had spoken to me in the morning about sending you the patterns.

	I have been engaged all day in College business.  I was appointed Chairman of a committee by the Governor at our meeting last night for this purpose with Senator DeSaussure & Col. Townsend which I regard as a compliment.

	When I went to the chapel this evening amidst a crowded house President McCay rose & came forward to greet me.  He seemed extremely kind & obliging.  I could not see Willie, but I suppose he saw me.  As we returned from the College there was a bonfire on the campus said to be the chairs & tables taken out of the room of Professor Pelham.  He was standing by me when someone told him what it was!  He said nothing.

	Goodlett & Donaldson came down this evening & told me about the Kansas meeting.  Col. Johnson of Charlotte walked with me to the College this evening & insists very much on my going to the Mecklinburgh celebration on the 20th.  It is to be a great occasion.  I am half inclined to go if I can spare the time.  I shall see Governor Swain, & all the great men of North Carolina & can reach there in one day from Greenville.

	The clock has now struck eleven & my segar is most outmy paper most filled & I must bid you good night.  I wish you & Arthur were here again.  Willie sends his love to you all.  Give my love to all the children & believe me your most affectionate & loving husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. Send my letter to the Patriot which is enclosed to you.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
