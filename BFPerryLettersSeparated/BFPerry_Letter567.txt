Letter 567
8 January 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	We received a letter from you last night & were glad to hear you were well.

	You must have had a dull Christmas & I am sorry you did not get leave to visit Washington.  I suppose your officers thought it best for you all to stay at home.  Some would not have been able to go & this would have mortified them.

	Wee anxious to hear how much you have risen & see your standing for the last month.  I now begin to feel that you are disposed to study & push ahead in the world.  Stick to this determination & carry it out.

	I am afraid you find the weather very cold at Annapolis.  We have had a dreadful spell of weather in GreenvilleSnow sleet & rain.  I have scarcely been out of my office & find my Montreal coat very comfortable even in the house.  This week I shall be engaged in examining witnesses in the in the commissioners office.  The election of Sheriff takes place tomorrow.

	The weather has been so bad that none of us have gone to church today.  We received an invitation yesterday to Spartan D. Goodletts wedding on Tuesday to Miss Lyles of Fairfield.

	Gilreathes  negro was tried here last week for killing a free negro & convicted of murder.  He is to be hung on the second Friday in April.  I defended him & Reed prosecuted.  There was a mistrial before I went to Columbia.

	I have nothing more to write you except that we are all well.  Your grandmother, aunts Anna & Susan & children are all well.

	I am glad you are pleased with Col. Ashmore. He is warm hearted & kind.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry.
