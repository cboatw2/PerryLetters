Letter 372
27 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now ten oclock in the night & I have just returned from Col. John S. Prestons dinner party.  It was a most delightful & interesting party & magnificent entertainment.  Only a few persons were presentCol. Hampton, Governor Manning, Col. Orr, General McGowan, Col. Pickens, Col. Chesnut & myself.  I never spent a more pleasant evening at the dinner table.

	On my return I rece[ive]d both of your letters with many others.  I was glad to hear from you & rather sorry not to find Frank here.

	Last night after writing to you I called over to see Col. Dawkins as I went to the College & saw Mrs. Cunningham.  She is altered very little & seemed as cordial as ever.  She enquired most affectionately after you & the children.  She asked how you looked & I replied as young as you did when we were first marriedlooked about seventeen.  I saw Mrs. Dawkins also.

	Col. Moses has invited four or five of us to go down to Sumter & spend Sunday.  I have promised to gomay be gone before Willie reaches here Saturday evening.  If so he can take charge of my room till my return Sunday evening or Monday morning.  In haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
