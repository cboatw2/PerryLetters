Letter 327
15 April 1855
Greenville

My Dear Daughter

	I received your letter last night, & we were very glad to hear from you, & to learn that you were well, & enjoying yourself so much at Dr. Caines.  You must give my respects to Dr. Cain & thank him & his family in our name, for all their kindness to you.  You must also invite your little friend Anna Mos to come & spend some time with you next summer.  I know Dr. Cain very well & served a long time in the Legislature with him & always entertained a very high regard for him.

	I am glad you have an opportunity of seeing the plantations of the lower country, & learning something of the society of the Planters.  You must not stay too long.  It is not healthy for a mountain girl to remain on the plantations late in the Spring.  I shall be in Charleston the first of May.

	When you go back to Town, I had rather you should stay with Miss Murden till I go down for you.  But you can do as you please, & as your mother directs.

	We are all well.  Fanny & Frank are taking lessons in dancing.  Hext & Hayne have grown a great deal.  Willie is making fine progress in his studies, & has the highest standing in his class, although there are some grown men in it.  You Pony is so fat & gaity, that I am afraid you will not be able to ride him when you return home.

	Your little friends here are making a great many inquiries about you, & when you will return home.  The Baptist school is doing very well here one of the best teachers in the Southern States.

	Your mother writes you so often, & tells you so much of the news, that I suppose you are well posted up in regard to Greenville.  I would write you oftener if your mother did not write you so constantly.

	We are all anxious to see you & the servants will give you a warm greeting.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
