Letter 180
25 November 1851
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening, enclosing one from Anna and another from Willie, and for all of which I am very much obliged to you.  I hope to receive another tomorrow evening.

	The reference to William & Annas going to the writing school I am willing you should do as you please about and Frank too may go if you think he will learn anything.

	I have two little packages for Susan, sent by General Martin.  I will send them up by young Markley who goes up tomorrow.

	I met Col. Isaac Hayne this morning as I was going down the steps & he coming up.  We spoke and shook hands & passed on with the ordinary enquiries.  He did not ask anything about his aunt & cousins as heretofore.  General martin seemed kind & friendly.

	We have just had a visit from Arthur Simkins & he was electioneering for commissioner.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this evening & gave me an invitation to tea tomorrow evening before I go to attend the board of trustees.  He wrote me a letter this morning inviting me to tea this evening.  The Dr. is delighted at the result of the election.

	Duncan, Brockman & myself are getting on very well in one room, except that the Colonel snores a little too much.
	I am glad to hear that you are all well, & that little Hext has experienced no evil from his magnesium.

	Tell the children all that I will bring them some pretty presents & write them a letter shortly.

	In regard to my purchases I have bought a pair of boots & a hatlife of RandolphLives of the Queens of France & Scotland, Lady Wortley &c &c.

	I will now close my letter as the clock is striking ten & perhaps I may write you again tomorrow.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
