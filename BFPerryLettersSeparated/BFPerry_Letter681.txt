Letter 681
2 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now half after ten ocl;ock in the night & Chancellor Dunkin has just left my room.  I went to take supper with Mrs. LeConte.  Fannie & Miss Graham & young Holbeck went to the Tableaux.  Hext went to bed.  I came off to prepare for tomorrow & write letters.  The Senate will send for Beattie & Thurston in [Thomas Edwin] Wares election.  They will have to come down Wednesday.  I will have a Writ issued for Willie but I am afraid he cannot be obtained.

	They have had a severe battle at Grahamville where Willie was stationed.  His removal to Wilmington was fortunate.  We whipped the yankees.  I saw Col. Ball who passed by there today.  The yankees lost five hundred &sixty killed & wounded.  Vardry did not get there in time to be in the battle.

	Dr. LeConte lives well & they seem as kind as they can be.  Fannie & Hext are enjoying themselves.  Hext does not wish to go to Col. OHanlons.  I will send him home next week  Fannie & all of them were in the State House today.  She says she enjoyed herself last night at the dancing party with Miss Holbeck.  Lula was unwell this evening & I did not see her.

	I have heard nothing from Willie.  I hope you are all well.  I must now close as I have other letters to write by  Thurston who goes up in the morning.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
