Letter 528
27 April 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was so much fatigued last night after trotting over the town, trying to find some clothes to make myself appear decent that I was not able to write you.

	Fannie has just finished a long letter to you & I suppose has told you all the news.  I may be telling you the same things over again.  There was a considerable crowd yesterday on the Rail Road; but today seven cars came laden with stockholders & their wives & children.  The Greenville folks yesterday  all went on to Charleston.  Mrs. Beattie, Hamlin, Willie, Mrs. Choice, Mrs. Cleveland, B & others.  Choice stopped to represent his stock.

	Col. OHanlon came to see us today & made a great many enquiries about you & the children.  Fannie & Annie had gone out of their room & he did not see them.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte seemed glad to see us & have been very kind.  Miss Graham is about starting to Europe.  Lula is very much pleased with her school.

	Fannie & Anne are delighted with their trip & are enjoying themselves very much.  They went up to see Mrs. Taylor this morning & were invited to stay with her.  But they prefer staying at the Hotel.  Mr. L &daughters are very kind.  The Governors drawing room willwas given to them yesterday, but I preferred their being near me & they have rooms near where we staid last winter.

	I have seen very few persons to converse with.  My purchases are two coats, four waistcoats, a dozen socks & a pair of pants, boots & a hat.

	There is great dissatisfaction with the management of the Rail Road & an effort will be made to reform the management by turning out some of the officers.  The weather is warm & we have had rain.  I hope you & the children are doing well in our absence.  I would tell you all who were at the Hotel if I knew them or you would know them when their names are mentioned.  Mrs. McPheters & her daughters you know.  Tow[n]es of Abbeville & daughters are here.  His daughters are going to school at Barumville [Barhamville].

	I think it likely I shall remain here till Monday & then return with the girls & remain at home instead of coming back again.  Though I ought to be at home Salesday.

	The acquittal of Sickles was mentioned last night & Mrs. LeConte & the Dr. both agreed with me thatdeserved his fate, but that Sickles is an unmittigated scoundrel.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
