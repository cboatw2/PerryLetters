Letter 144
7 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Little Daughter

	You can hardly imagine how pleased I was to receive your beautiful letter.  I had no idea you could write so well.  Indeed you write better than Willie.  I told him so & that he must take more pains in his next letter to his mother.  You must write me another letter.

	There is a German who arrived here the other day with some hundreds of canary birds in little  cages & sells them at four dollars a pair.	 How would you like to have a couple of the little creatures.  If you will write to me perhaps I may purchase two of them for you.  They sing beautifully.  But strange to say all the singing & chattering is done by the male bird.  The female does not chatter at all.  This reverses what is common in our species.

	The other day in the State House the Gallery was filled with young ladies & little girls & they kept up a chattering all the time like the canary birds. & disturbed the members by their noise.  But as soon as they left the Gallery all was quiet again.

	In the course of four or five years I will bring you down here to Columbia with me.  I wish you had been here the other night to have seen the Tableaux vivant at the Catholic Fair.  They were beautiful little girls & boys & ladies standing, reclining & sitting like pictures & Statues.  Willie was very much pleased & I am sure you would have been too.

	Willie & myself have been invited to ride on the rail road to Camden next Tuesday & perhaps we may go if I can leave the Legislature.  But today the Bank question came up & it is too important a question to leave.

	I will now stop writing & finish my letter this evening after I return from the State House,  Something may occur which your mother would be glad to hear.  Willie shall write to you by the next mail.  He has some beautiful books which you shall read when we return.  They are full of pictures & such pretty stories that I have been reading them myself.

	I have just returned from the State House, ate my dinner went to the Post & recd your mothers letter of Wednesday.  I had just seen Col. Thos P. Butler who came down in the stage this evening & told me you were all well.  I was glad to hear from you by letter although it was a short one.  Willie had not eaten dinner today when the Legislature adjourned & therefore I did not go to dine with the Governor as I had been invited & had some idea of doing.

	We had a crowd of ladies in the gallery today & Col. Memminger your friend who you took for a man selling chickens made an able argument against the Bank.  Mr. F. P. Reed of Anderson replied to him, but in a very feeble manner.  General Adams will speak tomorrow.  I may speak Monday or Tuesday.

	I saw Col. Isaac Hayne & his lady in the gallery & spoke to the Col. after the Legislature adjourned.  He immediately commenced electioneering with me for his friend Dr. Stark.  I answered your aunt Eliza Haynes letter & wrote very politely & pleasantly.  She too had written me about her [husbands]  office more than about Willie.  I told her it would always afford me great pleasure to serve her as her family & that she had only to command my service.

	I am glad to hear Sam Earle has bought his Brothers land.  He has paid a high price for it.

	I did not receive a ticket to the commencement Ball & therefore did not go as I usually do.

	I have bought for your mother one of the prettiest shawls I ever saw.  It is a dress shawl & quite large cashmere.  White in the center & large wide borders of flowers extending pretty much across.  It is fine, though not thick & heavy, & is such as I see the little ladies wearing.  I think your mother will be pleased with it & the price astounded me.  I cannot yet understand it.  It was $4.00!!!.  If the man had said $15.00 I should have given it.  I had looked at a great many priced from $7 to $12 and was not pleased with any of them.  Passing by a store I saw the shawl & went in.  I know it will please your mother & although not as warm as a cloak or a blanket shawl is warm enough.

	Willie is now talking to me & I must& go down to the State House as it is just dark.

	You must write me again.   Tell Fanny I saw a great many cocoa nut cakes today.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
