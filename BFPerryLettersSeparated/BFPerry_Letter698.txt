Letter 698
Friday morning, [December 1864]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am writing you before day.  The clock has just struck four & I am dressed.  I recd your letter last night after my return from committee.  I was glad to hearfrom you & that you were getting on so well.

	The weather is so warm I expect you had better get Watson  to butcher the beeves & sell the meat.  I am afraid it will spoil.  They ought to be killed before they become poor.  If you keep them till the weather changes you must make John feed them well on corn & shucks & take care that they do not get out & go off and the same with the hog.  But as corn is so scarce you had better kill as soon as safe.  I am glad John is haulking the corn.

	I wrote you yesterday & have nothing further to communicate.  No further news from the fight at Grahamville nor nothing further from Sherman.

	I hope Anne will be satisfied with my sale of her gold & Bond.  The Bonds are falling, but gold is rising.  I do not think her capital is lessened  by the arrangement I have made.  The interest will be so much more valuable than the Bond.

	Nothing was done yesterday in the Legislature.  Col. Wares case will come up today.  Col. Campbell & C.P. Sullivan are employed by Sullivan.  I am alone for Col. Ware.

	Judge W came into my room just now & untangled my writing.  We then went down to breakfast at five oclock & I have just got back.  I must now close & hunt up some passenger to send this letter by.

	It is still not daylight yet.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
