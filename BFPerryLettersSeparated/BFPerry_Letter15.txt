Letter 15
Tuesday morning, [26 November 1844]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I must write you whenever I can & therefore will have to write the day before the Stage leaves.  I have a few moments of leisure this morning before breakfast & will avail myself of the opportunity of writing to my wife & children.

	Yesterday morning I saw Col. Martin, who said that Mr. Haynes friends requested him to ask me to write & inform you of the particulars of his death.  I told him I had already done so.  I understand Mr. Haynes was in perfect health when the paralysis came on.  He attempted to raise up a window & his right side became palsied & he fell to the floor.  I hope however your mother has received letters from some of the family.

	I made my debut in the Senate yesterday in a short speech on the contested election between [Andrew] Hibben & [James Smith] Rhett which was well received.  Have you seen the puff [of me] in the Charleston Courier?  It was written by Gilmore Simms.  Judge Frost told me yesterday he was really gratified to see me in the Senate & that my election gave great grattification to my friends in the Courier & that they were many.  Almost everyone I have met has said to me that they were pleased to see me back in the Legislature.  Col. Pickens spoke to me as I went up to qualify & said he was glad to meet methat we had both got to be old men at the same timealluding to our coming into the Senate together.

	Judge [Josiah James] Evans enquired very kindly after you and so did Judge Butler & ONeall.  I gave the letter to Mr. Seabrook & also to Mr. Roper, both of whom enquire very kindly after you all & Anne in particular).  I had a long talk last night with Henry L. Pinckney who also enquired after you all.  He is very much like Frances Hayne.  I could but think of Frances all the time I was talking to him.  His nose, lips, expression of the eyes &c.  I hope she has more principle than her uncle.  But I found Pinckney a very pleasant man.  His views & feelings as expressed on every subject were correct & honorable.  He agreed with me very well in politics & I was rather disposed to like him.  I expect he is a good deal like Walker morallynothing bad about him but without firmness & not a close observer of truth.

	I have taken a seat in the Senate with Mr. [Henry Clinton] Young.  He left his seat & came over to where we could both sit together.  I like Mr. Young very much.    He is a noble fellow & keen hearted man.  I love purity & sincerity & will make those only my friends who possess those qualities.

	The breakfast hall is now ringing & I must close this very hasty scroll.  I have bought the finest trunk you ever sawa large travelling trunk ($22.00).  It will last us our lives & be a trunk for our children.  I have also had to buy a, pair of gloves and shall have to purchase handkerchiefs.   I left one at home.

	You have no idea how much I wish to see you & the children & how glad I shall be to receive a letter from you.  God bless you, B.F.P.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
