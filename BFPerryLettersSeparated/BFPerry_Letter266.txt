Letter 266
4 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just written a letter to you by Mr. A. Allston who is going to Greenville with his sisters to spend the winter & build on his land near the Village.  But for fear he may not reach Greenville tomorrow I will write you again.

	I thank you for your letter by H.T. Thompson & will certainly do all I can to assist him.  Willie & Anna are enjoying themselves very much.  They went to the commencement today &^ were pleased.  The House is full of ladies. Mrs. Green is now in their room.

	I have just written a letter to the Patriot & have nothing more to say.  I will make Anna write you tomorrow.

	I have no time to write.  Anna does not care to go to the Ball tonight.  I will send them tomorrow to see Mrs. Taylor.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F., Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
