Letter 364
21 October 1856
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I write you merely to let you know I will be at home tomorrow evening.

	I saw Warren yesterday who told me they were all well at the Farm & his Fathers.  They had just heard of the death of Clark Perrys wife.  She died of typhoid fever in Texas & left a little daughter ten months old.  It is a sad fate for the poor girl remote from all friends but her husband.

	Warren paid me about five hundred dollars for the estate from the sale of wheat & bacon.

	I have got a good many new cases here but no money.

	Elford, Donaldson, Easl[e]y & Sloan Duncan came on with me on Sunday.  Elford told me that Dr. Edward Jones had cut his throat in Jail.  I presume the family have no regrets on the subject.

	I have not had any conversation with Keith yet on the subject of your settlement.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
