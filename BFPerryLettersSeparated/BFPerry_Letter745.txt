Letter 745
24 August 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I am glad we have the opportunity of writing to each other every day.

	The cases of Taylor & Herrick are still progressing. I suppose we will finish today & if not too much fatigued after my argument I will ride out to Sans Souci this evening.

	No letters or books for you.    I suppose Willie & Hext will be at home this evening.

 	In great haste, as I am preparing my argument.  Your affectionate & lonely husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Sans Souci
