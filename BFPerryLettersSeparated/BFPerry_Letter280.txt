Letter 280
9 April 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have a few moments to spare before starting this morning & will write you a line.  I wrote a long letter for the Patriot last night.

	We had quite a pleasant trip down with Mr. Duncan & Beattie.  Col. Fair got in at Newberry.  The up train yesterday had a great many of my acquaintances whom I met for a few moments & amongst them George Butler of Arkansas.  He is on his return from Washington & wishes very much to see me in Greenville he said.

	There are a great many persons going down this morning & amongst them Mr. Taber who is at Janneys. He has been sick & is just returning.  Mr. Robert Cunningham went down yesterday.  [William H.] Thomas the Editor of the Mountaineer is going down & here.  Beattie says the next sale of that paper will be a blowup & it will fall through.

	I have purchased all my clothes herecoat $10pants 7.00waistcoat 5Boots 8Hat 5--$1.

	Mr. Janney is very kind & says he is going to send you a bottle of his preserved peaches which are exactly like the ripe green peach.  He is going to visit the mountains again next summer.  Mrs. Janney enquired after you & Anna.  The smallest of the daughters is here only.  She enquired after Anna.

	The dust yesterday was awful.  Today it is raining & will be better.

	Pinckney McBee & Irvine went on last night.  Dr. Thomas also came down with us & went on last night.  I saw Henry C & Doyley at the depot.  Hamlin Beattie came to see his father last evening.  They are all well.

	My face & bile are better.  I had a good sleep last night & feel better this morning.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  Yours, B.F. Perry

Mrs.  Elizabeth Perry
