Letter 563

Thursday
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was so much engaged yesterday that I could not write you.  In the morning I went to the court of appeals & was all day engaged in my cases.  They are all disposed of.  I gained the case of BoinestChaplain.  The court willthe case.  This you may tell Boinest or Dicky if Willie sees them.  I think I will get a new trial in the case of Boinestads Dicky.

	I did not go to the House yesterday at all.  In the evening I went to dine with Dr. Fair & had a most eloquent entertainment which I did not leave till nine.

	I rece[ive]d your letter & the pamphlets & will go this morning to have them bound.  I gave Mrs. LeConte her poetry & Ashmores letter, also one rece[ive]d from Frank yesterday which is very encouraging.  I have not seen her since.

	I will not leave Columbia as soon as the court of appeals is disposed of & the Blue Ridge.  General Easl[e]y goes up in the morning & I may send Gregson letters 7abroad to you.

       I have nothing more to write you.  I sent Frank $20.00 yesterday.

       I want to see you all very much.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
