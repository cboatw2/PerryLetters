Letter 251
21 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I wrote you yesterday morning & after closing my letter I rece[ive]d yours of Monday in which you mentioned that Col. Ware would come up & see me as soon as I returned home.  I shall certainly be at home in time to prepare for his defence.  I hope to get off this week.  But I must have patience and endeavour to make something out of the Indians or Gardiner before leaving.

	Yesterday evening General Thompson & myself rode out with Mr. Bradl[e]y to his country seat eight miles into Maryland.  I was delighted with the trip & the country and Cherry  the name of Bradl[e]ys mansion.  The house is one hundred years old.  His father was assistant Post Master General under General Washington & lasted in office till the administration of General Jackson.

	I have written an account of my visit to Bradl[e]ys farm for the Patriot.  Mrs. Bradl[e]y is as native of New Haven & her name was Tuttle.  But Bradl[e]y tells me there are none of the name or kindred there now.  He said he thinks he has heard his wifes sister who married Sterly speak of Mrs. McCall in New Haven.  She was then perhaps single.

	My letters to the Patriot reflecting & sneering at the secessionists wishing office have excited a good deal of interest in Charleston.  The Mercury has opened his fire on me.  Last night I rece[ive]d a letter from Gilmore Simms complaining that I had done him injustice & that he was not a secessionist.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from Col. B.F. Hunt encouraging me about the Gardiner case.  I also rece[ive]d a letter from Dr. Gibbes about my letter to the Smithsonian Institute.

	You say your mother thinks so Badly of her kindredthat I must confess they are not great favorites with me.  Arthur Hayne hardly enquired after you all & I saw nothing more of him after speaking to him in the House of Representatives.  He staid here some time.  Ingersoll did appear to take more interest in enquiring after you all than Arthur Hayne.  This however was very natural.  The only heard from you presumably and the other had not for many years.

	I had you before me last night in my dreams.  I wish the dream could be realized, & I could be with you & the children again.  It is pleasant to go from home occasionally, but it is still more pleasant to return home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
