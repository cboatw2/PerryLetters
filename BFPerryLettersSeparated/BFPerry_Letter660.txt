Letter 660
9 July 1863
Greenville

My dear Liz

	It is very cloudy & it is doubtful whetherwill go or not this morning.  But I will write you a line or two.

	At eight oclock I meet Col. Martin.  At ten court meets.  Judge ONeall came last night & says he cannot sit more than one day.

	I was very busy yesterday & shall be more so today.

	We have no particulars of the great battle at Gettysburg in Pen[n]sylvania.  It is likely Wilie was not in it.

	I dont think it will be possible for me to come up to Glencoe.  The Board of Trustees of the College are ordered to meet on Monday night.  But I shall not go.

	Tell Alfred he will have to keep chopping in the corn till it is clear if it takes him to September.  I want all the sproats killed & grass cleared out so that I may sow rye in the field up toward Bil Fishers.

	As soon as the weather is settled & the wheat perfectly dry he must haul it & fence it in so that the horses may have a pasture.

	Let Mary & Lindy & Charlotte all chop sproats in the corn every day till it is cleared out.  Then fix your garden & road & yard.  Keep them in the field first.

       I have bought a pretty clock for Glencoe keeps good time.

       Fannie & Hext can tell you all the news.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
