Letter 762
3 November 1872
Greenville

	I rece[ive]d your letter this morning & was very much gratified at your improvement.  I hope Aiken will restore you to health again & that you will be able to return in the spring a well man.  But take care of yourself, dont catch cold or be imprudent in your living.  Take moderate exercise in good weather.  Continue your cod liver oil.  I will send you a jug of whiskey by express this week.

	Your mother came back last night quite well and delighted with her visit to Charleston.  She says she got Mr. Glover to send you a draft for $50.00.  I will send you one whenever you ask for it.  Let me know before you get out of funds.  I will repay Mr. Glover tomorrow.  I know your stay in Aiken will be expensive but I do not mind the expences if you are benefitted by it.

	Willie came back from Abbeville last night also, & goes down to Columbia Tuesday morning to see about contesting the election & to visit the Lula.  He bears his defeat well.  Your mother asked him about the news of his being engaged, & he said there was no truth in it.    There is none at all.

	Ben has been hauling corn & shucks.  We made 450 bushels & have got 250 from Simmons, only afrom Johnson & none yet from Calvinonly 64 bushels from Jack Jenkins & $27.00 in cotton.

	There have been two or three corn shuckings every night last week.  Johnson has had two & not done yet.

	Fannie & Perry are quite well. I left them just now at Susans with your mother.  She came in with me this evening to see your grandmother.

	The potato crop has turned out well.  The oats look fine & the wheat pretty well.

	I hope you get the Enterprise.  Give my respects to George Croft.  Write me soon.  We are all well.  Hext wrote me three days since.  He is well & hopes to be appointed to a position in the hospital.  The appointment is made shortly.  Frank McBee has just been in the office & says he is going down to General Hagoods to spend Christmas & that he will have you to go down to Barnwell & meet him.  Your affect[ionate] Father, B.F. Perry
