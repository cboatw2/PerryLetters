Letter 638
24 November 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have had so much company in my room this evening that I coul;d not write you by mail but have met Mr. Sass who offers to take this letter.

	Col. [Thomas Nuckolls] Dawkins [has] become a candidate for Speaker. & defeated both of us.  Aldrich was elected on the third ballot.  If Dawkins had not been a candidate  I would have been elected the first ballot.  But de divided the upper country & in order to make an election votes went over to Aldrich.  The first ballot I got 31, Aldrich 36 & Dawkins 27.  But thirty members wre absent & mostly from the upper country.  The most prominent of the Charleston delegation voted for me.  Trenholm, Trescot, Yeadon, Campbell, Whaley, Seymour &c.  But R. C electionered as if he had been before the people.

	I am not at all mortified at my defeat.  It is all for the best.  But I will remember Col. Dawkins.

	Mr. Petigru was in my room this evening and says it would not do for any union man to be governor.  He would be charged with Treachery.  Yeadon says he intends to run me for Chancellor & Whaley said the same.  Dr. Croft said Mrs. Pickens expressed great regret at my not being elected.

	I have not been able to get the mail this evening.  I therefore have not heard from you.

	Three hundred came down on the cars this evening.  All Greenville seems to be here.

	I have no news.  I am anxious to hear from you.    Give my love to the children & your mother & Anne.  Your aff[ectionate] husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
