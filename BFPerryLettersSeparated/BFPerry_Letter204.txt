Letter 204
8 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I received your letter last night & was very glad to hear from you, and to hear that you were well and enjoying yourself amongst your kind relations.

	I received a letter also last night from your Mother.  They were all well & she sent me your letter to her.  I had sent her your first letter to me.  Also you see how much we value your letters.

	Mr. & Mrs. Elford are here going down to Charleston.  They have letters for you & Mrs. Elford will call & see you.

	Enclosed I send you ten dollars which you desire.

	Mr. Janneys little daughters enquire a great deal about you. & say I must write for you to come back.  They are anxious to have you with them again.  One of them said she was going to write to you.

	I have to write several letters this morning & must conclude this.  In regard to your coming up with Mrs. Trimmier you can do as you please.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
Charleston
