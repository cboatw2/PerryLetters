Columbias

 My dear Lizzie

	We all reached here last night about twelve oclock in safety after a break down on the Greenville road below Allston.  The Engine ran off & broke its axle tree & wheels.  We were detained in the swamp from two oclock till ten oclock in the night without anything to eat or drink.  There being no water, I did not even take a drink of brandy.  No one was hurt.  There was a great crowd on board the Cars.  Amongst them a large number of Methodist Clergymen on their way to the Conference at Charlotte.  Mr. Wightman, Doctor Smith &c.  They had their families with them.  We had a dreary time of it.  But on reaching Janneys Hotel we had a good supper & I went to bed at one oclock, slept till eight, took breakfast at nine, & feel perfectly well & restored.

       On the Cars Mr. Reed mentioned a singular circumstance in regard to Col. Brockmans daughter who is boarding with him & may throw some light on the cause of Anna cough.  Miss Brockman took a ride one cold day on the Blue Ridge Rail Road & commenced coughing.  It continued at intervals very bad.  Finally threw her into a fever & she had to go to bed.  The doctors visited her for two weeks & thought she had either consumption or bronchitis.  Her Father & Mother came to see her.  Whilst in bed one day, recently, her cough was very violent & she coughed up a lump of charcoal as large as a pea which she had somehow swallowed whilst cleaning her teeth & which had lodged in her throat.  She was immediately relieved of her cough, her consumption & her bronchitis.  It may be that Annas cough is owing to some such cause.  Some charcoal. Bone, or crumb of break lodged in her throat.  Write to her about it.

       I am writing to you about half past twelve oclock & have already written to Elford & Frank & am going to write to Anna & Willie.  I got here so late last night that I saw no one.  And went down to breakfast so late that I saw very few persons this morning.  I have not yet seen Mr. or Mrs. LeConte.  I saw their sons & told them to tell their mother that I had heard from their sister &c.  I suppose I shall see them at the dinner table.

       I have not been out of the House.  The weather is pleasant but rather cold.  I saw Hamlin Beattie & C Butler last night.  They had just been undergoing an examination by one of the Committee.  There are twenty five applicants for admission.

       Governor Allston & his family are expected tomorrow.  The Charleston members have not yet arrived.  Neither Dr. [William Adolphus] Mooney nor [Nathaniel] Morgan or [John Latimer] Westmoreland are here.  I suppose they will come down tomorrow.  I wish very much I had staid till Monday.  It was a horrible time after we ran off the track till we reached Columbia.  I thought of a shipwreck at sea where the passenger were without food or drink & waiting death.  How much safer to be on land where we can send for help.

       I was told at the Greenville depot that Spartan Goodlett was very low with typhoid fever, not expected to live.  Write me how he is.  It is strange I did not hear of it whilst at home.  It is a dreadful disease.

       Write me every day & I will write you whenever I can.  Kiss the children for me, & give my love to your mother Susan & Anne.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry
