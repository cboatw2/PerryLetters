Letter 728

Washington

My dear Liz

	I have not heard from you yet.  Mr. Asa Hodges csame here yesterday, who left Greenville Monday & says all are well.

	Tuesday morniong I went to see Mrs. King & she was out.  In the evening she wrote me a beautiful note to escort her to the Presidents Service that night.  Col. Elford & myself went & she had procured a carriage was magnificently dressed & said she had not been to any of the Presidents Services for want of a suitable escort.  She & I walked all over the rooms.  I introduced her to the President & his daughters.  There were two thousand persons present.  Such a jam you never saw.  We were much noticed, & Col. Elford said he heard the remarks made very often walking behind us there goes the governor of South Carolina.  I met Mr. Bancroft & had a long chat with him.  Mr. Washington came up and spoke to me & several others who remembered me in the Charleston Convention.  I saw & conversed with General Butler & Senator [Henry] Wilson of Massachusetts.  They were polite.  I have met Randal Hunt of New Orleans.  He says  is pardoned & living in New Orleans.  Judge Patterson is very kind to me & his wife is pleasant & also Mrs. S.  I have become acquainted with governor [William Lewis] Sharkey, Gov. Parsons & Gov. M.  Governor Sharkey told me that W[illiam] H[enry] Foote had just published a book in which he & myself were compared.  A Bookman has presented me with a copy of the work.  This morning The Chronicle announced that governor Perry of S.C. had an interview with the President yesterday.  I have written a long article for the National Intelligencer which will make a noise tomorrow morning, in the political world.  Last night Miss Sallie Martin sent for me to join a pleasant party at her uncles, but it was so cold I declined going.  I will call to see her today.  I have bought you.  I have got a full length Photograph likeness & smaller ones all fourteen dollars as a present for you of myself.  I got the President yesterday to sign an order for five hundred pardons for South Carolina & today I have sent for another order for two or three hundred more.  Col. Elford is having them executed & will bring them home.  I rerce[ive]d a letter this morning from Miss Simons & I have got her pardon.  There are about one thousand persons at Willards Hotel & the ladies all ugly.  Yesterday, at the White House, I saw an exceedingly beautiful young gentleman step into the room, dressed in cloth pants and sack coat, fair, ruddy & lovely complexion soft beaming eyes with a lovely smile& a fancy hat  on his head.  I thought to myself your face gracefull person and winning manners will play mischief with these young ladies.  As he came near me I thought of M in Bulwers Strange Story.  There was a perfectabout his air & expression, high bred manners &c.  I fouind out it was Miss Walker a doctor in the United States Army, who had been twice captured by the!  Col. Elford says he feels sick, & wishes to send for her.  I shall leave here Monday or Tues.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
