Letter 460
3 January 1858
Columbia

My dear Son

	I met Anna here last night, & we go up to Greenville in the morning.  She came from Philadelphia with Miss Graham to Washington & from there with Dr. John LeConte to this place.  He health is better & I hope she may soon recover.  She stood the journey very well & regrets very much not seeing you.  She says she wrote you to meet her at the Annapolis Junction, and is afraid there was some mistake.  But I suppose you could not get permission to leave your school.

	I left them all well at home.  It is not late in the night & I have been writing letters to various persons.

	If you can get permission go on with Willie to Washington & stay a day or two.  But I suppose you cannot & perhaps ought not leave your school.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
