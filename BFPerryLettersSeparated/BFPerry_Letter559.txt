Letter 559
15 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just taken dinner & it is night.  I have to go back to the House at seven to finish my separate court Bill which has been under discussion all day & will pass.  I have made three or four speeches on it today.

       I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & will explain all when I see you.  Dr. Fair told me last night  that Governor Adams could not live long & he was conscious of it.  He is going about the House & will till a day or two of his death.  How sad.

	I gave theto Stokes today & he will bind them very reasonably for $1.29 per copy in black Morrocco with gilt &c.  They will be finished next week.  I have not spoken to Mrs. LeConte since I gave her the poetry & letters.  Today I sat a different table with,although my seat next to her was kept for me but there was no room for.

	I feel as if my Bill for a separate court will be a triumph & I am sure it will pass about nine oclock  tonight.  Fifteen or twenty members have changed their votes.

	I send this evening a letter from Warren & Wilkes approving my Resolutions & very complimentary.

	The weather is not so cold here & I cannot wear my overcoat.  I put on my cloak.

	I must now close.  I saw sometoday, who told me he saw Willie & that Willie stays in my office very.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
