Letter 586
26 April 1860
Charleston

My dear Son

	I will write you a few lines.  I am here attending the Convention as a delegate.  We have a prodigious crowd in the city.  But I am at Dr. Porchers & very comfortable.  The Convention goes on very harmoniously.  I like the northern delegates very much.  They are all in favor of the South & the Constitution.  I have become acquainted with many of them.  Who will be nominated for the Presidency is uncertain.  I do not think Douglass will though the north are united over him.

	I saw Mr. Walker the father of your friend the cadet & he enquired after you.  Your friends here all enquired about you & hope you are doing well.

	There is a chance of nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency or Vice Presidency.  At present the contest is between Douglass & Hunter of Virginia.  But neither will get the nomination.

	You must write me whether you go to sea this summer or not.  I will send you some money when I go home.  How much do you want.

	I have nothing more to write.  Be a good boy & study hard.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
