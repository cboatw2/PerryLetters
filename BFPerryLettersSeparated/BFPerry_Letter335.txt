Letter 335
14 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from Governor Adams & enclose you my account of the visit.

       I rece[ive]d your letter on my return & hope to hear from you again tonight.

	I have nothing to write you.  I shall go to Charleston in the morning & stay there Thursday & Friday & be home Saturday.

	I hardly think it is worthwhile for Frank to come & meet us.  It will cost three dollars & he will loose a day from school.  But still if you are disposed to let him come you may.

	I hope you will have all your house arranged by my return.  I can do all the shopping in two days in Charleston.

	Governor Adams has improved his style of living very much.  Mrs. Adams inquired about you & Anna & has promised to send you a basket of strawberries, the largest I ever saw.  Affectionately yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
