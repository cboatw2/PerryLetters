Letter 285
4 May 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Since writing you this morning I have rece[ive]d a most valuable, useful & beautiful present for Anna from Mr. E the district attorney of the United States who met her in Columbia last winter.  I asked him & Reed to[page torn] after getting through business there [page torn] Captain H  I was looking at a very fine gold thimble in a magnificent tortoise shell case & spoke of purchasing it for my little daughter.  Mr. E immediately said he begged for permission to send it to her as a present & would do so.  He said he went with Anna to the College chappel last winter & had a great deal of amusement with her.  She seems to have made a most favorable impression in all  who saw her here last winter.  I value the thimble & case very much for I know it will please Anna & be of use to her.  It is the finest thing of the kind I ever saw.  The price was $7.50.

	I have just been over to see Col. Pickens and his daughters who are at Hunts Hotel.  They will remain here till next week.  The Col. enquired about you, Anna & Willie & would have been very glad to have seen you.  His daughters seem pleasant & intelligent.

	I have just seen Mr. Irwin of the Mansion House & will send Annas thimble by him to her in the morning.

	I finished my business in the Court of Equity about half after one today.  I think I am pretty sure I have succeeded in all my cases before the Court of Equity.

	I hope to hear from you this evening.  The mail has come in, but not yet opened.  It is half past four oclock in the evening.  Governor Means & Mr. DeSaussure are to come to my room to decide on the college matters referred to us as a committee.

	I must therefore bid you goodbye till Monday next.  There is to be quite a large party going to Governor Mannings residence tomorrow.  I go to General Adams & then Sunday to the governors.  Your affectionate husband now, and at all times, past, present & future, B.F. Perry
