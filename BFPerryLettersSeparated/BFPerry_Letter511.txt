Letter 511
9 January 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter Friday evening & one last Monday giving an account of your visit to Washington.

	Poor Anna is gradually sinking & cannot live many days longer.  She is a mere skeleton.  I am so much afflicted by her situation that I have no heart to write you.

	I wish it was possible for you to come home with Willie and see Anna once more.  But it would be only an affliction to you.  Your dear Father, B.F. Perry
