Letter 166
4 December 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Frank is not inclined to go with Mr. Easl[e]y & therefore I shall not send him.  He is however very much in my way but a great favorite with all the members.  Col. Dudl[e]y told me tonight that it was the expression of all that Frank was a remarkable boy in looks & appearance.  I replied he was very different from Will & explained to the Col. the difference.  Tom Poe a little boy has just brought a message from his uncle that I would let Frank go home with him in the morning to the Peedee country.  Tom has given Frank a Harmonica which plays beautifully.

	Someone gave me today a little china doll left with him by Mr. Barnwell.  I saw Mrs. Taylor & Martin in the gallery today but did not speak to them.  Will came to my seat in the House & pointed them out to me in the gallery.  I saw them looking at Will & myself in the House.  But I had at that hour to go to the College to meet the Faculty.  Mr. Barnwell, [John Izard] Middleton & DeSaussure & myself were a committee to meet Col. Preston, Dr. Lieber, Thornwell & the other Professors to arrange a matter of government for the College.  Will went with me.

	I am sure you will be greatly distressed when I inform you that Col. Ben Perry has beaten Burt by two votes for Secretary of State.  I voted for Burt & wished him elected in spite of all his prejudices against my politics.  He is really in friendship attached to me.

	I could not go to Coil. Hamptons dinner party yesterday in consequence of the meeting of the Board of Trustees in the College last evening.  Middleton & myself send word by Speaker Simmons [James Simons] as to our excuse.

	We had quite an interesting meeting of the Board of Trustees last night & transacted important business.

	Col. Ben Perry has just given a toast of champaigne wine & I have partaken of it.  This in consequence of his election.  Franks great ambition seems to be to eat two dinners.  He leaves the State House at ? past one, eats dinner & returnsthen at four he eats with me.  Willie stays till I eat.

	Col. Jno. Preston made a speech today whilst I was in College.  I told him I was sorry not to have heard it.  Mr. Harrison of Anderson told me today that he expected the Legislature would go with me after all.  Several persons have to my Paper.  I hope you & family are all well.  In the course of an hour I shall hear from you.  But before that time I have to close & mail my letter.

	I shall probably speak on the Southern question next week.  There seems to be a disposition to hear me.  I shall try & make a good speech.  Yesterday I was introduced to Col. Tomlinson of Georgia & a member of their state convention.  He said he was glad to meet a union man & I must send him my paper.

	I have bought a great many Books at 75 cts per volume which would cost 2.50 per volume.  They are English books & printed in England.

	I have bought a beautiful likeness of Terry  I saw Miss Martha Calhoun in the gallery today but did [not] speak to her.  There is a great display of Ladies in the gallery.

	Kiss Fanny & Anna for me & tell them to kiss you for me.  Yours truly a lovingly, B.F. Perry

Maj. Dawkins has become very sick on the defeat of the Col.
