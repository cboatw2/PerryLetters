Letter 615
20 July 1861
Ashland, Va.

Dear Mamma

	I write now merely to acknowledge the receipt of your letter yesterday containing the Four Dollars, and also to say that we will leave this place some time today or soon tomorrow morning.  We will go to Manassas Junction.  It is something over a hundred miles from here, and we will have to go it on horseback, so we have a long ride before us.  The Infantry Companies belonging to the Legion left Richmond yesterday evening for Manassas.  We will be under charge of Major Griffin.  There is nothing to write you that would be news by the time this letter reaches you.  The fight at Manassas seems to have been a pretty considerable one.  Give my thanks to Grandma and Aunt Annie for their portion of the 4 dollars.  All the letters you all have written I think have come safe to hand.  I dont know but what it would be better for you to continue directing to Richmond from which place they will be forwarded.  I got a letter from Pa also yesterday evening.  I would like to see him on here very much.

	I wrote you a long letter yesterday answering all your questions, so I have nothing left to write about.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Son, W.H. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth perry
