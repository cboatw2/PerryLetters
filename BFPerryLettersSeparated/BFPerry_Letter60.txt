Letter 60
29 November 1846
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed last night on returning from the Rail Road meeting & not finding a letter from you.  My first letter to you remains unanswered & I hope however that you & the children are all well & that I shall certainly hear from you this evening.

	I am so busy that I have no leisure on Sunday eve.  The whole of today I have spent in drawing a rail road charter for Greenville.  Last night I made a speech an hour long on the rail road to a town meeting in the place.  General Thompson is to speak Monday night.  Then I have to meet the Board of Trustees, & check a Professor of Roman literature.

	Yesterday I attended a lecture of Dr. Ellets before the Trustees on green cotton.  He loaded a pistol with this cotton, & I shot it three or four times.  The cotton is better than powder & will supersede it in all probability.

	Tomorrow my resolution giving the election of electors to the people [will] come up for discussion.  We shall begin this week to have meetings of interest before our Honourable Body.  I wish you were here to witness them.  You must let me know as soon as you determine what you are going to do, whether remain in Charleston or come to Columbia.  General Thompson says Mrs. Thompson is to be here this week.  Jones & Eliza have gone home from Edgefield.

	Clark Mills is making progress with my Bust.  At present it is an ugly affair.  I desire very much to have yours taken.  I am sure it will make a handsome one.  And whenever an opportunity offers I wish to  have your portrait taken.

	How I should like now to see you & the childrenin on you & see how you areI hope the children are behaving better.  But really no children [always] behave well & should never be taken from home.  The next time we visit Charleston we will leave them behind.  I must now go to dinner & will keep my letter open till night.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter dated Saturday morning and thank you for it.  I was afraid you were unwell or something was the matter with the children.  z\I have written you twice & hope you have re[ceive]d the second letter.

	I shall be glad to see you whenever you feel disposed to come up and if possible will supply you with all the money you wish.  I know how pleasant it is to spend when abroad & how much we are tempted by pretty things.  I only regret I had not a fortune to place at your command.    But we have done pretty well.  If you stand in need of funds write me

I have just re[ceive]d a Greenville Mountaineer with my letter in it & one from Col. Townes.

	Mr. Elmore will not be a candidate for the Senate.  Judge Butler will be a candidate.  Col. Davie, Barnwell Rhett, Pickens, Judge ONeall, Governor Hammond &c.

	I must now conclude with my usual requests to the children & your Aunts.  B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Charleston
