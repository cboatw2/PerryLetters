Letter 66
6 oclock, 16 December 1846
Columbia

My dear Liz
	I hope by this hour you are comfortably seated in our Home with the children all around you eating their suppers & the servants coming in to see you.  Today we have had rain & I have thought you all the same.  But you were fortunate to escape so well.  I hope you had a pleasant trip, & that the children gave you no annoyance.

	Yesterday I dined with Col. Martin who invoked the President of the Senate Col. DeTreville, Moses, Boozer &c.  I like Martin very much.  He said the first thing he thought of when he saw the sun rising Sunday morning, was that you would have a pleasant day.  I do not like Col. Isaac Hayne much.  He seems cold & sly.  Manifests no disposition to become acquainted with me & I have shown none towards him.  He seems not disposed to approach me or to have much to say when I approach him.  I think our dislike is mutual, & likely to continue.

	Dr. Goodwyn told me that Mrs. Goodwyn was coming to our room to tell you goodbye but prudence had you to bed.  She had taken tea out that evening.  Col. Davie spoke of my pretty mountain children whom he had seen running about in the Piaz[z]a.

	The likeness of the whole family is finished & makes a pretty group as Col. Ashe says.  I have got a gilt frame for it.  You look quite natural.  Your dress & hair are taken very accurately and I thank youralso.  Mine is not so well as the other.  Anna & Frank show rather better than Will.  All look well enough.  Will is standing near me & Anna near you.  Frank between.

	I have to go down in the Senate tonight at seven oclock & will finish my letter after I return.  Col. Town[e]s, Sam Earle & Dr. Earle all go up in the morning.  I will send this letter by Col. Townes,

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just returned from the State House through a terrible rain & deep mud.  This is one of the worst nights I ever saw.  How glad I am that you are not travelling.

	We have had a great deal of discussion tonight in the Senate & I feel much exhausted.  I claim the credit of having saved many thousand dollars for the State this night.

	I have just heard of a most melancholy death. Mrs. Seabrook, once Miss B the wife of a member of the Legislature, married last Summer, & I met them at Saratoga Springs, gay & joyous.  He was a very young man & his wife not more than 17 years old.  She died suddenly from mis.  Her husband went to the rail road tonight & heard of her death.  He fainted & appeared for some time a maniac.  Another member Mr. Barnes of Lancaster lost his wife last week in the same way.

	I must now bid you good night.  I hope to meet you Sunday evening.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours truly, B.F, perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
