Letter 259
18 November 12853
Charleston

My dear Liz

	We reached here yesterday to dinner & had a very pleasant trip down.    You will see my letter to the Patriot for all that.

	Willie & Anna have gone out visiting your kins people.  I have been shopping.  I bought the frames for our portraits at $18 each.  They will be sent up in seven or eight days.  I gave your Bill to& to fill & forward the groceries.  They do not want the money before next year (February will do).  I thought after getting all the expensive articles the other items though numerous would not amount to much.

	Yesterday evening we walked over the Battery & around the city, Willie, Anna & myself & Col. Irby.  We met a good many acquaintances.  Dr. [Samuel Henry] Dickson & Judge King have both promised to call & see me[Richard] Yeadon also.  I saw Col. Hayne & Col. John Cunningham.  Mrs. Cunningham has returned home to remain & will not return to Philadelphia at all.  Miss Pamela will remain in Philadelphiadoes not intend returning.  Singular to be thus separated from an only daughter & the sick & bedridden daughter from her mother.

	I have stopped at the Mills House & it is truly a Palace.  I am glad I did not stop at the American.  Sitting at the dinner yesterday Mrs. Beadon said her daughter asked if Willie was the brother of Anna whom they knew to be my daughter.  She replied they are so unlike they could not be brother & sister.  She is the niece of Col. Davie of Chester & a very pleasant lady.  Beadon [Richard Stobo Bedon] is a Senator from one of the Parishes.  We have to spend a great deal of our time at the table eating dinner & breakfast.  But the fare is superb.  I told Mrs. Beadon that we had five children & they were all unlike each other.  I went over Bancrofts store with youngthis morning.  I have not yet seen Augustus Hoke.

	My dear Liz, this letter was broken off very abruptly yesterday & I did not have an opportunity of finishing it.  This morning Mrs. Edward Hayne sent for the children to dine with her, but I intend going to the& they will not get back in time.

	Last night Col. Beadon & his daughters & myself & children went to the Theatre & were all very much pleased.  Anna & Willie

	Col. Pickens & his daughters are at  We have a pleasant company.  Willie & Anna yesterday visited Col. Arthur Hayne, Mrs. WHayne, Mrs. General Hayne, your aunt Hayne, Mrs. Turner.  Your uncle Arthur said he would call & see me this morning.  They saw Mrs. Emily Hayne in visiting.  They have not yet been to Mrs. McCalls.

	I shall return to Greenville Thursday if possible.  I hope to hear from you today.  I have a great deal to talk about when we meet.  But not time to write it.

	I must now prepare to visit Sullivans Island.  Your uncle Arthur called & staid so long that the hour for taking the boat has passed over.  He invited us to dine with him Monday.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
