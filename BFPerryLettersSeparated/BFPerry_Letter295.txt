Letter 295
27 November 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have but a moment to write you.  I was engaged last evening on rail road matter.

	I read your letter & can assure you that I am not so foolish ad to mind what an anomos writer may advise.

	I saw Col. OHanlon yesterday & he enquired of you & the children very affectionately.  He offered me his house at Perryville to stay at with you & the children.  He says Willie & Frank must come down & stay with him at Say castle.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
