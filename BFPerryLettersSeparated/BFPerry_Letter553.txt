Letter 553
10 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just received your letter & Franks, also one from Mr. Arthur.  Col. Orr dined with me today & I left the Legislature before it adjourned.  We had a pleasant dinner & just as we left the room we met Mrs. LeConte going in to dinner.  Dr. LeConte has gone to Georgia & left her here.  I like Col. Orr very much & we agree very well in our political views.  I met John Cunningham as Col. Orr & myself were leaving Governor Gist today & he told me that his mother was delighted with my resolutions & took me again to her heart.

	Col. Orr, Sullivan & myself called to get a pardon from the Governor for young Sullivan & he granted it.  Nothing occurred in the Legislature today worth mentioning.  My Bill for a separate Court of appeals comes up on Monday.  I have hopes of its passage, although it was killed in the Senate yesterday.

	I am glad to hear Frank is doing well & will write him tomorrow & send him $20.00.  Though I may wait till he writes to me.

	I sent you this morning by Wells two Books & have the other two to read.  So your letter came too late to make the present in money.  I hope the Books willas well.

	I am sorry to learn the sow had such bad luck with her pigs.  She had better be fattened & [word obscured].  Tell Alfred so.

	Col. Orr invited me to dine with him Monday at the Assembly House.  I will do so.  I will write to Major Bolling tomorrow.  I will also write to the Patriot tomorrow..

	My cases in law come up Tuesday & when I get through them I will be ready to return home.  I would give a great deal if I could be at home today & return Monday.

	Mr. Arthur wrote me about a Bill which he says the Episcopal church will present.  I saw old Mr. Bryce this evening who told me he was at my House.  I saw Dr. Smith also his nephew.

	  I have bought several Books & amongst them Reminiscences of Rufus Choate, a most admirable book.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry
