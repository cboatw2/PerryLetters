Letter 248
18 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d no letter from you yesterday& I have no news to write you except that my cold is better & I am the most anxious to return home that was ever in Washington.

	The case of [George A.] Gardiner progresses slowly & I am tired out with it.  The present aspect of the case is a bad one.  What turn it may take I know [not].  I am afraid however that the Government Has some strong testimony to offer yet.  They have already produced a pile of letters of Dr. Gardiners to prove that he was at a different place at the time he alleges to have been at his mines.  We shall prove the existence of his mines, but there is anthat the government will show this is all storm & pretense.

	I hope to hear from you this morning.  It is a great comfort to hear from you & I feel deeply the disappointment.  I wish you would write me more about the children in all of your letters.  I wish to know all about you & them.  Let me hear how they get on at schoolhow they behave what they are doing.

	But I hope to be at home before you can answer this letter.  I must now conclude & go to breakfast.  If I had anything to write longer.  Your affect[ionate] husb[an]d, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
