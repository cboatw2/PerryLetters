Letter 355
Wednesday, [ca. 1855]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your letter of yesterday dated Charleston, stating that you had arrived safely and all were well!  I am truly glad to hear all are well, but I am sorry to hear you are in Charleston again.  I hope you did not after I left you Tuesday morning get out & take the downward train.

	I shall not be able to get off in the morning but hope to reach my case tomorrow & be at home Friday evening.  Have the carriage at the depot for me & I should be happy to meet you & the children there.

	I went down to the rail road depot this evening & ascertained that my boxes were put on board the Greenville cars & will leave in the morning.  But I hear nothing of the carriage.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & brought a bundle for you.  Mrs. Elford will be here tomorrow.  He told me of the death of Butler Haynes daughter.

	How anxious I am to be at home ever more.

	I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.

	Harman was tried this morning.  I do not think there was any chance for him.

	I have gained all my cases in Equity.

	I must now conclude.  Mrs. Brown sent me word that she had some potters to send you.  Brown has come back to suit his affectionate wife.

	Kiss the children for me.  It is so dark that I am sure you cannot read what I am writing.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
