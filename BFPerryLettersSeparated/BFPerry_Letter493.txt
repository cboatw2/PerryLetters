Letter 493
13 June 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We did not receive a letter from you last week.  Your Report gave you 30 demerits!  What have you done?

	I sent you a check for fifty dollars some time ago, which I hope you rece[ive]d.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is improving slowly.  Arthur is a little indisposed & frets very much.

	We had a great deal of company in the village last week.  All the Episcopal Clergy in convention.

	I hope by this time you have got through with your examination &e safe.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
