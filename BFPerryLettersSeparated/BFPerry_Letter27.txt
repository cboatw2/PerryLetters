Letter 27
Thursday night, [16 October 1845]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	As I shall not be able to return home before Sunday I will write you a few lines.  Nothing yet has been done in my cases & I am very tired of waiting. My great apprehension is that after staying all the week I shall not be able to reach them.  I have three very important slander cases & the great Will case, all ready for trial.

	I saw Mr. & Mrs. Allston & Mrs. Gadsden last night.  They spoke kindly of you & your kindness to them, praised Will &c.  I see a good many persons passing down the country.  The dancing master F went on this morning.

        Robe has permitted me to take a Box of seeds & wheat of an extraordinary character which he ordered from the north.  I will now plant wheat this Fall which he did not intend doing.  But which you wished me to do.  The grass seeds I am looking in getting. I have a great deal of agricultural talk with the Judge [Frost] &  Robe and amazed with Robe.  He says he likes to talk with him & picks up a great deal of information from him. [sentence interlined, illegible] It is now after eleven oclock.

	It would give me great pleasure if I was at home with you & the children.  My Farm is now another inducement to be at home.  My wife, my children, my office & my Farm are all great attractions for me, [words interlined, illegible] The office the least of all  & yet the most profitable.

	I hope John is well so that I can put Charles to work when I return.

	It is so late in the night I must conclude.  In the morning if I have time I will write a note to Will & Anna & Frank.  Yours truly & affectionately, good night, B.F. Perry

Mrs. B.F. Perry
