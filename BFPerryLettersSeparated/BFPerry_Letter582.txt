Letter 582
21 April 1860
Charleston

My dear Liz

	Dr. Porcher has just called & handed me your letter.  I will therefore write you a line.  Mr. Butler did not call to go to your uncle Arthurs as we [word blotted] last night.  I was therefore at leisure.  Your cousin E has just sent a little servant boy  to say to me..I have time I will.  I have just seen Col. Memminger & Mrs. Yeadon & Mr. Spratt said Mrs. Spratt wished to see me & invited me very kindly to come & see him.

       You say my name does not appear in the Carolinian.  The Editor is my friend.  The Mercury gives very full accounts of my speeches, motions &c.  If you will send to the Enterprise office you can see the papers.  There are three of them.

       Mr. Spratt said this morning that I ought to have some prominent position in the convention as I would be the finest looking man in it.  I saw this morning Collin Ingersoll & his father in law.  Mr. Spratt & Ingersoll enquired very much about you & your mother & family.  He seems kind.  I told him you looked as young as you did [page toen] you were going to school in New Haven.

       .  I am glad the deer has come back & hope you will get her home.  In regard to living in Charleston I prefer Greenville.  There is more ease & pleasure there.  I saw Rice here yesterday from Greenville.  I saw  & Wickenburgh yesterday & they showed me your letter.  I told them it was the latest news I had from home.

       The Hotel is filling up rapidly.  The mercury & Courier contain announcements of my arrival in the city at the Mills House.  I write you these little matters as you areto all notoriety respecting myself.

       I will now close.  Tell Fannie I am glad she is making progress in French & Music.  She is smart & pretty & will make a great B[word smudged].

       Last night Mr. Mordecais son rang a Bell & told his servant   to go into his library & get a book.  He said his servant could not only read but spoke French and--all of his servants read.

       Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville.
