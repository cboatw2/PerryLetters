Letter 552
8 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & have purchased for you  of Hearts, Life for a Life, & Gregson Letters & Home & Abroad with the five dollar Bill given me yesterday for counsel & advice.

	Tell Major Bolling his case is ordered to be reargued next Spring.  This is a great victory & I have hopes of a success.

	The Blue Ridge was killed today in the House suddenly & before I made my speech.  I do not care.  South Carolina will never do anything & is fit for nothing but to quarrel with the Union.  I am disgusted with the Legislature& with politics.  Hereafter the State may pursue her own course & I will pursue my profession & live at home in the bosom of my family, caring nothing about public matters.  I hope Willie will never engage in political life, but devote himself to his profession.

	I have nothing of interest to write you.  I rece[ive]d a letter this evening from General Thompson saying my Resolutions had given him great satisfaction.  Hammond son of the Senator came to me today & said his uncle requested him to tell me that my resolutions filled his heart with patriotism.

	The weather is very cold & my overcoat is most comfortable.  I tried to get sa dressing gown but could not.  You must have me one made out of& nice material.  Can you not do this before I return  home.  Have it well padded & lined.  Make it after my old one.  Clara can do it.  Have it thick & warm.  I suppose you can get the padding in Greenville such as ladies use for their pretty coats, or cotton preferred.

	I have heard nothing from Frank.  I will write him in time to send the money for his visit to Washington.

	Governor Adams has an internal, ulcers in the entrails, which are very painful & killing him.  I want to see you all very much & when I get through with my law cases I shall return never to come back as a member of the House.

	Remember me to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
