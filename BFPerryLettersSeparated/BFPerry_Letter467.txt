Letter 467
21 February 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	I recd your letter last night &was glad to hear you did well at your examination, & that you were now going to study hard.  This you must do, for you have been falling off, in numbers ever since your first Report.  The last is the worst of all.  Let your next Report be better & every other still better.  How much pleased we shall be at it.  I know you love your Father & Mother, & we had a hard struggle to get your situation for you.  Do remember this.  Hold on to it as you would your life, & rise with your class.  How dreadful it would be for you to be sent home or turned back.  Keep out of idle company & when at your book study do not idle away your time with your book before you.

	We had all like to have been burnt up just now.  Marys room caught fire.  One of her children caused it.  Her bed is burnt up.

	Anna is not so well & gets weaker.  I am very uneasy, and much distressed about her.  She looks very pale & is very weak.  A good deal of her time she has to be in bed.  The rest are all well.

	Willie will start back next Friday & be in Annapolis Monday or Tuesday evening.  He will carry you some clothes.

	Today the Baptist church is dedicated.  Tomorrow the military companies parade & have a ball.

	I had seen an account of your fire & was very sorry to hear of the old church being burnt.

	You must give my love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & my respects to Captain Blake.

	Hamlin Beatty [Beattie] & Sally Cleveland are to be married in April.  I have no other news to tell you.  MissMcBee was very much pleased with your letter in the Patriot.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
