Letter 748
30 August 1870
Greenville

	I hope you had a pleasant day yesterday.  Townes case has not been called yet.  Mr. Murray of Anderson came over last night and employed me to assist him in an important case in the next court.

	The wood cutter has finished the pile & will go out to chop at Sans Souci.  I wish that hill side cleared up very much.

	 Fergusons cutter borrowed last Sunday to open thewith.  Heit.

	I do not know when I shall be able to drive out to see you.  In great haste, your affectionate, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Sans Souci
