Letter 228
28 February 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	Yesterday after writing to you I went & dined with Governor Corwin Secretary of the Treasury.  General Thompson & Col. Summer were of the party.  We met a good many ladies there, but none remarkable for beauty or talent.  Miss Corwin is a good looking young lady.  She is quite young, and presided at the head of the table with grace & dignity.  Mrs. Corwin had gone home.  Miss Ellicott of Pennsylvania was quite agreeable & rather pretty.  I had the honor of escorting to the table Miss Smith of Ohio, sensible & ugly.  We spent a very pleasant evening & I am delighted with Corwin.    But you will see my letter in the Patriot.

	Today I went to see General Pierce with Armistead Burt & General Thompson.  General Thompson introduced me as the Editor of thePaper in South Carolina.  He replied I know him perfectly well & am very happy to meet him.  He seems quite cordial and sincere, plain & unpretending.  He said we ought to have placed so quiet a man as he is in the Presidency.  Mr. Burt told him he was going off this evening & the President replied I wish I could go with you.  I observed I had no doubt he was sincere in this wish to get rid of the crowd which was worrying & annoying.  He said never before had his sleep been broken, that he could always heretofore sleep, but now that was not the case.  We staid but a few minutes & as we retired he asked General Thompson to come back tomorrow about some matters.

	I have today had my daguerreotype taken in a broach for you & in the medal[l]ion for Anna.  Your broach is a very pretty one (gold) and fashionable.  My likeness in it is said to be very good.  A very handsome woman, Mrs. Clements of Virginia, said so, as I was puitting it up.  The broach with my likeness cost only five dollars.  The likeness in Annas medal[l]ion only one dollar & fifty cents.

	Today has been raining.  I saw Tom Butler in the rotunda of the Capitol.  He said he left home Monday & all were well.  He looked very well.  I saw also doctor Hayne whop is here to get the appointment of Port Physician of Charleston.  He said all of your friends were well in Charlestonthat Mrs. Hayne had recd a letter from Greenville just before he left stating you were all well.  I saw Johnson of Columbia & Boatwright &c.

	This morning Col. Orr introduced me to General Bailey of Virginia.  He said he was very glad to meet me if I was the man he took me to be the Editor of the Patriot.  In returning from the Presidents I met Mrs. Bailey & her daughter in ashop & was introduced by General Thompson.  She is a very pleasant lady & told me that her daughter could make a table run all over the room & could raise a tumbler of water from the table by mere touch.  They do not account for it & cannot, nor had they been to see the spiritual rappers Mrs. Fox & her daughter.

	Mr. A. Burt & his wife were here this evening.  I wish I could go with them but I suppose you wish me to stay till the coronation & give you an account of it.  I am very tired & would not live here for any consideration.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  General Thompson goes to the rappers every day & communes with his deceased wife, child, mother & Father & says he is a new man.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
