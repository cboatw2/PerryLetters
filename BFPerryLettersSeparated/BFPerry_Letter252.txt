Letter 252
21 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I came out of the Court House this evening at half after four oclock tired & hungry & exhausted, & thought I would go to the Post office & see if I could not get a letter from home, from my wife to cheer me & comfort me in my lonelyness & distress, and sure enough two were handed me & one from Judge ONeall & one from Mr.Carter of Charleston.  But my dear wife how can you scold your husband so poor fellow, when he is away & wants comfort!  Did you not read about what I said about Carlisle having a sweet wife & children to greet him & smile on him & love him when he comes home exhausted & fatigued in  Keep your scolds till I come home.  I can bear them better there than herenever say one unkind word to me from home.  I had rather receive no letter from you at all.  You must remember what I do is not without consideration & reflection & is for the best.  Moreover I have a right to do as I please with my own money which I have worked hard for & who=ich no one gave me.  I provide for my family pretty well & am not very extravagant.  It is just such nervous sensibility on the part of Susan that has made her life an unhappy one.  He husband is a fool & has nothing to sustain him but the bottle when he [is] crossed or vexed.  had good sense enough to reason the matter with you.  But never write me any more such letters.  They crush my heart when away, far away from you.

	Poor Col. [Benajah] Dunham!  His death has made me sad.  I am not well myself.  The Gardiner trial is going badly.  The prospect of getting him is remote.  General Thompson got a letter from his wife this evening and Ihim the one you enclosed.  I also read him what you said about Mrs. Thompson.  He insisted on hearing it.

	Judge ONeall  & Mr. Carter are bursting with indignation at the  appointment of the secessionists to office.  They wrote me that the people of Charleston are indignant at the appointment of Colin [Wiliam John] Graysons place.
	The best way to please the President is to keep away from him & make his acquaintance at some other time.  But I shall go and see him before I leave Washington.  Judge ONeall begs me to go & tell him about the secessionists & that he must appoint Union men.

.Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
