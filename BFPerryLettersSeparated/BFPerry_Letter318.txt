Letter 318
19 December 1854
 Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a line this morning for fear I may not be able to write this evening.

	Last night we had a terrible session.  Neither House adjourned till near midnight.  The Blue Ridge Bill passed the Senate.  The Augusta Bridge is still under discussion & I may speak on it today.

	Mr. [William Dunlap] Simpson of Laurens said last night after hearing Col. Preston on the Rail Road, said he had never heard him before, but that he did not make anything like as good a speech as I made at Asheville last summermonth.

	I wrote you last night about meeting Marenick.  He shocked me to look at.  He looked about seventy.  His hear as white as cotton.  He lives in San Antonio.  He had heard of Major Bell but had not met him.

	I am exceedingly anxious to get home again & would not for any consideration go on to Charleston without going home.  On reflection I rather think I shall have to remain in Greenville till after saleday.  I must be at home on that day and it will be almost impossible for me to get back.  In going [on] a trip to Charleston I like to take my time in staying there after travelling two hundred & seventy or eighty miles to get there.

       I rece[ive]d a letter last night purporting to be from Reuben.  He says that Mr. Crawford is going to Augusta & that he & Mrs. Crawford are so much attached to his wife they would buy then sellthat the Bible says a man must forsake father, mother & brother & cleave unto his wifethat Georgia seems to be his trial & he had as well make up his mind to go.  The letter looks as if a negro may have written it.  It is signed your boy Reuben.  But he speaks of Reuben in the letter as if it was written by someone else.

       It is now six oclock in the evening & I have just taken dinner.  I will finish my letter before going down to the State House.  Nothing has been done in the Legislature except discuss the Augusta Bridge to empty chairs.  I took no part in such a debate.

       I rece[ive]d your letter just this minute, also one from Alfred Huger requesting me to give my support to the repeal of the law relative to Colored seamen.  He says he has always entertained the highest appreciation of my judgement & political principles as well as respect for me personally.  I also rece[ive]d a Book from Judge Butler.

       I am glad to hear you mention all the children by name.  I wish I was with them & you.  I am tired & sick of Columbia & would like to go up in the morning with Mr. Duncan who returns to see his sick child.

       I also rece[ive]d a letter from W.S. Lawton who says he has a son at Greenville at schoolthat his son writes him he has heard me make some fine speeches.

       Mr. Arthur was here yesterday but I did not see him.  Mr. Leavy has been crazy from drink.

       I am glad Lindy is going to be married, & hope she will do better.

       The Greenville academies have been decidedthat the Trustees have the right to sell the lands & transfer the academies without applying to the Court.  This is the view I always had of the matter but filed the petition at the insistence of Dr. [Andrew B.] Crook to pacify all parties.  [I] have introduced a clause in [word obscured] incorporation bill to blend the trustees of the Academies & Furman University.

       I have seen nothing of Miss Brenan.  She did give a concert, but I did not attend nor have I seen Mr. Hasle.

       I must now conclude & go to the State House.  But I shall not stay there longer than nine oclock for I am worn out in sitting up with loss of sleep.  My money is deposited in Bank $700.00 & I have $75 in my pocket.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
