Letter 649
13 December 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the State House & taken dinner, after one of the hardest days work of the Session.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee I had reported a Bill on the subject of the Stay Law  & collection of debts.  The Bill was assailed on all sides & hundreds of amendments offered by various members.  I had to fight the Bill through. & I suppoise I was on my feet one hundred times or more & made as many short speeches.  We were at the Bill from eleven in the morning till half after four in the evening.  Finally I succeeded in sending the Bill to the Senate.
