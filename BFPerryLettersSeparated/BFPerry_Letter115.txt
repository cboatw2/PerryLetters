Letter 115
Wednesday evening, [29 November] 1848
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recei[ve]d your letter & weas truly glad to hear from you & the children & learn that you were all wellFanny poor little thing is better.  I hope to see her walking to meet me on my return.

	In regard to Reuben I do not know what to say.  James Harrison is altogether mistaken in his report of our conversation.  I said we could not tradethat I could not give more than $500.  This was all that passed.  I made an offer at all.  It would not be convenient for me to pay the money at present.  But James Harrison said that would make no difference.  He may be mistaken in this as he was in our conversation.  But if they will take my note bearing interest, payable within twelve months, I will purchase Reuben if you desire me to do so.  I leave you to make the trade with Mrs. Harrison.  She can make a Bill of Sale & warrant the soundness & I can give my note on my return home.  It may be that I will pay the money in a short time.  The trade of course cannot be completed until my return.

	I have been going on bravely with my cases in the Law court & have nearly got through.  When my Equity cases will be taken up is doubtful.  I have unquestionably got a new trial in Col. Dunkins case & also in a case of Monsels in Pickens.  I am preparing myself in Dr. Andersons case.

	In regard to elections I have done a little for Col. Hayne.  I believe all the Greenville delegation will vote for him.  I told Col. Ware if he did not you would never vote for him again.  He is for him.  General Martin invited me to dine with him tomorrow & I am to do so.  I introduced Col. Hayne to Major Smith & Col. Williams & told them he was your cousin & a candidate for attorney general.

	I have not yet been to the State Houseall my time in court.  And I have really nothing to write you about.  I must go in a few minutes to the College to meet the Board of trustee.  I have not yet had time to look at carriages or anything else.

	I have bought Mrs. Ellets Book & it contains one of my articles & makes honorable mention of me.  I see my article [on] Dicey Langston has been published in the New York papers & in the Palmetto Banner.

	I do not wish the other hogs killed until my return home.  They are young hogs & do not fatten well.  I wish Jim & Charles to keep clearing up the pieces of ground pointed out to them & splitting rails.  The garden is to be spadedleaves& thrown in the stable lot &c.

	I must now conclude by saying to you if you desire Reuben make the purchase.  I do not know when I will be at home.  Perhaps I may return in the stage or I may write to you to send down the carriage.

	Tell the children to be good & learn fastno danger of hurting themselves by studying.  I shall bring them something.  In haste, yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
