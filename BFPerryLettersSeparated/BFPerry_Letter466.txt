Letter 466
14 February 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	Thus is Sunday & Valentines Day.  The whole face of the earth is covered with snow & the trees with ice.  We never before had so destructive a sleet.  The shade trees are all broken down.  The large oaks in thew yard are stripped of their limbs.  The house tops are covered with broken branches of trees.  The cedars are ruined.  Now the ice is falling off the trees & there is a constant noise.

	Did you receive any Valentines?  Anna got two very pretty ones last night & threw one into the fire without letting us see it!

	We have all been bound for the last two days in consequence of the snow & sleet.  No one went to church today.  The streets are impassable.    But the weather is not so cold as one would suppose.

	I write to you today by request of your mother, but have nothing to tell you.  Your letter was rece[ive]d last night & you must write all about your examination.  I hope you will do better hereafter.

	Willie will return the last of this month.  You mother will send you some shirts, your Indian cap, & slippers.

	Tim, whom I once owned, was here just now & asked to see your likeness.  He says it does not look as well as you do.  He thought too that Willie did not look well.

	Anna seems better, but looks badly.  All the rest of the children are well.  Mary & Charlotte are sick.  Monarch threw Willie into the river yesterday, but did not hurt him, except a good ducking.  The horses all look well.

	You ought to go & see the Legislature in Sessiongo up some day.  It is something to remember.

	You must keep all your letters to read years hence when your mother & I have passed away.

	We would like to see you very much.  But dont want to see you dismissed.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
