Letter 279
19 March 1854 Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines by Mr. Goodlett who returns in the morning with Mr. Furman.  Mr. Elford also going back tomorrow.  I shall probably be here till Thursday morning.  Judge Wardlaw will take a seat in the hack with me to Greenville.  I do not expect to be at home before Thursday evening.

	I should be glad to hear from you, but I suppose if there is no hope of it, I feel anxious about Anna.  I hope you have rece[i]d letters.

	I saw Mr. Sharp here today.  He says his family are all well.  And he enquired after you & your mothers family.

	I have not seen my brother or any of his family, but have heard they are all well.  Foster will be here tomorrow.  Warren has been sick with Rheumatism.

       I have nothing new to write.  We had a bad day Sunday to travel. but I kept dry.

	I hope you & the children are well, getting on well & that the servants & horses are well & doing well.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
