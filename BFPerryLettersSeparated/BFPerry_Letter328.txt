Letter 328
6 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just written a letter to the Southern Patriot in which I described our journey down here & could not repeat it to you.

	It is probable that the Western circuit will be taken up Friday next.  If so I shall have to go down to Charleston next week.

	I have just seen Edward who has been a little sick with cold.  He prefers living in Greenville, & does not like Mr. Antwerp much.   I shall see about it after tomorrow.  He is perfectly well now.  I will write to Anna tomorrow.  Jones went down after Flora & could return the middle of next week.  He completed his trade with Wilson & got the necessary funds.

	I hope Willie has returned safely & that you & all the children are well.

	I went to the college chappel to hear Thornwell this morning & have seen nothing of Col. Taylor & his family.  Dr. Thornwell seemed glad to see me& so did Mr. Brumby who enquired after you.

	I am in a roomCol. Owens of Barnwell.  Col. Watts informs me that Arthur Hayne is sick in Boston & that his wife is still acting as though she has just lost a brother.  The Col. says Arthur will kill himself drinking brandy.  He once travelled with him & said he would drink a tumbler full of brandy & it did not seem to move him.

	The Congaree House is not much improved.

	I will write you after receiving your letter tomorrow evening.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
