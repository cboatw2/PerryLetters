Letter 269
8 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the State House tired & fatigued & have eaten my dinner.  I will write you a line for I find it impossible to get Willie or Anna to write.  After all I believe a husbands has more affection for his wife than a child for a mother.  Captain Brooks & his family have just arrived & the Captain has just come into our room & is talking to me whilst I am writing.  He will go up day after tomorrow.

	Anna is considering about going to the Governors Ball.  She does not wish to go.  But as all the rest are going, I told her she had better go.  I think that she isthat she has not a Ball dress.  Elford has just come down & brings me no letters.  I hope to hear when the mail is opened.  Elford says he saw Fanny & Hext yesterday & you were all well.

	We had considerable discussion today on the Calhoun monument & about that discussion I will write to the Patriot.  My room is now full, & they are all talking as I am writing in one corner.  They are all crowded here like boys & it is like living in a boys den.  I am tired of it.

	John Cunningham is here.  I saw him paying attention to Mrs. Brown today & drinking champaigne with her at the table.  Young Gantt on the other side of her & Brown next.  Poor fellow looked uneasy.  I doubt whether [page torn] any better thanought to lie.  She seems awoman, fond of attracting admiration.

	It is now raining & the weather is cold.  Mr. Arthur came into the room just now to see us.  It seems that EVERYBODY FROM Greenville is here.  Barnwell Rhett came up & spoke to me today.  He said he saw from my paper that I had been in Charleston & was greatly pleased with the Ballet troupe.    He asked if you were with me.

	I will now close till I hear from you.  The mail will be opened in a short time.

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter.  I am surprised that Allston did not send over your letter.  I gave him a letter to Hoke & to Trevers.  See if they have rece[ive]d their letters.

	I will now conclude.  Hoyt wrote to rent my place for Mr. Dickey.

	The Legislature speak of coming up to Greenville Tuesday evening & going back Wednesday.  The President of the road has invited them.  It may be that a good many members accept the invitation.  I may come myself, & you must prepare to entertain two or three members.  I will write you tomorrow more about this matter.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
