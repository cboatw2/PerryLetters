Letter 179
24 November 1851
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I had not time to write you this evening before the mail closed.  I wrote a few lines to the Patriot which I knew you would see the night it arrived.

	My cold is better, but I felt Bad coming down in the stage.  [several words obscured by blotting]  Jones came down with me.  We stopped at the head of the rail Road ten miles above Newberry C.H.  The next morning we had a car full to Columbia.  Judge Whitner & his daughter were in companyalso Judge ONeal[l] & Chancellor Johns[t]on.  Col. Ware has brought his little son down with him.

	Tell Willie & Frank that a great many persons have enquired about them.  Dr. Powe says that his son often speaks of them.  Dr. Goodwyn enquired after them.

	I saw Arthur Simpkins this evening.  He came to our room to electioneer.  He is a candidate for Commissioner in Equity.  He brought me a letter from Richard Harrison of Florida.  I shall vote for him.  There is a good deal of electioneering.

	Everyone seems kind & cordial to me& a great many have taken an occasion to compliment me for my course and the hottest secessionists in the Legislature have done so.

	I saw John Cunningham a few moments today but did not enquire about his mother & sister.  There is to be a meeting of the Cooperation party here tomorrow.  Judge Cheves is here.  Judge Butler is not here yet.  His niece is to be married next Thursday or perhaps Tuesday.

	    I had a pleasant interview with Governor Means this morning & he seemed in a good humour.  He told me that old Mrs. Hughes was in town & immediately afterwards I recd a letter from Dr. Roach informing me that old Mrs. Hughes wished me to intercede &c.

	I feel great anxiety about you & the children.  I hope to hear from you tomorrow evening.  The colds & fever are so common that I am in constant apprehension.  Goldsmith lost a negro woman with cold, as I came by his house & he is down with fever.

	Col. Brockman & Duncan are in my room & talking all the time & I am somewhat bothered.

	Let me hear all about your household affairs and especially the children.

	I have seen very few persons today.  In my next letter I will give you more news.  Give my love to the children & accept the same for yourself.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
