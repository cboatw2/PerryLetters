Letter 152
28 March 1850
Anderson C,H,

My dear Liz

	I shall leave here in the morning for Tugaloo & will write you a few lines this evening as you requested.  The court has just adjourned & very little business done or to be done.  Judge Withers has gone to his room to sleep, the lawyers here are all gone home & I am left alone in my glory.  A young lady came into the sitting room to practice on the Piano & I have retired to write you.  By the y a Miss Smith enquired of me about you as an acquaintance.  She is going to school here & I believe from old Pendleton.  There is a house full of girls here, & most of them look like ought to be courted & married instead of going to school.  At least they are large enough to think of a beaux.  Judge Withers has been amusing himself & them by all sorts of sexist talk.

	I had a pleasant day to come here, but the weather has been very bad ever since. I found here Walker, Campbell & Long from Greenville.  They have all returned & a gentleman came to me in court this morning to carry some books to Greenville.  I told him Long was going over & would carry them.  He replied, yes, Mr. Craytons brother in law, I know him. I made no reply & thought it might someday be true.

	My face is still swollen & not entirely, but I have slept gloriously for two nights past, going to bed at eight oclock, & waking at seven.

	The papers bring us no news this morning that Mr. Calhouns health is better.  Very great interest is manifested here in his recovery.  They had a political meeting on Tuesday & appointed four delegates to meet at Greenville during court & elect delegates to the Nashville convention.  Col. Tom [Thomas Jones] Pickens is an anti Bank candidate for the Senate in opposition to Dr. [Alexander] Evins.

	Mr. Harrison tells me the Cotton was sent off last Monday, & you will probably receive a check for the amount before I return home.  I am sorry to see the last foreign news is unfavourable for cotton.    The corn will sell well.  Mr. Simpson spoke of going up to the sale, & invited me to go home with him.

	As I passed by my farm last Tuesday morning, someone had thrown down the fence & pulled down the Barn to the ground.  Tell Reuben he must [page torn] to the fence or the stacks will get [page torn] & destroy the wheat.  Let Charles fill up the stable.  Jim might with the old plank of the fence build a new pig pen like the old one and some corn sheds against the fence.

	You must attend to your garden & plant your seeds.  Major Seaborns agricultural paper comes out this week with my article on the profits of the farm.

	Write me a long letter to Pickens.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
