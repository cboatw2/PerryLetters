Letter 700
20 July 1865
Willards Hotel

My dear Liz

	It is now twelve oclock in the night & Mr. Gibbs goes in the morning.  My room has been full of visitors, who have just gone all wishing to see the provisional Governor of South Carolina.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from the President this morning appointing three oclock for our meeting.  We had a most interesting conversation for two hours & seem mutually pleased with each other.  I cannot repeat all that was said.  He is kind & solicitous about the South & will do everything he can for us.  In reference to my appointment he said we lived only one hundred twenty miles apart & that he knew all about, that when he mentioned my name to the Charleston  Committee, Judge Frost immediately approved the nomination & the others cheerfully assented.  I made such an impression on the President that he insisted I should call on Seward & Stanton & talk to them about South Carolina politics, & [he] gave me letters of introduction to them.  He made me promise to come back & see him again before I left.  There were hundreds waiting to see him when I went & could not.  I carried with me Col. Orr, Elford, Grady, Blad, Gibbs, General Williams, & Leiter.

	I have just issued my Proclamation & will send it to Columbia by Gibbs,  Elford has copied it for Dr. Buist to read at the depot.  I have made Willie private Secretary & his name appears on the Proclamation.

	I went with my friend this morning to see Governor Denison Post Master General.  He went to the President for me.  I am delighterd with Johnson.  Tomorrow I go to see all the Cabinet officers.  I have rece[ive]d telegrams from Preston, Middleton & Campbell today.  I have the appointment of all Federal officers in South Carolina & have to approve all Pardons.  Never before had a Governor of South Carolina [had] so much patronage & power.

	Goodnight my dear wife, B.F. Perry
