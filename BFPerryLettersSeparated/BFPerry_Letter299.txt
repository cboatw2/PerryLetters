Letter 299
1 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter this evening, & you express so much anxiety to hear from me every evening that I will try to do so.  It is now about ten oclock & I have just returned from a caucus on the Electoral question.  I have therefore time only to write you a few lines.  Nor have I anything of interest to write.

	The Bill dividing Pendleton passed today & I made a short speech in favor of it.

	Mr. Pinckney Butler went home yesterday & will return Monday.  I think I shall go up with Willie & Frank tomorrow week & stay till Monday.   Next Saturday, tomorrow week, is fasting & prayer & the Legislature will not meet so I can come home & bring Anna down with me, & be better prepared to go to Charleston after the adjournment.  I shall have seen my wife & family.

	Tell Mr. Elford that I have not yet seen the Patriot.  The Mountaineer came tonight but no Patriot! This is abominable and inexcusable neglect on his part & I can act outraged at it.  They never send the paper together to any of us when it is published.

	Send Elford likewise word to send the other briefs that he is preparing in the case of Bates & Christoipher.  Wells says he lives at his house most of his time; a man may be in love without neglecting his business.

	When you receive this letter Willie & Frank will be in Columbia, & you will be lonely.  I wish I could be with you.

 	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
