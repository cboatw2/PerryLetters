Letter 173
19 December 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just recd your long letter & will write you a line in reply by Wednesday.

	I am truly sorry to hear such bad news about the horses.  If I had known of the lameness of Byorn I would have gone up in the Stage with Mr. Duncan.  But it is too late now to change your arrangements.  I am sure you have done the best as you always do.  I have as you know great confidence in your judgement & arrangements.

	I went to the Rail Road the other morning but could hear nothing of your bundle nor have I yet heard anything about it.  But I will ascertain & find out in the morning.  It is now after ten oclock &
The Legislature in session & will be till midnight.
	I shall try to get home Sunday night but think it almost impossible if Miss Calhoun takes a seat with us & we have to travel with her mother.

	I am glad you have sent something to eat.  The tin box I left at Fulks & told Reuben to car[r]y it home.  I suppose he forgot it.

	You are mistaken in supposing that I am not treated well by the members.  We are all cordial.  I shall be glad to meet your mother & family at dinner on my return home.  You did not say anything about the writing desk for your mother.

	I am afraid I shall not be able to get the seeds or hops.

	I am distressed to hear that the smallpox is in the Country.  The children ought all to be vaccinated

	I shall be truly glad to be at home again.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
