Letter 297
28 November 1854
Columbia

My dear Lis

	I have just returned from dining with Governor Manning & it is now about nine oclock in the night.  I rece[i]ved your letter last evening & Sunday evening I was glad to hear from you & that you were all well.  I have not seen Mr. Wells, but understand that he brought my dressing gown.  I have not seen that either.  He is out somewhere.

	I had a very pleasant time with Governor Manning.  Col. Orr, Col. Wilson, Col. Watts, Mr. Richardson, a German architect & another gentleman whose name I did not learn were all who came there.  I did not see Mrs. Manning who arrived today.  She is likewise in a condition not to show to advantage.

	Duncan informs me that Mrs. Simmons & Mrs. Croft arrived this evening, but I have not seen them.  Tell Willie that DeLorme has been elected doorkeeper & when he comes down he may let him into theHall.  DeLorme seems a clever boy & was very grateful for our effort.

	There was nothing of any interest done today in the Legislature.  I introduced a Bill to give the election of Electors to the people & also to give state aid to the Blue Ridge rail road.

	Look in those pigeon holes over where I sit & write in my office & you will see Dr. Gantts deed & the paper I drew for him.    Get them & give them to him.

	I must now conclude as I have really nothing to write about.  I am sorry for poor Luther McBee.  His brother Pinckney recd a letter from Alexander Monday evening but did not represent him as so low as you suppose him to be.

	Mr. Wells has just been to my room & has gone to bring my gown.  I have just seen at a distance Simmons & his bride & two other ladies & I suppose they are all to sleep together.  .  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
