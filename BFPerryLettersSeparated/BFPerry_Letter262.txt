Letter 262
1 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now ten oclock at night.  I have just seen Augustus Hoke & will send by him Mrs. Henrys book.  It will be something for you to read whilst alone.

	I hope Anna & Willie [will] be ready to leave Saturday morning.  I got no letters from you this evening.  But I hope you are all well.  I wrote you by mail this morning & have nothing more to communicate.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
