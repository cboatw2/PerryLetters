Letter 72
23 March 1847
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines this evening as Col. Thompson says he will return in the morning.

	I shall probably get off Thursday though it is uncertain how long a certain case will occupy the court.  I am trying to compromise it, but do not expect to succeed.

	We have very little business here & a prospect of less next court.  I have recd two hundred dollars on Mattisons note.  Suddith says he will pay me $50 at Greenville court on Fowlers note and $100 from Major Henry in Mr. Thomas Case will enable us to square off & have some balance.  But the Sawyers prospect bis now a gloomy one.

	I find it rumored here that I will be a candidate for Congress, but the more I think of it the less inclined am I.  How can I give up the pleasures & vexations of you & the children for six months?  How can you & the children do without my counsel & advice?

	General Whitner has given me an invitation to go see his wife, children, & coons.  I told him the wife & children were inducement enough without putting in the coons.

	I have sent Col. [John] Bausketts money to General McDuffie by Mr. Perrin.

	We had a pleasant dinner on the roadside on Sunday.  Butler made a fire & we ate in great comfort.

	I have neither seen nor heard anything of Mr. Sharpe.

	I hope you & the children are doing well & the servants giving you no trouble.

	Kiss the children for me.  Yours truly &c, B. F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
