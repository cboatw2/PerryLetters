Letter 141
2 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a letter this morning before I go to church for fear I may be prevented afterwards, as I was the other evening in attending the Board of Trustees.

	I have read a letter from your aunt Eliza requesting me to let Willie pay them a visit when next Jas. Conner returns.  But Willie says he will not go without I do.  He is a manly little fellow & I think a most remarkable boy.  Since he came here he has read three books of considerable size, I had to purchase another for him last night.  Dressed up in his suit of cloth, silk waist coat & frock coat he looks like a little man.  He goes to the State House, sits in the gallery alone, observed everything that is done in the House & comments on the proceedings at night as if he were a member.

	Yesterday we took a ride on the Greenville Rail Road.  The Judges were all with us & they all renewed their acquaintance with Willie.  The road is finished seven r eight miles.  The car purchased for the road is the most beautiful one I ever saw.

	Last night Mr. Yeadon & Judge Porter of Alabama called to see me.  The Judge said he would have known me any where by my Bust in Mr. Yeadons drawing room. Yeadon has got Clark Mills to make one from the mould in his possession, which Mills has preserved.  I was very much pleased with Judge Porter.

	I am going to the Episcopal church this morning.  Tomorrow is commencement in college & a great day.  Willie will see a great deal.  Yesterday he heard the cannon firing for the first time & at first did not know what it was.

       Col. Isaac Hayne & his son called to see Willie & myself the other day & we were not in the room.  His son Isaac & William Taylor came in the evening and spent a few minutes with Will & invited him to see them.  He has not yet been.

	I recd your letter by the Fridays mail & glad to hear you are enjoying yourself in my absence.  I hope you will continue to dance.  I am anxious to return home again.  But having Will with me is a comfort & he behaves so well it is doubly pleasing & grattifying.

	It has now commenced raining very hard & I do not suppose we shall be able to go to church.  How I should like to be at home & spend the day with you & anna, Frank & Fannydear little creatures.  There is no place like home.  There are no persons like wife & children.

	Elford, , Green & Dr. Erwin are all here. But I have neither seen or heard of Jones.  The idea of his offering for solicitor is absurd.  Walker is here & ran twice for Comptroller General & got three votes both times.  Jones would not get as many for solicitor.  How people can deceive themselves.  Walker really thought he could be elected, & out of 164 votes recd 3!  Elias Earle was not a candidate.

	I do not know that I mentioned that Mr. & Mrs. Burt passed through Columbia on their way to Washington.  I saw them sitting in the gallery & Mrs. Burt was spruced up very fine.  Before I got an opportunity of speaking to her she left.  Burt & myself spent some time together & went to call on the governor together.  He has become as fat as a bear.  I saw Barnwell Rhett yesterday, who gave me a most cordial greeting.  He too is fattened up very much.  I was introduced to Heyward the other day who married Miss Smith or Rhett.  He enquired after you & your mother & Susan & Anne.  He was under the impression that Anne was married & Susan single.  Mrs. Isaac Hayne is here, but I have not seen her.

	Tell Fanny I will bring my pocket full of cocoa cakes for her.  Anna & Frank shall be remembered.  You shall be in the way of a shawl but I have not yet seen anything of the kind.  The four ladies I have seen wore mantillas & not shawls.

	I have bought myself an over sack like my Canada sack only larger for $12.00.  It is worn over my coat & looks very genteel & is all the fashion.  Cloaks are thrown aside as old fashion.

	I hope to receive a letter from you tonight.  The last mail Col. Fair & myself went to the Post office together & he said he was very anxious [to] get a letter from his wife, but did not.  I however recd one from you, & thought to myself you were more thoughtful of your husband.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
