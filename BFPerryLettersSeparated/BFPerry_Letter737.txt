Letter 737
28 November 1866
Greenville [Columbia?]

My dear Liz

	I have but a moment to write you before going to the Court of Appeals.  I am on the Committee to examine students.  There are fifty five applicants for law & twenty five for Equity.  I rece[ive]d your letter last night & if Mrs. Laurens sent any tickets to me they were stolen from the mails.  I see my letter to the Herald published in the paper of 22d.  The comments are moderate.  The Charleston Couriers New York correspondent says the letter is magnificent.  The Phoenix publishes notices of my letter on the Constitution.  The Charlotte News makes extracts from my Herald Letter & compliments.

	I had a long talk with General Capers & advised him to accept the Greenville Church & run for Secretary of State.  He will resign his office as soon as he is ordained.  He spoke very kindly of you & your efforts to provide for him.  He appears to be a most excellent & pious gentleman.

	In speaking of Mr. Arthur Chief Justice Dunkin said that you would not let me defend him.  Willie is quite well.  Henry Buist told me he saw Fannie at his Fathers just before leaving Charleston.  Col. Jackson & his Bride came down with us & stopped at Nickersons.  I had to give him my room for the night.  Miss Orr came down to stay with Col. Childs during the Session.  Edward Stokes was very attentive to her, but I think Van Wyck is addressing her.  His first wife was a daughter of Judge Battle of N.C.  I have bought me a new hat like the old one.  Janney invites you to come down & stay with him.  I do not know whether I shall be able to go down Saturday or not.  I will write you again.  I have been nowhere & seen no one except those at the Hotel.  In great haste, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
