Letter 349
16 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday & I have time to write you a long letter.  The weather is bad & I shall not go to church.  I have just finished a long letter to the Patriot & Mountaineer.  The union of these two names sounds horribly to ears yet awhile.

	I rece[ive]d Franks letter last night with a line added by you & for which I thank you.  General McGowan asked me if it was a fact that I wrote a letter to my wife every day.  He said he had heard so & told his wife so, & that it has elevated me very much in her estimation.  She desired him to do the same, but that he would not find time to write more than twice a week.  I told him that you & I both wrote to each other every day, & that also wrote to the Patriot daily, notwithstanding my arduous duties.  He expressed great surperize.

	I have not written to you a full letter since I dined at Col. Prestons.  The dinner was superb one & I never ate more or drank more.  We did not rise from the dinner table till after ten oclock in the night!  I had promised Governor Adams to go to his house that night to attend the Literary Club if I could get off in time for eight oclock.  But I had to forego that pleasure.  I was very anxious to be present at the governors.  Generals Bonham & McGowan who were there said I was very much enquired for.  I suppose some of the literary gentlemen desired me to speak at their debate again.

	My. Account of the meeting at Dr. Labordes has excited a great deal of chat with the ladies & the Patriot is in great demand, although a copy is sent to each member.  Mrs. Lieber sent me her thanks the other day by her son of the Drs quitting the College.  Mrs. Dawkins manifested great interest in seeing the Patriot & the Col. got a copy for her.

	I dined with Col. Campbell & Count deCha the other day.  We had a very pleasant party & the Count gave me a pressing invitation to visit him next summer in Henderson.

	Last night I was invited to take supper with the governor after the adjournment of the Legislature.  But the House did not adjourn till midnight & I came home & went to bed.  I wish very much to see Mrs. Adams & her daughters before I leave Columbia, but I am afraid I shall not have time.

	We shall have to sit up all night now till the Legislature adjourns if we do the business of the House.  I shall not be at home till Thursday & may not have time to write you again.  I hope Willie was able to tell you a good deal about Columbia & the Legislature, and I will tell you a great deal when I return home.

	I am my dear Liz exceedingly anxious to see you & the children & be with you all again.  It is actually painful when I think of having to stay till Thursday.  But some of the members, my friend Col. [Benjamin Henry] Willson [Wilson] for instance, seem perfectly willing to stay a week or two longer and have actually tried to force the Legislature to rescind their order for adjourning.  They are perhaps happier, & have more enjoyment from [here] than at homenot so with your husband.  When I think of my position at Greenville, never from home more than a week whilst on the circuit & receiving five thousand dollars a year, I feel happy, & would not exchange my situation for any office less than that of the Presidency.  Whaley & some members from below said to me I had been spoken of as Judge if there was an election, but that they had said I would not accept.  I told them they were right, & that I was doing much better than to be a Judge.

	In regard to my likeness I have not time to sit for a daguerreotype & I do not think a better one could be made than the one you gave Elford.  He need not wait for any other if he intends having an engraving of me.

	I shall expect a long letter from you Monday night.  You can write me Tuesday evening & I will get it Wednesday night.

	Last night on returning from the State House I fell in company with General Martin.  He seemed very kind & cordial & enquired after you all.  He said he never saw me.  I did not go into the Senate & he did not go into the House.  I have seen nothing of Taylor for two weeks.  Last night I walked to the State House with Isaac Hayne & General Bonham.  Hayne wishes his salary raised four or five hundred dollars.

	Tell Willie I went for his wal[l]et yesterday.  They were at work on it & said it should be ready Monday.

	I will now enclose & write a letter to Anna.  I was glad to read her letter to you.  I have not yet written to her at all nor have I heard from her but once.  Flora Jones is going with Mrs. Allen to Montgomery to stay with Mrs. Young awhile.

	Tell Frank & Fanny I hope they are studying their Books & will learn faster under your instruction than they have done at school.

	In January you & I will go down for Anna & stay awhile at the Mills House.  I shall receive $500 of Williams at American sale day in January & perhaps my Mobile money with Strouds &c.  A few days from home together will be pleasant & it is so pleasant to travel with you & leave all the children at home.  Our trip to Pickens was a pleasant one.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
