Letter 245
11 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	On my return from the Court House today at four oclock I met General Thompson with your letter in his hand at the door of the Hotel waiting for me to open it & tell him the news from Greenville.  He did not receive any letters today, nor did he yesterday.  Your letter was dated last Sunday & you spoke of the deep snow.  It was refreshing to be rewarded with a letter from my wife after a fatiguing day in the court House.

	The case of Gardiner goes on better today & I think a change has taken place in the minds of the Jury after hearing the statement of our side of the case from Bradl[e]y.  he made the opening speech for Gardiner & Carlisle & myself will argue the case after we have gone through the testimony.  But we are all making speeches on points of testimony throughout the day.  The newspapers are reporting our speeches.  I see a pretty full report this morning in the Republic of the arguments yesterday.  I see it stated in all the newspapers that I am here as counsel for Gardiner.  The Southern Standard this morning had long extracts from my letters & pronounced them the best travelling gossip it had even seen.

	General Thompson has just come up from the Reading Room & says that the gentlemen there who were in court today state that I outspoke all of the lawyerslongsome of them said there was no comparison between my speaking & that of the others.  I only addressed the court for a few minutes.  I am pleased that my mode of speaking is so much admired.  When I come to make theargument I hope to do well.

	After writing the above I went down to supper & whilst sitting at the table talking to Major Wigg of South Carolina who has just got a claim passed Congress for fifty or sixty thousand dollars on account of his grandfathers losses in the revolution, and who was the brother in law of Col. Isaac Hayne the martyr,  I was requested by Mr. Colcock to go with him & various others to see Governor [Nathaniel P.] Tallma[d]ge & hear him talk about spiritual rappers & I went with them.  It is now Sunday morning before breakfast.  I did not return till near mid morning from Governor Tallma[d]ges & on my return found a short letter from you dated Monday last.  I was glad to hear from you again a day later than my letter rece[ive]d yesterday morning.  General Thompson  came into my room & I read a portion of your letter to him.  If Mrs. Thompson only knew with how much interest he looks forward to the reception of a letter by me from you she would certainly write him oftener.

	My visit to Governor Tallma[d]ge & the rappers I will write out for the Patriot. He told the most wonderful & marvellous things done by the spirits to him.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
