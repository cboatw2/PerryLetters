Letter 121
Monday night, [1848]
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have barely time to say to you that I have been very busy defending Keiths election today before the board of managers & have been successful.  I was employed as a lawyer & will charge a good fee.  It is said I have gained many votes by my defence.  It has united all of Keiths friends on me.  Many of [Frederick Newton] Garvins also go for me.

	I start in the morning to Cheohee with Col. Norton who is tome the rounds.  I go on horseback & will not reach Pendleton before Sunday or Monday evening.  I have to make a speech here on next Monday, which is sale day & I shall spend the time in the District.  You can go to Pendleton & remain there till I go there or you can go on home.  I will perhaps get there Saturday evening, but if so I shall come up to Pickens on Monday.

	I hear favorable accounts from old Pendleton.  Col. Orr has the fever at Caesars head & has sent to Greenville for a doctor.  So you may know he is not doing mischief.

	There was a great crowd there today & a favorable account from all quarters.

	Kiss the children for me.  I hope you may spend your time pleasantly, Yours truly &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
