Letter 756
13 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I wrote you from Chester after making my speech there & then went & spent the evening with Col. Hamilton.  I was very much pleased with Mrs. Hamilton who is really smart & interesting.  She said she knew me very well although I did not know her.  She had seen me so often in Greenville.  The Col. has been a true friend & done me great service.

	I left Chester at 11 oclock in the night & came to Winnsboro.  They were expecting me the next day & had made arrangements to receive me & escort me to my friend   where they wished me to stay.  But I preferred being at the Hotel where I could see everyone.  I made a long & good speech in the Court House which was well received.  Judge  a Radical came up & congratulated me.  In the evening they gave me a magnificent dinner.  One hundred of the first gentlemen in the county sat down to the [word faded] all made speeches and if you could have been present & heard all the extravagant compliments paid me by the different speakers you would have been proud of your husband. They complimented my firmness, my pol, my talents & ability & then commenced on my personal appearance & really made me believe that I was a noble looking gentleman.  They spoke of my wisdom  in differing from them on Secession &c.  I send you a Bill of Fare which Col. [James H.] Rion told me to bring home & let the people see how well they entertained me.

	Everywhere I was well received but Winnsboro beat them all, when in nullification terms I could not have got a dozen votes, for anything even constable.  I met my old friend Major Wardlaw, Col. inson, Col. Lyles, Mr. Campbell.  The parlor of their church & manymany others, who seemed delighted to see me.  I left about twelve oclock in the night & came to Columbia with [D.T.] Corbin district attorney.  He told me that he wished me elected to Congress & thought I would beat [A.S.] Wallace.  But it is very uncertain & depends on the turnout of the negroes.  If they turn out well I shall be beaten.  Although we have a majority of white voters, there are at least two thousand scalawags in the congressional district.  I do not think the negroes will turn out well.

	I think Willies election pretty sure.  He is in Abbeville & will remain there till after the election.  I hear very favorable accounts of his success there & in Pickens.
