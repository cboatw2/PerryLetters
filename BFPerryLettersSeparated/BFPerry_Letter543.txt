Letter 543

Greenville

My dear Son

	I go down to Columbia in the morning & will be in the Legislature till towards Christmas.  You must write to me there.  This is a very wet day & gloomy weather.  I have been packing up my clothes although it is Sunday & we have a Methodist minister staying with us.  His name is Stacy, & [a] very clever intelligent gentleman he is.  We are to have another tomorrow.  Mr. [Albert Micajah] Ship[p] the President of the Female College at Spartanburgh.  I shall not see him as I go off in the morning.

	There is a great Methodist Conference here.  Akins came here & about 2:30 Pres.  They are quartered on the Village {last few words obscured by stain].

	Anna Green was married last week & Willie was one of the groomsmen for Mr. Davis her husband.  He also waited on Donalson & Sue Hoke.

	I am glad my dear Son that you are going to study hard & be transferred to a higher section.  I hope you will succeed.

	Col. Ashmore will be with you tomorrow.  I hope you will be allowed to see him & converse with him a long time for he has promised to give you a great deal of advice.

	If you wish to go to Washington in Christmas time, & get permission to do so I will send you money to defray your expenses.  Write to me whether you will be allowed to go.  Col. Ashmore will invite you if it is necessary to receive an invitation & you wrote him to that effect.

	Willie is studying law very hard, & makes good progress in his studies.  Hext is going to school & doing well.  Fannie is also going to school & doing well.  She is one of the smartest & best little girls I have ever seen.  Hayne & Arthur are doing well & looking well.  Your mother is well [and] so are all the servants.

	Col. Ashmore writes me that you are a noble looking boy & he knows you could do well. I hope when he sees you & knows of you he will not change his opinion.

	Now my dear son be a good boy & study & make a man of yourself of whom your family and country will be proud.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry
