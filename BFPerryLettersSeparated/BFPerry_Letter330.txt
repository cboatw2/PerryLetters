Letter 330
3 May 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & have just returned from a lecture on young America by aMethodist Preacher who is chaplain to Congress.  Governor Adams, Col. [Christopher William] Dudl[e]y & Mr. Thompson went with me.  I saw Robert Thurston downstairs & he kindly offered to take up anything for me.  I have time only to write you a line.

	I was pleased with Mr. [William Henry] Millburns lecture.  He has produced quite a sensation in Charleston & Mrs. King has become seriously affected under his peaching says Col. deTreville.  She leads him up to the Pulpit & escorts him all over the cityHe taking her arm!  Piety badly lead.

	Today I argued the case of the church in Spartanburgh & commenced Dr. Bivings case, but it will take about all day tomorrow.  I shall get off from here the first of next week.  Governor Adams has given me an invitation to his house, Saturday next.  I am appointed to examine students next Tuesday.  I wrote to Anna this morning.

	I am getting my gold chain mended & borrowed a vest chain to wear.  They are now all the fashion.  I wish one for myself.  Willie may have the one I have been wearing.  Will that do him?  Write me.

	Col. OHanlon called to see me yesterday but I was out.  He left word that he would be back in a day or two.  Dr. Lieber called yesterday & I was out.  Dr. Thornwell called this evening, & presented me with a copy of his book on Truth with his presentation on the blank leaf.

	I will write to Dr. Croft & answer the other letters you sent me tomorrow.  I saw Mr. Green today.  He came up from Sumter to see me, & seemed greatly pleased with my settlement with Loring.

	I am writing you with such haste that I hardly know what I write.  Yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
