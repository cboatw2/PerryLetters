Letter 447
9 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Lizzie

	I enclose you a letter of Annas, but have not time to write you.  I am very much distressed about Anna & shall write to her tomorrow to quit her studies.  It is likely that I will go on for her as soon as I hear from her Physician in Philadelphia.

	I did not reach here the day I left home till eleven oclock in the night.  The up train ran off & left the cars on the road.  Today I was busy incase & they have decided not to do anything till the Alabama case is decided.  I will write to him tomorrow.

	I have just returned from dinner with Mr. Speaker Simons & a pleasant company of gentlemen.

	It is now twelve oclock.  I have just seen Mrs. LeConte &the Dr. who read me a portion of their daughters letter about Anna which is pretty much as Anna writes.

	Dr. & Mrs. LeConte leave in the morning for Savannah.

	I did not hear from you this evening as I expected.

	I may speak on the Bank question tomorrow.  Good night my dear wife, B.F.  Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
