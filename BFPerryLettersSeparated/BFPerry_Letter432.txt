Letter 432
24 November 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I send you enclosed a letter to the Patriot.  Do so as soon as you have read it.

	Col. Memminger has handed me three large bundles for you, which I will send by Wells, Thursday.  I suppose you know what they contain.

	We did nothing in the House today.  My bill about the College was read & referred.

	Mr. Elford came up this morning & could get no room.  I have taken him into mine which has two beds in it.

	I saw Col. Frank Kayne today who enquired after you all.  I have seen none of the T except on the Bench.

	I hope to receive a letter from you, but the mail closes at six oclock, & I must put this letter in the office without hearing from home.

	I have not seen Mrs. LeConte today & I do not know whether she has heard from her daughter & Anna.

	I have no news to write you more than my letter to the Patriot contains.

	I was dining today at my usual table all alone & invited Col. Memminger to take a seat with me.  Directly afterwards Yeadon came & took his usual seat by me.  I think these two gentlemen were very much embarrassed as I suppose they have not spoken since last session.  We all three conversed very pleasantly after the ice was broken.

	Col. Memminger tells me his sons are better satisfied than they were at home.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
