Letter 502
24 October 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter as usual Friday evening.  I returned from Pickens Court the evening before.  Hext went with me & was very much pleased.  He bought himself a pretty knife & is delighted with it.

	We are all well except Anna.  She is not so well as she was last week & I am very busy preparing my cases, so I have no time to write you a long letter.

	You must study hard & behave yourself well so as to stand high in your class.  You ought to stand first as you are going over the same studies you pursued last year.  Do my son strive hard to avoid demerits & get a high stand in your class.

	We did not hear from Willie last week.  But rece[ive]d a catalogue from him.  He is doing very well & has a pretty good standing in his class of one hundred & twenty five.

	Everybody enquires after you & ask[s] how you are getting on & how you like the naval school.  I am sorry there are so few South Carolinians in the school.  Why is it?  Can they not enter?  Or do they not apply?

	In great haste your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
