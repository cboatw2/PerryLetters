Letter 574
11 March 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I have time to write you only a few lines.  I have just finished a long article for the Columbia Carolinian nominating Col. Orr for the Presidency.  In the morning I start to Anderson court & will be gone most of the week.

	We are all well.  I bought a Poney for Fannie this week.  He paces finely& when you return he will do for you to ride.

	Your letter was rece[ive]d last week.  Your Report has not been rece[ive]d.  My dear son study hard & be a good boy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
