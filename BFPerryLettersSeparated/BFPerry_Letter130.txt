Letter 130
Sunday night, [13] May 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening and thank you for it.  I was anxious to hear from you, & walked up to the Post office before the hour for opening & delivering letters.  The post master saw me through a crack & opened the office.  Whilst I was standing reading your letter in the piazza of the office Judge Evans came up & enquired how I could get letters out.  I replied the post master knew me & supposed I was anxious to hear from my wife.  The Judge said do you not thank God that you were not elected  [to Congress--you ought to.

	Since writing to you I have bought a beautiful wig for $10.00 & it has improved my looks very much.  I immediately made Col. Herndon buy one to cover his grey head.  He now looks about thirty five.  I told him when Mrs. Herndon comes down this week I intend to have them married over again.  She would hardly recognize him.

	I have made considerable purchases since I wrote you besides the wig.  Col. Dunhams agent offered to pay me if I would take out the draft in his store.  I thought it best to do so & purchased the following articlesone dozen tumblers $5.00dozen wine glasses $6.00all the finest cut glasses or stonea set of beautiful decanters, cut glass, 4 in number $16.00two wash basins & pitchers 3.00two vegetable dishes $3.00one entry lamp (gas light) $6.50a most splendid affairone chamber lamp (gas) $2.50cream pot 75ctsmolasses pitcherdo very handsome $2.50one small beautiful basin & pitcher for Annas room &c &c.

	I have also purchased two bedsteads for $8.00 & $6.00three mattresses $6.75 a pieceone mahogany folding table $14.00one crib mattress $2.50.

	I do not expect to go to Charleston or purchase groceries till I return home.  Next spring we will go to town as you suggest & lay in our supplies.  Tell Anna I will buy her ear rings.  I will get the shawl for Anne &c &c.  But have not yet had time.

	I saw Captain Cunningham this morning.  He called to see me & is a member of the convention.

	There was a meeting of the delegates yesterday evening & it was agreed that we would not do anything more than organize a central committee to correspond with the Southern people.  Tomorrow the convention meets & there is a great crowd in Columbia as we usually see at the meeting of the legislature.

	I was employed in a case from Newberry to be argued before Judge Frost at chambers Wednesday & shall get a good fee.  The case is a dispute about a child between the grandmother & the aunt of the child.

	It is more than likely that our cases in the court of Appeals will not be reached & that I may return home the last of this week.

	Col. Irby & Mr. Young came down this evening.  They brought news that Edward Earle was probably not alive.  Col. Irby tells me that he will pay the interest & desires to do so.

	I am sorry to hear of the death of Durbecs child & that Elias Earle was in the bar room so soon after the death of his wife.  His son came up to me the other day & made himself known.  He is going to school here.

	I have no doubt that Dr. Tiddiman is sick of his purchase.  You are mistaken in saying that I have a horror of long letters.  Yours are never too long except when you scold me, or give me too much advice.

	I hope the children are well and that Reuben is getting on well with the farm.  I am glad you have had a fine rain.

	I must now conclude.  You have no doubt heard of the dreadful in New York.  The last account is that 500 men were killed in the last one & that the mob had overcome the military and that they had sent to Philadelphia for aid.

       I hope the children are through with the mumps & poor little Fanny rid of her complaint.  Yours truly and affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
