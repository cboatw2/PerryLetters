Letter 520
13 March 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d your letter last night& were pleased to hear of your high averages.  Study hard & make up for your past deficiency.  Do not neglect your lessons by reading too much in the Books we send you.

	We are all well.  I go to Anderson court in the morning & will be gone all the week.  I shall see Col. Orr & hear something about your visit to Washington.

	There have been several attempts to burn up Cox & Gowers carriage establishment & Hext has just come to tell me that they have caught the IncendiariesKirk Smith & Parker two of the workmen.  Smith is a boy & son of Chesney Smith.  He had been whipped by Cox for forging an order.

	We have ordered a beautiful monument for Annas grave from Philadelphia costing $400.  The iron railing cost $200 & is on the way.  Fannie goes almost every day & strews her grave with flowers.

	The Register of the navy sent us has been rece[ive]d.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
