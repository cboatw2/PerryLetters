Letter 531
15 May 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We did not hear from you or Willie last week, & are somewhat uneasy, as your letters heretofore come so regularly.  But we hope nothing is the matter.

	Fannie & Annie disap[p]ointed us last evening likewise in not returning from Charleston.  Mr. Arthur delayed starting till tomorrow.  We shall see them Tuesday.  They have enjoyed themselves very much, but are very anxious to return home.

	Mrs. Pearson has come here to die.  She is very low.  Dr. Randall Croft is very unwell.

	We are all very well except Arthur who has a breaking out all over his face but is still up.

	We are all anxious to see you Y Willie at home once more.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
