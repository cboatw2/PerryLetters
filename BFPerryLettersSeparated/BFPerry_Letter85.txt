Letter 85
26 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I know you will be glad to receive a letter from me although it may contain nothing of interest.  I can well imagine myself in your situation every mail night, waiting to receive a letter & I know that I should be disappointed in not receiving one.

	I hope to hear from you again tonight & perhaps Willie may be enduced to write me again this week.

	I sent your package to Mrs. Taylor yesterday by Edward.  He saw no one but Colonel Taylor.  I have not seen the Colonel since.  Yesterday I saw Col. Isaac Hayne.  He says they are all well in Charleston & enquired after you & your mother & family.  I do not think he looks altogether as well as he did last winter.

	Gilmore Simms called the other night at my room after I had gone to bed & paid me a long visit.  He was deeply interested in the election of his friend Col. Aldrich, who was a candidate for commissioner in Equity for Barnwell & who was yesterday elected.  Tell Anne that he expressed a deep interest in her health & welfaresaid she had made a lasting impression on his mind, & from the way he talked one might suppose his heart too.

	General Martin tried to dissuade me from going to Congress the other day by telling me that I  would be elected President of the Senate whenever [Angus] Patterson retired, & that this was a more honorable position than a seat in Congress.

	I have purchased Kohls Russia, Austria, England, Ireland & Scotland in three volumes for six dollars.  You may remember extracts from the work & know how interesting they were.  I have got them to read to you this winter.  I have also purchased ancient & modern sculpture, a very fine & large English work, full of the most beautiful plates for three dollars fifty cents.  This work in England I have no doubt [would] cost ten or fifteen dollars.

	I have just recd a letter from Keith of Pickens giving me good news about the election.  Col. Grisham & Miles Norton are here, & they speak favorably of Pickens.

	The election for Chancellor will take place next week & there are several candidates Memminger, Whitner, Dargan, Haynesworth, DeSaussure, Wardlaw &c.  I suppose Col. Memminger will be elected & I am sorry that Whitner permits himself to be run.  He had better keep back for the law bench.

	We have nothing new on the Rail Road subjectnor have we done anything in the Legislature.  General Thompson is here & expresses a great interest in my election.  He had some sharp sparring with [James Lawrence] Orr at Newberry.  Orr charged Greenville with a want of courtesy in debate.  I replied & he stopped me & said it was no I that he alluded to, but some other member.  Thompson told him to name the member, but he declined doing so.

	Tell me what present I shall bring you & the children.

	My breakfast is now nearly ready & I must conclude.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
