Willards Hotel, [Washington]

My dear Liz

	We arrived here safely in three days after a most fatiguing trip travelling night & day.  But we had a great deal of pleasant enjoyment in talking & eating & drinking.  In Richmond I purchased a very fine sack Coat $39beaver cloth &$18, cravat $1.50 & gloves $2.00.  Immediately on my arrival here I went to see the Secretary of War.  He rece[ive]d me very kindly and paid me in money my account $1520.  The gold note $285, another note of $200 lost.  of $200 borrowed of Ferguson when I went to Columbia--$25 for the horse & $20you have received.  I was delighted to git the money but grieved to have to part with the greater part of it immediately.

	My arrival was announced in the National Intelligencer & Trescott & Buist came immediately to see me & said I had arrived just in time to be.  They state mostin reference tp the s[e]izure of lands &c.  They insisted on my going with them forthwith to see the President.  When we got there, a large crowd had assembled in the East Room.  It was the Christian Society for the relief of Soldiers.  The President came down to meet them & made a speech.  In it he said his policy embraced all the states & he knew no section.  On retiring he came up to me  & said he was much grattified to see me.  I said I wished to have some conversation with him & he told me to call tomorrow Sunday morning when he would be at leisure.  He told me about the Black republicans sending Fred[erick] Douglass & a force of negroes to make a speech to him.  He said it was the most trying scene he had ever passed through, but that he kept his temper.  His reply was most admirable.  He looks very well & is a most wonderful man.  I shall have a long chat with him tomorrow in company with Trescot & Buist.

	Tonight I have just learned that he will veto the Freedmans Bureau Bill.  This will be a great & unexpected boon to the South & requires more nerve than I thought he possessed.  But he is a wonderful man, & looks only to the interest of the whole country.  Black republicans will be furious & the lands will now have to be restored in the lower country.  The state works at Greenville will be given up by the Secretary of the Treasury.  Trescot told him I was here & that I had transferred the works to Gov. Orr instread of selling them to defray the expenses of the Convention.  The Secretary then said he would abandon them.

	I went to the Senate this morning & gave Reverdy Johnson my commission to present, which seemed to impress him.  He called this evening to see me.  I have just made the acquaintance of the Alabama Senators Parsons & Houston.  The crowd here is immense.  Willards is full to overflowing.  Tell Willie I have purchased a very fine hat for him.  I went into a singular store today where everything was a dollar.  I purchased a beautiful cup as pretty as silver one dollar, a Book full of photographs with a gold clasp for a dollar.  Then I was entitled to two draws in a lottery.  I drew a little silver Bell & a necklace.  The thing is a mystery.  I will have my photograph taken full length for $3 & then $1.50  for all copies afterwardslittle ones taken for three cents by the hundred.

	In visiting the Capitol I was shocked to see ragged, dirty, stinking black negroes mixing in the galleries.  They go into the Senate gallery & sit & sleep &the whole House!

	I have subscribed for the Nationasl Intelligencer.  You must preserve the papers that come in in my absence.  I think I shall return the week after next.

	Your affectioinate husband.  Goodnight eleven oclock.  B.F. Perry
