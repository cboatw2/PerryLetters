Letter 306
7 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Shortly after I had written you and gone to bed, I was awoke by the fire bell.  The whole square opposite the Hotel is burnt to the ground.  The sight was a terrific one.  The women were horribly alarmed.  The whole house is in the greatest confusion.  The fire is yet burning.  DR. Gibb[e]soffice $30,000 is utterly destroyed.  The streets are full of furniture.  Willie & Frank have stood in the piazza fir three hours looking on.  The fire broke out ? after one oclock.  It is now after five in the morning.  I have no idea of the loss, but it is very heavy.  The fire broke out in a grocery where last night a man was killed by the son of Chancellor Caldwell.  His body is burnt up.  The murder, the grog shop & the fire will furnish Judge ONeall with atheme for a letter or temperance lecture.  In great confusion, your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
