Letter 445
3 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have been in court all day arguing the case of Bonys & Sloan from Anderson & am very tired.  I have to conclude my argument tomorrow, & then all of my cases in the law court of appeals will be over.  Next week same term my equity cases will come on.  I think I shall get a new trial in Bonys & Mather & then a good fee,

	I shall go home Saturday & return Monday.  This therefore is the last letter I will write you till I see you.  I have just rece[ive]d Fannies letter & was glad to hear from you.

	Mrs. LeConte proposed today at dinner that I should let Anna go with her sister Miss Graham to Philadelphia & consult some eminent Physician who makes the throat & lungs his peculiar study & see what is the matter with her.  I have just written to Bishop Doane to let her go.  Mis Graham will go over next Friday & take Anna & Lula to Philadelphia.  Mrs. LeConte is now writing to her sister & to the Bishop.  They will stay till Monday & return to Burlington.  This will be some satisfaction to us to know what does cause her cough.

	Governor Means told me a most horrible thing on John Cunningham last night.  He was indicted last court, the other day in Charleston for a rape on an Irish girl whom Mrs. Cunningham had sewing for her.  He went to settle with the woman & abused her.  She took out a warrant & the attorney general handed out an Indictment.  Eleven of the Jury were for finding a true Bill, but it required a twelve jurors, & so he was discharged.  She was a great big fat girl & it was said ought to have been strong enough to have defended herself.  But one more Juror would have put the gentleman on his trial for his life & death!   I suppose he does not deny having intercourse with her, & that he used some force, but she did not tell of it soon enough or it might have taken his neck.  What a villain he is.  What a derangement he seems to have on that subject.  He looks as imprudent as if nothing had ever happened. I will tell you more about it when I see you & in the meantime burn this letter for fear it may fall into the hands of the children or someone years after this.  And I would not like it known that I had written such a thing to you.

	I must now conclude my letter.  How happy I am at the idea of seeing you & the children Saturday evening.  What a joyous meeting it will be.  Kiss the children for me.  Oh how I long to kiss you all myself & how the little fellowsaround me once more.  Col. Irby goes up with me as far as Laurens & a great many of the members will go home to avoid the College Commencement.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
