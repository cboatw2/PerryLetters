Letter 242
10 March 1853
Washington City

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d a long letter from you last night, on my return from a visit to Judge Butler, dated the 4th Inst., and whilst reading it Mr. Beattie & Mr. Grady came into my room with General Thompson.  I was truly glad to see them & we sat up & chatted till after twelve oclock.  They did not arrive here till nine oclock in the night.  I have sent by Beattie Annas locket with my likeness & your broach with my likeness.  I have also sent by him some medals for the children of Pierce & Scott, who you have no doubt rece[ive]d before this letter reaches you.

	But Beattie & Grady had left home two days after I did & therefore could tell me no news.  I sent the locket & broach for you to have something to see & talk about, though I had rather kept them & exhibited them myself.  I am a good deal like Anna in this respect when she wished her Christmas presents kept till she returned.

	I have bought your silver goblets of the most beautiful pattern in the world for fifty dollars.  They are of the Abbotts&beautifully.  They were at the Fair for exhibition.  These with the tea set will be a handsome present for you.  They were so beautiful I could not resist every temptation but that of beauty.  They are used instead of tumblers.  Tumblers are out of fashion & glass goblets will last always & glass tumblers break directly they are cheaper & as a matter of economy it is better to purchase them.

	When Burt left here yesterday I had to let him have fifty dollars to get home.  His brother Armistead Burt told me to furnish him with money & he would refund to me and told me to say so to Frank Burt.  So I am now about able to get home myself after the Gardiner case is over.

	Judge Butler invited me to dine with him tomorrow & see his mess.

	I must now conclude hoping to hear from you again tonight. I am glad to hear Willie is improving.  I hope he will study hard.  Anna must attend to her studies too & music lessons.  Fanny must be a good girl & study her lessons.  Frank I hope will be quite improved when I see him.  Hext I hope will talk.  God bless you, B.F. Perry
