Letter 82
22 November 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I arrived here yesterday evening & received your letter after tea, for which I thank you more sincerely.  It always gives me the greatest interest to hear from you & the children although you may have nothing more to write than that you are all well.

	Major Earle informed me last night that his wife & children passed through Columbia yesterday evening & that he only got to see them in the streets.  I told him that if I had been in his place, they should have staid all night or I would have gone with them.  He had not seen them for four weeks!
He should be ashamed to mention the fact and I rather thought Major Jones who was present was ashamed of his conduct.  But you need not speak of it.

	You must not pay any attention to the reports & news your friend Moore tells you about election.  I know how to understand these matters & you do not.  They are too idle & foolish to do me harm.  I think the Rail Road will have a good effect on the election in Laurens & perhaps loose me some votes in Anderson.

	I met Dr. Goodwin last evening in the presence of Reed & Alexander who expressed his great regret at loosing me in the Senate, & joy at my having a wide field to display my usefulness in.

	Yesterday I travelled in company with Col. & Mrs. Coleman & we stopped on the road at dinner together.    Mr. & Mrs. Poinsett did not start so early.  The company was all pretty much behind.

	Major Jones & Col. Townes fell in company at Newberry & had the pleasure of riding in the stage to Columbia.  Townes told me he saw you riding out & supposed you were all well.

	I am glad to hear that Mr. Bradshaw speaks so highly of Anna.  I think she is remarkably smart & will no doubt learn fast.  Keep her at school.  We have great cause to be thankful for all of our children.  They are all uncommon childrenvery handsome remarkably smart, very good & well behaved & seem kind & affectionate.  I think you have a great deal to be thankful for in this life & I hope we will both appreciate it & enjoy itnot disturb ourselves by looking on the small dark speeches which may be seen in ouror which we may imagine we see.

	You say I must write about Edward.  He does well, & I hope he will be of service to me and will learn a great deal.

	I have not much to write you this morning.  If anything of consequence should transpire during the day I will write you again tonight.  I write now because it is before breakfast & I am at leisure.

	I have seen very few persons yet.  All the Greenville delegation board at this house except Col. Townes.  He stays at Hunts just opposite & came over last evening to see us.  Major Henry says he caught cold at my house & has not been well since.  He seems inform.  I saw John Cunningham at Newberry.  He says Pamela has had chills & fever since her return from Charleston & is very much reduced in health & spirits again.  She is at Ben Yanceys.

	Tell the children they must behave themselves & I will bring them a present.  Willie must write me.  Let me know how all the servants are doing.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
