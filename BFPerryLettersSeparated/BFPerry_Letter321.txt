Letter 321
3 January 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have tracked Reuben to Columbia & think he went to Augusta with Mrs. Harrisons woman.  I have telegraphed Augusta, Marietta & Wilmington.  I have also advertised here in Columbia Carolinian & the Augusta papers.  I shall catch him.

	We are all well & about setting off for Charleston.  In haste, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
