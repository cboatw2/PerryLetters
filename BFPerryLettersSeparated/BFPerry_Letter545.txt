Letter 545
1 December 1859
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter yesterday, just after the House adjourned and as I was going to dine with Col. [Joseph Duncan] Allen.  I was glad to hear you were all well & getting on well with the Methodist clergy.  I was afraid they would give you trouble.

	I did not have time to write you yesterday.  In the evening I dined with Col. Allen & then went to the Board of Trustees.  The Col. gave us a fine dinner.  Edm[und] Rhett, Yeadon, General Edwards, Pope, [Francis Wellman] Fickling, [James H.] Norwood and others were guests.  Yeadon is low spirited.

	I have notice yesterday of my Bill to establish a separate court of appeals.  Rhett got a copy of it & introduced the Bill in the Senate.  [William Sidney] Mullins from the Pee Dee introduced a Resolution yesterday to dissolve the Union.	  But I do not think it merits any serious consideration.  The Harpers Ferry affair has excited everybody very much against the north & very.  If I thought the northern people generally entertained the sentiments of Wendel[l] Phillips,  Smith &c. I too should be in favor of a dissolution.  But I do not believe such sentiments are entertained by the statesmen of the north or the masses of the north.

	Bryant sent me a Bill of your Books yesterday--$28.35 which I will pay this morning.

	I saw Dr. Laborde yesterday & he enquired after you kindly.  I got the Board of Trustees to subscribe for twenty volumes of his Book.

	I was invited yesterday to dine with Gov. Gist, but was previously engaged to Col. Allen

	I will write a letter for the Patriot the last of this week.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from W.H. Cooper of Spartanburg yesterday saying he was coming down to Columbia to get me to file a Bill of Injunction to restrain the administration of his Fathers Estate from carrying slaves out of the State.  So I have law business as well as Legislation to attend to.

	Mr. Petigru & Governor Allston came up last night & were at the Board.  This morning I breakfasted with Mr. Petigru & gave him a Brief in Stokes & Sullivans case.

	I must conclude & go to the State House.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
