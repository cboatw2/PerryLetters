Letter 421
25 October 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your letter of the 14th Inst. On my return last evening from Pickens Court, and was gratified to hear you were still pleased with the Naval Academy & had no demerits.  You must study hard & behave well, be obedient to your officers & teachers in all things, & kind to your fellow students.  I know it is hard to pass through the school without demerits.  But you must have as few as possible.  I hope you will pass your February Examination with flying colors.

	Col. Orr inquired about you at Pickens, & all of your friends ask after you very frequently.  You are a great favorite in Greenville amongst all the Boys & girls too I believe.  You must prove yourself worthy of their love & esteem.

	Hext went with me to Pickens Court & behaved well.  He went down to his uncle Foster Perrys & staid two days.  His uncle gave him a knife which he is very proud of & thinks as much of as you do of your watch.  Does your watch keep good time?  You have said nothing about it lately.

	You ought to git you an overcoat when the weather turns cold.  I believe you have none.  Take care of yourself & avoid catching cold.

	Mrs. Prince the daughter of Jordan Pool died whilst I was At Pickens.  She caught cold at the Fair one night & died the next day or two.

	A great many persons are now sick in Greenville with colds.  Several of the students in the Furman University are quite unwell.

	The House is now finished and painted & looks pretty.  It has cost me upwards of two thousand dollars.

	I had a great deal of business at Pickens & made some money.  I defended a man who was indicted for having two wives.  He was convicted & has been sentenced to fine & imprisonment.

	This is Sunday & tomorrow is court at this place.  Instead of going to church I have staid in my office to write you & Willie & Anna.  I am glad you all keep up a correspondence.  I need not therefore write you about them as you hear from them sooner than I do.

	You must write me all about your school, your officers, teachers, students, studies amusements, boarding &c. &c.  Who are you most intimate with amongst the students?

       You wrote to your mother on the 18th enquiring about Wileys getting married.  He married a girl of Mrs. Nance at Newberry.  I told him it was so far he could not see his wife often & he said he was willing to marry her oftener than once a year.  I will let him go oftener than that.  He does very well now & keeps sober since joining the Baptist church.  Clara is sick with coldMary has been ill the rest of the servants are well.

       Arthur is pretty well but has a cold.  Hayne is fat & hardy.  Hext is quite well.  Fannie is going to school & well.  Hext is also going to school.  Your mother is quite well & delighted at your success in the Naval Academy.  We will try & go on & see you next summer.

       The Horses are all fat & sleek.  The Pony wants someone to ride him.  He stands in the stable all day & no doubt would like to prance about a little.  Fannie rides him some times.

	Your grandmother & Susan & the children are all well.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
