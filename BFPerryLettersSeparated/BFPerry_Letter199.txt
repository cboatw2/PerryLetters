Letter 199
3 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now eleven oclock in the night & I have just sat down to write you a letter.

	Your letter & Annas have just come to hand, and another one from Anna to me.  I have been engaged in the Legislature late tonight, & at the supper table got into conversation with Mr. Petigru & Col. Chesnut & sat a long time after anyone else had realized.  The house is full of ladies, & the table is crowded with them.  They are dancing & promenading & almost seen over me at every turn I make to get through the crowd.  There is not one of them as pretty as my wife & so you need not be jealous of me.

	There is a young lady here from Georgia a Miss Baxter, daughter of Judge Baxter, who is said to be talented & is bold & good looking.  Col. Keith has been wishing to introduce me to her.  I heard a good story in reference to her.  She dresses in the extreme of fashionable dress & open bosom &c.  Dr. Bailey a member of the Legislature was a competitor in the boat race in Charleston & beaten by a boat called Becky Sharp from Georgia.  This he disliked very much.  He was looking at Miss Baxter dancing the other evening & enquired who she was.  Hearing that she was from Georgia, he exclaimed another Becky Sharp.  The expression was told to Miss Baxter & no doubt pleased her very much.

	I liked your last letter very much and hope you will always write me such.  I do not care to be praised in your letters, but I like expressions of your love for me.  I hate scalding & reprising.  I wish you were here with me most sincerely.  There are some pleasant ladies.  Mrs. Chesnut is not one of them.

	I saw & spoke to Mrs. Elford & Miss Crayton this morning.  Joab Mauldin & Miss Crayton are gone to his wedding.  He is married tomorrow.  Mrs. Elford will go to Town [Charleston] in the morning.

	Mr. Beattie & Mr. Cox are here.  Greenville has been pretty strongly represented this winter at this House.  Mrs. Brooks leaves here in the morning.  Dr. Pasley goes up to Greenville & I expect him to carry this letter.

	In the Legislature not much done.  General Harrison told me this morning that everyone said my speech on the division of Pendleton was the speech of the session.

	Col. Glover has been elected Judge. He beat Col. D.  We have some thought of running Elford for Glovers place.

	My speech is published this morning at length in the Carolinian.  Anna writes me for $10 more of money.

	I must conclude & will write you tomorrow.  All well, yours &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
