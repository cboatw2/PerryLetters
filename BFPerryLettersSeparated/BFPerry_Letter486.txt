Letter 486
7 May 1858
Columbia

My dear Liz

	After writing you a short letter last night I felt so bad that I went to bed.  I felt sleepy, & thought I could sleep off my unpleasant feelings, but I soon found that there was an increased commotion which would defy sleep.  The ice water, green peas & fruits which I have been eating have affected my bowels & I spent a very unpleasant night.  I am somewhat better today, but was unable to examine the Equity students.  This morning I am unable to go down to the college exhibition tonight.  Mr. Petigru says Judge Longstreet regretted very much my absence last night.

	We heard this morning the melancholy intelligence of Judge Evans death.  He was perfectly well & in the Senate yesterday, & died at ten oclock in the night.  This is a sad death.  I had great regard for the Judge & most sincerely mourn his loss.  He was one the best, wisest & most exemplary men I ever knew.  He died of a disease of the heart.  You will perhaps see his death notice in the mornings papers.  The Bar have a meeting in the morning.

       I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & was glad to hear you were all well.  Tell Hext I have bought him a nice drum which he can beat loud & long.  I enquired for your Books but they were not to be had.  The Book seller said he would& get some of them.  I have got the promise of some remarkable strawberries next Tuesday.  I hope to return home Wednesday.  If so I can carry the strawberries up.  You must save all your cream & we will have a nice supper.

       Col. Herndon, Fair, Dawkins & Thompson are all here now & they enquired after you & Anna.  Herndon said he had intended sending his daughter to Burlington till he heard of Annas sickness.

       I bought a check today for $414.00 & sent Southworth which is all that I owe him for the Heirs of Dbarn.

       I have bought a most beautiful & interesting work of humor & fun & pictures the  Cyclopedia of humor in three volumes which I will send up for the enjoyment of you Anna & Fannie, but take special care of it.  It contains five or six hundred pictures.  The children & servants will view it if they are allowed to look at it.

       Dr. LeConte did not return this evening.  They are expected tomorrow evening.  I will give your letter to Miss Graham & invite her the last of the month if you wish.

       I have not yet purchased any groceries.  But will do so before leaving.

       Long & Hawthorn & their wives left here this morning without my seeing them.

       I am very anxious to return home.  Nothing was done today with my cases.  Tomorrow one of them is to be argued.  Two will remain for next week.

       I must now conclude.  Col. Dawkins came to me this evening & suggested that I should accept the temporary appointment of U[nited] States Senator till the meeting of the Legislature.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
