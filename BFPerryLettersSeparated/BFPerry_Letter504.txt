Letter 504
6 November 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & I have only time to write you a few lines.

	I go to Laurens court in the morning & am full of business this evening.

       Enclosed I send you a check for ten dollars.  You asked for five.

       I am glad to hear you have no demerits, & are doing well in your studies.

	Anna is getting weaker & we are in great distress about her.  All the rest are well.  Your mother will write you in a few days.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
