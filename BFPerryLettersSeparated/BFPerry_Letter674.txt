Letter 674
2 December 1863
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I returned from the Governors dinner, where I had a very pleasant time, & met Col. Elford who handed me your letter.    I also rece[ive]d one from Col. OHanlon, your uncle  enclosing a draft for $3000, & one from General Easl[e]y about shucks & fodder. Tell Hext Col. OHanlon came up for him today in his carriage & felt greatly disappointed.  Frank McBee did not get a place in the military school.  Tell Vardry to learn to spell, cipher, write & readbut principally spelling.  He must have socks & underclothes.  The others are furnished.  Board & tuition & clothes are $300.  Vardry, Tench Pool,  & someone else were selected from GreenvilleDr. Goates son.  I have received $100 rail road dividend, & will draw my pay as Commissioner about $500 or $600.  Tell your mother her dividend in Planters & Mechanics Bank has been paid.  I suppose Taylor has it with that of Peoples Bank.  I will enquire about it.  I will send Col. OHanlons letter & your uncle.  But I cant find your uncle  letter.  It was only three lines.  [page torn] draft I have in my [ page torn] Book.  Tell Fannie I will do as she directs.  You must feed the cow as muchas she will.

	I have no paper in my room but this half sheet.  It is now eleven oclock & I have just returned from Board of Trustees.  Donaldson goes up in ther morning [&] will carry this letter.  I will perhaps come home Sunday & stay Monday.  The legislature will not adjourn till 18th.  The times are gloomy indeed, & subjugation is beginning to be talked of as possible.  I saw General H Brother Keith H at the Governors.  He said the General telegraphed last night that he was living on cornbread & beef once a day!  He wanted something sent him to eat!  Nothing special with legislature.  Give my love to all.  Vardry will be notified when to come down.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
