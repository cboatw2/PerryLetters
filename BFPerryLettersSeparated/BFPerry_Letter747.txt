Letter 747
26 August 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I felt so much fatigued yesterday that I was not able to ride out to Sans Souci.  After the Judge has charged the Jury & my clients are acquitted, I will ride out early in the evening.  Tomorrow I have to attend a Reference before Moore & will be engaged all day.

	I went to bed last night at 8 oclock & did not go to sleep till 12 oclock.  My two hours speech had done me up.

	Heard nothing of Hext or Willie last night.

	Rufus has quit on your Message but I think he did about as well as any of them will do.  I want the wood cut up & put away for winter.

	No letters or books for you last night.

	Yeargen & Green brought butter & eggs.

	My Brother sent me yesterday morning a plate of Rolls the finest I ever saw.  I wish Lindy could make such.  Your affectionate Husband, B.F. Perry

	Mrs. Hoke has a son.

	Judge Bryan will spend Sunday at Sans Souci.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Sans Souci
