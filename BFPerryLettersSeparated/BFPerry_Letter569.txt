Letter 569
22 January 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I received your Report last week & was much grattified to find you had risen in almost all of your studies.   Your last letter too was grattifying, informing us that you [had] risen to a higher section.  I now feel as if you had commenced improving & was disposed to study harder than you do.  Your pride ought to stimulate you to study.  You have talent enough to make yourself a great man & you have fine looks & a good disposition and good principles.  Nothing wanting but hard study to make you the pride of your family, & the ornament of your country.  How good a boy must feel, to excel his associates, & how mean he must feel, to see others surpassing him in his studies.

	When I was at school I would not for my life let any boy get ahead of me in my studies.  If a boy turned me down in spelling even I would cry heartily.  I now enjoy the advantages of such a spirit.  But for it I should have been nothing but an humble laborer & cultivator of the Earth.

	I shall now expect in every one of your Reports to see you rising a little higher & higher.  We are all well.  I saw Pinckney Irvine today at church.  He has been sick but is now well again.

	I rece[ive]d a letter last week from Col. Ashmore.  He says he is going to write you a letter as soon as he sees your Report.

	We had an Earthquake here the other night.  I felt it very horribly.  It shook considerably in Charleston & Columbia.

	The weather is fine but has been very wet.

	I have nothing more to write you.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
