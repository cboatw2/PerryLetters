Letter 183
28 November 1851
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I recd your letter last night informing me of your purchases & that you might have to draw on me.  I will honor my draft you may make.  Let me know how much money you may wish & I will enclose it to you.  I have lent Col. Brockman two hundred dollars.

	Mr. Latta has been to see me & invited me to dine with him next Sunday in company with Judge Evans.  Mr. Latta enquired after you & your mother.  I saw Judge Cheves yesterday.  He was very kind in his enquiries about your mother, sister & yourself & children.  The Judge looks pretty well but like a hard drinker.

	I met Barnwell Rhett yesterday.  He was very cordial in his meeting & paid me some compliments.  Judge Butler has not yet arrived.  Sam Townes will go up this evening & I may send some package by him.  We are quite friendly & I voted for him.

	You must write me what you wish me to purchase for you & I will do so.  Tell Anna to write what she wishes me to purchase for her.  Also Willie & Frank must write me in the same way.  I will write to them as soon as I have leisure.  But I assure you I have no time to do anything.  Yesterday I was in court pretty much all day.  But you will see an account of the courts & Legislature in my letter to the Patriot.

	I am glad your carpeting has all arrived & will be pleased to see it on my return to see the House looking neat, wife pretty & children hearty & cheerful.

	I must now quit & go to breakfast.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
