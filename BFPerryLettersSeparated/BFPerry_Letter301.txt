Letter 301
Sunday, 1 oclock

	I have just returned from the College Chapel & heard a fine sermon from President Thornwell.  I have just written an account of it for the Patriot.  Willie & Frank went also.  I saw a great many persons from Greenville there, the professors of the Furman University amongst them.  It was the first service in the new chapel.  There was an immense crowd.  The Building is a magnificent one, a sort of Grecian Temple.  The manse was fine.  I saw Miss Brenan in the Gallery, but did not speak to her.  Somehow or other I do not feel the same interest in her, since her intimacy with Alston.  I spoke to Mrs. Lieber & the doctor.  I saw [Richard T.] Brumby & his daughters, but did not have an opportunity of speaking to them.  Tomorrow everybody will be at the Chapel.

	In regard to my opinion {page torn] poor Luther, I have no doubt his God has dealt mercifully with him, & as I said before he was not a bad hearted man.  It is perhaps better for him, & his family that he is gone.  He could have been of little service to them or consolation to them.  I am sure however Susan feels deeply his loss.  Many a tear fell from my eyes whilst reading your letter.  Tell Susan I deeply sympathize with her & hope she will now devote her life to her children. & unite herself in thought & feeling with the family of her husband.  It is her duty & her interest to do so cheerfully and Freely & uncomplaining.  She must be affectionate & kind to them & neither complain of nor resent their supposed neglect of herself.  The McBees are all affectionate & good people in their way.  They are a plain people, & it is Susans duty to be one of them in dress, living & everything else.  They will do a good part by her children.  But if she begins to complain & fret & worry & tease them as she has heretofore done, she will make herself odious to them.  She must be economical & prudent.  If she has grievances she must keep them to herself, & not tell them to her mother, & they will be for [page torn].

	I will now close my letter.  God bless you & the children.  My dinner is ready.  Willie & Frank have dinner before, gone to take a walk with young Butler.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
