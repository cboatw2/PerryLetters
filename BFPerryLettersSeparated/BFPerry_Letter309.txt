Letter 309
11 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just had time to read the longletter you sent me by Mr. Thompson.  It is now ten oclock & I have to write for the Patriot after writing to you.  I have just come back from the committee in the State House.

	Willie & Frank returned today from Col. OHanlons & were very much pleased with their visit.  They wish to stay here till the Governors Inauguration Wednesday so you may look for them Thursday.

	The decrees in Crofts case & Boles case were confirmed today.  Tomorrow I have to argue again the Academies in the Court of Errors.

	General Adams was elected Governor today & they are now serenading him.

	I must now write for the Patriot.  Good nightGod bless you & the children & make you happy as you ought to be.  Yours affectionately. B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
