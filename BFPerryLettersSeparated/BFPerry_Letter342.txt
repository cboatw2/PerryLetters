Letter 342
4 December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from the College& will write you a line.

	Professor McCay has been elected President over Dr. Lieber, eighteen to ten votes.  I am very much grieved & mortified at the result.  Dr. Lieber will now quit the College I expect.  He will be sadly disappointed.

	Anna & Willie are dancing & the room [is] full of ladies.  Sue Hoke is not dancing.  I will go down in a few minutes & tell Anna as she goes off at six in the morning that she must retire.  Sue Hoke speaks of returning Thursday morning.  Willie will stay a day or two in Charleston & return here without going to the Cains.  Gill Watson is here & speaks of going down to Charleston with them.

	I made a speech today on the Judiciary Bill & carried it by seven votes.  If I can push the Electoral Bill through I shall be greatly delighted.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening.  It was very short.

	I must now quit & bid you good night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
