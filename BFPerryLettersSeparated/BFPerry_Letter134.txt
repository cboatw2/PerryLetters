Letter 134
23 October 1849
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have time only to write you a few lines.  It was my intention to have returned home from this place & then to have gone to Bachelors Retreat before Pickens Court.  But yesterday Mr. Burt had me retained in a case in court with a fee of fifty dollars, & directly afterwards Mr. Harrison came to employ me on the other side with himself & General Whitner.

	I shall not now be able to return home till after Pickens court.

	We had quite a strong time in the convention at Abbeville, as well as going & returning.  But the Rail Road has been secured to Greenville and the people of Anderson are very much outraged at it.

	You must tell Reuben to attend to the hogs in the field & feed them as they have eaten up all the peas by this time.  As soon as he has gotten the corn out of the other field, & dug the potatoes & ground nuts, he must turn the hogs in that.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  You must write to me at Pickens by some of the Lawyers.  I am so anxious to return home that I felt indifferent about getting a fee to detain me here.

	Tell the children to learn their lessons & get no more ther from Dr. Laurens.  Yours truly, B.F Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
