Letter 362
8 May 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now near eleven oclock & I will write you a few lines, before going to bed.  I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & strange to say you still write about sending the bundles.  They were sent long since.

	I shall be at home Tuesday evening.  I dislike staying here but circumstances have rendered it.

Necessary.  All day today I was engaged with Barnwell, Memminger and Dawkins on College matters.  We report tomorrow evening.  I spent the day pleasantly.  We called the President of the College & all the Professors before us to give us information.  No doubt McCay did his duty in the riots.  We have expelled Rhett and [John Charles] McClenag[h]an.

	I have bought Willie, Frank & Hext hats $3.00, $6.50 & $1.00Panama and Leghorn hats.  I bought Willie & Anna gloves $3.50 and a Book for Anna which I hope she will read & study.  The Ladys guide to perfect gentility.  It is an admirable book.  I have bought two bottles of the balm of a thousand flowers.  It is good for anything.  I can shave with two drops of it & it makes a fine lather.  It is a good tooth wash &c.  I am now so sleepy that I will finish my letter in the morning.

	I have just dressed & will write you a few additional lines.  I feel better this morning than I have since I have been in Columbia.  Slept well & my system is [in] a better condition.  But I begin to wish to be at home.  I am afraid my business is neglected there.  My clients will wish to see me.  And I wish to see you & the children.  It isa pleasant to go from home occasionally just to have and enjoy the pleasure of returningfor after all there is no place like home.  Someone says in Rogers Table Talk that he pitties the man no matter how great and how rich who has no one to love.  I have my wife & six children to love & provide for & it is my greatest enjoyment & happiness.

	Col. OHanlon dined with me the other day & seemed very cordial but he is a tiresome   egotistical man.  He told me that Mrs.Jones had written him a letter recently wishing to boron $2.500 & pledge the honor of a lady for its return.  The colonel did not answer the letter.    He did not appreciate the security.  But this you must say nothing about.

	I rece[ive]d a Patriot last night through Mr. Wells, but none through the office.  Chancellor Dunkin spoke to me for a copy when I received it.

	I have nothing now to write & must conclude & write to the Patriot.  I suppose I shall not hear from you tonight & Saturday night.  I shall be at Governor Adams--so I shall not hear from you now till Monday morning and Tuesday morning I start home.

	Governor Adams returns this morning & will give me the order for the rifles.  I will immediately have them boxed up & forwarded to Greenville.  Yours affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
