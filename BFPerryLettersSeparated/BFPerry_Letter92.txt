Letter 92
8 December 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I wrote you two letters by last mail & did not then suppose I should have time to write you so soon again.  I have a few moments leisure before breakfast.  I hope to hear from you tonight but shall not have time to write you afterwards.

	Yesterday the Electoral Bill was discussed in the Senate & we had an immense crowd of ladies & gentlemen to hear the debate.  I never saw the Senate chamber so much crowded before.  The ladies actually took the seats of Senators & looked as self possessed as if they had actually been members of our great body.  I was going to speak & therefore could not give up my seat as I was taking notes to reply to Col. DeTreville.  Some fair damsel came in & took a seat beside me which she continued to occupy until I had finished my speech.  I spoke about three quarters of an hour and I believe acquitted myself very well.  Today the discussion is resumed & I shall speak again at one oclock.

	Monday night I went to Dr. Gibbes to meet Gliddon & others.  We sat around the table & ate fruits, nuts, cake, drank wine, talked & spent the evening very pleasantly.  He is quite an interesting man in conversation, but did not have much to say about Egypt.  I suppose he keeps his information on the subject for his lectures.

	At ten oclock I went to the Ball, having been presented with a ticket.  General Adams & myself made arrangements to go together.  The room was a very large one & quite crowded with young ladies from all parts of the state.  They were very tastefully & finely dressed.  The Miss Hamptons in rose colors.  I saw Miss Cornelia Crittenden there & spoke to her.  She is assisting in a school here.  Judge Wardlaws daughter was there.  I saw a young lady there, whom I had seen & known very well fifteen or twenty years since.  I told Black that I knew her as Miss Pride and I wished to know what her name was now.  He told me she was still Miss Pride.  Judge Withers told me she had been in Europe & was quite an accomplished woman.  I did not renew my acquaintance.

	After staying an hour or two at the Ball I came off before supper.  I was much amused in looking on at the different faces, & the dancing & waltzing, which is quite affectionate in the position.

	Major [Nathaniel Ridley] Eaves a senator from Chester returned Monday night from Mexico & took his seat yesterday in the Senate.  There was a great to do & he made a speech.  He tells me that Goodlett & Elias Earle are both quite well in the city of Mexico & that he shook hands with them when he started.

	General [James] Shields & [John A.] Quitman are to be here tonight.

	When I commenced writing I intended discussing about the children & our household, but have not time now.    Dr. Prior has just called with a letter from Mr. Howard on his way to purchase at Greenville.  He seems a fine gentleman.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry
