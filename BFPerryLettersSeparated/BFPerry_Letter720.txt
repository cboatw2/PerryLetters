Letter 720
6 December 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now past midnight & as Dr. Boyce will go up in the morning I will write you a line.

	The Board of Trustees have just adjourned & we have converted the College into a university.  Mr. Barnwell will be elected one of the Professors & chairman of the Faculty.

	I have just seen President Johnsons message & it goes for the South all right.  We are delighted with it.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
