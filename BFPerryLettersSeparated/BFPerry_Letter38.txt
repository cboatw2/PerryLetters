Letter 38
12 May 1846
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I received no letter from you by Sundays mail.  I shall anxiously expect one by the next mail.

	It is more than likely that I may return home next Friday evening.  There is no hope of reaching my cases under two or three weeks.  Young, Whitner, Sullivan, Irby & Orr are now here and we will probably make an arrangement tomorrow to continue all of our cases & go home.  Whitner has his wife with him & Mrs. Mays is to be here tonight.  Harrison is here with his wife.  General Thompson came here yesterday & says Cornelia Crittenden will also be here tonight.  She stopped a day in Orangeburgh & all the Abbeville lawyers came in today & yesterday.

	There weas quite a pleasant party at Col. Prestons Saturday evening.  I met Mrs. Ellet again.  She invited me to her soiree Wednesday evening, but the Board of Trustees met that evening.  [Thomas Jefferson] Withers, Manning & myself have been busy about the college every day.

       The students for admission to the Bar are examined next Wednesday & I Am on the committee again.    Have just prepared my questions.  Fortunately I brought my old ones down with me.  There are some fifteen making application.

       I purchased the works of Hugh [Swinton] Legare & was not a little surprised [to] learn from Col. Wigfall that I was mentioned in them that my name had reached Brussels also!   I have been reading the Work with some interest.  He is very severe on the nullifyers.

       I was at church on Sunday & heard Mr. [James Henley] Thornwell preach a fine sermon.  I saw Chancellor Harper at Col. Prestons.  His health is desperate & [he] cannot live long.  He enquired about Anna & your mother.

       I have bought your knives & a carving knife & forka Ball for Will that will bounce as high as the Houseno hat as yetprice same as in Greenville $1.50 and Panama $3.00.

       I hope you are not much alarmed by the war.    There is great interest felt here to know more about it.  We shall hear in a few days.

       I saw Pringle here on Saturday.  Poinsett will be here tonight.

       Col. Irby brings me news that you have had a great deal of rain in Greenville.  I am afraid my crop is all ruined & the land all washed away.

       In my last letter I said nothing about being anxious to get back home.  You once told me not to write anything more about that.  I will not at present, but only leave you to imagine [page torn] much pleasure it would give me to see you & the children.  The remembrance abroad is always a delightful one.  I forget that the children ever cry, or behave badly.

       I saw at Col. Prestons a beautiful marble bust of Mrs. Preston by [Hiram] Powers.  It is worth looking at & made me ashamed of my plaster of Paris busts.  He has a great many fine paintings.  His library was on shelves in the dining room but not so large as mine.  Nor was his house so neat as our rooms are.

       My darling Liz good night.  If I do not return home by the next stage I will write you.  Kiss the children for me & believe me yours truly, &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
