Letter 538
18 September 1859
Boston

My dear Son

	I received your letter on my arrival at this place, which was handed me by Edw[ard] Stokes, and I was very glad to hear you were all well, & that you were attentive to the office & making progress with your studies.  I would have written you before, but have had but little time & that little leisure I have spent in writing for the Patriot, which letters you will see.

	Edward Stokes went with us to Mount Auburn & has been unwell since.  He wrote me a note yesterday saying that he was sick & desired me to come & see him before leaving.  He stated he was getting better.

	Your mother, Frank & Fannie have engaged themselves very much.  Frank has met several of his fellow students & they seem clever boys.  I have found about twenty dozen of my kinspeople whom I like very much.  Two of them are members of the Legislature.  You will see my letter about Sherborn in the Patriot.

	I was greatly dissatisfied  yesterday by the rain, which prevented me hearing Everett & Felton  on the Inauguration of the Webster Statue.  I rece[ive]d an invitation but could not turn out in the rain.

	We leave here in the morning for Montreal direct & shall not go to Quebec.  We will see Niagara & the Hudson & be at home the first day of October, Saturday.  We have made some pleasant acquaintances & met a good many friends at the different Hotels.

	I hope you will attend to everything at home and issue the cases brought where you know how.  Give my love to all.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
