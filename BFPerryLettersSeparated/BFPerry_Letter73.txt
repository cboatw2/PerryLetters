Letter 73
10 May 1847
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just written Col. Townes a long letter on the prospects of the Rail Road.  The people of Columbia are now very much in favor of it.  Col. Preston made them a speech which has completely revolutionized them.

	I have nothing to write you of interest.  We had a pleasant journey down, Col. Coleman, Mr. McBee, General Thompson & Major Earle.  We feasted high on the road every day at twelve oclock.

	I have not yet had time to purchase Vardrys chair.  I am much pressed with businesshave been appointed to examine law studentshave to argue a case in the Court of Errors tomorrowhave to attend the Rail Road meeting &c &c.  You must therefore value this hasty epistle, written amidst so much hurry.

	I hope you & the children are doing well.  Tell Will I shall expect to find him head of his class.  I will endeavour to bring all the children some little present.  I wish you to write me every mail.  It is a great relief to my mind to hear from you.

	I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr. Webster in Columbia on Thursday.  They are making great preparations to entertain him.  I expect I shall have to attend their Ball.

	It is probable that Mr. Kilgore will be elected President of the Rail Road Company.

	I have seen nothing of Col. Taylor or any of your kin.

	Col. Dawkins & his new wife have gone to Charleston to see Mr. Webster.

	Col. Herndon has given up his dye for his hair & he is now as gray headed as any man you ever saw.

	We have very few lawyers here at this time.

	I suppose Susan is staying with you & I hope you will find her company pleasant & a satisfaction to you in the absence of her husband.

	Kiss the children & believe me your truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
