Letter 672
29 November 1863
Columbia

My dear Liz

	This is Sunday, & I have just returned from church, eaten my dinner, lighted my pipe, & seated myself to write you a letternot yet two oclock.  Hext & Charley Janney have gone off somewhere with Duncan Brooks.

	I went with Wallace Thompson to the Catholic church & heard a very learned Sermon on the Bible.  The Priests object seemed to be to place the church above the Bible.  He said it was all uncertain about the Bible out of the church.  It required [page torn] the church history to understand the Bible--portions were specious, left out & alteredportions not to be comprehended &c.  I thought the discourse was altogether a war upon the truth & authenticity & inspiration of the Bible.

	I saw Miss McEl & the nuns.  I suppose I shall see Simms & his wife here this week.I have been out nowhere.  Governor Pickens has gone & Mrs. Pickens did not meet him here.

	I have written a letter to Col. OHanlon for I wish Hext to pay him a visit.  He is learning nothing & seeing nothing here.  He stays all his time with Janneys son  & Duncan Brooks.  I have had my wallet mended & gave Hext yours this morning.  He is very& pleased with it.  Chancellor Dunkin said he did not recognise Hext in his homespun.  He though [page torn] too aristocrtic to clothe him in homespun.  My hat is very much admired.  Tell Edward I have not yet worn my homespun suit.  The weather is rather cold for it.

	I was in hopes to have heard from you last night.  I wrote to John to send on the corn forthwith.  If Easleys negroes do not send fodder & shucks you will have to send to Perry Duncan.  If you can buy shucks or fodder do soyou wish beef kill the calf when the weather is cold enough.  Feed the cows well on meal &slop.

	I wrote Willie a long letter yesterday.  But I see they have had skirmishes lately.  Sparkes is here & is now Lieutenant in a company in the lower country.  He looks well.  I have heard nothing of your uncle Arthur.  I saw Mr. D Thornwell this morning.    He enquired after your mother & family.

       Col. Ware has been in my room & sat a long time.  But for this I would have written you more.  Tell Fannie I will write her this week.  I have written to Elford to come down this week as our Board will have to revise the prices.  I wish you would go into my office & look in my Paper case to the left of the door as you go in.  The upper part is unlockedsee a box marked Commissions.  In it there are two large packages containing lists of prices in an Envelope.  Get these Envelopes & contents & give them to Elford to bring down with him.  I want the prices to govern us in our revision.  Your affect[ionate] Husband, B.F. Perry
