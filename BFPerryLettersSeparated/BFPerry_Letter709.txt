Letter 709
Sunday morning, 29 October 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Mr. Burt is going up this morning & will carry my letter to Belton.  Your letter by Col. Lubbock was read this morning & I was glad to hear from you.  Sell the Beef as soon as you can, it will grow poor.

	The election of Senator takes place Monday at one oclock, so before you receive this it will be over.  I dont think there is any doubt of my success.  But there is as great deal of manuvering & electioneering.  Some of the Parish members will not vote for me.

	I saw Mrs. LeConte & Lula yesterday.  They are so violent that I was displeased.  I read a letter from Mrs. Keith the most violent I ever read towards the yankees.  She says they may take all of her property before she will take the oath of allegiance or bow to Andy Johnson.  She was very kind in her remembrance of you.  I telegraphed the President for a Pardon for Governor Bonham & General M. Butler & yesterday [and] rece[ive]d a reply that they were pardoned.  I then sent a long telegraph to the President for General Hampton.  The General is a strong administration man.  He told me he was always opposed to the secession & was for maintaining our rights in the union.  He says he shall counsel & advise with me in all matters.

	Tell Mr. Grady the check has come in & if he wishes me I can send it tofor him. Or send it up by the first safe opportunity.  Willie is quite well & was getting on pleasantly.  I have spent my time very pleasantly.  I will send you a paper.  Your affect[ionate] husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I enclose the check./  Hand it to Mr. Grady.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
