Letter 410
25 September 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	I rece[ive]d yours & Mr. Millers letters this evening, & I have written to Col. Orr & Mr. Cobb the Secretary of the Treasury to try & get the Secretary of the Navy to have you reconsidered by a Board of Physicians in Washington.  I hope we may be successful.  But if not you can come home & prepare yourself for some other Profession.  It may all be for the best & so you must not grieve at your misfortune.  It is owing to no fault of yours.  But in the meantime you must study & remain with Mrs. Green till our application to the Secretary of the navy is known.  If you cannot get in the Navy, I suppose you can come home by yourself.  It is impossible now for me to leave here as my courts are coming.  We shall all be glad to see you at home again.  I will forward you a check to defray your expenses.  If you are not admitted I think you had better think of medicine as a Profession & perhaps you will do as well in that line as any other.  Your trip to Annapolis will have improved you & it has been pleasant.

	But I still have hopes for you.  Could you not speak to Captain Blake or get Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller to speak to him to intercede with the Secretary of the Navy & have you reexamined.

	We are all well but Arthur.  He is getting better.  You must give our love to Mrs. Green & Mr. Miller & thank them for all of their kindness to you.

	I will write also myself to the Secretary of the navy & get Col. Pickens to write to the President with whom he is intimate.

	Willie & Anna are well.  We heard from them tonight & they are both pleased with their schools& doing well.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry
