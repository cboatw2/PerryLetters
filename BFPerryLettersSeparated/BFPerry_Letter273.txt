Letter 273
13 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	The House has been in session all day & I have to go back half after six.  The Electoral Bill is under discussion.  I made my speech over an hour long.  There was a great crowd, & it is said I made a good speech.  Col. [William Aiken] Owens replied.  [William Ferguson] Hutson has the floor tonight & perhaps General [Samuel] McGowan may reply.

	Anna & Willie are all well & enjoying themselves very much.  I will now tell you the particulars between Taber & myself.  He wrote me a note.  You will see however the whole correspondence in the Carolinian of today.  The course I pursued has met the approbation of almost everybody.  A great many came up to me in the House & congratulated me this morning on the noble stand I took.  Mr. Petigru, General Bonham, and Col. Dawkins came to my room last night to express their warm & cordial approbation.  Col. Isaac Hayne took a warm interest on my side and approves most heartily my courseso do Col. Jno & Col. William C. Preston.  Dr. [Ozey Robert] Broyles said he should put me in nomination for Governor for my noble stand.  Professor Brumby expressed his hearty approbationSenators [Samuel] McAiley and [Christopher William] Dudley.

	I have sent Willie down to get letters & I hope to hear from you.  Willie says the mail is not yet rece[ive]d at the Box.  I shall have to conclude my letter.

	If anything of interest is in your letter I will add a line.  If the Legislature had accepted ourI should have been at home tonight.  I wish they had.  I long to be at home once more.  This day week we adjourn.  I am very much fatigued tonight.  My sheet is quite wet & I am afraid of taking cold.

	God bless you and the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
