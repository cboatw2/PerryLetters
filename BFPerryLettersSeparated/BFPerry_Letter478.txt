Letter 478
25 April 1856
Greenville

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d your letter this week & were glad to hear you were doing well & had recei[ve]d no demerits this month.  I hope you will now begin to see the necessity of studying hard & being on your best behaviour.

	I have been disappointed in visiting you.  Perhaps I may go on from Columbia to see you the first of May after getting through the Court of appeals.  I go down to Columbia the last of this week.

	We here had a great wedding in the village--Hamlin Beattie to Sallie Cleveland.  I was at the party at Beatties.  It was a very handsome affair.  There was a large collection of the young people & some old ones.

	Pauline Ware was also married to Mr. Arnold last week & they go off to Mississippi immediately.  Col. Ware & his wife were very much opposed to the match.

	Anna is better & rides out every day.  Dr. Earle says she will get well.  She is gaining her strength.

	Arthur is sick todayhas an eruption all over his face & high fever & bad cold.  He is taking medicine & I hope will get better.  The little negro children were affected in the same way & get well in a day or two.

	We have had a great religious revival.  Twenty or thirty are to be baptized today.  Mary Mauldin Betty & Oscar are amongst them.  Georgia Sperman about twelve years old is to be baptized.

	Your mother will write you in a day or two & tell you more particularly the news.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
