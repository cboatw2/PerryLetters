Letter 498
28 September 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We have not heard from you, except through Mr. Miller, since your arrival at Annapolis.  He wrote very flatteringly of you, said you had improved, was spoken of in high terms by the officers of the Preble and that you were not going to study hard & not be so lowdown as you were last term.  You must have pride & ambition to study hard &study all the time.  Now that you have go over your old studies you ought to stand no. 1 in your class.

	You must write me all about your cruise & sea life, what you saw and what you did on board the vessel.  Also write me all about your classmates & the new cadets.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Col. Alexander Taylor enquired about you very particularly last Sunday.  He & his family are here now.  His two youngest sons whom you saw at Cashiers Valley are fine little boys, manly & well behaved.

	We are all well except Anna.  She has fever & is taking blue pill.  Dr. Earle has put a blister on her which gives her great pain.

	I was employed last week to defend a young man only nineteen years old named John Fowler for killing Felix Rodgers below McBees Factory.  He struck him with his gun.  Rodgers was drunk & rushed on him with a rock.

	We have today an Egree gale & the weather is very bad.  You got back in good time.  It would be terrible weather at sea.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
