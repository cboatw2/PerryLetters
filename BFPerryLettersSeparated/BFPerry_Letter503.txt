Letter 503

Greenville

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d a letter from you last night to Anna & were glad to hear you were well & doing well.  But you say you do not like the Seas much.  I am sorry to hear you say so, as your destiny is on them.  I hope you will like them better as you see more of them.

	Anna is still feeble & weak.  She & your mother think of going to Aiken to spend the winter & leave me at home to take care of the children.  But I shall endeavour to go on & see you this winter.

	I saw Col. Orr last week & told him you were going to pay him a visit about Christmas.  He said he would be very glad indeed to see you & enquired a great deal about you.  On his account you must study hard & make rapid progress in your studies.  He enquires about you when he sees anyone in Washington from the naval Academy.

	I shall see your Report in a few days & hope it will be a good one.  Poor George Wells has studied so hard in the Military school in Columbia that he has had to leave on account of his health.  But will return as soon as his health is regained.

	James Moore who was in the Furman University made a speech in defence of John Fowler with me & did very well.  He will one day make a good lawyer & a man of distinction.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
