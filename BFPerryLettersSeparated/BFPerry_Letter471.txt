Letter 471
7 March 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	I start in the morning to Anderson Court & your mother says I must write you.

	We are all well except Anna.  I do not think she is improving & have great fears about her.  I hope, however the warm weather will produce a change for the better.

	The day Willie left here he fell in company with Judge ONeall & the same day the Judge met with a terrible accident on the Spartanburgh Rail Road.  He was thrown off the track & badly injured.  He has lost the use of his legs & will never be able to hold court again.

	Col. Orr has declined being a candidate for Congress.  Col. Ashmore, Col. Irvine Jones and Mr. Vernon of Spartanburgh are candidates.  Col. Ashmore will probably be elected.

	I hope you are studying hard & behaving well.  In the report of the Secretary of the navy I see a list of the cadets who were dismissed last year.  I hope you will not have your name amongst them next year.

	Write us how you are getting on in everything.  Tell us all that happens to you.

	Fannie had some little girls here last night, & amongst them Mary Cleveland, who is a sweet little girl and I believe one of your belles.  She is certainly prettier thanCroft.

	But you must not think of the girls till you are a lieutenant in the navy.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
