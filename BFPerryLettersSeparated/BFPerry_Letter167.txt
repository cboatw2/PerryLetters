Letter 167
8 December 1850
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I was very much gratified last night on receiving your letter & the one from Anna to Willie.  Tell Anna she writes a beautiful letter & I said to Willie she could beat him.  I had no idea she could write so well.  We are blessed my dear wife in our children.  They are very far superior in looks & intellect to most children I meet.  In behaviour I believe they are as good.  At the college commencement I noticed two little boys about Franks size on the platform in front of all the Professors & Trustees behaving very bad.  I thought to myself that if Frank was behaving in that way I should be terrible provoked & mortified.  Willie is a little man every inch of him, & I have never seen his equal.  Fanny is the prettiest & most intellectual child I ever saw.  Tell Anna I shall take great pleasure in hearing her play on the Pianno when I return home.  Willie is now reading by my side & Frank cutting with his knife.  I shall go to church after breakfast & carry Willie & Frank.  Col. Herndon asked me the other morning if I ever whipped my children & said he had occasionally to whip his.

	On Friday I heard the first sermon ever preached in the State House by Whiteford Smith.  It was a noble discourse eloquently delivered full of patriotism & liberty and good sense.  He urged wisdom & prudence in our deliberations & cautioned in strong terms against rashness & precipitation.

	Yesterday Mr. Robert Barnwell sat with me in the House for an hour or two & we exchanged very fully our views & opinions.  He is very much opposed to separate state action & goes for a Southern Congress.  But he thinks disunion will ultimately come when the South is united.  I am confident of the reverse.

	Col. Pickens sat with me some time yesterday also & his views are moderate.  I think he will be elected Governor.  I saw a letter yesterday from Col. Hammond to Senator Gist of Union which denounced in strong terms separate action as folly & disaster.  He said the state would be crushed immediately by secession.  The opinion is that Rhett will beat Hammond for theSenate.

	I had another visit from Dr., Lieber last night.  I wanted him to go into the sitting room & sit with me there amongst all the members.  But he said no.  I wish to talk with you & not the other members.  So we went to my room & had a long chat, a good union talk& I am sure Mrs. Lieber would have been glad to have heard it.  I gave the Dr. when he left me Poinsetts recent letter in the Mercury to take home & read.  These letters of Hamilton & Poinsett annoy the disunionists very much.

	The weather is now cold & I hope you will tomorrow, Monday, have those hogs killed.  They have been wasting my corn.  I am glad to hear that the stock are all doing well & some of them increasing.  Hochee no doubt would be very glad as Anna says for Willie to come home and give him a little variety by a ride to the farm & other places.

	The Debate is still going on in the House on Federal Relations.  But the small guns have been firedthe big ones are kept in reserve for the latter part of the debate.  I shall probably speak about Wednesday.  John Read went off like a bag of wind yesterday & was for war & secession. [William Aiken]
 Owens followed in the same track.  When [William Ferguson] Hutson of Beaufort or Colleton made a pretty war speech, Jones tried to get the floor & finally succeeded for Monday.  My namesake Josiah B. Perry made a pretty good speech & was for secession.  What Jones will be for I know not.

	The committee of Ways and Means appropriated $125,000 yesterday morning to build a navy to fight the U. States.  Memminger & myself voted against it & were the only members of the committee who did.  The military committee are about appropriating $200,000 more to arm the state and fortify the coast.  I told them that this was a matter which the U., States ought to do!  Russel[l] Middleton was for the navy & was steamers.  I told him the U. States could send a half dozen ships as well [as] one to Charleston.  He is on our committee & seems a worthy & intelligent gentleman.

	I will make Willie write after our return from church.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
