Letter 637
24 November 1862
Columbia

My dear Liz

	We reached here safely yesterday & had a pleasant time on the road.  All the members seem to be for me for Speaker.  Dr. Croft was out last night & reported very favorably.

	I met Greenfield & Stairly from the Brooks Troop & they report favorably &.  I send you Willies letter.  Make Greenfield come & see you.  He has a great deal to tell about the Troop & Willie &c.

	As to the election of Governor not much is said about it.  I requested Dr. Croft not to speak of it till the election of speaker was over.  [Aldred Proctor] Aldrich is a candidate for speaker.  He is the only one I have heard of in opposition.

	The news from the army makes it pretty certain that there will be a battle at Fredericksburg.  I heard last night of some very high eulogizingon me by General Martin.

	The weather is changing & I hope Hext &get home.

	I have a veryin one of Mrs. Mrs. LeContes rooms, opposite her drawing room.  Boyce & Croft are next me & I am much pleased with them.

	I shall go down to see Elfords Regiment today.  Fainny sends me down with Dr. Fair to try & get his son in law Leap off from the service.

	There are no members here yet from Charleston & not many from theCounty. Janneys Hotel is about equal to our table every day & yet we pay five dollars per day.

	Greenfield says Willies Greenville uniform is the admiration of everyone in camp & the nicest in the Troop.

	There are very few members in favor of the Council.  It will certainly be abolished.  I hope you & the children will get on well in my absence.  If any of you are sick or unwell you must make..  I am very uneasy about the Throat disease in Greenville.

	Give my love to all & write me whenever you can.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
