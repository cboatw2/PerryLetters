Letter 370
25 November 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written Tuesday and will write you a line before going to the Board of Trustees.  It is now six & I have to be there at seven.  I called at the bar & was told they had rece[ive]d the letters & there were none for me.  I went to the Post office & got no letters.  On my return to the Hotel your letter was handed me.  It had been put in a wrong box.

	I have just been to see Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham at Hunts Hotel.  Mrs. Cunningham had gone to see Howp Gardens & I did not see her.  I saw Mr. Cunningham.  Pamela is in Charleston.  Mr. Cunningham is going to move there entirely & isa a candidate for Bank director.

	I was invited to dine with Governor Adams today, but declined his invitation as Col. Orr was going to dine with us.  You need not give yourself any fears about Franks getting into the money.

	Dr. Lieber paid me a visit this morning, & I hope he will remain in the College a year longer at least.  I spoke to him about Williealso spoke to Professor LeConte.

	There was nothing done in the legislature today.  I must conclude & get a cup of tea & go to College.  Alex McBee & his Bride are here.  I saw Alexander but have not seen his wife.  I congratulated him & he blushed & appeared ashamed.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
