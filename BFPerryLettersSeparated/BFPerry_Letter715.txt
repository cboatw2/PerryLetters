Letter 715
6 November 1865
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am afraid I shall not be able to git off this evening & will therefore write you a line.  I may be up Wednesday or Thursday.  I am very anxious to return home & see you all.  And I wasdisappointed not hearing from you since my election.  I flattered myself that I would receive one of the prettiest & most affectionate letters you had ever writtenthat you would be so much grattified & so happy that your letter would make me happy.  But not a line from you!  But for Mr. Elfords letter I should have been uneasy.  He wrote me you said Thursday morning  that you were all well.  If I had been defeated for the Senate, I am sure you would have written me & given me a stern scolding, instead of consoling me in my misfortunes.

	I am waiting on the Legislature & the President.  The Legislature are about passing some Resolutions which I must attend to and I have telegraphed the President & wait his answer.

	`Mr. Buist came down again last evening & congratulated me most cordially on my electionso handsomely made.  Buist & myself have always been congenial spirits.  He spends most of his time in my room.  If the Provisional governorship is continued I will have him my successor.

	I have nothing new to write you & only write to keep you from being uneasy.  Your loving & affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
