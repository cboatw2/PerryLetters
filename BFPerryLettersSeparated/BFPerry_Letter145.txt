Letter 145
9 December 1849
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just rece[ive]d your letter written on Friday & was glad to hear you were all well.  It seems a long time since I left home & I am extremely anxious to return.

	The stage came in today at three oclock.  Col. Fair, Ware, Irby, Sullivan, Willie and myself went immediately to get some letters.  Col. Ware rece[ive]d three from his wifeCol. Fair none, Irby & Sullivan recd letters, but from whom I know not.  I suppose however from their better halves.

	  I have very little to write you since my last.  Yesterday Col. John Preston made a noble & eloquent speech in defence of the Bank, which I have mentioned in my letter to Wells.  General Adams made a good speech on the other side.

	Col. John Preston invited me to dine with him yesterday, but I could not go.  Willie was unwilling to be separated from me.  And the truth is all my linen was in the wash & I had not a clean shirt to wear.  But I have no disposition to attend any parties.  I like Col. Preston very much.

	Last night I was at the lecture on Geology by Professor Brumby in the House of Representatives.  It was a most learned & able & interesting speech.  I saw Col. W.C. Preston there & his health is better.  He seems very cordial towards me & said he was sorry I was not in Washington.

	I saw Col., Hayne & his wife but did not get to speak to them.  I spoke to E Butler.  Mrs. Hayne looks dowdyish in her dress.  In other words she looks like an Alabama lady.  But she has strong features & I thought rather

	After the lecture Genl Adams insisted on our going to the Catholic Fair but I positively declined & said one night was enough for me.  Today Col. Thos Pickens was giving me an amusing account of Tom Butler & Erwin Jones there last night.  I tell it to you in confidence & you must not speak of it.  Butler took $40.00 in raffles, won a gold watch & presented it to Miss Dangol, a beautiful, bold & impudent young lady, the daughter of a shoe maker, to whom he was very attentive & with whom he seemed desperately in love.  Jones was spending his money most freely in raffles & making presents to a Miss Beard who was equally bold & who lives in this place & was officiating as salesman.

	But I have done wrong in mentioning those things even to you.  But only think of Tom Butler head over heels in debt taking $40.00 in raffles & presenting gold watches to the young ladies!  His wife & children at home, perhaps needing some of the comforts of life.

	I have heard of Anne Williams & am afraid the fact of her coming down here at this time in the capacity of milliner will not add anything to her reputation, however pure her motives may be.

	Today has been a bad day & I did not go to church.  Willie has been reading his Testament. & I have been looking into the Bank question.

	You must send Wells letter to him the night you receive it, as he may wish to commence setting it up.

	Lands have risen very much in Greenville judging from Coxs & Dr. T prices.  The Rail Road can take at a fair value any ones land for depot or right of way.  B.F. Perry
