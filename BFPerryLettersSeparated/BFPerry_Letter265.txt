Letter 265
4 December 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Mr. Allston & his sisters go to Greenville tomorrow for the purpose [of] seeing about their lands & building there.  They intend to live there permanently.  They will build a house this winter.  In the meantime his sisters will board at the Mansion House.  They are in bad health.  I have told Mr. Allston he could have my carriage to ride out with his sisters when he desired it.  You had better go & see them.  He thinks perhaps he may purchase a house already built & asked me if I know of any for sale.  I told him of your mothers house.  He may wish to see it.

	I am truly glad he is going to build or purchase in Greenville.

	 Anna & Willie are quite well & enjoying themselves very much.  They were at the college commencement today.  Anna does not care to go to the Ball.  Very few of the ladies are going from the House.  I will visit you again by mail.  Your affectionate husband &c., B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
