Letter 667
23 September 1863
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I received your letter last evening and was glad to hear Wiley had arrived safely with his horses.  Directly after reading your letter I saw Dr. Rutherford who owns Wileys wife and told him that Wiley would be at his house Wednesday & that he must meet me at Newberry Friday.

	I shall go up Friday & be at home Friday night.  There is nothing likely to be done in the Legislature of importance.  I introduced a Bill this morning to impress provisions for Soldiers families which will pass.

	You have seen an account of the great fight in Georgia.  We are anxiousy waiting for the final battle.  The victory so far is dearly bought.  But of the greatest importance to the Confederacy.

	I met you uncle Arthur this morning who wishes to send up two of Pinckney Alstons daughters under my charge as far as Belton.  They have been staying with him, & go to pay a visit to Alston Hayne.  He says they are twins & beautiful young ladies.

	I am to up today & dine with Mr. Johnson at two oclock.  It is now one oclock.

	Yesterday I had Governor Manning, Speaker Aldridge [Aldrich], & Col. Hayne to take a glass of my whiskey & honey brandy which they enjoyed much.

       The House has taken a recess till five oclock this evening.

       You may send Frank McBee word that I recei[ve]d his letter & bought his Surveying Books, four for ten dollars [page torn] [and] will bring them up with me.

	I will go to see Mrs. LeConte this evening. [Page torn] Boyce is to go here this evening.  Your uncle says he is going to bring the Miss Alstons to the State House tomorrow.

	I did not see Tim .  I saw Henry Cauble who brings down Vest as a substitute.

	Dr. Croft is asnxious abpout his son who was in the late Battle but has not heard from him.  The Butler Guards were in the battle but not heard from.

	I will write you tonight if anything occurs.

	I saw Hollow[ay] yesterday going on to the [page torn] Troop.  He had recovered from his wound.

	Give my love to the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
