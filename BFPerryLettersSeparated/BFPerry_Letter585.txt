Letter 585
24 April 1860
Charleston

My dear Son

	I have only one moment to write you.  I rece[ive]d your letter & your mothers this evening.  Tell F he need not answer the Bill till court.  It is wholly immaterial about the thirty days.

	I am very busy in the Convention &till midnight every night.  Last night I staid on committee about the New York elections till twelve oclock & then left them.  I have been placed on that committee for South Carolina.  Today we elected General [Caleb] Cushing President of the Convention.  It is the most noisy & disgusting assemblage I ever was in & will leave it to be home Friday night I think.  I am very well pleased with Dr. Porcher & his wife.  They are the kindest people I ever saw.  I am very much pleased with the northern members & have made a great many acquaintances.

	Tell your mother I will go & see her aunts if I possibly can.  I will write her tomorrow if I can.  But there is such a hurly burly here that I have no time to write.  I am now writing a letterat five oclock before the committee meets.

	Give my love to all the family.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
