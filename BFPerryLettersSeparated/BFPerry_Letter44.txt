Letter 44
13 July 1846
Washington

My dear Liz

	I wrote you this morning because I may not have an opportunity of writing again for several days.  The great Tariff debate in the Senate commences today & from what I hear will continue several days.  I may detain me in Washington as it will [be] of great interest.  The great men of the Senate will all take a part.

	Yesterday was Sunday & it was so hot that I did not go to church.  I wrote you a letter in the morning.  After breakfast I pulled off my clothes and lay on my bed near a window pretty much till dinner thinking of you & the children.  That I loved you all as much as it was possible for a husband & a father to love his wife & family.  But I never realized the full strength of my love till separated from you in a strange city & no hope of seeing you for weeks to come.  I thought to myself all day yesterday how little I Appreciated whilst at home the value & the pleasure of yours & the childrens company & how much I would value it on my return.

	In the evening I went with General Thompson by appointment to ss Webster.  We found him sitting in his front portico with his coat & waistcoat off.  He looked as plain as any old farmer or country magistrate.  He said to me I have heard of you before.  I told him that I once had the pleasure of receiving a letter from him.  He ordered some claret, whiskey & water.  I & General Thompson drank of the claret & water.  He drank whiskey & water.  He spoke of the Tariff, Mr. Calhoun, Internal Improvement, Oregon, the Mexican War, the character of the American people, Agriculture, England, Stock, Talleyrand, France &c.  I enjoyed the conversation very much and was delighted with his simplicity & greatness.  When I went to start he asked me how long I would remain in the city.  He asked me if he could do anything for me in Boston by way of letter &c.  Said he would send me to a gentleman near where my father was born who would give me more information than I had any conception of in regard to my name & myself.

	From Websters we went to Judge Masons attorney general of the U. States and spent an hour or two very pleasantly with the judge, his wife & children.  Judge Mason is regarded as the purest best man in Washington.  His wife is very ugly but pleasant & agreeable.

	A good many South Carolinians are now here and Judge Butler is to be here today.  I tell you in great confidence which you must not mention that Governor Butler & Col. Mason of the Army are to fight a duel as soon as he arrives in Washington.  This brings Judge Butler here.  I have my information from General Thompson.  But do not let it get out as it would distress his family & friends.  It is an old quarrel & cannot [page torn] made of.

	Major Stark of Hamburgh is here & also Mr. Bryce of Columbia.  They are all going north.  So I shall have company enough.

	Today I must return some calls & visit old John Q. Adams by appointment.

	The weather is alarmingly hot and it is truly distressing.

	Breakfast is ready & I must conclude this letter.  You may not hear from me again before I leave the city.  I shall go to Baltimore & stay a day, thence to Philadelphia, New York, West Point&c.  Give my love to your mother, Susan, Mr. McBee, & Anne.  Kiss the children & accept the openness of my love.  B.F. Perry
