Letter 760
23 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your mother states in her letter this morning that she will leave Aiken tomorrow for Charleston & that you are much better.  You do not know my dear son how much I am gratified at your improvement in health.  This has cheered me for all the results in the elections.

	Blythe has beaten Willie only 17 votes, & the election will be contested.  I think Willie has gone to Abbeville for that purpose.

       Your mother says you wish to hear about the Farm crop &c.  Ben has gathered all the corn 450 Bushels.  Johnson & Simmons & Calvin are gathering things.  We have ours& the shucks put up.  The crib is half full & will be full when we get our rent.  It holds 1000 bushels.  Ben has put up 11 hogs, to fatten & sold one for $5.00.  He went to Col. Ervins sale today to buy me a sou for a breeder.

       The rye sown the second time has come up beautifully.  The oats & wheat look well.  The cows are running in the bottom fields.  The sheep are doing well.  I had the weather [wether] killed for mutton.  Ben killed a shoat the other day for meat.

       Willie has got a nice.  Today Jack & Mallory are ditching, cleaning out the long ditch.   Jimmy cleaned out as far as he cultivates.

       I will make Ben write you and you must write me a line every day or two & let us know how you are doing.  Your affect[ionate] Father, B.F. Perry
