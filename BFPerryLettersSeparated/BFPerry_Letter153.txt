Letter 153
2 April 1850
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

	I rece[ive]d your letter and the papers by Mr. Elford & for which I thank you kindly.  I was very anxious to hear from home.  It seems to me that I have been a long tome from home.  The weather has been bad, business dull, accommodations horrible, & labour considerable.

	The property sold well at the sale & amounted to $639.00!  The cotton will certainly bring $900.00.  This will make the crop raised by ten hands worth $1500.  I have collected a great deal of money for the Estate, but none for myself.  I may, however, receive some yet.

	My horse became quite lame again, & I have swapped her to Wellborn Perry for a blooded horse, which drives finely in a Buggy.  I gave him ten dollars to boot, & I am very much pleased with my trade.    He is a fine horse & well disposed.

	I passed by Mrs. Duboses & she was at church.  I did not see her, nor Lees family.  I did not go by my Brothers, but I saw him and most of his sons at the sale.  They are all well.

	I will send your letters & packages.  I heard a scandalous report on Mrs. Dudaes oldest son & Miss Lee, which has excited a good deal of neighborhood talk, and which may be all scandal & noting more.

	The Judge is working very hard to get off from Pickens, & it is likely I may reach home Wednesday night.  The court sat tonight till after nine oclock.

	The convention excites a good deal of talk, & my name is spoken of amongst those from whom a selection is to be made.

	It is now late in the night and I must bid you good night.  Yours truly & sincerely, B.F. Perry.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
