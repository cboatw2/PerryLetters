Letter 312
12 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	 Willie & Frank have just finished packing up & gone to bed.  The Legislature has just adjourned & it is ten oclock.

	I send you two dollars worth of candy which Coil. OHanlon gave the money to Willie to purchase & he lost one dollar of it.  There is a great variety of candies.  I also send Fannie a box 1.00 & a ring 1.50 as she is not going from home & Anna is.  I also send Hext a gold watch, made out of India rubber, price 62 ? cts.  Buy a ribbon & let him wear it.

	Tonight I met your uncle Col. Hayne in the streets.  I said to Willie that gentleman looks like Col. Arthur Hayne.  He turned round to follow after us.    He is to be here several days.  He says all are well in Charleston.

	The Legislature will adjourn next Thursday 21st December.  If Anna has no good opportunity of coming down I had just as leave return home, & go back with her to Charleston.  If I were to go home first, I should enjoy my trip to Charleston much more, & would stay longer.

	The Greenville academies was decided tonight allowing the trustees to make the transfer of the Academy lands on the terms we proposed.  But the Court would not permit the two corporations to be united.  But everything is gained that I petitioned for in the first instance.  [George F.] Townes deserves the universal execration of the whole community & ought not to be countenanced by the Baptists for he has greatly bedevilled them.

	Governor Adams was inaugurated today & gave me a most cordial invitation to go & see his wife & daughters.  He seems a good friend personally & I believe he is sincerely so.  He has always been kind to me & he put me in nomination years ago for President of the Bank.

	I have been engaged in Court all day & shall be tomorrow morning.

	The Blue Ridge Rail Road comes up tomorrow & I have to speak firstTrenholm & Memminger follow.

	I must now stop.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
