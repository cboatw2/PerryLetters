Letter 426
15 November 1857
Greenville

My dear Son

	Your letter of the 8th Inst. Was received Friday evening.  This is Sunday, and I will write to you, Willie & Anna, instead of going to church with your mother & Fannie.  Next Sunday I shall be in Columbia.  I go down on Saturday.

	Your letters, my dear Son, are a great comfort to me & your mother.  You are satisfied with your school & take everything like a little man, instead of complaining & trying to find something to be dissatisfied with.  But you must try and avoid demerits.  You ought ever to be on your guard against them.  You might have avoided those you have.  It was very thoughtless in you to prompt.

	In writing your letters you must not blot or blur them.  This makes them look as if they were written carelessly & not as a particular military young gentleman should write.  Your mother sent one or two of your letter to Mr. McBee & Mrs. Butler to read.  They were very much pleased with them & praised you a great deal.  You must therefore be particular in writing.

	I hope you will become acquainted with young Rodgers & tell him you are some akin to him & know his aunt Mrs. Butler very well.  I know his mother who was a daughter of CommodorePerrys.  I know his aunt Mrs. Commodore Rodgers & his cousin Mrs. Lizzie Smith very well.

	You must write & tell me when you receive any demerits & what they are for.  Remember if you receive a certain number of demerits you are dismissed from the Academy.  This would be a great shame & disgrace on you.

	You must be sure & study your lessons well & not be idle.  Let me know if you still keep in section no. 2 or whether you have risen higher.  Do not fall into a lower section.

	I am glad to hear you are growing fat & fatter.  This shows hot only that you are in good health, but that a naval school & all its hardship & trouble & study agree with you.

	Mrs. Butler is very anxious to send Tom to the naval school & says she will try & get Lanes place for him of General Bonham.  Henry Thompson told me the other day that he would very much [try] to get his son in the school in a year or two.  Mrs. Williams is trying to get a situation for Campbell in the military school in Columbia.  George Wells & Mr. Dyers son are both applicants for situations in the military school in Columbia.  And Mrs. Speers wishes to put her son there.

	We are all well.  Your mother has just sent me word that I must go with her to church this morning.  I will do so.  The children & servants & your grandmothers family are all well.  Hext is going to school to Miss Powell.  Hayne is sitting by me now in my office & says tell you he loves you & wants to see you very much.  Arthur is doing well.  Fannie has holiday now & practices a good deal  on the Piano.  The carpets have come & are put down & look very pretty.  Your affectionate father, B.F. Perry

Direct your next letter to me in Columbia.
