Letter 258
16 November 1853
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I will write you a few lines before setting off for Charleston.  I have been so much engaged here that I have not had time to write you.  I have written two letters for the Patriot & will write another this evening., all of which will go in the same mail.  Willie wrote you yesterday whilst I was at the College.  He & Anna went to Mrs. Taylors yesterday & Mrs. Taylor is to send for Anna to dine with her today.  There is no one at Taylors but his wife.

	You will see my letters to the Patriot & I will noy repeat what they contain.  We had a pleasant trip down.  Mrs. Jenkins, Mary & Matilda Croft came down with us & Anna spent most of the time with them.  Col., Perrin & his daughter came also from Abbeville.  Anna was put in a room with Miss Perrin.  She has now returned & Anna is rooming with the  They all seem glad to see her.  I took tea last night with Professor Brumby & saw his wife & daughters.  The whole Board of Trustees took tea there after adjournment in College.  Mrs. Brumby enquired very kindly after you & especially your mother.  She asked me if Mrs. McCall was much broke in appearance.  I replied that I thought not that she look[s] exceedingly well for a lady of her age.  She asked if she looked as well as Mrs. W  Hayne.  I told her a great deal better & much younger.  She replied Mrs. Hayne was the younger which I knew.

	I went out shopping this morning & bought a waist coat & cloak for Willie five dollars-- a pair of pants & suspenders for myself ten dollarsa pair of boots for Willie & cap $7.50a hat & pair of boots for myself $14.00.  This is all.  Willie has lost my diamond breast pin.

	I saw Mr. Brown in his studio this morning.  He seemed delighted when I told him General Thompson & others said your likeness was perfect & better than mine.  He told me what he had promised you & I replied that you were still disposed to adhere to his promise.  Mrs. Brown has been unwell with a cold but I saw her this morning.

	Willie & Anna are both behaving remarkably well & much noticed.  I have introduced Willie to most of the Professors in College.  I had a long talk this morning with Dr. Lieber.  I also met Dr. Thornwell & had quite a chat with him.

	Mr. Brown directed me to Youngs jewelry store where there weas a perfect music box.  The price is $75.00 & it plays almost equal to a piano.  I saw another which played twelve tunes for fifty dollars.  But I did not purchase either of them.  At some future day in New York I will purchase one for you.  I have had my cane nicely mended, 75 cts & new crystal in my watch & Willies.  I have exchanged my prayer book & got one with a gold clasp a late fashion of binding.

	I carried Anna out with me this morning shopping.  She is now with the& Will is reading Dr. Liebers book on Civil Liberty in the room where I am writing.

	I hope you & the children are all well.  My sore on the eye has disappeared.  God bless you.  Kiss Hext & tell Frank & Fanny to be good children &c.  B.F. Perry
