Letter 663
19 July 1863
Martinsburg, Va.

Dear Pa

	I wrote you the foregoing letter a week ago and have had no chance to send it and so will write you a few lines more today.  I was mistaken in my prophesiesbut it was owing to the yanks not wanting to fight for Gen. Lee offered them battle for two days, and on the third night our army crossed the Potomac again and here we are again in old Virginia.  I dont know what we are going to do.  Some think we are going back to the Rappahanock but at present we are picketing around this place.  Day before yesterday the yankees ran in our Pickets and took 11 men from Capt. McFies & Chasnuts  Companies.  I hear this morning that they are fighting at Charleston, and we heard several days ago that Vicksburg was taken, but some dont believe it yet.

	I am quite well  and so is Wiley.  Gen. Stuart with part of the cavalry drove the Yankee Cavalry across the river at Sheperdstown.  There are still some of them in front of us, but I dont think they are across the river in much force.  I have no news to write you.  The men who went home for horses are expected here today.  We have had a great deal of wet weather here lately, but we have got so used to rain that we dont mind it.  I have no time to write hardly.  All the Company are well.

	Give my love to all and write to me often.  I have not got but two letters in the past month; the mails are very irregular.  Your Aff[ectionate] Son, W.H. Perry
