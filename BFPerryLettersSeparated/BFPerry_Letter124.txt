Letter 124
Thursday night, [1848]
Pickens C.H.

My dear Liz

       I rece[ive]d your letter by Col. Townes & the others sent me.  He was not able to bring the newspapers.  I thank you kindly for your letter as it gives me considerable pleasure to hear from my wife & children when from home.

       I came to Pendleton Tuesday morning about eleven oclock.  There I met a crowd of gentlemen waiting for the mail.  They recd me most cordially & all of them came to the tavern to see me.  I sat & conversed with them about two hours & I think we were mutually pleased with each other.  Dr. Symons, Maxwell, Seaborn, , Sloan, Taylor, Lewis, Col. McCord, Maverick Starke &c &c.  Col. McCord gave me a most pressing invitation to go down & see him & offered to meet me at Pendleton on my return with his carriage & carry me down to his House.  Burt says I must come over & stay there three or four days & bring you with me for an excuse, & that I can do good business in the way of electioneering.  He counted about thirty votes for me in the village of Pendleton out of seventy.  He told me afterwards that two or three had said they were for me whom he did not count.

	I rode out to see Mrs. Mays but she had gone down to Anderson.  I took tea with Mr. Sharp, his wife & sister.  Mrs. Sharp looks very bad, & I am afraid she is rapidly passing to her grave.  They will be in Greenville next week on their way to North Carolina to see some of Mr. Sharps relations & restore her health.  They desired me to inform your mother.  I invited them to stay a day or two with [us] & come to our house.

       I came up to Pickens Wednesday & came through a verybut they were all absent.  In Pickens Village my vote has increased from a bare majority to two thirds since last winter.  Everything is going on well.  The Burnl[e]y & Johnson debt has done me good service.  Col. Orr is the only democrat who goes for Taylor.  They are all pleased with my course on the Presidential election.  John Sloan who has been bitterly opposed to me, told Burt if Orr went for Taylor he should vote for me.  The Col. Has committed a great mistake in committing himself so soon.

       We have been all day trying a case in court, & it will take all of tomorrow & perhaps not finish it.  I shall probably not be at home before Sunday.  The weather is dreadfully hot.

       I intend paying a visit with you to Pendleton this summer.  We can spend a few days there most pleasantly.  I saw Col. Bee who enquired after you all.

       Joseph Powell is here, & told Miles Norton that he intended to vote for methat Col Orr would not get 300 votes in Greenvillethat I had always mistaken his character &c.

       Kiss the children for me.  Yours in great haste & true affection, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
