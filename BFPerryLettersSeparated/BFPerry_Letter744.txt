Letter 744
24 April 1870
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I was all day yesterday in the trial of Taylor & Herrick & I am afraid we will not get through today.  Ponder was discharged.  I dont expect to go out to Sans Souci this evening.

	The mail brought nothing for you & no news of any importance.  I am very lonely, but getting on pretty well.  The Servants are doing well.

	George ought to be willing to give ten stalks of corn to keep the freshet from ruining his crop.

	Let Mr. [Thomas Stephen] Powell get through with his painting.  Dont make him do too much.  The house is whitewashed outside & it is not in good taste to have much painting inside.

	I wish the water breaks in the field finished, & dont take Simmons from that to do anything else.

	I am glad Hayne had the good sense to decline going to the mountains.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Sans Souci
