Letter 692
18 December 1864
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I am sorry I disappointed you in saying that I would be at home Saturday night.  Col Ware & Mr. Boyce were to have gone with me & they concluded that the business of the two Houses would not permit them to go.  This induced me to consider that there were important matters which would come up in my absence, & which I wished to discuss.  Moreover I went to Dr. LeContes Friday night & there met Mr. & Mrs. Johnson & Fannie.  We had a fine supper & I ate heartily of some sweet things  which has disagreed with me.  I came so late & Col. Ware came into my room  & sat a long time.  Then I sat down to write a letter toMr. Barnwell about the appointment of district Judge.  This made me reflect about the propriety of trhe appointment if tendered to me.  I thought of you & the children & povertyall of us trying to live on three thousand dollars.  I could not go to sleep till the clock struck three!  I did not wake up in the morning till just before the cars left.  Feeling ratherI woke up.  I thought it best to remain in bed & rest mysystem instead of riding three hundred miles & wasting three days to spend one at home.  It was a sore trial to me for I longed to see you once more & be with you & the children again.

       Yesterday morning General [William Edward] Martin came to me in the State House.& said Fannie was going to dine with him & wished me to meet her there.  At four oclock I went up to his House & Fannie was greatly surprised to see me.  She thought I had gone home.  We had a fine dinner & I spent the evening very pleasantly.  I walked home with Fannie Mr. H & Miss Maggie.  I came back to the Hotel, got a cup of coffee & went down to our night session at seven oclock & remained there till eleven oclockI came home & went to bed, slept soundly & feel quite well this morning.  Janney had Boyce & myself wake up early to take breakfast with him & I have just returned from the breakfast table to write you a long letter.
 ouses

	I recd a letter from Col. Elford last night stating that he would be here Monday evening to meet the Commissioners.  He informed me Col. [John Durant] Ashmore has employed me & himself to defend him for killing that poor fellow Pinson.  He says he has been down to see Ashmore & that he was suffering terrible both mentally & physically.

	Last night after ten oclock the Exemption Bill came up exempting the members & various officers & persons from conscription.  Told [we] had just received a telegram informing us the Fall of Savannah.  I got up & said it was a remarkable coincidence that we had just received in telegram of the capture of Savannah, & the crossing over of a portion of Shermans forces into South Carolina, whilst we were then, at that late hour of the night trying to exempt ourselves & our friends & various other persons from being called out to meet the invading foe!  It produced a furious sensation in the House & many of the members came ro me & said they had never heard remarks more appropriate.  The Bill was postponed till Monday.  I despair of the country.  Yhere is so much of cowardly selfish feeling pervading all classes that we do not deserve success.

	It is said Savannah has fallen but I see nothing of it in the papers this morning.  The city was invested some days since by Sherman and the people suffering for the want of food.  I have no doubt it will fall if it has not already fallen.  The enemy will soon be marching on Charleston & extending their raids throughout the lower country.  You may have the consolation of knowing that Greenville is the safest place in the State.  It will hardly ever be reached by the enemy.

	Mrs. Johnson had called at Holbecks to Fannie just before I got there with her.  She will go with Mrs. Johnson to thetomorrow  & I have promised them our seats on the floor.  There will be a grand display.  I should have missed it all by going home.  Fannie will come to the Hotel Tuesday morning & remain with Ellen Janney till I go up Thursday.  She will then stay with Tilla Croft & spend the Christmas.

	A large majority of the membersmy appointment for district Judgeall except those whoCol. .  Many of them came to me & expressed a regret that they had not sooner heard of my applicationGovernor Manning among them.  If I secure the appointment I shall be sorry for it & do not know that I will accept it.  I was gratified to know that so large a majority of the Senators as well as members of the House had recommended me for the appointment of district Judge.  Boyce told me there were but four members who declined to sign it who had already signed one for Col. M.  Two of them said they never signed any petition, & one of the other two was C[harles] P[inckney] Sullivan of Laurens.

	Mrs. Martin seems feeble & had toafter dinner.  Miss Salie is not pretty, nor is the younger sister,  Her son has gone to Savannah as captain of the foreigners & was safe yesterday.  I have heard nothing further from Willie.  Your uncle Hayne was in the House the other day looking very well & full of talk as usual.  I see Col. Isaac Hayne every day. but I have not seen or heard from Col. Taylor.

	I shall not go to Church this morning.  Boyce & myself have promised to dine with Janney at half past twelve.  He says he is going to have a good dinner, turkey &c. &c.  I wish now I was at home to spend the day with you, & talk over all the incidents I have to tell you.  But instead of talking I am writing to you & can imagine you present.  Fannie goes with Mrs. Herbemont from church this morning & takes tea with her.  I suppose however she will write you and tell you everything about her self.

	When I told Mr. Johnson the other night at Dr. LeContes that I was going home, he said I must bring you down with me.  Governor Magrath is to be at Janneys this evening & has taken a suit of rooms.  He occupies my bed room & I have taken one next to it.  Mine was opposite his Parlor & I consented to give it up.  He takes my room, & I may, perhaps, take his seat in the Senate.

	I am glad to hear you are getting on well.  You have plenty of corn & meat & I hope Charles will bring the flour.  Elford writes me that corn is $15.00 per bushel & flour $250  per barrel & pork $2.70 per pound.  Swap off your spun yarn for corn & pork.  I hope to get money enough here to pay my Bill & all my debts at home when I get there.

       Now my dear wife I have written you a long letter like a good husband as you know I am.  I think we were both very fortunate in getting loving & affectionate companions.  Very few persons have been more fortunate than you & I in marrying.  Do not you think so?  I wrote Mrs. Cunningham the other day & sent her the printed note about her card Factory.  I did not succeed [word obscured] hercome very near it & sent her the proceedings on my motion.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

P.S. I am afraid this long letter will tire out your patience in reading this.  B.F.P.

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
