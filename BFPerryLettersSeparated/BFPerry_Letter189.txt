Letter 189
21 June 1852
Anderson C.H.

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a line.  And I have very little to write.

	My horse did very well, never drove one which was more gentle.  He is gentler than Caleem.  Willie can drive him any where.  I am very much pleased with him.

	As I came on Overtook Col. Townes & John Jones & even stopped on the road side & ate our dinner very pleasantly & they both drank of my wine & brandy.

	I have been here all day without reaching my cases.  We will only be able to try Paris case.  The other will have to be postponed.

	I have met Chancellor Dunkin who enquired after you very kindly & seems very pleasant.  He asked for the Southern Patriot this morning & said he had not seen it since he left Charleston.

	Mr. Burt, Young, Perrin, McGowan, Sullivan are all here.  It is probable I shall not leave till Wednesday evening & stay at old Pendleton.

	I shall be glad to hear from you at Pickens.  But I am afraid no one is going from Greenville.  Yours truly & affectionately, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
