Letter 757
22 October 1872
Greenville

My dear Liz

	I was very much disappointed in not hearing from you last night.  I am anxious about Hayne & wish to hear as often as you can write.  When I do not hear I am afraid he is not so well.  I have not seen Fannie today.  She may have heard from you.  Susan told me she had not.

	In regard to the election I have only to say that Willie was beaten 107 votes by the patriotic people not turning out in Abbeville.  They acted shamefully.  Willie rece[ive]d 717 majority in Oconee, 330 in Pickens, 450 in Anderson & 182 in Greenville.  But Blythe rece[ive]d 1800 majority of negro votes in Abbeville.  Willie thinks of contesting the election.  At one box in Abbeville Blythe rece[ive]d 250 votes where there were no managers.  150 North Carolina rail road negroes voted in Pickens who were not entitled to vote.

	I expect Wallace has beaten me.  I got a majority of 1150 votes in Spartanburg, 650 in Oconee, 400 in Pickens, 461 in Greenville & 250 in Union.  But his vote in York, Chester, Fairfield & Laurens overcomes my majorities by two or three hundred votes.  But great frauds were practiced in Laurens & two hundred fifty Democratic votes were thrown out because they were on two pieces of paper.

	I rece[ive]d a letter this morning congratulating me on my election.  He said all the papers in Philadelphia announced my election.  He wants more money & I have sent him a draft for $100.

	If Hayne is able to do without you, I think you had better return home as I want to see you very much & the expense of staying there is very considerable.  Your aunt Mathews has been here three times to see Willie about money.  She says she is pennyless.  Willie gave her $20 yesterday & she came for $60 today.

	Ben is hoeing well at the Farm.  He bought a coat & pants for $10, went to church & looked very nice.  He has hauled all the corn & will finish shucking today.  Tell Hayne the corn turns out well.  We shall make & git from tenants more than 1000 bushels.  I rece[ive]d $250 yesterday in peas &which came in good time.

	We killed a mutton last week & a pig today & I shall have to buy some bacon for the servants.

	I beg you, & pray that you will take the result of the election calmly.  I do not wish to go to Congress.  My health forbids me.  Willie is able to live without the solicitors office.  He has & will receive from his aunts a large property.  To be beaten by negroes is no reflection on him.  He rece[ive]d large majorities in all the white counties.  Indeed he rece[ive]d the entire white vote of all the counties except the infamous scalawags.  I am as well satisfied as if we had both been elected.  I am going to publish an address to the Democratic voters of this Congressional district & tell them the only way to control the negroes is to make them vote with us or not employ them.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry
