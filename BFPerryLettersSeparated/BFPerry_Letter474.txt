Letter 474
4 April 1858
Greenville

My dear Son

	We recei[ve]d your letter last evening & were glad to hear you were now doing very well.  I do hope you will study hard, my son, and keep up with your class.  Do not idle over your books one moment.  Get your lesson over & over again.  We shall soon receive your Report for march.  I hope it will be better.  Let every Report, sent me, show that you are rising, & standing better in your studies.  Each one should be a little better than the previous one.

	I am trying to make my arrangements so as to go & see you in the course of two weeks.  I hope to be able to do so & get back to the court of appeals the first Monday in May.

	Anna is better, but still in bed & very weak.  She takes a great deal of medicine &requires a great
Deal of nursing.  Her mother has not been out even to church for several weeks.  All the rest are well.

	I have no news to tell you except that the students in the South Carolina College, in the military schools in Columbia & Charleston, at Yorkville & in Newberry Academy have had rebellions.  The schools here are going on very well.  The Village is quiet.  There is a revival in the Methodist church.  Wileys wife came to see him yesterday & she is almost white.

	Let us hear from you about your new roommate.  Do you continue to like him so well as you did.  How do you two get on together.  Waddy Williams has returned like a bad penny to his mother.  You mother says you must not be like a bad penny & return [to] us.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
