Letter 526
22 April 1859
Greenville

Dear Sir [Charles Lanman]

	I have looked over portions of your Congressional Dictionary with some interest & ask leave to suggest one or two corrections.  I see you ask for such information.

	There were two William Butlers on Congress from South Carolinaone the Father & the other the brother of Judge Andrew P. Butler our late Senator.  You have jumbled them together.  General William Butler the father was a gallant Revolutionary officer, and served in Congress many years.  He was turned out of Congress by John C. Calhoun in 1811, he was before that turned out by Robert Goodloe Harper.

	Dr. William Butler the son of the General & brother of Senator Butler was in Congress in 1842.  He graduated at the South Carolina College in 1810 & married a sister of Commodore Oliver H. Perry.  For some time he was a surgeon in the U[nited] States Navy.

	In reference to William Smith you have again put two men together, both of whom were men of great ability.  William Smith of Charleston was in Congress immediately after the organization of the federal Government & took a very active part in all the debates.  He continued in Congress for a number of years.  He afterwards changed his name to William Lawton [Loughton] Smith, & was in Congress afterwards for several years.  He was beaten by Langdon Cheves.

	Judge William Smith was in the Senate, but never in the House.  He moved to Alabama, was appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States but declined the office.  There was another William Smith in Congress from the upper part of South Carolina about 1800 whom you do not mention.

	In speaking of Andrew Pickens you have again united Son & Father.  General Andrew Pickens who was in Congress in 1795 was never Governor of South Carolina.  His Son Andrew Pickens, the Father of the present Russian Minister Col. F.W. Pickens was Governor of South Carolina about 1818.

	I am with great respect yours &c., B.F. Perry
