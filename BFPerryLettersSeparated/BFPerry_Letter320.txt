Letter 320
26 December 1854
Greenville

Mrs. [John] Pettit. My dear Madam

	Your very acceptable letter was received by me, whilst attending the sitting of our Legislature in Columbia.  Mrs. Perry was kind enough to enclose it to me.

	You must excuse the liberty I take in publishing it.  Several of the Senators & representatives to whom I showed the letter said it was it was too good not to be published.

	I have just enclosed to you a Poem by Col. [William John] Grayson of South Carolina, long a member of Congress, & recently a good Union manThe hireling and the Slave.  I hope you will accept it, as a memento of my regard for you, & your political principles.  It has high merit in South Carolina, & is just published.  It comes from your own sunny South & dear old Carolina.

	I sincerely regret the loss of Mr. Pettit in the United States Senate.  My friend Judge Butler spoke in very high terms of him last Summer to me.  It would have given Mrs. Perry & myself great pleasure to have seen you and Mr. Pettit in Greenville.  I have ordered the Southern Patriot to be sent to you.  I scribble for it as Editor, but my Professional vocations as a lawyer are so arduous that I cannot pay the attention to it that I desire.

	   I will write you again shortly.  Mrs. Perry unites with me in regards to you & Mr. Pettit.  Yours &c., B.F. Perry
