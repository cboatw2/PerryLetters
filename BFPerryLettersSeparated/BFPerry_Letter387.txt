Letter 387
19 December 1856
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I send you a letter to the Patriot & have not time to write you more than a line or two.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night, but I dined with Col. Hampton & had not time to write.

	You must not erase my editorials.  If you do I must quit sending them to you.

	It is possible that I may get home Saturday night.  [William Adolphus] Mooney & [John Wickliffe] Stokes go up this morning.  The business will all be finished today.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
