Letter 453
16 December 1857
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Enclosed I send you a letter from Mr. Perdicaris which explains all you have been wishing to know.  It is the latest intelligence which I have had from Anna by ten days.

	I rece[ive]d your letter this evening & Franks Report.  It is pretty well.  He stands about midway in his class which does very well considering all the boys are older,

	I rece[ive]d a letter today inviting me to the anniversary dinner of the New England Society in Charleston on the 22nd but I cannot attend.

	I have just left the House of Representatives & feel sleepy so you will have to put up with a short letter.  The letter to the Patriot will answer instead a letter to you.

	I bought Luther a very pretty cap for one dollar today.

	The election of Trustees takes place tomorrow.  General McGowan chairman of the committee to nominate says there will be no difficulty to mine & Memmingers nomination & election.

	Elford goes up in the morning & will carry my letters.

	Mr. William Lyles of Fairfield presented me with a new book The Calhoun Tribute today in the Bookstore as a memorial of his friendship although differing so widely in politics.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
