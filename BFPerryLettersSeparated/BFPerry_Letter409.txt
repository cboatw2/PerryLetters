Letter 409
21 September 1857
Greenville

My dear Daughter

I have just returned from Columbia & found all well except little Arthur who is getting better I hope.  But he is still very feeble.

	We restored all the old Professors in the College except President McCay who did not desire to go back.  No President was elected.

	Your last letter to your mother I have not seen.  But was glad to hear you were better satisfied with the school.  I have written to Bishop Doone to let you go & spend some days with the Pedicaris during vacation.

	I saw Col. Memminger yesterday & he told me all about Willie & his sons.  They are all doing well at Harvard, but I have rece[ive]d only one letter from Willie.

	Your mother has written you all the news.  Yesterday Mr. Westfield lost his little son, & Willie Long has returned from the Asylum quite restored.

	The schools here are doing well.  I suppose you saw Susan Hoke as she went on.  I was in hope Miss Caldwell would stop at Burlington to go to school.

       The Governor was here yet with is family.  Greenville has been quite gay this summer & we have had a great deal of company here.

         This morning a letter was sent from the Post office for you directed to Burlington.  It had no post stamp on it & we put one on it & forwarded it to you.  I suppose it was from some little girl who forgot about the stamp.

       This is Sunday & I am in great haste.  I will write you a longer letter the next time.    Your grand Mother & Aunt Susan are all well.

       Fannie rides your Pony occasionally.  He looks very well & we take special care of him.  Your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
