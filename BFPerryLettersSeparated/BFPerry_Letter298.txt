Letter 298
30 November 1854
Greenville [Columbia]

My dear Liz

	I have just recd a letter from you & one from Willie & thank you for them.  Willies I ought to have recd last night.

	I did not write you last night because it was about eleven oclock when I returned from the Board of Trustees.  Dr. Thornwell has resigned as President of the College.  Who will be his successor is doubtful.

	Today I have been mostly in the Federal court listening to [James Louis] Petigru & Dr. Tre  argue a case originating in secession & abolition excitement.  I have written an account of it for the Patriot.

	I heard of the death of Luther McBee yesterday evening & I ft over your letter tonight in reading portions of it to Col. Brockman.  I am sorry for him.  He was foolish, but not a bad hearted man & I never have had but one opinion in regard to him with & to Susan.  She was too sensitive & not disposed to bear & concede his faults as a good wife or husband should be towards their other half.  This intercoursehappiness as well as his.  In married life we never can give unhappiness to each other without participating in it ourself.  It is like the poisoned cholic which returns to [word obscured]which prevented it.

	I enclose you a pardon for poor Pittman.  Send it at once to him, & when he can give security to keep the peace he can come out & leave the state.  I am afraid the poor fellow is crazy.

       Wells has just brought me my briefs & says he will pay some attention to Willie & Frank that they need not attempt to go from one car to the other or get out of the cars or stand on the platform.  Let them keep their seats & keep their heads in the cars.  Pickens Butler lost his hat this evening as he came down, & had to come in town bareheaded.

       	I must now conclude by giving my love to you & all the children.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
