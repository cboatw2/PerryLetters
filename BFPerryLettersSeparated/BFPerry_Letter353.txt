Letter 353
[19] December 1855
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have scarcely time to say I am well as you requested me simply to say when I have not time to write you.  Yesterday I dined with the Charleston mess & had a pleasant evening with Count Chais, Col. Campbell Wilson & others.  The House did not adjourn till near midnight last night & I have slept rather late this morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter last night which was gratifying to my feelings as a husband & lover of my wife.

	Yesterday I had the pleasure of seeing my Bill giving the election of Electors to the people pass by one vote.  All the other Bills on the subject were defeated, & we spent the whole day in voting.

	I will write you a long letter Sunday and have a great deal to say.  But it is thought that the Legislature cannot adjourn on the 19th.  I do not suppose I can leave here till the adjournment.  But I am very anxious to be at home once more.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
