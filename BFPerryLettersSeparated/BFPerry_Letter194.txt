Letter 194
27 November 1852
Columbia

My dear Liz

	Mr. Keith goes up in the morning & offers to take my letters.

	I went to the Episcopal Church today & heard a good sermon from Mr. [Peter] Shand.  Anna went to the Roman Catholic with Janneys little daughter.  She was greatly pleased with the ceremonies.  I did not see Mrs. Taylor in church.  I saw but did not speak to Col Taylor.  I went with Mr. Petigru & Col. Alston & sat very much in front of him, but he went out of the House & I did not see him again.

	Trimmier of Spartanburgh & his wife & sister in law are at the House, & going to Charleston Tuesday next.  Mrs. Trimmier who seems awoman just married said she would take charge of Anna inher to Town [Charleston].  I think I shall send her down in that way.  She is enjoying herself very much.

	This morning after breakfast I found you Friday letter on the center table.  I was truly glad to hear from you and felt sorry when I thought you would not probably hear from me before this morning.

	I was sorry to hear John was sick & hope he is out by this time.  I was glad to hear of the return of our stock & that you were in beef by the return.

 	The Townes, Campbell, & John Jones & Gossett have all come from Greenville.  John Jones tells me Mrs. Thompson is up yet.

	Write me often & tell me all the news of Greenville.  Col. Augustus Townes is wishing to address Miss Garlington it is said.  I am glad Hillhouse is going to be moved.  Yours truly &c, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
Greenville
