Letter 599
19 February 1861
Greenville

My dear Sir [Governor Pickens]

	I received your letter last evening & herewith enclose the paper you were so kind as to send me from St. Petersburgh.

	It would have given me great pleasure to have answered your letter but really I had nothing to write & did not know exactly how too forward my letters.  Had anything transpired in the Legislature relative to anointing the new State House with busts of Revolutionary characters I should have attended to your wishes & the interests & honor of the upper country.

	I wrote on the eve of your Inauguration suggesting the name of my son William H. Perry as one of your aids in the upper country but I see others were appointed and it is perhaps very well.  He is a volunteer in a troop of cavalry which may be called on for service.

	It is known to you that I have always been opposed to breaking yup our Federal Union.  But after the State had seceded I felt bound to sustain her action, & will do so.

	I am with great respect, yours truly &c., B.F. Perry
