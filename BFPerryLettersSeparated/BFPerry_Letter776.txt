Letter 776
13 December 1881
Columbia

Dear Father

	I have nothing special to write you more than what you see in the papers.  I think it probable that the Legislature will take a recess on Monday the 19th to enable those who wish to accept the invitation to visit Atlanta to do so.  I may go to Atlanta, but am not certain about it.

	I think Besss plan about the dam instead of the bridge on Mas road is exactly right, even if it should overflow the spring, which I hope it will not.  To raise carp properly there ought to be three ponds, and some time we might make another dam lower down.  So let Bess go ahead with the dam, but not cut down any more trees than absolutely necessary.

	I think Croft or Hawthorne must have that note on Tutwiler which the postal from Yadkins inquired about.

	I think the Senate will pass the Registration law but the passage in the House is doubtful.  The House has passed the general Stock law, and it will probably pass the Senate by a light squeeze.  Last Saturday night and Sunday was spent by Mr. Crayton and me in the country with a Mr. Sims who was in the army with me.

	The weather is cloudy, and there will be rain soon.  I am glad to hear from Mas letter that Adaline will remain next year.  She is the best cook we could get and quiet.  Yours &c., W. H. Perry

P.S. Tell Fred to feed the fish.  I ordered another trio of Plymouth Rock chickens which ought to arrive about this time.
