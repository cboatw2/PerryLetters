Letter 40
6 July 1846
Washington, D.C.

My dear Liz

	I arrived in this city yesterday morning & have not yet recovered from the excessive fatigue of the journey.  I will however endeavour a brief of my travels so far.

	The morning after I wrote you in Columbia I set out on the Rail Road for Charleston in company with Professor Henry of the South Carolina College.  I had quite a tete a tete with him as far as Branchville.  He then turned up for Aiken.  The downward car had Judge Dunkin on board but I did not find it out till we had landed in Charleston.  He enquired after you very particularly.  I saw no one in Charleston.  The boat closed at 4 oclock.  We had a crowd on board.  In the night a most terrible storm over took us & I assure you I never spent a more wretched night.  We were in great danger from the wind & lightening.  I slept none.  It was excessively hot & we had to close all the windows to keep the rain water out.  The heat broke out all over my body & in many places the skin is as red as blood.  Sunday morning we landed in Wilmington & took the cars for Weldon where we arrived at night 160 milestravelled all nightcame to Petersburgh about sunriseate breakfast at Richmond & arrived here at 5 oclock.  I took lodgings at the National Hotel, a very splendid building.  Almost the first man I saw was General Thompson.  He was glad to see me & hear from home. I next saw Frederick Rutledgethen a Mr. Michael from near Beaufort.  He was going round to Burts to take tea.  At the tea Burt & Yancey came to see me & we sat & talked to near ten oclock.  In the meantime I met my old acquaintance General Rush of Texas.  General Thompson called up Commodore Morris & introduced me to him & I informed him Mr. Poinsett had given me a letter to him.  He enquired very kindly about Mr. Poinsett & invited Gen. Thompson & myself to call & see him.

	In the morning I went down to the Capitol.  This is a magnificent building & greatly surpassed my expectations, for grandeur & beauty.  The grounds too are magnificent.  I was introduced into the House by Mr. Yancey.  [Richard F.] Simpson came over to see meso did Rhett & [Isaac] Holmes, [James] Black, [Joseph] Woodward & [Armistead] Burt.  I was greatly astonished at the appearance of the members.  They are indeed a most inferior set of looking menseem to have very little talent & one half of them look like they had no pretentions to be called gentlemen.  I was more shocked at their rudeness & vulgarity than I was at their bad looks.  They are a rowdy set & nothing could induce me to be a member of that House.  I went with General Thompson into the Senate.  He introduced me to [John J.] Crittenden of Kentucky, [Dixon] Lewis of Alabama, [Alexander] Barrow of Louisiana & [William S.] Archer of Virginia.  The latter invited me to take tea with him tomorrow evening.  I spoke to Mr. Calhoun but did not see McDuffie.  Col. Benton is decidedly the most striking & imposing man I have seen.    I am to go to his house to deliver my letter.    The Vice President is also strikingly aristocratic in appearance.    A good many of the Senators are inferior looking.

	I have engaged some clothes.  [page torn] they will not be ready for some days ad will detain me hereotherwise I should go north immediately.

	I hope to hear from you before I leave this city.  I shall endeavour to write a letter for the Mountaineer, but really the breaking out of the heat annoys me so at night, that I am almost crazy.  I commenced writing this letter last night but had to stop on that account.

	I feel as if I was a long way from home & am anxious to see you & the children.  It seems to me that I have been from home a month at least.

	You must excuse thisscroll.  I will write you again before I leave Washington.  Kiss the children & give my love to your mother & family.  Yours &c, B.F. Perry
