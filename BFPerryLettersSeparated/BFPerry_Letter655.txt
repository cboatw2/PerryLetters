Letter 655
19 March 1863
Greenville

My dear Liz

	Fannie has just written you a long letter & told you everything so I have nothing to write about.

	Willie was going up to see you Wednesday but Col. Butler wrote him to meet him in Columbia that day.  He returns tomorrow & will go up Saturday or Sunday.  When he returns I will go up.  Did not go to Pickens court.  There was no court & will be now at Greenville next week. on the circuit.  I have been working five or ten dollars every day since my return.  But we stand in need of a great deal of money to pay for corn at $2.90 & bacon at 75 cts.  I am afraid it will take Alfred a long time to haul the corn.  That is as bad as paying for it.

	I got 100 bushels corn fromthe other day costing me $2.20 a bushel.  I have fifty bushels engaged in Newberry.

	I hope the old field is finished ploughing.  Let them plough as much as they can.

	I cannot get nails.  The smokehouse will have to be built without nails.  But I will try to get them.

	Willie goes back Monday two weeks 6th day of April.  He brought 105 dismounted men with him to get horses.  It will take them 30 days to return on horseback.  Wiley came with him & will go back with him.  They will ride to one of the mens houses to let them go by the.  Wiley looks well & has behaved well.  Willie is in good health.

	The rumor is that Charleston was to be attacked this day but nohave yet come although it is ten oclock in the night.  No news yesterday of any great importance.  The yankees attacked Port Hudson on the Mississippi & were repulsed.

	Spartan Goodlett was here & returns tomorrow.  He has been restored to his command but has not had hisyet.

	We all want you & the children to come home very much.  You must come back with me.  Plant your garden at once.   will finish it.

	Goodnight.  Your loving husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
