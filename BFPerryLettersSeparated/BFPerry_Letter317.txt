Letter 317
18 December 1854
Columbia

My dear Liz

	It is now near midnight & I have just returned from the Legislature.

	I could have written to you after dinner but I met my old friend S.A. Marenick from Texas & had to spend the hour with him.  He looks as old as his father did when he died.  He came up to me in the room & I had no idea who he was.  He said he had been looking for me.  I have justfrom him.  He goes to Pendleton in the morning.

	I rece[ive]d your letter tonight.  Becky may go to Charleston with Baylis [Earle].  I shall stay at home three or four days.

	I am glad Brackenridge is dead.  I should have disliked to have seen him again.  I hope the other horses are well.  You must buy corn for them.

	Mr. [Perry Emory] Duncan has heard that his son is sick & will go home Wednesday or perhaps tomorrow.

	I must now conclude.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
