Letter 566
1 January 1860
Greenville

My dear Son

	I write you the first time I have ever dated a letter as above.  This is new years day & the earth here is covered with snow which fell all day yesterday. I am not sorry as the day is so disagreeable I should dislike to go out.

	Your letter enclosing ten dollars was rece[ive]d this last week.  You need not send back the money I sent you , but keep it for necessary expences.  I am sorry you did not get to go to Washington for Col. Ashmore would have been glad to see you, and you would have enjoyed yourself.

	I have nothing to write of any interest.  I see from the Secretary of the Navys report he speaks in high terms of the naval academy.  I hope you will by your good conduct & hard study be behind no one in adding to the reputation of your school.

	Pinckney Irvin came up with me from Columbia, but I have seen nothing of him since.  I suppose he is out at his uncles Col. Irvins.  He did not seem to know what he was going to do.

	Spartan Goodlett is to be married week after next to Miss Lyles of Fairfield.  Mr. Brown who went to school here is to be married to John Reeds daughter the same day.  This is all the news I have to tell you except it is said Mr. Kennedy the Methodist preacher is to be married to Miss D.

	We are all well.  Willie is reading law very constantly & seldom goes out of the office.  Fannie has holiday now & today is at your aunt Susans.  Hext has been a good deal of his time at General Thompsons.  He & Hayne & Arthur are playing about in the snow.

	I have nothing more but remain your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry
