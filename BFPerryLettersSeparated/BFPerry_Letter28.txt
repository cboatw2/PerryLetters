Letter 28
26 October 1845
Laurens C.H.

My Dear Willey

	I was very much pleased to receive your letter.  It shows that you think of and love your Papa although he is absent.  The next time you write you must ask Mama to print the words & let you fill them up.  This will make your letter more interesting.

	You must learn fast & keep ahead whilst I am from home.  Never let any of the little boys out spell you.  I wish to see you a great man some day.  So you must love your Book & school.  You must also try to be a good Boy and mind what Mama says.  Love Anna & Frank and be kind to the little boys at schoolnever quarrel or fight.

	If you do these things Papa & Mama will love you & everybody will be good to you & you will grow up to be a great good man.

	Your papa, B.F. Perry
