Letter 594
10 December 1860
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have only time to write you a few lines.  I have been very busy since I arrived here in reference to the Saluda Road & my cases in court.

	We had a great concourse of persons on the Rail Road todayMethodist preachers going to Conference.  Alston Haynes family were on the cars but I did not know it & did not speak to Mrs. Haynes.  Perroneau came & spoke to me.  Col. Orr went down with us.  Says Mrs. Orr is very low yet & his youngest child not likely to live.  All are for secession.

	I have just had a long talk with Mrs. LeConte & Miss Graham & Lula & the Doctor.

	I shall probably be at home Friday.  It is late at night.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
