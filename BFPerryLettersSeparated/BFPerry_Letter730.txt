Letter 730
9 August [1866]
Columbia

My dear Liz

	I have just returned from a visit to Mrs. LeConte & Mr. Barnwell & wil spend a few minutes before starting in writing you a letter.

	Governor Orr & General Harrison met me at Belton on their way to Philadelphia.  At Cokesbury we were joined by Judge Thompson & General McGowan forming a very pleasant party.  They were all provided with very amply lunch baskets filled with good things to eat & drink.  We had a very cordial & social picnic.  The weather was very hot & dry.  We reached Columbia about dusk & after supper I saw Chancellor Carroll, Col. Harris & others.  Col. Harris told me that my letter to Wallace had obtained  his office as Collector.  Wallace said my request had been with him.  The Col. seemed grateful to me.

	I went to bed at nine ocl;ock in my old room, the room I occupied whilst Governor opening into the Parlor & two beaux singing & playing on the Piano till I went to sleep under the sound of their melodies.

	I slept well & rose this morning very much refreshed.  After reading the papers & taking breakfast with Judge  & General McGowan I went to see Mrs. LeConte & thence to Mr. Barnwell.  They all seemed glad to see me.  Miss Graham gave me the address of Dr. Jackson in Philadelphia & requested me to call & see him.  She said he had talked a great deal about me & expressed a strong wish to see me.  They all enquired after you & Fannie very kindly.

	Mr. Barnwell gave me a great deal of political advice as to the Convention which corresponds with my own views.  He expressed great pleasure at my calling & begged that I would never come to Columbia without giving him the pleasure of seeing me.

	Governor Orr tells me that his convening the Legislature will depend on the President.  If the President will give him assurance that all the negroes will be turned over to the Courts for trial without interference on the part of the military, he will convene the Legislature, otherwise he will not.

	Mr. Barnwell is opposed to a special session of the Legislature & thinks the Legislature will do mischief instead of good.  He prefers that the Yankees should retain jurisdiction on the negroes.  He thinks very highly of Col. Green the yankee commander at this place.

	Dr. LeConte told me that he started up to call on me during the Conventionsaw me in the Chair organizing the Convention & did not have time to call again.

	Mrs. LeConte looks worse than I ever saw her.  She has lost all of her good looks & looks thin.  Miss Lula looks very well.  Miss Graham as usual.

       Tell Willie to take care of the office & its business.  Tell Hext & Hayne to study hard & be good boys.  You & Fannie need no advice & will do your whole duty.

       I hope to hear from you in Philadelphia & I will write again from Washington.  Your affectionate husband, B.F. Perry

Mrs. Elizabeth Perry
