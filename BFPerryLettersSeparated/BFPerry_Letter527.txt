Letter 527
24 April 1859
Greenville

My dear Son

	We rece[ive]d your letter last night & were glad to hear your good resolutions about getting no more demerits.  But what did the court of enquiry do with the boys who administered the tar & feathers.  They ought to be dismissed as well as the fellow tarred & feathered.

	  I am going to Columbia Tuesday & will carry with me Fannie & Annie.  They are delighted with the idea of going.

	We are all well, & all anxious for you to return home.  You will be treated with joy by everyone. And this should make you study hard & behave well.

	We had a frost this morning which I fear has done great injury to fruit, wheat &c.  The loss of peaches in the summer is a great depravation.

	Your affectionate Father.  I am starting to church Sunday morning.  B.F. Perry
