Letter 67
Saturday morning, [1846]
Columbia

My dear Liz

I have but a few moments to write you by Mr. Butler.  Last night it was twelve oclock when I got my supper on my return from the State House.  For the last three nights we have not [adjourned] until near eleven oclock.

	I recd your letter last evening& was glad to hear you were all well, & that your party was to take place after my return.  But in postponing it, you may disappoint Mr. McBees family from North Carolina which you ought not to do.

	Edward Rhett took dinner with me the other day & enquired kindly about you & your mother.  He told me some anecdotes about you & Mrs. Potter in New Haven.   He seemed astonished when I told him Susan had been married whilst I was in Columbia.  He said he thought she had returned not to marry.

	I will endeavour to bring the little presents you name but I shall not have time to get them.  Indeed I have no time to do anythingnot even to go & see Mrs. Taylor & Mrs. Martin.

	For several days past we have some hard discussion in the Senate in which I have taken a part.  The election of the circuits has taken place again.  Mr. Ward of George Town said to me he wished me to be a Judgesomeday & did notme to have to come to George Town so early as the court now sits.  I was elected a Trustee of the college yesterday.

	I was one of a special committee on the Beaufort College.  Mr. Robert Barnwell sent for me in court to talk about the college & the business before the committee.  I was much pleased with him.  He afterwards appeared before the committee & made a speech and an admirable one it was.

	The governor says he will not make up his decision in Wells case for four or five weeks.

	I shall be at home Wednesday night.  We are all well.  Kiss the children for me.  Your affectionate husband., B.F. Perry
