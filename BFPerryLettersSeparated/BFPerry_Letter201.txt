Letter 201
4 December 1852
Columbia

My dear Anna

	I received your letter this morning & it gave me great pleasure to hear that you had safely arrived in Charleston.  There have been so many Rail Road accidents lately that I was uneasy last night when I did not hear from you.

	I was glad to hear that all of you aunt Elizas family were well & that you had been out visiting your aunt Hayne & the Coles.  You must give my love to all of them.

	I rece[ive]d a letter from your mother last evening.  They were all well.  She professes great anxiety about you & your good behaviour.

	I will deliver your message to Miss Janney when I return to the Hotel.  I am now in the House of Representatives.  The cars did not reach Columbia till four oclock this morning.  This was the reason I did not receive your letter last evening. We have a house full of young ladies at Janneys.  They have come from all parts of the state to attend the commencement Ball.  Some ten or twelve are in a room next to me, & this morning they made so much noise & such bursts of laughter & screams that I could not sleep. I thought they must be crazy.  I am sure you would not behave so reckless.

	I have just written a letter to your mother, but since receiving yours, will write her again & enclose yours to me.

	In regard to your returning to Columbia exercise your own pleasure.  I shall be glad to see you here as soon as you get through with your visits.  It would perhaps be well enough to avail yourself of Mr. Trimmiers returning to Columbia.  I wish you were here now.  You would enjoy yourself more than you did last week.

	I am glad to hear you speak of practicing.  It is well enough to unite study & pleasure.

	If you wish any more money, write to me and I will send it to you.  Your mother wishes you to get a cloak, comb &c.

	I must now conclude, your affectionate Father, B.F. Perry

Miss Anna Perry
